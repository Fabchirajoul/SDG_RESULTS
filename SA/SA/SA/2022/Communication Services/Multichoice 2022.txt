Phuthuma Nathi Investments (RF) Limited Integrated annual report 2022 / 7:

Letter from the Phuthuma Nathi chair

Dear shareholder

On behalf of the Phuthuma Nathi board, it is my

pleasure to present our integrated annual report for

FY22 to you, the shareholders of the Phuthuma Nathi

share scheme. As you will know, Phuthuma Nathi

owns a 25% direct investment in MultiChoice SA,

which means that Phuthuma Nathi shareholders have

an indirect interest in MultiChoice SA through the

Phuthuma Nathi share scheme. Phuthuma Nathi is

proud to have 78 515 black shareholders as at

year-end (FY21: 80 229), comprising individuals,

stokvels and black-owned companies, all of whom

benefit from an efficient holding structure with a

robust underlying investment.

On page 14, we provide a summary to help you

understand how to think about your return on your

investment in Phuthuma Nathi. In short though, the

scheme has continued to deliver value to our

shareholders in the year gone by. We paid out

ZAR1.5bn in dividends to shareholders in FY22,

bringing the historic tally of dividends paid to

Phuthuma Nathi by MultiChoice SA since inception to

ZAR14.9bn. More on the current year’s dividends can

be found further below.

We would like to remind our shareholders that some of

their annual Phuthuma Nathi dividends, which have

been declared since the share scheme started in 2006,

remain unclaimed. A media campaign was launched in

FY21 to find these shareholders to pay them the money

that is rightfully theirs. To date, more than ZAR79m of

unclaimed dividends have been paid but there is still

ZAR183m remaining to be claimed. We sincerely hope

to pay at least the bulk of this outstanding balance to its

rightful owners in due course.

The year in review

MultiChoice SA serves customers and employs people

from all walks of South African life and are thus acutely

attuned to the many challenges that our country faces

on an ongoing basis and has faced in the past year.

COVID-19 and its associated lockdowns, and last

year’s riots in KwaZulu-Natal and parts of Gauteng,

negatively impacted an already weak economy.

As we started our new financial year 2023, the

KwaZulu-Natal region was impacted by severe flooding

which damaged critical infrastructure and hampered

“We feel fortunate that

MultiChoice SA’s

resilient performance

enables Phuthuma

Nathi to continue to

support its shareholders

and positively impact

their lives.”

Chair: Phuthuma Nathi

“A strong recovery in

advertising this year

meant that overall

revenues grew by 6%

YoY, while ongoing

cost controls partially

offset the normalisation

in content, sales and

marketing costs in the

current year and enabled

MultiChoice SA to

maintain its dividend.”
