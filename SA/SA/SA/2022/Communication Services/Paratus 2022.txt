Managing Director’s report “One can only connect the dots when looking back” as one

reflects on how PNH grew from its humble beginnings of being the first Capital Pool Company (“CPC”) to list on the NSX on 06 October 2017 to being admitted to

the NSX main board during June 2018, listed in the Technology Sector, to where we are now.

A milestone event in the history of PNH was the acquisition of Paratus thereby joining the paths of PNH and Paratus (and its subsidiaries) for the journey going

forward.

CORPORATE PROFILE

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN OUR HISTORY:

Managing Director (“MD”), Group Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Group Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”)

and Group Chief Operations Officer (“COO”) are ex officio members of the Board.

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the executive responsibility for the running of the

business and the leadership of the Board, such that no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-

making.

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee (“REMCO”) of the Board will assist with the identification

of suitable candidates for appointment to the Board and to board committees. Directors appointed by the

Board based on the recommendation of the REMCO will stand down at the first annual general meeting of

shareholders following such appointment and may offer themselves for re-election.

BOARD SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:

specific focus on the independence of independent non-executive directors who have served for more than

The Directors of PNH and Paratus are aligned to create mirror boards.

letter of appointment.

Inexperienced directors will be assisted, with the guidance of the

Chairperson, to participate in mentoring programmes where available.

The need for continuing professional development programmes will be

identified as part of the annual assessment of the performance of the

directors.

Directors will be provided with regular briefings on changes in risks,

laws and the environment but will also be expected to keep abreast of

developments in the business environment and markets that may have

a material impact on the business.

As part of the succession policy of the Board, suitably qualified

candidates can be appointed as members of board committees as to

ensure that such candidates obtain sufficient exposure and experience.

BOARD COMMITTEES

The Board has delegated certain of its functions to well-structured

committees but without abdicating its own responsibilities.

Each board committee as established by the Board will have a

committee charter to be approved by the Board and annually reviewed.

The Committees will be appropriately constituted with due regard to the

skills required by each committee.

The Committees will be chaired by an independent non-executive

director or by a suitably qualified non-executive committee member

and the majority of committee members must be independent non-

executive directors.

As a minimum, the Board has established an Audit, Risk and Compliance

Committee (“ARC”), Investment Committee (“IC”) a Remuneration and

Nomination Committee (“REMCO”) and an Environmental, Social and

Governance Committee (“ESG”).
