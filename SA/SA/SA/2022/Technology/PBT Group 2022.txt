LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

TONY TAYLOR

INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE

CHAIRMAN

ELIZNA READ

CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER

PBT Group is pleased to report on

another successful financial year.

A continuous demand for the

Group’s specialised services has

resulted in significant growth in all

aspects of the business.

During the period under review PBT Group

acquired an additional 2% of its subsidiary

CyberPro Consulting Proprietary Limited,

of which it is now a 58% shareholder.

The Group continues to expand due to

organic growth through the rest of its

subsidiaries.

During February 2022 PBT Group joined A2X

as a secondary listing to the JSE, providing

shareholder value through an additional

venue for trading purposes.

In terms of transformation, the Group

also reached its goal of becoming a

majority black-owned company during

the past financial year. PBT Group remains

committed to making a positive contribution

towards transformation and the creation of

sustainable B-BBEE in South Africa.

LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS [CONTINUED]

Share-based payment transactions

During the 2022 financial year PBT Group entered into three

B-BBEE transactions that are discussed separately below.

YONEX INVESTMENT PROPRIETARY LIMITED (YONEX)

PBT Group (South Africa) Proprietary Limited, a wholly owned

subsidiary of PBT Group, funded Yonex, a B-BBEE and staff-owned

company, by subscribing for preference shares to the value of

R65.7 million in Yonex. As the only surety for this investment

in preference shares is the underlying shares in PBT Group,

this investment has been treated as treasury shares for

accounting purposes instead of an investment. The preference

dividends received by PBT Group has also been eliminated

from the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other

comprehensive income.

PULSENT OH GP PROPRIETARY LIMITED (PULSENT OH)

On 23 July 2021 PBT Group entered into a binding subscription

agreement with Pulsent OH, in its capacity as the ultimate

general partner of the PBT Direct GP Partnership en commandite,

the latter in its capacity as the general partner of the PBT Direct

Partnership en commandite (“Pulsent OH” or “the Subscriber”),

in terms of which the Subscriber subscribed for 6 900 000

ordinary shares in the capital of PBT Group Limited (the Company)

(Subscription Shares).

The Subscription Shares were issued on 26 July 2021 in terms of

the Company’s general authority to issue shares for cash.

The Subscription Shares represented 6.7% of the issued share

capital of the Company prior to the issue thereof. The shares were

issued at R4.50, being a 4.7% premium to the 30-day volume

weighted average price of R4.30 at the close of business on Friday,

23 July 2021, the date on which the subscription agreement was

signed and became unconditional in accordance with its terms,

amounting in aggregate to R31.1 million (Subscription Amount).

Pulsent OH funded R12.4 million, being 40% of the Subscription

Amount, utilising its own resources, whereas the balance of the

Subscription Amount was funded by way of vendor finance.

The vendor finance was provided by PBT Technology Services

Proprietary Limited (PBT Technology Services), a wholly owned

subsidiary of PBT Group, which accordingly funded 60% of

the Subscription Amount by advancing a loan to Pulsent OH.

Pulsent OH’s obligation under such loan is secured by a pledge

and cession in securitatem debiti of 100% of the PBT Group

ordinary shares subscribed for by Pulsent OH in terms of this

transaction, as well as certain related claims.

As the only security for the repayment of the loan is the

6 900 000 PBT shares with no other recourse, the transaction is

treated as a share-based payment transaction under IFRS 2 and

the loan is treated as the issue of an option to the B-BBEE party.

The loan is not recognised as an asset, but instead treated as

treasury shares held by a subsidiary company. The WANOS are

decreased with the full weighted 6 900 000 PBT shares and the

R12.4 million funding received (being 40% of the newly issued

share capital) included in the share-based payment reserve.

As there is no vesting or lock-in period, the full share-based

payment expense is recognised immediately, for an amount of

R2.1 million.

PBT FOUNDATION PROPRIETARY LIMITED (PBT FOUNDATION)

On 23 July 2021 PBT Technology Services entered into an agreement

with the PBT Foundation for the purpose of providing funding to

subscribe for 480 shares in Spalding for a total cash consideration

of R2.8 million. Refer to note 14 Share capital for further details of

the transaction. The funding will be in the format of cumulative

redeemable preference shares issued to PBT Group. Due to

circumstances not within the Company’s control the incorporation

of the PBT Foundation was only finalised on 24 November 2021,

on which date the preference shares were issued. The funding was

treated as a loan until 23 November 2021.

As the only security for the repayment of the preference shares is

the investment in Spalding (with their only investment being the

underlying PBT shares) with no other recourse, the transaction

is treated as a share-based payment transaction under IFRS 2

and the preference share investment is treated as the issue of an

option to the B-BBEE party. The preference share investment is

not recognised as an asset, but instead treated as treasury shares

held by a subsidiary company. As there is no vesting or lock-in

period, the full share-based payment expense is recognised

immediately, for an amount of R0.4 million.

SUMMARY

The effect of IFRS 2 on the Group’s financial statements are

summarised as follows. For the 2022 financial year IFRS 2

decreased the Group’s bottom line by R5.7 million, of which

R2.6 million is a once-off expense. It resulted in a total number

of 22.2 million treasury shares being reported. Investments in

preference shares and loan are not treated as assets, which results

in the total assets disclosed in the 2022 consolidated statement

of financial position being understated by R87.2 million. IFRS 2

also had the effect of decreasing the WANOS by 20.3 million

shares which, as a result, increased EPS and HEPS for the period.

Purchase of further interest in CyberPro Consulting

Proprietary Limited (CyberPro)

PBT Group initially acquired 51% of CyberPro in 2012 and an

additional 5% in the 2021 financial year. The Board was again

presented with an opportunity to increase its shareholding in

CyberPro and performed a comprehensive analysis to determine

whether the acquisition would be aligned with the interest of

all stakeholders. Careful considerations were made and it was

determined that the additional investment would be earnings

accretive to PBT Group, that the price was reasonable and that

the investment would not introduce any business integration

risk to the Group. As a result, on 1 October 2021, PBT Group

increased its shareholding in CyberPro from 56% to 58% for a

total cash consideration of R5 million. The investment was funded

from PBT Group’s internal cash resources. The original founders

and key management of CyberPro would retain a significant 42%

shareholding and are therefore committed to seeing the business

continue to prosper.

LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS [CONTINUED]

Another exciting project has started in the United States via

Europe, where PBT Group Europe has established relationships

to the extent that we are now engaging directly with the client

in the United States. Taking a business, rather than technology,

angle has been very rewarding. Although competition is fierce,

it is our expectation that PBT Group will be a strong contender

in following phases of a project where we are already playing an

important role in enabling the business. This includes migration

from on premise to the cloud, mostly using the Microsoft Azure

technology stack, which is one of our strengths.

There are many opportunities in the pipeline for the new financial

year. With the PBT Group United Kingdom office having been

officially established and one of our leading technical specialists

relocating to the region in the imminent future to head up pre-

sales activities, we are positive that we will unlock the great

prospects that we have identified in the region. Through these

activities, PBT Group will gain direct access to the market, working

closely with our long-standing British partners.

Australia

One of the great advantages of the new way of working has been

the significant removal of geographic constraints from our ability

to engage, develop and retain new clients. This has been evident in

PBT Australia’s Health Data Practice, which has engaged clients in

Sydney and the United Kingdom, with our key staff being based

in and around Melbourne. As an organisation we have identified

the health tech sector as a key area of strength for our team and

an area of opportunity in the Australian market, with a particular

focus on health data and interoperability. These areas will

become even more crucial with an ageing population and more

people in remote and regional areas leveraging tele-health and

care at home as part of their engagement with health services,

and we are positioning PBT Australia to be the go-to consultancy

in these areas.

PBT Australia has increased its software offerings by bringing

the RulesLab expert system to the Australian market with the

goal of improving efficiency and reducing manual effort for our

clients. This has focused in two key areas, namely medical and

government administration, with great interest in both Australia

and southern Africa.

These developments and new business areas continue to

be underpinned by PBT Australia’s core professional service

offering in the medical and social insurance space, where our

long-term clients continue to enjoy the benefits and expertise

of PBT consultants and the wider Group’s collective knowledge

around health, health insurance and data.

In summary, PBT Group is well positioned to address the data

demand globally within all aspects of the data ecosystem to

service business, including technology, practices and capacity.

We are looking forward to the new financial year with great

expectation, anticipating that our initial investments will result in

further revenue growth, as PBT Group focuses on continuing to

offer a one-stop service in all aspects of the modern data platform.

GOVERNANCE

PBT Group remains committed to sound corporate

governance principles, including integrity, transparency

and accountability, and subscribes to the Code of

Corporate Practices and Conduct as set out in King IV.

DISTRIBUTIONS

The Company’s distribution policy is to consider an interim and

a final distribution in respect of each financial reporting period.

At its discretion, the Board of Directors may consider a special

dividend, where appropriate. Depending on the perceived need

to retain funds for expansion or operating purposes, the Board of

Directors may also elect not to pay distributions.

On Friday, 24 June 2022, the Board of Directors resolved to

declare a final distribution of 32 cents per PBT ordinary share

for the period ended 31 March 2022. The total distribution will

equate to R33.9 million. Each shareholder will be able to elect

to receive the distribution as either a dividend as defined by

the Income Tax Act, Act 58 of 1962 or as a capital reduction

distribution. If no election is made, the default option will be

that a dividend will be paid to such shareholders. An Election

Form (for use by certificated shareholders) included with the

Notice of Annual General Meeting of PBT Group, which together

with the Directors’ Report, containing details of the distribution,

was distributed to shareholders on Friday, 8 July 2022. The Form of

Election is also available for download on the Company’s website:

https://www.pbtgroup.co.za/investor-relations/#annual_financial_

statements.

The implications of the elections above are as follows:

• A gross dividend of 32 cents per PBT ordinary share from

income reserves will be subject to dividend withholding tax at

a rate of 20%. Consequently, a net final dividend of 25.6 cents

per share will be distributed to those shareholders who are

not exempt from paying dividend tax. In terms of dividend tax

legislation, the dividend tax amount due will be withheld and

paid over to the South African Revenue Service by a nominee

company, stockbroker or Central Securities Depository

Participant (CSDP) (collectively “regulated intermediary”)

on behalf of the shareholders. However, all shareholders

choosing this option should declare their status to their

regulated intermediary, as they may qualify for a reduced

dividend tax rate or exemption.

• A capital reduction distribution of 32 cents per PBT ordinary

share is not subject to dividend withholding tax as the

distribution is paid out of capital reserves. As the distribution

will be regarded as a return of capital and may therefore have

potential capital gains tax consequences, shareholders are

advised to consult their tax advisers regarding the impact of

the distribution.
