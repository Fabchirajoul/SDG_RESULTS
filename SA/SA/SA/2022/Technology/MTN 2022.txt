letter to you, I highlighted the risks associated with an inflationary

upcycle and the need for this to be carefully managed. I am pleased with the strong

execution of MTN’s Ambition 2025 strategy in this context, which leveraged the

resilience of the Group’s business model to deliver a robust set of 2022 results. This

was underpinned by the proactive initiatives to manage the inflationary environment,

with a focus on commercial, supply chain, network and financial resilience

interventions. These are detailed in the Q&A with the President and CEO (page 07).

In MTN Group’s home market of South Africa, macroeconomic pressures were

compounded by the deterioration of grid power availability: loadshedding increased

throughout 2022, particularly in the second half. MTN South Africa is addressing this

through a comprehensive network resilience plan, which we expect will improve

network availability into the second half of 2023 and support a recovery in service

revenue back towards our medium-term target range of 4 to 6% growth per annum.

Ambition 2025 delivery

Despite the tough trading context, we made further strides in building the MTN of the

future through the execution of Ambition 2025. The Q&A with the President and CEO

(page 07) describes the considerable progress made to deliver on our strategic

priorities in 2022, with more detail available in our strategic performance dashboard

section (page 60).

We continued to drive digital and financial inclusion, connecting 137 million and

69 million active data and fintech users respectively. In 2022, we grew service

revenue by 15.3%* and held the EBITDA margin steady at 44.0%* through execution

of the expense efficiency programme (EEP). Our financial resilience enabled us to

absorb the shocks in the operating environment and invest in the growth of our

business. In this regard, we made pleasing advances in further reducing our holding

company (Holdco) leverage to 0.8x (from 1.0x), on the back of solid cash flow

generation and delivery of our ARP. Please see the Q&A with the CFO on page 47,

which provides our financial performance in more detail.

References to our ESG work and our strategic priority to create shared value are

made throughout this Integrated Report. Please also read the Sustainability Report

and Transparency Report published simultaneously for a comprehensive view of our

enhanced disclosures, programmes and progress in sustainability.

How we create value

Financial and strategic review:

Dear stakeholders

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our

Remuneration Report for 2022.

“Our Ambition 2025 strategy led to a significant evolution in

the way we define ourselves as a company. Now more than

ever, true progress will be realised by closing the gap between

CAN and DO. The refreshed organisational approach to work

introduced in 2021 is our way of closing that gap. This is

reflected in the implementation of the ‘Anywhere, Anytime’

flexible work policy and various other elements which enable

employee choice and flexibility. It is realised through our ‘Live

Inspired’ employee value proposition. Remuneration is a key

enabler in achieving our strategy: we aim to provide rewards

that are relevant, and market related across our business

lines and employee levels.

By listening to stakeholders and taking into consideration

both employee and shareholder requirements, we consistently

review our reward practices to enable the achievement of

Ambition 2025. Our decisions and recommendations are

made consciously with executive and shareholder alignment

top of mind.

Company performance

2022 proved to be challenging on several fronts, with the after-effects of COVID-19, accelerating inflation and the impact of

the Russia-Ukraine war affecting the global economy in addition to tough localised in country conditions such as the power

crisis in South Africa. Despite these challenges, we built on the successes of 2021 and employees showed great resilience as

we worked to deliver on our strategic priorities to:

• Build the largest and most valuable platforms.

• Drive industry-leading connectivity operations.

• Create shared value.

• Accelerate portfolio transformation.

We are proud of our MTN’ers and how they have pulled together as an integrated team to deliver to MTN customers which

has resulted in solid results in such tough and challenging times. Our results reflected below provide context for the

Remuneration Report which follows.

ESG performance

We made strides towards achieving our long-term ESG

objectives summarised below:

• Significant progress towards achievement of 50% women

in the overall workforce, with women making up 40% of

our staff.

• Made progress to meet our target to reach Net Zero

carbon emissions by 2040. Our emissions reduced by

13.9% (excluding South Africa, which was impacted by

loadshedding) in 2022.

• Expanded broadband coverage to more areas, increasing

our overall (including rural areas) broadband coverage to

87.8% (2021: 83.0%), versus our target of 95% by 2025.

Our remuneration strategy and framework are key to driving

these results. This continues to be the case as evidenced by

our performance and relatively low rate of employee

turnover (2021: 6.5%, 2022: 6.4%). This reflects our compelling

employee value proposition in a talent market that continues

to be challenging for scarce and critical skills. We expect this

to continue to be the case and the committee is cognisant

that to drive performance we need to be able to attract and

retain the best talent in the market, MTN therefore must have

a compelling remuneration proposition. We are pleased that

our employee engagement rating increased significantly

from the 2021 baseline of 2021: 80% to 2022: 83%.
