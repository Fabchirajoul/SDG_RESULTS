FY2022 has been a very difficult year for Afrozaar with revenues

falling short of projections and cash constraints impacting on our

ability to implement critical projects. Having said that, we made

some good progress in terms of our product refinement strategy,

implementing our first video streaming offering, and are optimistic of

its success in the upcoming financial cycle.

Our key priority is investing into establishing a dedicated sales

strategy and team, which has been identified as the critical

impediment to our performance in 2022. We remain focused on our

three key territories, namely United Kingdom/Europe, Africa and

North America. Our UK office has done well this year in growing the

business in the region. Thus, establishing in-country representation

in the US is now our main focus. Again, cash flow constraints are

making this a challenging endeavour, hampering our growth in this

important market.

Our Publisherâ€™s Toolbox and PT Sportsuite products remain strong

amidst growing competition globally and MojoReporter is well

positioned to succeed in the B2C arena. With the correct funding

structure, the three products can achieve significant market share

and revenue growth in 2023. The commercial model remains sound

with respectable profit margins and dependable annuity income.

Bolstering the development and sales teams is, thus, the critical

success factor, which will inform our performance in the coming year
