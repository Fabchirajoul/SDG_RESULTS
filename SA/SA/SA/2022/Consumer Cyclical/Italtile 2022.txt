I am pleased to present Italtile’s Remuneration report

for the year ended 30 June 2022.

The Committee has oversight of the Group’s

remuneration practices and policies. The Committee is

focused on responsible remuneration practices across

the Company and strives for fair, responsible and

transparent remuneration through the review of

remuneration practices.

The Committee is committed to:

• the principle of ‘pay for performance’;

• ensuring that remuneration policies and practices

effect alignment between the interests of executive

management and shareholders;

• continuously monitoring pay levels to ensure fair pay

and that there is no discrimination based on race or

gender or any other factor; and

• narrowing the gap in compensation between

executives and employees at lower levels to prevent

unacceptable levels of inequality.

The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

engages extensively with a range of shareholders

regarding the remuneration policy. This resulted in a

ÀiwiiÌvÌ i«VÞÛiÀÌi°

The Company’s remuneration policy was approved by

96,98% of shareholders and the Implementation report

was approved by 90,01% of shareholders at the

Company’s 2021 AGM.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE AT A GLANCE

As tasked by the Board, the Committee assists in

setting the Company’s remuneration policy and reviews,

and recommends and approves the remuneration of

executive and non-executive directors, prescribed

vwViÀÃ >` ÃiÀ >>}iiÌ ­ViVÌÛiÞ ÀiviÀÀi`

to as ‘the executive team’).

A core responsibility of the Remuneration Committee is

to ensure that the remuneration philosophy and policy

support Italtile as follows:

• aligns the executive reward with the Group’s

commercial success and long-term sustainability; and

• supports the Group’s strategic objectives and allows

for the recruitment, motivation and retention of

senior executives, ultimately maximising shareholder

value while complying with relevant legislation and

the requirements of King IV.

As per its terms of reference, the Committee’s

responsibilities are to:

• assist the Board in developing and setting the

Group’s remuneration policy;

• determine and approve the total remuneration of the

executive team;

• review executive performance contracts;

• determine and approve the performance measures

for the executive team;

• review the compensation basis and proposed

average annual increases for the Group’s employees;

• review remuneration and Board best practice and

trends in order to assess the appropriateness of the

remuneration policy;

• review remuneration matters for executive team

promotions, transfers and termination of employment;

• oversee any proposed major changes to employee

LiiwÌÃÌÀÕVÌÕÀiÃÌ ÀÕ} ÕÌÌ iÀÕ«Æ

• review and recommend short and long-term incentive

policies and targets for directors and executive

management;

• set the participation principles for the various

remuneration schemes;

• review and recommend performance management

policies;

• ensure compliance with applicable laws and codes;

• advise on the fees for non-executive directors;

• review the Group’s succession plan for executives;

and

• review and evaluate the contribution of each

and determine their salary adjustments on an annual

basis, ensuring pay for performance.
