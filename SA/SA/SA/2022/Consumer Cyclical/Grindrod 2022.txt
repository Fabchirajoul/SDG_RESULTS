Business review

The Group continues to deliver on its customer focused

strategy supported by strong management and dedicated,

committed, and innovative people striving for operational

excellence. This is demonstrated in the Group’s solid

performance for 2022 with revenue growth for core

operations up 58% from the prior year and headline

earnings from core operations of R1.1 billion. The Group

returned R0.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and

reported share price growth in excess of 100% in 2022.

Zero fatalities were reported in 2022. The Group’s pleasing

performance reflects that current remuneration, philosophy

and policies continue to support the achievement of the

Grindrod’s strategic objectives attracting and retaining the

talent required to promote and maintain sustainable growth

of the Group.

Chief Executive Officer (CEO) transition

Andrew Waller retired as CEO and executive director

effective 31 December 2022. Consequently, his outstanding

long-term incentive awards were prorated as detailed on

page 73.

Xolani Mbambo was appointed as CEO with effect from

1 January 2023 and his total remuneration for 2023 was

benchmarked against appropriate market remuneration.

Advisory note

At the Annual General Meeting held on 3 June 2022,

Grindrod secured a vote in excess of 75% for both the

Remuneration Policy (2022: 85.14% approval; 2021: 77.82%

approval) and its implementation (2022: 80.30% approval;

2021: 69.92% approval). This demonstrates the alignment of

the changes implemented in the 2022 year with the feedback

provided from shareholder engagement.

Future focus

The remuneration philosophy and policies are intended to

support the achievement of strategic objectives that

promotes fair, responsible and transparent remuneration.

The committee is satisfied that its decisions taken in 2022

contributed to meeting the objectives of Grindrod’s

remuneration policies to fairly reward individual

performance measured against objective structures,

organisational sustainability, a high-performance culture

and the retention of scarce and specialised skills.

The committee is satisfied that Grindrod’s core skills

complement is intact and capable of successfully

implementing Grindrod’s strategy to the benefit of all

stakeholders.

REMUNERATION POLICY

Remuneration policies are designed to attract, motivate,

reward and retain human capital and promote the

achievement of strategic objectives within approved risk

appetite and tolerance levels, positive outcomes, ethical

culture and responsible corporate citizenship. These policies

are structured to achieve value-based management, which

promotes performance at organisational level and optimises

employed capital and shareholder returns.

Policy frameworks adhere to legislation and sound

governance criteria and are aligned with the business

strategy and objectives.

The Remuneration committee is mandated to assist the

Board to compensate employees fairly and responsibly for

specific roles. The evaluation of specific roles within a

formal job-grading system provides for an objective

measurement against benchmarks and an informed

consideration of the gap between all pay levels. The policies

provide a basis for the structured grading of jobs and

formulation of role descriptions, with regular evaluations

supporting fair reward for employees also based on their

skills and performance.

The Grindrod remuneration philosophy rewards individual

performance. To ensure fairness and accountability,

individual performance is measured against objective

structures. The process is aligned in support of

organisational sustainability, a high-performance culture

and the retention of scarce and specialised skills.

Individual performance is measured against individually

tailored, predetermined key performance indicators (KPIs),

including non-financial sustainability measures that

incrementally trigger rewards. To achieve performance

continuity and the desired retention levels, some policies

factor out conditions over which operations and individuals

have no control, such as adverse market conditions.

Human resource officers and management regularly engage

with recognised unions and bargaining councils to ensure all

objectives are addressed over time.

The remuneration of executive management is monitored in

terms of the overall remuneration across the Group.

Monitoring criteria include levels and trends in salary,

collective bargaining outcomes and bonus participation.

At the time that salary increases are considered, the

committee receives a report on the approach management

proposes to adopt for general staff increases.

Sign-on, retention and restraint payments are not part of

normal remuneration unless the Remuneration committee

determines otherwise in specific cases.
