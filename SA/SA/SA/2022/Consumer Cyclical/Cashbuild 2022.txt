GENERAL

INFORMATION:

Dear stakeholders,

Cashbuild subscribes to the highest ethical standards of

business practices and has a well-entrenched and defined

business philosophy around its customers, staff, business

partners, systems and finances. The philosophy is underpinned

by the Group’s vision, mission, and values, as well as The

Cashbuild Way.

Cashbuild’s approach to sustainability

Cashbuild reports its corporate sustainability in terms of the Six

Capitals as set out in the International <IR> Framework, as well

as the UN SDGs.

The underlying objective of reporting using the Six Capitals is to

ensure that Cashbuild focuses the appropriate degree of

attention on each of these areas, considering the impact of

each aspect on the Group’s performance, as well as the

influence that the Group has on its stakeholders in each area.

This in turn ensures that Cashbuild maximises its opportunities

for sustained financial and non-financial success in the short,

medium and long term.

On 14 June 2022, the JSE released its Sustainability and Climate

Disclosure Guidance that aims to promote transparency and

good governance, as well as guide listed companies on best

practice in ESG disclosure. This guideline is voluntary and

Cashbuild will incorporate, where applicable, the information

proposed to adhere to the Sustainability and Climate Disclosure

Guidance for the year ending June 2023. However, where

available information already exists, Cashbuild has disclosed

the necessary data in the current financial year.

In the complex southern African environment in which

Cashbuild operates, many valuable lessons have been learnt

over the Group’s history, spanning over more than 40 years.

The sustainability policies and practices which have been

adopted and implemented by the Group, of which our

Executive Managers, who have the greatest understanding of

the nuances of the communities in which their stores operate,

have proven to be one of the Group’s greatest advantages. This

has significantly assisted in risk mitigation during the

establishment of Cashbuild’s operations in new, unknown, and

often challenging environments.

The value drivers for enhanced sustainability performance and

disclosure are ultimately to assist with managing both the

financial and non-financial risks of the Group, improving

productivity as well as contributing to the Group’s sustainable

growth to ensure that solid stakeholder returns are achieved.

We strive to do it
