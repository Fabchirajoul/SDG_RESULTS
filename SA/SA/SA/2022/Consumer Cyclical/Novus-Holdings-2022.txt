Message from the Chairman

The preceding year tested the Group’s ability to remain resilient despite the challenges

it was faced with, and this was demonstrated by the turnaround in trading performance

in the current year. Novus Holdings remained committed to executing its strategy

and adjusted its operations to be more agile and fit for purpose, coupled with a more

streamlined structure from the Board through to operations.

A review of the Board Committees led to the consolidation of

the Remuneration and Nominations Committees to form the

Human Capital Committee effective 01 July 2021, chaired by

André van der Veen.

The Board is confident that its current composition is well

balanced, sufficiently independent and diverse to operate

effectively within its mandate and provide adequate strategic

direction and leadership to the Group.

The Board adopted a strategy of stabilising the current

business to enhance its sustainability for the long term

by restructuring its operations to suit reduced demand.

Returning capital to shareholders remained key as evidenced

by surplus asset disposals and two notable dividend

distributions in the year.

There was significant focus on the Department of Basic

Education ("DBE") tender in the year, which Novus Holdings

was successful in retaining together with its consortium

partners. We are proud of this achievement and more so of

our proven track record of delivering on a contract of this

magnitude.

Novus Holdings remains committed to transformation and as

a Level Two B-BBEE contributor, the Board and management

team will continue to explore opportunities to transform the

business and develop the local economy.

Thank you to the leadership team of Novus Holdings who

remained committed despite the circumstances, as well as

to all our stakeholders for their ongoing support throughout

the year.

A heartfelt thank you to our employees for braving the

odds which included some of our KwaZulu-Natal employees

being displaced by the floods in the latter part of the year,

but still remaining loyal and dedicated to the Group meeting

its objectives.

DR PHUMLA MNGANGA

Chairman

Annual board effectiveness

evaluation

The Board Charter makes provision for the

evaluation to assess the effectiveness and

performance of the Board and its Committees

on an annual basis. An independent evaluation

process was undertaken, assessing the

2022 performance of the Board, its various

Committees as well as the Chairman

of the Board, CEO, CFO and company

secretarial function. The Board is satisfied

that the evaluation process is improving its

performance and effectiveness.

Combined assurance model

Novus Holdings, in its implementation of

combined assurance, has identified the

components of combined assurance as per

King IV™. These components of combined

assurance are used to integrate, coordinate

and align risk management and assurance

processes. Assurance processes in Novus

Holdings include internal and external audits.

Information technology governance

The IT Steering Committee provides oversight of the IT

function and reports regularly to the Risk Management

Committee. The executive team is responsible for the

implementation of the ICT strategy against operational plans

and the technology and information framework. During

the year under review, key emphasis was placed on the

development of a technology and information framework,

identifying and monitoring technology and information risks,

user awareness campaigns and security assessments.

Further to the above, an external audit on key technology

and information systems, general computer controls and

application level controls was performed by PwC.

Compliance with laws and regulations

The Board ensures Novus Holdings complies with relevant

laws and regulations, audit and accounting principles and

practices, non-binding rules, codes and standards, and Novus

Holdings’ own governance documents. The responsibility has

been delegated to the Risk Management Committee.

The Board is assisted in achieving compliance with all

applicable laws and regulations by the Audit and Risk

Committee, Social and Ethics Committee, the executive

team and the company secretary. Regular legislative updates

are provided to the Board to assist the Board in ensuring

compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
