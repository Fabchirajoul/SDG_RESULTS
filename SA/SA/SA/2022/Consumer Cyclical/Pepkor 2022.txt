HIGHLIGHTS:

managing director of Pepkor

from 2001 until 2017. During this period, Pepkor

delivered significant organic growth and expanded

locally and internationally through acquisitions.

The first international acquisition was Best&Less

in 1998, followed by the great success story of

Pepco in Poland, which grew from 14 stores in

2003 to more than 3 500 stores today. Pepkor

UK was formed in 2014 and a very successful

international sourcing office was established in

China during this time.

Since its inception, Pepkor’s focus has always

been to meet customers’ needs as close as

possible to their homes and at the lowest cost.

This philosophy led us to expand our clothing offer

to cellular and financial services, becoming one

of the first retailers to enter this arena at the time.

This offer was strengthened with the launch of

loans through our Capfin business, as well as the

acquisition of the Flash business in 2012.

Pepkor has some great South African brands in

its stable with histories dating back more than

100 years. Sean Cardinaal, our newly appointed

chief operating officer, also has a long history with

the group. He joined PepClo (our manufacturing

operation) in 2003, became buying director of PEP,

and was the driving force behind the Ackermans

success, serving as: managing director from 2011

until 2016. After this he joined Pepkor UK and later

Pepco Group. His role will further strengthen our

ability to focus and grow our business.

Over the past five years, the Pepkor leadership

team had to deal with extraordinary events.

Leon Lourens led the team as CEO in an exemplary

way and deserves the utmost appreciation of all

the stakeholders of Pepkor. The strong cultures

and commitment of teams within the Pepkor

businesses enabled the group to deal with COVID-19

in 2020, the social unrest in July 2021 and, most

recently, the extensive flooding in the KwaZulu-Natal

province. This enabled the group to become the

leader in the discount and value market of South

Africa, with substantial market share. Our positioning

in this market underpins our ability to produce good

results consistently through different economic

cycles.

During FY22, the group executed on its eight growth

drivers and delivered a good performance.

Business review

PEP

PEP’s performance was most impacted by

disruption in social grant payments and the

flooding of its KwaZulu-Natal distribution

centre. This impacted

in-store product availability and sales.

Best price leadership was maintained, with

96% of products sold equally priced or cheaper

than the competition. The PEP HOME stand-

alone format achieved solid sales growth of

25.9% with substantial market share gains of

415 basis points over three years (RLC). The

PEP HOME retail footprint was expanded to

355 stores through 61 new store openings.

PEP sold 8.1 million cellular handsets with

more than 50% representing smartphones.

Cellular performance was impacted by

increased competition.

The PAXI parcel distribution initiative,

which leverages the retail footprint of PEP

and other Pepkor brands in over 2 800

locations, increased volumes by 20%. PAXI

distributed 4.2 million parcels during the

year and supports 24 000 small and medium

enterprises.

PEP opened 134 new stores during

the year, expanding its retail store base

to 2 579 stores.

Ackermans

Performance in Ackermans was impacted

by constrained consumers, electricity load

shedding, which worsened in the last quarter,

as well as incorrect merchandise mix

decisions in some departments.

The credit sales mix decreased marginally

to 17% from 18% in the prior year

notwithstanding a record number of new

accounts opened.
