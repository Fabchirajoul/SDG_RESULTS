Electronic participation

The Company’s Memorandum of Incorporation authorises

communication as does section 63(2)(a) of the Companies Act.

Shareholders or their duly appointed proxies who wish to

participate in the Annual General Meeting are required to

complete the Electronic Participation Application Form

available immediately after the proxy form on page 95

and email same to the Company’s Transfer Secretaries at

proxy@computershare.co.za and to the company secretary at

legal@rextrueform.com, or by fax to be faxed to +27 21 460 9575,

as soon as possible, but in any event by no later than 10:00 on

Thursday, 24 November 2022 for the attention of the company

secretary, relevant contact details including e-mail address,

cellular number and landline, as well as full details of the

shareholder’s title to the shares issued by the company and

proof of identity, in the form of copies of identity documents

and share certificates (in the case of certificated shareholders),

and (in the case of dematerialised shareholders) written

confirmation from the shareholder’s CSDP confirming the

shareholder’s title to the dematerialised shares.

Shareholders or their duly appointed proxies are required to

provide satisfactory identification before being entitled to

participate in the Annual General Meeting.

Upon

receiving

a

completed

Electronic

Participation

Application Form, the Company’s Transfer Secretaries will follow

a verification process to verify each applicant’s entitlement to

participate in and/or vote at the Annual General Meeting. The

Company’s Transfer Secretaries will provide the Company with

the nominated email address of each verified shareholder or

their duly appointed proxy to enable the Company to forward

them a Microsoft Teams meeting invitation required to access

the Annual General Meeting.

Fully verified shareholders or their duly appointed proxies

who have applied to participate electronically in the Annual

General Meeting are requested by no later than 09h55 on

Monday, 28 November 2022 to join the lobby of the meeting

by clicking on the “Join Microsoft Teams Meeting” link to be

provided by the company secretary or by the secretarial office,

whose admission to the meeting will be controlled by the

company secretary/secretarial office.

Participants will be liable for their own network charges in

relation to electronic participation in and/or voting at the

Annual General Meeting. Any such charges will not be for

the account of the Company’s Transfer Secretaries or the

Company who will also not be held accountable in the case

of loss of network connectivity or other network failure due to

insufficient airtime, internet connectivity, internet bandwidth

and/or power outages which prevents any such shareholder or

their proxy from participating in and/or voting at the Annual

General Meeting.

Shareholders who wish to participate in the annual general

meeting by way of electronic participation must note that

they will not be able to vote during the annual general

meeting. Such shareholders, should they wish to have their

vote counted at the annual general meeting, must, to the

extent applicable, (i) complete the form of proxy; or (ii) contact

their CSDP or broker, in both instances, as set out above.
