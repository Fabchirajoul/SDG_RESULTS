LETTER

4

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

It is my pleasure to present Celsius Resources Limited’s (“CLA”) Annual Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2022, in which

the Company has substantially advanced its copper-gold assets in the Philippines and partially implemented a plan to generate

value for our shareholders in relation to its Opuwo Copper Cobalt Project in Namibia.

Philippines

MCB Copper Gold Project: after completing a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate of 313.8 million tonnes @ 0.48% copper

and 0.15g/t gold, for 1.5 million tonnes of contained copper and 1.47 million ounces of contained gold, our Philippine team

headed by Peter Hume has continued to deliver project milestone achievements at an incredible pace including:

a) Outstanding drill results with intersections such as MCB 38 showing 611m at 1.39% Cu and 0.75 g/p/t Au. I am looking forward

to an updated JORC Mineral Resource Statement later this year, which will feed these results into a revised mine plan and ore

reserve as a basis for the Feasibility Study improving the overall cash flow early in the mine life;

b) A signed off Scoping study to mine its High Grade Core with ~50Mt material at 1.1% CuEq over 25 years; and

c) A community development program which follows a participatory process that institutes mechanisms for inculcating a sense

of ownership for more effective and sustainable outcomes with our host Balatoc community.

The Company’s Negros Island Sagay project has also progressed. The project appears to contain very large-scale porphyry copper

mineralisation that remains open at depth. Drilling during the year ended 30 June 2022, drilling confirms the promising continuity

of that mineralisation at shallower levels.

Namibia Opuwo Project

During the year, the Company successfully completed an upgraded JORC Compliant Resource, which demonstrates an estimated

resource comprising 225.5 Mt at 0.12% Co, 0.43% Cu and 0.54% Zn. This is a globally significant resource containing 259,000

tonnes of contained Co, and 970,000 tonnes of contained Cu. The Company also completed nine diamond drill holes for future

metallurgical optimisation work, which includes ongoing roasting and tank leach test work as well as separate test work for

hydrometallurgical downstream processing.

Much of this work carried out in both the Philippines and Namibia was under difficult circumstances with Covid-19 uncertainty,

climate change-linked events as well as national elections in the Philippines.

On that note, the Company welcomes the new government of President Marcos in the Philippines and positive statements as to

the importance on responsible mining in the post-Covid economic revival.

The Company has ambitious goals in environmental stewardship and our MCB Project is designed to achieve ESG excellence. We

also work to improve the lives of our host communities by working hand in hand with them in a variety of community

enhancement projects, in addition seeking to act as a catalyst for sustainability.

During the period to date, we have significantly refreshed the composition of the board of CLA directors to ensure we have the

appropriate mix of skills, experience and diversity. In this regard, I welcome Peter Hume to the board as Executive Director and

Michael Hulmes, Julito Sarmiento, Simon Farrell and Jonathan Colvile as valuable Non-Executive Directors.

Having spent a considerable portion of my career developing copper-gold assets in the Philippines, which included the

development from feasibility to production of one of the country’s most successful copper mines, I can attest to the quality of

CLA’s assets.

I would like to thank all our loyal shareholders who have joined us on this exciting journey to date, and look forward to providing

more positive news on our prospective projects.

Yours faithfully,

Martin Buckingham
