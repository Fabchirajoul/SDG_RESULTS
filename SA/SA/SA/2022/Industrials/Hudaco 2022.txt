Technical expertise: Critical relationships in the field are with the

technical and maintenance teams of our customers. They place

the orders upon which we depend for our turnover. We need a

constant supply of new sales staff with the right technical skills to

be able to adapt to and service our customers’ changing needs.

Although we are essentially a group of distribution businesses, we

run in-house learnerships where we can and technical traineeships

where we cannot.

Customer interaction occurs primarily through our technical sales team.

As they are the face of the business and the drivers of organic growth

in revenue, we invest heavily in their training. New appointees are sent

for training prior to being placed in the field. The board also supports

training and skills development initiatives through bursary programmes,

management training schemes (as described above), experiential trainee

programmes, mentorships, apprenticeships, educational assistance and

learnerships. Extensive in-house and external training is given in a wide

range of practical and theoretical subjects to better equip employees

with the skills required for senior positions. The learnership programme

content typically includes financial administration, human resources

administration, inventory management, end-user computing and

warehousing courses, as well as technical product training.

Five of our businesses (Deutz Dieselpower, Gear Pump Manufacturing,

Hudaco Power Transmissions, Hydraulic Engineering Repair Services

and Joseph Grieveson) run SETA-accredited apprenticeship programmes

with 22 participants in 2022 being trained in various trades. An

additional 242 abled learners and 27 learners with disabilities were

recruited for learnership programmes run by the Maharishi Institute and
