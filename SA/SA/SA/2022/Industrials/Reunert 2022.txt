Appreciation

On behalf of the Board, I thank Reunert’s employees for their

hard work and commitment to Reunert in a year in which

several macro-economic factors continued to complicate

operational activities.

To my fellow Board members, thank you for your insights and

contributions during the year. On behalf of the Board, thank you to

Alex Darko who will retire from the Board after the 2023 AGM. It has

been a pleasure working with you all. I also thank the executive

team for their dedication and assistance to the Board.

Thanks to our suppliers and other business partners for contributing

to Reunert’s continued success and to our shareholders for your

ongoing support.

Thank you to our customers for their ongoing support and

collaboration. We will endeavour to again exceed your

expectations in 2023.
