PERFORMANCE

GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION

SHAREHOLDERS’ INFORMATION:

LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN: Dear stakeholders

I write to you this year in a post COVID-19 environment where life

is returning to “normal”. However, we are now entering a world

of high inflation, constrained labour markets in the geographies

in which we operate and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These

have a multifaceted effect on logistics, energy and other aspects

of our operations and the lives of our stakeholders.

From a remuneration perspective, this challenging environment

has made it necessary for Aveng to continually re-evaluate and

adapt its remuneration policy, strategy and employee value

proposition.

Against this background, I report on the progress we have made

in remuneration matters during the 2022 financial year (2022)

and the measures we have put in place for the 2023 financial

year (2023).

During the last two years, the remuneration committee (remcom)

focused on ensuring that meaningful short-term and long-term

incentive structures were developed and implemented. During

2022, the committee validated that the incentive structures were

yielding the desired outcomes. Remcom dealt with remuneration

matters at an executive level and oversaw decisions regarding

the remuneration of employees during four scheduled meetings

and other ad hoc meetings as required.

Performance

During 2022, the Group reported a sound set of results including

the following key features, some of which were linked to incentive

payments more fully set out in Part 3:

• Operating earnings of R576 million

• Strong cash flow generation of R612 million

• Interest-bearing debt reduced by R398 million to R481 million

• Good progress on our ESG strategy

In addition, the 2nd tranche of the management incentive plan

(MIP) and 1st tranche of the long-term incentive plan (LTIP)

vested with 92% vesting against a pre-agreed set of

performance conditions more fully set out in Part 3.

The MIP 2021 will be completed in September 2023. Thereafter

the current management who participate in the MIP 2021 will

have no further lock-in. Therefore, it is proposed that the MIP

2021 participants be entitled to participate in the LTIP 2022

grants in order to have continuous lock-in of executives. In

addition, LTIP 2022 requires certain amendments to

accommodate the tax consequences of participants in the

scheme in Australia. The proposed amendments to MIP 2021

and LTIP 2022 are set out in Part 2 as well as in the AGM notice

for shareholder approval.

I would like to thank the executive team for the incredible effort,

energy and hard work they have put into executing the strategy,

disposing of all non-core assets and continuing to deliver

improved financial performance in the core businesses over the

last 12 months. Finally, a big thanks to my remcom members for

their support and effort in implementing our decisions.

The report is split into the following three sections:

Part 1: Overview: Covering the work performed by the remcom

during the year and our future areas of focus for 2023

Part 2: Remuneration Policy

Part 3: Implementation of remuneration policies

The Board will put both the Remuneration Policy and the

implementation report forward for non-binding advisory

shareholder resolutions at the upcoming AGM.

I look forward to your support on the above-mentioned

resolutions.

be held in escrow from settlement date to vesting

date.
