letter of credit facility.

Key covenants on the debt package are a current ratio in excess of

1.25 times and a debt-to-equity ratio less than 0.6 times. All covenants

were met in the 2022 financial year.

Gearing (net debt to equity) increased to 28% by the end of the year from

a prior year gearing of 24%, with equity significantly improved by the

current year profit and an increase in net debt due to the volatile $LME

pricing during the year.

Hulamin Integrated Report for the year ended 31 December 2022

28:

Dear Shareholders

It is with pleasure that I present to you the remuneration report for the 2022 financial year on behalf of the

Remuneration and Nomination Committee (Remco). The purpose of this report is to provide stakeholders with

a detailed summary of the organisation-wide philosophy and policy pertaining to remuneration at Hulamin.

In accordance with Hulamin’s commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen, this report has been aligned

with best practice reporting standards incorporating the King IV Report on Corporate Governance (King IV™)

and the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited.

Remco responsibilities and focus areas

The Remco is a sub-committee of the board of the Company (the “Board”) with delegated authority. Hulamin’s

remuneration policy is reviewed annually by the Remco and submitted for approval by the Board. The Remco

responsibilities and actions are set out and governed in its terms of reference, read together with Hulamin’s

remuneration policy and other applicable documents.

The Remco meets at least three times per annum.

In 2022, scheduled Remco meetings were held on 25 February, 19 May and 30 November, with three additional

special meetings on 19 July, 18 August and 9 December. The special meetings were all called for the approval of

the wage negotiations mandate, and changes to the STI bonus.

Key managers and executives are invited to attend Remco meetings, on an “as and when appropriate” basis.

Management who are invited to attend Remco meetings do not participate in meeting votes as invitees and are

recused when their remuneration is discussed.

In addition to its normal responsibilities, the Remco paid attention to reviewing

the mandate for wage negotiations and the restructuring and refinement of the

short-term-incentive (STI) system.

Following the successful transition to a quarterly STI bonus in 2022, the Remco

approved several changes to the STI to help capture employees’ discretionary effort. These

changes include a “shopfloor” STI for the bargaining unit, and additional performance measures

for management and staff (group, departmental and individual, in addition to divisional).

Routine

activities

• Long-term incentive scheme awards were approved for senior management

• Remco terms of reference were reviewed and recommended to the Board

• The Remuneration Policy and Remuneration Report were reviewed and

recommended to the Board

• Review of Remuneration Risk and reporting back to the Risk Committee on

matters identified

• Quarterly STI targets and STI awards were approved quarterly as applicable

Non-

routine

activities

• Continued focus on containing and reducing manpower costs

• Introduction of an STI for all shopfloor (bargaining unit) employees

• Reconfiguration of the STI to drive more profitable management decisions

Where appropriate, the Remco has obtained the advice and opinions of external advisors on various

remuneration-related matters. The Remco is satisfied that the advice received was constructive,

objective and independent.
