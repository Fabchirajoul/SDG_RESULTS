letter from SARS, indicating a possible

upward adjustment to taxable income following the conclusion of a transfer pricing audit relating to the

company’s 2014 to 2016 years of assessment. Per the finalisation of the audit: letter, additional assessments

resulted in a cumulative additional tax liability of approximately R415 million, and understatement

penalties of R165 million were levied. The additional assessments attract interest at a rate prescribed

by SARS (calculated monthly), amounting to approximately R365 million (2021: R328 million) at

31 March 2022.

In July 2021, the Group submitted a request for the deferment of payment to SARS in respect of its 2014

to 2016 years of assessment. The request was partially granted in November 2021, with SARS requesting

payment of R207 million by 2 December 2021 and all possible future payments being deferred until the

matter is resolved. The payment made to SARS continues to earn interest. Such interest has been

recognised separately from the Group’s estimated uncertain tax liabilities.

An objection to the 2014 to 2016 assessments raised by SARS was submitted on 15 November 2021

following extensive engagement with transfer pricing specialists. The Group received a request for

substantiating documentation from SARS on 26 January 2022, which was submitted to SARS on

7 April 2022. On 29 April 2022, SARS requested an extension to respond to the objection until

30 September 2022.

The Group continues to favour an amicable conclusion to this matter, although it may be necessary to

resolve it through the Alternative Dispute Resolution process. This is considered the most probable

outcome of the matter and thus forms the basis of the provision raised in this regard in terms of IFRIC 23.

Dear stakeholders

It is always heart-warming to start with good news.

Despite the ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, Omnia won

the 2022 award for the Best Sustainable Diversified

Chemicals Group in Africa from CFI.co. We believe this is

due to our conscious and progressive investment in

technology, time and resources to ensure due respect and

care for our natural environment.

We continue to focus on the execution of the Group’s

sustainability strategy which looks to evolve beyond the

traditional elements of safety and health, environment,

and risk to a more encompassing sustainability approach

that is embedded into every aspect of the business.

The Group’s goal is to align all businesses in all

geographies to the highest sustainability standards. The

focus and interventions will differ per business but will

align to create a more sustainable and resilient Group.

Letter and background statement from the RNC chair: Dear stakeholders

Context to the 2022 remuneration review

Three years ago, we developed a phased strategy to stabilise, fix and grow our business. Since then the world has experienced

substantial macro-economic changes recorded in recent history. The disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic,

supply chain challenges, volatility in input costs and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have all impacted the business environment.

Against this backdrop, Omnia has undergone a period of transition and has successfully executed on its intent to stabilise and

fix the business. We have delivered on our priorities with a focus on our core assets, operational excellence, supply chain

optimisation, our values and our people. Shareholders will receive a pleasing outcome of an ordinary dividend of 275 cents

and a special dividend of 525 cents per share.
