letter of, and the spirit

behind, important accountability frameworks. These include

the IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of

Sustainability-related Financial Information and the Exposure

Draft IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures (Climate Exposure

Draft), which builds upon the recommendations of the Task

Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and

incorporates industry-based disclosure requirements derived

from SASB Standards. Both of these are under the auspices of

the International Sustainability Standards Board.

“The Group continues to deepen its resilience and differentiation as a

contractor, employer and partner as market dynamics and stakeholder

expectations change, with increasing emphasis on ESG credentials and

digital solutions to ensure sustainable competitiveness.”

formally declare that there was no unethical behaviour involved

in the compilation of the tender.

All our businesses have an anonymous whistle-blower facility

that can be used to report incidents of fraud, corruption, or

other unethical behaviour. The administrators refer complaints

to management, which are thoroughly investigated, with

appropriate action taken when required.

Stakeholder engagement

Values-led and ethical conduct underpin our intention to be

recognised as a trusted partner to our stakeholders, wherever

we work in the world.

Annual Integrated Report 2022

letter wherein

all responses provided by management on concerns raised were

found to be satisfactory with recommendations made for future

disclosures.

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those that, PwC, in their professional

judgement, were of most significance in their audit of the

consolidated financial statements of the current period:

■ Estimation uncertainty involved in accounting for revenue from

contracts with customers

■ Recognition and recoverability of uncertified revenue balances

■ Liquidity and working capital management

Significant areas of judgement

The Committee assists the Board by performing an oversight

role over financial reporting, which includes assessing the

appropriateness of significant estimates and judgements

specifically covered by the key audit matters and those disclosed

in note 41 and note 43 of the online annual financial statements.

Consolidated and separate financial

statements

In our opinion, the consolidated and separate financial

statements present fairly, in all material respects the consolidated

and separate financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries

as at 30 June 2022 and its consolidated and separate

financial performance and its consolidated and separate cash

flows for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS and the

requirements of the Companies Act. In preparation of the annual

financial statements the Group and the Committee has taken

into consideration the feedback included in the most recent

Report Back on Proactive Monitoring of Financial Statements

provided by the JSE. The Committee recommended the Group’s

and Company’s annual financial statements to the Board for

approval. It is satisfied that they comply with IFRS and that the

financial statements have been prepared on a going concern

basis following an assessment of solvency and liquidity

requirements.
