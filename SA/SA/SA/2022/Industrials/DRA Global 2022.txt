the project was to complete a basic engineering

program, plan for restart implementation execution

of a 55,000 tonnes per day copper/molybdenum

concentrator, engage contractors early for

construction optimisation and produce a final

budget for construction decision.

DRA Projects in AMER is presently in discussions

with Elko Mining Group to initiate EPCM services in

April 2023.

MCILVENNA BAY COPPER PROJECT

In FY2022, DRA Projects in AMER was engaged

by Foran Mining Corporation to execute detail

engineering and procurement services for the

McIlvenna Bay Project; Canada’s first carbon-neutral

copper development project.

This project is supported by large mine financiers,

including Sprott Mine Financing and the Ontario

Teacher’s Pension Fund.

YANGIBANA RARE EARTHS PROJECT

DRA Projects in APAC has been engaged by Hastings

Technology Metals since FY2018 on the Yangibana

Project, a significant rare earths project containing

substantial neodymium and praseodymium

resources in Western Australia.

Following the completion of the advanced front-end

engineering design (FEED), DRA continues to support

Hastings with the project through the Yangibana

mine and hydrometallurgy plant in Onslow. EPCM

services commenced in January 2022 and include

project management, project controls, engineering

and design, and procurement.

LETTER FROM THE CHAIR OF THE PEOPLE, CULTURE AND REMUNERATION

COMMITTEE: Dear shareholders

I am pleased to present DRA Global’s Remuneration Report (Report) for the financial year ending 31 December

2022.

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

In FY2022, we focused on strengthening the business and delivering outcomes in line with our global strategic

direction, DRA’s Roadmap to 2025.

On a global scale, competition for skilled talent in an active market and wage inflation were some of the biggest

challenges facing our industry throughout the year. To address these trends, we continued to prioritise the health

and wellbeing of our people, while also focusing on professional development opportunities.

Each year, the Board sets the balanced scorecard KPIs and targets, taking into consideration the budget,

company strategy and expectations, appropriate benchmarks and economic conditions. Overall business

performance is then measured against the balanced scorecard. The overall balanced scorecard result was 74

percent which was primarily driven by our challenging EBIT performance for the year. Pleasingly the second-half

financial returns exceeded the target set in the scorecard, and stronger results were achieved across the safety,

operational excellence, talent and client focus areas.

A more detailed disclosure of the FY2022 Group outcomes against set strategic areas is included in this Report.

KMP REMUNERATION CHANGES/OUTCOMES

During the year, there were changes to the Key Management Personnel (KMP) with the appointments of

James Smith and Michael Sucher to the roles of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)

respectively, following the resignations of former CEO Andrew Naudé and former CFO Adam Buckler.

The FY2021 Remuneration Report was not adopted at our last Annual General Meeting (AGM), with 59.02 percent

of the votes cast being against. During the year, we took deliberate actions in response to shareholder concerns

about KMP remuneration that were raised at the 2022 AGM.

The following outlines a series of remuneration changes and outcomes applied during the year.

• Improved the robustness of remuneration benchmarking methodology, including a review and enhancement

of the peer companies used for KMP remuneration benchmarking so DRA’s KMP remuneration practice is

compared against companies that are closely aligned with our operations and size to ensure a fair outcome.

• Reviewed and moderated executive total fixed remuneration (TFR) levels, including the appointment of James

Smith and Michael Sucher to the role of CEO and CFO, respectively, at a significantly lower TFR level than

their predecessors (i.e. 40 percent lower than the former CEO and 22 percent lower than the former CFO). No

change in TFR was made for Alistair Hodgkinson, Chief Operating Officer (COO), during the year.

• No short term incentive (STI) payment was made to Executive KMP for FY2022 in recognition of the Group’s

financial performance. Recognising that it was a challenging year where key financial performance hurdles

at a Group level were not met, the Board determined that no STI award payment would be awarded to KMP

Andrew Naudé ceased to exercise executive authority from 19 March 2022 when he was placed on ‘gardening leave’ pursuant to

clause 23.6 of his employment contract.

2. RESPONSE TO “NO VOTE”

The Act requires that publicly listed companies include a Remuneration Report in each annual Directors’ Report,

which details the Company’s remuneration practices and arrangements, and the compensation paid to KMP

during the relevant reporting period. The Remuneration Report must also be voted on by shareholders (excluding

the votes of any KMP and their associates) at the Company’s AGM by way of a non-binding advisory vote. The

objective of these legislative provisions is to increase levels of transparency and accountability on remuneration

arrangements, strengthen alignment of remuneration with performance, and provide for greater shareholder

engagement and feedback on remuneration matters.

At the AGM held on 17 May 2022, 59.02 percent of shareholders voted against adoption of the FY2021

Remuneration Report. As the percentage of the “no vote” exceeded 25 percent, the Group incurred a ‘first strike’

pursuant to section 250R of the Act.

The Company has considered the feedback raised in the 2022 AGM in relation to the Remuneration Report and

sought to address the concerns regarding remuneration arrangements by taking actions including reviewing

KMP remuneration, obtaining further market insights from external remuneration consultants, and considering all

business outcomes in determining remuneration outcomes for FY2022. Full details of the changes implemented

as a consequence of the 2022 AGM vote are outlined in this Report.

The table below provides further information on key remuneration matters raised by shareholders and the

Group’s response.

Issue

Company response

NED remuneration

is perceived high

considering share price

performance over the

year

During the year DRA reviewed the remuneration of NEDs and relevant benchmarking methodology

and applied the following changes:

• reviewed and revised the comparator group companies for the purpose of benchmarking to

ensure those selected are closely aligned with DRA’s current operations and size so that a more

appropriate and valid comparison with the market can be conducted. The criteria used to select

the peers during the review include the nature of business (industrials, engineering and project

delivery), company size (comparable revenue, market capitalisation), complexity (operations

across multiple jurisdictions).

• reduced NED remuneration by 10 percent effective 1 November 2022 and until at least 31 December

2023, at which time annual remuneration will be reviewed again, and increased the opportunity for

settlement of remuneration through equity from 20 percent to 30 percent. The changes help further

align NED remuneration with long-term shareholder outcomes and also maintain the ongoing

appropriateness against market and internal policy (i.e., target between the 50th percentile (P50)

and 75th percentile (P75) for KMP remuneration) to ensure attraction and retention of people.

There are no performance

criteria for NED equity

NED equity is delivered in lieu of the cash fee and not in addition to the cash fee. The purpose of NED

equity is to promote shareholding among NEDs and align the financial interest of NEDs with that of

DRA shareholders over the long term. To increase this alignment, the Board approved the NEDs to

sacrifice 30 percent (vs. 20 percent in FY2021) of their fees in equity effective 1 November 2022. The

increase will be aligned with shareholder approvals regarding the number of options that can be

granted to Directors.

• NED equity grants are made without performance conditions (i.e., zero exercise priced options

which are subject to a service only requirement) to ensure NED independence in Board decision

making.

Executive KMP

remuneration is high

Following the review of executive KMP remuneration against the market, based on revised peer

companies, the Board:

• appointed James Smith and Michael Sucher to the CEO and CFO roles respectively at a significantly

lower remuneration level than their predecessors (i.e. 40 percent lower than former CEO, Andrew

Naudé, 22 percent lower than the former CFO, Adam Buckler). No remuneration increase was

offered to Alistair Hodgkinson (the COO) during the year.

• reduced the LTI maximum opportunity to 73 percent of TFR for the CEO (vs 115 percent in FY2021),

and between 68 and 72 percent of TFR for other Executive KMP (vs. 90 percent in FY2021).

• The Board considered that Executive KMP remuneration (post review) is aligned appropriately to

comparable companies in the market.

Managing Director) need to stand for re-election at a general meeting to

be held within 90 days of the second “no vote” being cast. This vote to ‘spill’ the Board of Directors is passed if 50

percent or more of eligible votes cast vote in favour of the resolution. While the votes of KMP and their associates

are excluded from voting on the non-binding advisory vote and any ‘spill’ vote, in the event the ‘spill’ vote is

passed they are not excluded from voting on resolutions to remove a director at the subsequent general meeting

of shareholders.

3. REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE

KMP remuneration decision making is guided by DRA’s remuneration governance framework as follows.

Board

The Board:

• considers the recommendations and considerations of the People, Culture and Remuneration

Committee.

• approves the remuneration arrangements of Executive KMP including fixed and at-risk elements

(STI and LTI plans).

• proposes the aggregate remuneration of NEDs for shareholder approval and sets remuneration for

individual NEDs.

People, Culture and

Remuneration Committee

(PCR Committee)

The PCR Committee assists the Board to fulfil its responsibilities in relation to people, culture and

remuneration matters, including:

• the establishment of remuneration strategies and practices that reward performance aligned with

the Company’s strategic objectives and long-term stakeholder interests.

• having oversight of KMP remuneration arrangements.

• meeting regularly throughout the year, with external consultants and senior management

attending PCR Committee meetings by invitation where their input is required.

Executive KMPs are not present during any PCR Committee discussions about their own remuneration

arrangements.

External Remuneration

Consultants

To ensure the PCR Committee is fully informed when making remuneration decisions, it may

seek external, independent remuneration advice on remuneration related issues. Remuneration

consultants may be engaged either directly by the PCR Committee or senior management.

During FY2022, the PCR Committee engaged consultants, including The Reward Practice Pty Ltd, Old

Mutual Limited and Aon Hewitt to provide remuneration services in respect to Australia and South

African benchmarking data and market insights for KMP remuneration.

No remuneration recommendations as defined in section 9B of the Act were provided by the

consultants during the period.
