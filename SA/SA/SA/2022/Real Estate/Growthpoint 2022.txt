LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

FOR THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

Dear shareholder

I invite and encourage you to attend and vote, either in person or

via electronic participation, at the 34th annual general meeting

(AGM) of Growthpoint Properties Limited (Growthpoint), which

will be held online and/or at The Place, 1 Sandton Drive, Sandown,

Sandton 2196, on Tuesday, 29 November 2022 at 09:00.

The AGM is an ideal opportunity for shareholders to engage

with Directors and executive management on the company’s

performance and results for the financial year ended 30 June 2022,

as well as on strategic and financial matters, including the future

direction, goals, objectives and policies (as well as remuneration

and social responsibility) of the company.

All the information that you would require to make an informed

decision on how to vote at the AGM is included in this report

containing the notice of the AGM, the summarised audited

financial statements and other supporting documentation.

The notice is accompanied by explanatory notes describing the

reasons for and the effects of special resolutions to be proposed

at the meeting.

In addition, I would like to highlight the following in respect of

certain of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM:

Changes to the Board

The appointment of Mrs Eileen Wilton and Mr Clifford Raphiri

during the year is in line with the commitment to shareholders

to rejuvenate the Board.

The Board is of the view that these new Directors have the

necessary skills and expertise to serve on the Board. The Board

remains committed to its intention to meet the empowerment

and representation targets it has set.

Mrs Mpume Nkabinde and Mr Patrick Mngkonkola will retire

at the AGM.

Changes to committees

Subject to shareholder approval, it is proposed that Mrs Wilton

chair the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee and

be a member of the Risk Management Committee, and that

Mr Raphiri be appointed as a member of the Audit Committee

and the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee.

Given the formal skills profiling and assessment of the Directors

that commenced in 2019, we are confident that the Board

remains suitably composed to ensure the future growth and

development of Growthpoint and to oversee the

implementation of the company’s strategy.

Remuneration policy and implementation

The Chairman of the Human Resources and Remuneration

Committee and I have actively engaged with our major

shareholders on our remuneration structure. Where possible,

we have incorporated all feedback into the design of our

long-term incentive scheme and the key performance indicators

for the short-term incentive scheme. Growthpoint is focused on

creating value for our stakeholders and the community at large,

and, therefore, non-financial measures for client satisfaction,

transformation and sustainability are continually monitored.

We trust that the structure as detailed on page 127 will meet

shareholders’ approval. Based on the consultations with our major

shareholders and the advice received from our remuneration

advisers, PwC. We believe that our remuneration policy is aligned

with best practice and that its application will enhance the

performance culture in the Group and lead to sustained value

creation for shareholders and other stakeholders.

The remuneration policy contains the FY23 Non-executive

Directors’ fees, which are recommended for shareholders’

approval. The Board, at its meeting held on 14 June 2022,

recommended a 5.5% increase in Directors’ remuneration for

FY23 (following a 4% increase for FY22), which is in line with

senior management increases.

The Board, having considered the contents of each resolution,

recommends that shareholders vote in favour of all resolutions

proposed at the AGM.

Lastly, I would like to thank Mrs Mpume Nkabinde and

Mr Patrick Mngconkola, who retire from the Board at the

AGM after 13 and 10 years respectively, for their significant

contributions to the Board.

If you are unable to attend the AGM, you may vote by proxy

in accordance with the instructions in the AGM notice and

proxy form.

I look forward to welcoming you to the AGM.

Yours sincerely

Rhidwaan Gasant

Chairman
