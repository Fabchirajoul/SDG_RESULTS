Significant judgement and

ARC assessed the suitability of

accounting policies and appropriateness

of management’s judgements and

estimates. The committee focused on

key matters, particularly those involving

complexity and management judgement

or estimation, considering potential

risks and impact on the Group’s financial

results.

In relation to assessments relating to

key audit, and other significant, matters,

the committee obtained assurance from

the external auditor as detailed in the

following table.

Key audit matter

Committee’s assessment

Valuation of

investment

property and

investment

property held

for sale

The valuation of investment property and investment property

held for sale requires significant judgement and estimation. MAS

obtained independent, individual asset valuation reports for

each six-month period reported, and the committee discussed

these, and the related assumptions, with external auditors and

management.

Acquisition

of Spark II

Portfolio from

DJV

The committee reviewed and assessed management’s key

judgements and estimations when deciding the relevant

accounting policies to be applied in respect of this material

transaction concluded during the financial year. The committee

discussed these accounting policies with management and

reviewed the relevant disclosures included in the financial

statements, ensuring compliance with applicable standards.

Meetings

The committee meets as necessary, but at least three times a year. The external auditor is invited to attend meetings when the

committee plans to discuss the planning, findings and conclusion of the audit process, discuss and review consolidated interim or

annual financial statements, and investment property external valuations’ assumptions and appropriateness. The external auditor is

invited to other committee meetings as determined and requested by members.

The committee held four formal meetings during the financial year. Additionally, ARC held a meeting in August 2022 assessing the

annual (consolidated and standalone) financial statements for the year to 30 June 2022, prior to recommending these for Board

approval. During this session, the list of external independent valuers was reviewed and approved.

The main topics discussed and/or resolved at each formal meeting, held during the 2022 financial year, is detailed in the following

table.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE (CONTINUED)

Combined Assurance Framework

MAS manages risk using a combined

assurance model, involving multiple lines

of defense, ensuring effective controls,

risk management procedures and

governance processes. This embodies

the concept of holistic risk management,

enabling the Group to manage exposure

and optimise opportunities.

External auditor

ARC recommends to the Board

appointment of the external auditor

and oversees its effectiveness and

independence by:

• reviewing the scope of annual

external audit plan, including its

appropriateness, key audit matters and

materiality;

• assessing external auditor’s

independence and audit quality, and

• appraising and approving external

auditor’s remuneration.

ARC discussed the appropriateness

of key audit matters, confirmed the

external auditor adequately fulfilled its

responsibilities and has the requisite

qualifications, knowledge and resources

to discharge its duties, based on

paragraph 22.15(h) of the JSE Listings

Requirements, especially in the context

of the migration to Malta.

PwC confirmed its independence and

that it maintains the necessary internal

safeguards to ensure objectivity. Except

the external audit, the two parties are

satisfied that no relationships exist

between them, which might affect the

external auditor’s independence and

objectivity.

The committee reviewed the

appropriateness of the external auditor’s

fees with reference to the Company’s

migration to Malta, the financial year’s

challenges and complexity, additional

communication and the audit’s multi-

jurisdictional nature, concluding the

fees are commensurate and sufficient to

perform a quality audit.

PwC’s approved fees for 2022 and

2021 financial years are detailed in the

following table.

* Includes full fees for audit work performed in

respect of the DJV in the context of MAS’ financial

statements.

** Non-audit fees incurred during the financial

year to 30 June 2022 relate to the external

auditor’s involvement in the 2022 sustainability

report, bond allocation report and accountants’

independent reporting on proforma financial

information included in the circular to MAS’

shareholders for the Transactions with the DJV.

The Group’s non-audit services policy

states all the external auditor’s non-

audit services require the committee’s

approval before being engaged by MAS

and the scope of work must be clearly

determinable. The policy applies to

the Company and all its subsidiaries.

These requirements were observed and

complied with in respect of non-audit

services commissioned during the

financial year.

Risk management

Effective risk management is essential

to achieving strategic and operational

objectives and goals, and good

management. It is also crucial to

corporate governance, as it is integral

to decision making and day-to-day

management, and is incorporated into

the Company’s strategic and operational

planning.

Ultimately, managing risk is the Board’s

responsibility, and, without abdicating

its authority, the Board has delegated

this function to ARC, which oversees risk

management.

Management is responsible for

implementation of risk management to

day-to-day operations. The committee

focuses on key risks affecting MAS and

ensures these are regularly assessed.

Internal controls

The Group’s internal control framework

incorporates the following matters:

• risk identification;

• risk assessment;

• risk response;

• risk monitoring, and

• risk reporting.

The committee is satisfied that adequate

processes were in place and internal

controls operated effectively throughout

the 2022 financial year.

Whistleblowing

ARC is responsible for overseeing

the Group’s Whistleblowing Policy,

that provides a formal framework for

staff members and Directors to raise

concerns if they observe misconduct or

illegal activities within the organisation

or supply chain.

This is facilitated by maintaining a

dedicated, independent and confidential

Whistleblowing Hotline, available

for staff 24/7 and operated by an

independent chartered accountancy

firm. Anonymous concerns can be raised

by email, online or by telephone.

This year, there were no instances of

whistleblowing.

Conclusion

This report was prepared in accordance

with the JSE Listings Requirements, King

IV and other applicable regulations.

The committee is satisfied it discharged

its duties in accordance with its Terms of

Reference from the Board.

REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION AND NOMINATION COMMITTEE (CONTINUED)

Shareholder engagement

On 6 December 2021, 77.36% of

shareholders that voted at the Annual

General Meeting, approved the

2021 Compensation Policy and its

implementation for Executive Directors

(81.80%) and Non-Executive Directors

(95.44%). This demonstrates continued

strong shareholder support for the

Compensation Policy and reflects a

strong commitment, and considerable

consensus, among shareholders, Board

and management to prioritise total

long-term shareholders’ returns at the

forefront of MAS’ strategy.

Compensation: staff

Philosophy

The compensation philosophy is to

attract, invest in and retain the best

talent, enabling the Company to meet

strategic objectives. Long-term staff

performance and productivity is driven

by numerous factors, including skills

and knowledge, respect for leadership,

experience, positive work environment,

personal investment in business and

a transparent and fair remuneration

system.

Compensation and staff policies are

equitable and transparent, ensuring

long-term staff contributions align with

Group’s values.

The Group’s guiding principles of people

management are:

• attracting, retaining and developing

staff;

• staff acknowledging, and adhering

to, the corporate culture and, more

specifically, core organisational values;

• staff’s alignment with shareholders’

interests;

• a performance culture, maintaining a

healthy balance between individual

achievement and teamwork;

• supporting, reinforcing and rewarding

excellence;

• effective resource selection and usage;

• appropriate, efficient and cost-effective

compensation structures;

• compliance with regulatory and ethical

standards;

• compensation structures reinforcing

Risk Management Policy;

• appraisal and control, and

• fairness and accountability.

Awards based on a combination

of individual performance

In addition to the

competitiveness of total

compensation packages, if

the Group is outperforming

objectives, for instance, by

delivering returns greater than

the risk-adjusted return on

equity required by shareholders,

compensation should also

outperform the market.

Cash bonus

A biannual bonus pool, subject to

profitability, is generated and distributed

based on each individual’s contribution

to the Group’s financial success.

This is facilitated by a biannual,

360 degree performance appraisal

system, where staff members are

assessed by colleagues and managers

on their achievements, especially in

relation to core values and individual

contribution to results. These appraisals

are adjusted, and moderated, by senior

management.

Cash bonuses are generally awarded to

mid-management and other members

of staff.

Senior management and individuals who,

due to their role, can, and do, make a

material contribution to profitability, for

instance, Executive Directors, Function

Heads, asset managers other relevant

staff members are invited to participate

in the MAS SPS, excluding them from

the cash bonus scheme. Cash bonuses

are usually payable in three parts,

with the second and third instalments

deferred for twelve- and twenty-four

months respectively. The deferred

payments are subject to, amongst other

factors, continued overall profitability in

management’s discretion and continued

employment on payment date.

The cash bonus is discretionary

and awarded when merited. When

determining cash bonuses, multiple

factors are considered, including overall

compensation compared to market.

Individual annualised bonuses typically

range from one- to three-months’

salary. In cases of gross misconduct,

the payment of subsequent instalments

is subject to retroactive negative

adjustment.

MAS shares in lieu of cash bonus

Staff may, occasionally, be granted the

opportunity to invest their cash bonus

in MAS shares. Typically, this involves

converting bonuses into a direct, or

indirect, entitlement to MAS shares,

acquired on the market, and subject to

the following terms and conditions:

• the shares cannot be sold for a specific

time (lock-in period) after which,

subject to continued engagement, staff

may trade them;

• MAS shares revert to the relevant

issuing party, without compensation, if

a participant’s engagement ceases prior

to the end of the lock-in period, and

• participants benefit from dividend

payments declared by MAS, subject to

continued employment.
