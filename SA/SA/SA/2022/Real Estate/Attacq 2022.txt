Dear Stakeholders

The challenges we faced in the last

couple of years have brought about a

clear focus for the Attacq team on the

way forward. We have a strong company

culture and a much-improved capital

structure enabling us to focus on future

growth. We have affirmed our belief

that ownership in Attacq is a long-term

investment and Attacq will therefore

remain a REIT.

Attacq’s quality property portfolio showed

resilience during the challenging times

and the ability to bounce back as life

slowly returned to normality. The board

and management team’s continuous

focus on our core business drivers has

enabled us to deliver a good set of results

and position Attacq for future growth.

In addition, we are delighted to

announce that Attacq has achieved a

Level 1 B-BBEE rating – a first Level 1 for

Attacq since the start of its B-BBEE journey.

We remain committed to transformation

initiatives that are impactful for both our

employees and our communities alike.

Performance in 2022

I am pleased to report that we have seen a

significant improvement in our results for FY22:

§ DIPS increased by 34.2% to 62.8 cents

§ Dividends resumed with 50.0 cps declared

by the board for the financial year

§ Gearing decreased from 43.3% to 37.2%

§ Our weighted average trading density

measured over 12-months has improved

by 12.6%

§ Occupancy levels are above 92.0% and

collection rates remain high at 97.8%

Attacq has a strong development pipeline with

a compelling value proposition and a strong

capital structure to fund its strategy.

Our CEO and CFO expand on these results from

pages 15 and 43.

We are, however, acutely aware that our

shares are trading at a significant discount to

the underlying assets and we are confident

that the methodical development of our

assets will ensure that the evident value will

become reflected in the share price. We remain

committed to delivering a fair return in exchange

for the risk taken by our valued shareholders. Our

focus remains to enhance our capital structure

by possibly allocating capital to repurchasing

Attacq’s shares, debt reductions and accretive

developments within Waterfall City.

A clearly focused strategy

During the past year, we have confirmed

Attacq’s strategy, which underlines our

purpose: To create smart, safe and sustainable

community spaces providing remarkable

experiences in our managed hubs.

§ Our core focus remains on the development

of Waterfall City into a smart, safe, and

sustainable city through business and

development partnerships

§ The precinct-focused approach to our South

African portfolio ensures quality income

streams and the timely disposal of non-core

assets

§ Capital allocation is focused on value

creation and optimising a sustainable capital

structure

§ Business diversification is focused on value

creation by integrating ESG, innovation and

technology

Our MAS investment is considered a medium-

term hold while we remain committed to

our strategy to exit our Rest of Africa retail

investments.

Attacq’s purpose.

The macroeconomic

environment

Internationally, geopolitical tension has resulted

in extreme commodity price swings that will have

a profound impact on the global economy over

the short to medium term. Price increases in oil

and gas as well as food has affected worldwide

inflation statistics, especially in the developed

world. The additional upward pressure on

inflation will reduce household purchasing power

across the globe.

In South Africa, real gross domestic product

growth is estimated at 2.2% in 2022, with output

and employment expected to remain well below

pre-pandemic levels until 2023.

The economy is plagued by instability, poor

municipal service delivery and an electricity

crisis, manifested by increased load shedding

and plant breakdowns.

High fuel and food inflation have dampened

consumer confidence and spending.

Record unemployment continues to limit

economic recovery and spark social unrest.

Dear shareholders

It is pleasing to report that our employees have continued to respond with dedication and

commitment, conquering the challenges of yet another demanding year while building a

company culture that we are proud off.

Key focus areas and key decisions

The aim of our remuneration policy is to reward employees who embody our values, drive

sustainable value creation, and build our company culture. The board, through the remuneration

and nomination committee (hereafter remco), ensure that remuneration is aligned with Attacq’s

strategic objectives and the reasonable expectations of all stakeholders.

We regularly review our remuneration policies and practices to ensure they remain competitive,

relevant, fair, responsible and transparent.

As remco, our aim is to maintain strong relationships with our stakeholders to ensure alignment

and understanding of the implementation of the group’s remuneration policy. Remco reviews

the remuneration report disclosures annually in order to enable all shareholders to make informed

assessments of the remuneration policy and governance processes.

Remco reviews the remuneration structure annually to ensure that it:

1 is performance-based, linking to realistic performance objectives

2 is supportive of the group’s strategy

3 achieves the desired employer of choice status through best practise

4 is aligned with shareholder expectations

Voting on the remuneration report and measures taken in response

In line with King IV, the remuneration policy and the remuneration implementation report were

presented to shareholders for two separate non-binding advisory votes at the 16 November 2021

AGM. They voted on the remuneration policy and the remuneration implementation plan at the

AGM with votes totaling 66.5% (2020: 87.4%) and 75.4% (2020: 96.1%) respectively.
