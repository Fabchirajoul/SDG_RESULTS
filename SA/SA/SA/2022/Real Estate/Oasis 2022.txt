During the year, the Audit and Risk Committee considered key accounting matters and judgements in respect of the financial

statements relating to:

• Valuation of Investment Properties – The valuation of investment properties include comparable bulk sales, discounted cash

flow and net income capitalisation, using contracted rental income and other cash flows. These valuations are regularly

compared to actual market yield data, actual transactions by the Fund and those reported by the market. Valuations were

carried out as at 31 March 2022 by Mills Fitchet Magnus Penny, an independent, professional valuer registered without restriction

in terms of the Property Valuers Act, No. 47 of 2000.

• Going concern and covenant compliance – The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed, challenged and concluded upon

the Group’s going concern review and consideration of its viability statement including giving due consideration to the

appropriateness of key judgements, assumptions and estimates underlying the budgets and projections that underpin the

review and a review of compliance with key financial covenants.
