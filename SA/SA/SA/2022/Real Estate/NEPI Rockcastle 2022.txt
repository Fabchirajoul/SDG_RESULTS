Corporate governance:

Chairman's evaluation.

The evaluation covered the following considerations:

•

structure and composition of the Board and Committees,

including diversity, expertise and mix of skills;

•

efficiency and transparency of operations, processes

and routines, including the quality of the decision-

making process, members' dynamics, teamwork

and collaboration, the display of ethical values,

independence, autonomy, objectivity;

•

Board contribution to key areas such as strategy,

performance monitoring, evaluation, compensation

and succession, corporate governance and risk

management.

The Board and Committees activity has been evaluated

as rigorous, valuable and aligned to their mandate, the

Committees Charters and the Corporate Governance

Framework, while no significant improvement areas have

been pointed out.

The results have improved as compared to the previous

evaluation across all categories evaluated, and the

overall score was above average across the board. The

Chairman’s evaluation was also positive, exceeding the

average scores across all items.

Keeping up to date with trends, industry-specifics, legal

and regulatory developments, economic, social and

governance topics, is a constant priority and the Directors’

development programme includes dedicated sessions

covering such areas.

A formal succession plan is in place to ensure that

sufficient knowledge, skills and expertise are available for

the Board to effectively govern the Group, to safeguard

a smooth transition and to preserve knowledge and

experience at Board level. Succession planning includes:

•

identifying the knowledge, skills and experience the

Board should collectively possess to effectively fulfil

its roles and responsibilities;

•

ensuring an appropriate balance in terms of diversity,

expertise and knowledge among the Directors, in

accordance with the Board Profile Paper;

•

identifying qualified individuals suitable for

nomination and recommending them to the

shareholders at the AGM;

•

achieving continuity through a smooth succession

of Directors (including Board and Committees

leadership) that balances perspective and

independence with experience and knowledge; and

•

satisfying best practice within the legal and

regulatory framework applicable to the Group.

In 2022, the Chief Operating Officer and the Deputy Chief

Financial Officer were appointed as natural successors

of the former CEO and CFO, after a robust process,

under the coordination of the Nomination Committee.

The former Company Executive Director has also been

appointed COO. The process led by the Nomination

Committee and endorsed through Board’s appointment of

the new Executive roles, encompassed extensive market

research, assessments and evaluations, supported by top

notch external advisers.

DIRECTORS’ DEALINGS AND RELATED

PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Dealing in Company’s securities by Directors, their

associates and key Group employees, is regulated and

monitored in accordance with the applicable stock

exchange listing requirements, guidelines, legislation,

regulations and directives.

To prevent the risk of insider trading and to ensure that

none of the restricted persons abuse, and do not place

themselves under suspicion of abusing inside privileged

information, the Group has adopted a formal Dealing

Code, available and communicated to all employees

and Directors. The Dealing Code sets out obligations

for the Group’s Directors, managers, staff and persons

closely associated with them, under the Market Abuse

Regulation and stock exchange listing requirements and

guidelines, regarding clearance to deal and notifications of

transactions in the Group’s securities. The Group prohibits

all Directors and employees from using confidential

information, not generally known or available to the

public, for personal benefit. The Code was revised in 2022,

to ensure alignment to Dutch provisions and relevant

legislation.

Investment Committee

Members of the Investment Committee must have

significant property investment, retail and relevant market

knowledge. The Investment Committee Chair must be

a non-Executive Director with adequate financial and

investment experience.

The senior management of the Group is responsible for

identifying new investment opportunities, optimising the

performance of existing assets (for example, through

refurbishments, extensions and re-tenanting), and, where

necessary, proposing the disposal of assets which no longer

contribute to the Group’s income growth strategy. The

CEO will coordinate and monitor all acquisitions, capital

expenditures and disposals, and will recommend those

which exceed his mandate to the Investment Committee.

The Committee is responsible for formulating the overall

investment strategy of the Group and for establishing

investment guidelines. The Committee’s activity complies

with all applicable fiduciary, prudence and due diligence

requirements, which experienced investment professionals

would utilise, and with all applicable laws, rules and

regulations issued by relevant local and international bodies.

The purpose of the Investment Committee is to:

•

consider management recommendations for mergers,

acquisitions, investments, capital expenditure and

disposals, and make proposals to the Board for

approval;

•

authorise transactions that fall within its mandate,

analyse and recommend to the Board those that fall

outside its mandate; and

•

evaluate and monitor investments performance over

time.

The Board and the Committees considered their activity

during 2022 and confirm that they are satisfied that they

have fulfilled their responsibilities in accordance with their

charters and the Corporate Governance Framework.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND

RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT

The Board oversees stakeholder relationship management,

while responsibility for the day-to-day execution has been

delegated to the Executive Directors and, further on, to

line management.

NEPI Rockcastle has a transparent information

communication policy, enabling stakeholders to assess

the Group’s economic value and prospects. The Company

encourages proactive engagement with shareholders,

including during the Company’s semi-annual results

presentations and Annual General Meetings, where

Directors are available to respond to shareholders’ inquiries

on how the Board has executed its governance duties.

The Executive Directors have regular discussions on

operational trends and financial performance with relevant

stakeholders, where they believe this to be in the Group’s

best interest. No information is shared preferentially only

to some stakeholders.

The Group’s Directors ensure that all shareholders are

treated equally and equitably, and that management

recognises, protects and facilitates the exercise of all

shareholders’ rights through constant, open and timely

communication. The Board seeks to protect the interests

of minority shareholders while the Dealing Code and the

Related Party Transactions Policy are designed to ensure

such protection.

The Group actively manages its relationship with

stakeholders and communicates formally in a number

of ways:

•

news, announcements, press releases are issued

in response to events or under routine reporting

obligations;

•

SENS announcements are made for changes in its

governance structure, Director, Committees as well as

Directors’ and associates’ dealings;

•

business updates are published regularly, depicting

Company’s performance;

•

the reviewed interim condensed consolidated

financial results are published in August each year,

outlining performance for the six months ended

30 June. The results announcements are followed

by Results Presentations and investor calls. The

presentation and the reports are posted on the

Group’s website;

•

the reviewed preliminary condensed consolidated

financial statements for the year ended 31 December,

including detailed management commentary, are

published in February each year. These are followed

by Results Presentations announced publicly on the

corporate website, open to and accessible by any

stakeholder;

•

the Annual Report, including audited consolidated

financial statements of the Group and separate

financial statements of the Company, is published in

March each year, comprising reporting on all relevant

matters.

The Board is required through the applicable governance

codes to provide a fair, balanced and understandable

assessment of the Group’s position and prospects in

its external reporting. The Board considers that this

Annual Report and the Audited Consolidated Financial

Statements, taken as a whole, meet all requirements and

provide the information necessary for shareholders to

assess the Directors’ governance of the Group.

More details on stakeholder categories and the

key engagement mechanisms are included in the

Sustainability section of this annual report, page 165.

Director's shareholding

Executive Directors or entities in which they have an indirect beneficial interest held the following numbers of NEPI

Rockcastle shares at 31 December 2022:

Single figure remuneration

The total remuneration and detail for Executive Directors for 2022, relative to previous years where applicable, is

contained in the table below. This disclosure is aligned with the Dutch Executive Remuneration legal requirements.

*Considering the pandemic circumstances and the challenging market

context affecting the business in the last two years, in order to fairly reflect

these effects in the reward proposition for the Executive directors, and

in order for their remuneration to be in line with the business results, the

Remuneration Committee has decided to use the 2 years compound CAGR

for the determination of the award of 2022 versus 3-year compound growth

previously used.

**Considering that indexation is the key rate used in relation to all the

Group’s commercial dealings, the Remuneration Committee has decided

to use indexation when determining awards (instead of previously used

inflation). The indexation used is the one communicated in the rental

escalation note of the 2021 Annual Report.

*All figures represent total cost to Company; there are no other benefits granted to the Directors than the ones disclosed above.

**Mr Rüdiger Dany was appointed as Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer of the Group with effect from 18 August 2021. From 1 February 2022 he

was appointed as interim CEO and from 1 June 2022 he was confirmed in his role on a permanent basis. In computing the STIP award for 2022, the amount was

determined by reference to the CEO annual fixed remuneration for 11 months and the role of COO for one month.

An LTIP award of €800 thousand (137,945 shares) was granted in 2022, at the Board’s discretion, to Rüdiger Dany as an extraordinary sign-on, one-off award

as COO (for 2021). Considering his appointment as CEO as detailed above, an amount of 118,239 shares is deducted from the 2022 performance related award,

further to the termination of his position as COO.

The total LTIP award entitlement for Rüdiger Dany for 2022 performance is €1,620 thousand, equivalent to 279,866 shares, of which 118,239 are being

deducted from the previous year's allocation. Hence, the remaining award for the CEO role and 2022 performance, is an award of 161,627 shares, equivalent of

€936 thousand.

*** Mrs Eliza Predoiu was appointed as interim CFO of the Group with effect from 1 February 2022 and from 1 June 2022 she was confirmed in her role on a

permanent basis. In computing the STIP award for 2022, the amount was determined by reference to the CFO annual fixed remuneration for 11 months and her

previous role as Deputy CFO for one month.

^Mr Marek Noetzel, an Executive Director of the Group, was appointed as Chief Operating Officer effective from 1 June 2022.

^^Mr Alex Morar resigned from his position of Chief Operating Officer effective from 1 February 2022. The fees for 2022 include a non-compete compensation

of €120 thousand.

^^^ Ms Mirela Covasa resigned from her position of Chief Financial Officer effective from 1 February 2022. The fees for 2022 include a non-compete

compensation of €100 thousand.

~The share price for the LTIP relating to 2022 performance is €5.78849 and has been determined as 30-days Volume Weighted Average Price (‘VWAP’) from

10 February 2023 (date of the approval by the Remuneration Committee). The share price for the LTIP relating to 2021 performance is €5.7994 and has been

determined as 90-days VWAP from 8 March 2022 (date of the approval by the Remuneration Committee).
