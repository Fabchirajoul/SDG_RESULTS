Managing Director in 1999.

In 2001, he joined Mr Price Apparel (a

division of Mr Price Group Limited) as the

deputy: Managing

letter from its Spanish lenders regarding certain covenant terms.

As a result EUR 6,5 million of interest-bearing borrowings was reclassified as non-current subsequent to the reporting date. All debt

covenants are proactively monitored to manage and address any potential breaches and the Group has a safe range for covenant

compliance in the upcoming year. The Group properties’ respective LTVs at the reporting date are well below the maximum thresholds

of the related hard loan-to-value covenants.

Other considerations

The Group strengthened its balance sheet and liquidity position by raising EUR 2.7 million of additional equity during the year.

Overall assessment by the Board

In its assessment of the going concern assumption, the Lighthouse Board has taken cognisance of the impact of the macroeconomic

environment and determined that the going concern assumption for the Group and the Company remains valid and reasonable.
