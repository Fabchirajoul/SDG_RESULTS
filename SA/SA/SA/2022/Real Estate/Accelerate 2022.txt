letter of undertaking in this

regard. Closed periods are imposed on directors and

employee in relation to interim and annual financial

results, and from time to time in relation to any specific

corporate actions. Each share entitles the shareholder to

one vote. There are no non-voting shares.

Structured to effectively deliver value

Board structure

APF has a unitary board structure, and its board

committees focus on key strategic areas in line with

members’ expertise and experience. The structure of

the board and its committees is simple and transparent.

It enables an efficient and timely flow of information

from the board and its committees through the CEO,

CFO and the executive team into the group, and ensures

accountability from the board to shareholders. The board

reviews its delegation of authority framework annually

and confirms that it is satisfied with its contribution

to appropriate role clarity between the board, its

committees and executive management.

Appropriate policies and procedures provide the

parameters for the committees to fulfil their mandates

and add value to the effective functioning of the board to

ultimately create value for stakeholders.

The board recognises it is

accountable for effective

corporate governance, which is

enshrined in its commitment to

lead the company with integrity,

competence, responsibility,

fairness and transparency.

The composition of the board committees is monitored

and reviewed on a continual basis.

The board has a formal charter, which it reviews and

approves annually. The charter sets out the board’s role,

powers and responsibilities, and differentiates the roles

of the chairman, lead independent director, CEO, COO

and CFO.

Commitment to the King IV principles and outcomes

The board is committed to its primary governance roles and responsibilities. It recognises that the execution of these

and the application of King IV principles and outcomes allows it to measure and review performance in an informed

manner. For more details, see our King IV register on our website at https://www.acceleratepf.co.za/investorcentre/.

Our governance practices and processes resulted in the following outcomes:

Ethical culture

Performance

Effective control

Legitimacy

Our approach to business is

underpinned by an ethical

culture. We undertake to

conduct ourselves ethically in

everything we do, in line with

our values and the terms of

our Board Charter and Code

of Ethics.

Our strategy is designed

to deliver good

performance over the

short, medium and

long-term.

Performance is connected

to our immediate financial

results and the long-term

growth prospects of the

business.

While the board is

ultimately responsible

to shareholders, our

governance structures

ensure there is an

effective delegation of

responsibility to enable

sustainable delivery.

We strive to be scrupulous

in the way we conduct our

business. We endeavour

to be a responsible

corporate citizen that

contributes to the growth

of the communities in

which we operate.

Our social activities are

reported on page 91

to 95.

Ethical culture

The board is committed to leading ethically

and effectively, and it strives to ensure that its

actions reflect this.

The board is ultimately responsible for the ethical

behaviour of the business and regularly reviews the

company’s governance structures to ensure these remain

relevant and effective in achieving their objectives.

The social, ethics and transformation committee focuses

on ethics management, in alignment with King IV. The role

of this committee has evolved over the past few years

to be more prominent in ethics management, and to

ensure an ethical culture and ethical conduct permeate

the group.

Our values are embedded in our Code of Ethics.

These values include integrity, trust and honesty, in

our relationships with all stakeholders. APF expects its

suppliers, customers and other stakeholders in the value

chain to adhere to its Code of Ethics.

The company has an ethics matrix in place. At every

meeting, the social, ethics and transformation committee

monitors APF’s ethical conduct by reviewing reports

of significant cases of employee conflicts of interest,

misconduct, fraud, dishonesty or any unethical activity,

as well as reports of any whistle-blowing activities. The

committee also reviews the company’s Code of Ethics

Policy every three years, or as required, for further review

and confirmation by the board. There were no ethics

breaches to report for the year under review.

The board upholds the protection of human rights as

encapsulated in the South African Constitution and Bill

of Rights. The board confirms that APF adheres to the

10 principles of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact.

Details of our social impact and the activities of the

social, ethics and transformation committee are

discussed in the social, ethics and transformation

committee report on pages 119 to 120.

This matter is under consideration for the future, where such requirement becomes necessary given the ED’s and senior

management (excluding Michael Georgiou) minimal shareholding.

NED fees

NED fees reflect the directors’ roles and membership of the board and its committees. Currently, the fees comprise

an aggregate board base fee plus additional fees for membership per committee. In the committee’s view, the fees

paid to NEDs are sufficient to attract board members with the appropriate level of skill and expertise. NEDs do not hold

contracts of employment with the company, and they do not take part in the STI nor the LTI. NED fees are reviewed

annually and submitted to shareholders for approval.

The fees paid to NEDs during FY2022 are included in the implementation report below, while the proposed fees for

FY2023 are set out in the notice of AGM.

Non-binding vote on Remuneration Policy

The Remuneration Policy, as set out in part 2 of this report, will be tabled for a separate non-binding advisory vote at the AGM.

Implementation report

Compliance with the Remuneration Policy

The committee is satisfied that all remuneration practices during FY2022 save for the failure to issue STI and LTI awards

complied with the company’s Remuneration Policy. Further details are provided below.

TGP adjustments

No FY23 TGP increases or adjustments were made to any of the executive directors.
