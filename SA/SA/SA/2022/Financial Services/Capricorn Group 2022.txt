INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022

CELEBRATING 40 YEARS OF BANKING EXCELLENCE:

managing director.

The role of the chief data and analytics officer was created. This role

will help establish a formal strategy and to leverage data effectively as

a key asset to deliver personalised, secure and customer-centric

solutions. We developed a data strategy to help us derive value from our

data assets. This was approved in May 2022, and we are executing the

proposed roadmap.

All enhancements to channels have been designed and built using

design-thinking methods. Other guiding principles include:

> An omnichannel approach

> Paperless outcomes

> Consistency across all touchpoints

> Commercial viability

> Personalisation

> Customer-centric design

Customer and employee transition to adopt #gobeyond platforms and

processes remain critical. A business transition team is driving our robust

change management focus. Risk management is a vital part of the

programme, including cyber security. Our banks had no losses or legal

proceedings related to customer privacy. We also adapted our

Connector programme to offer strategic support to #gobeyond

through our change agent network.

Our vision of the banks’ future work is to reduce manual paper-based

processes and automate certain functions, freeing time to better focus

on our customers’ needs. Consequently, how employees execute certain

processes may change. Digital ones will replace manual ones, or the

products and services offered to customers may change. Employees

will have to learn new techniques and tools to promote and support

these products and services.

The banking trends set out in our section on our operating context

on page 24 reflect the emphasis on digital transformation to remain

competitive. Read more about #gobeyond milestones for 2022 in

the Group CEO report on page 44.
