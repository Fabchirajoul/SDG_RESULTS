Dear shareholders

On behalf of the Board and as Chair

of the Remuneration Committee, I am

pleased to introduce the Directors’

Remuneration Report for the year.

We are thankful for the constructive

engagement we had with our

shareholders and executives during

the year.

Performance in the year

The Group continued to successfully

navigate the social, economic and

geopolitical challenges that have

characterised the past two years, and

has made significant progress against

the strategic goals outlined at the 2019

Capital Markets Day. Our focused

approach delivered a strong rebound,

with adjusted operating profit increasing

by 82% to £687 million.

Revenue performance was strong as

underlying franchises effectively

supported our clients, with costs well

contained.

Full details of our performance in the

year can be found in the section ‘Our

Performance’ in the Integrated Report.

Remuneration overview for the year

In August 2021 shareholders approved a

revised Directors’ Remuneration Policy

that we believe is aligned with our

strategy to simplify and focus the

business for growth, through five

strategic objectives:

• Capital discipline;

• Growth initiatives;

• Improved cost management;

• Digitalisation; and

• Greater connectivity.

Key features of the policy included:

• on-target Short-term Incentive (STI)

at 100% of fixed remuneration and

50% of maximum opportunity, in line

with ISS guidance

• standard Long-term Incentive (LTI)

grant reduced from 100% to 80% of

fixed remuneration

• delivering all variable remuneration in

shares; and

• the introduction of Profit Before Tax

as a measure in the STI and Relative

Total Shareholder Return as a

measure in the LTI.

The 2022 Chief Executive remuneration

single figure increased by 130.3% from

2021 for three key reasons:

• Overall financial performance of the

Group, including adjusted operating

profit that increased by 82% to

£687 million

• This is the first year that an LTI award

has vested to the current Chief

Executive; this vested at 100.8% of

on-target number of shares and 74.7%

of maximum opportunity which

equates to £1,651,000

• The share price has increased 23%

over the performance period,

contributing £308,000 of the increase.

The Remuneration Committee believes

that the Executive Directors have

performed very well and the

remuneration outcomes are reflective of

the overall financial and non-financial

performance for the one and three year

performance periods.

Executive Director outcomes

STI 2022

Group Profit Before Tax (PBT) and Group

RoE outcomes both exceeded the

stretch targets set.

The group Cost to Income Ratio and the

Group Cost Growth metric both

exceeded on-target but did not achieve

the stretch targets set. This resulted in

overall achievement of the Group

financial metrics at 189.5% of on-target

amount and 94.7% of maximum

opportunity.

The committee assessed achievement

against the non-financial objectives at

stretch level for culture and values, on-

target level for ESG related measures

and in between on-target and stretch for

the strategic objectives, with the

exception of Ciaran Whelan for whom

the committee assessed achievement

against the strategic measures at

stretch. This resulted in the overall

achievement of non-financial elements

at 150.0% of on-target amount and

75.0% of maximum opportunity for Fani

Titi, Nishlan Samujh and Richard

Wainwright, and overall achievement of

175.0% of on-target amount and 87.5%

of maximum opportunity on the non-

financial measures for Ciaran Whelan.

The overall STI achievement was 181.6%

of on-target amount and 90.8% of

maximum opportunity for Fani Titi and

Nishlan Samujh. Due to the regulatory
