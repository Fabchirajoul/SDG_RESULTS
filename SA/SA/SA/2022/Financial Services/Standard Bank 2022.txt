of appointment setting out the terms of their engagement.

Directors are appointed by the shareholders at the AGM and

interim board appointments are allowed between AGMs.

One-third of the longest serving, non-executive directors are

required to retire at each AGM and may offer themselves for

re-election. If recommended by the directors and supported by

the board, the board then proposes their re-election to

shareholders.

Fees

The remuneration of board members is reviewed by the board of

directors and approved and ratified at the AGM. Non-executive

directors receive fixed fees for service on boards and board

committees. This includes a retainer that has been calculated in

line with market practices. There are no contractual

arrangements for compensation for loss of office. Non-executive

directors do not receive short-term incentives, nor do they

participate in any long-term incentive schemes. The fees for

non-executive directors are reviewed on an annual basis to

ensure that such fees at all times remain market-related.

OUR ACCOUNTABILITY:

letter of complaint by a third-party, who is not a client of the bank, that relates to an

alleged N$60 million loss by the third-party as a result of the alleged unauthorised conduct of the bank’s employee. The legal

department of the bank has investigated the matter in conjunction with external senior counsel and should legal action be

instituted against the bank in relation to this matter, it will rigorously defend the matter. The bank is comfortable that it has

reasonable prospects of success in defending the matter.

Other

In the ordinary course of business, the group is involved as a defendant in litigation, lawsuits and other proceedings.

Management recognises the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of defended legal proceedings. Nevertheless, based

on management’s knowledge from investigation, analysis and after consulting with legal counsel, management believes that

there are no individual legal proceedings that are currently assessed as being ‘likely to succeed and material’ or ‘unlikely to

succeed but material should they succeed’. The group is also the defendant in some legal cases for which the group is fully

indemnified by external third parties, none of which are individually material. Management is accordingly satisfied that the

legal proceedings currently pending against the group should not have a material adverse effect on the group’s consolidated

financial position and the directors are satisfied that the group has adequate insurance programmes and, where required in

terms of IFRS for claims that are probable, provisions in place to meet claims that may succeed.
