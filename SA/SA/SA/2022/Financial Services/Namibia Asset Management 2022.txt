letter and the spirit of new

ACTIVE CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP

We are an active corporate citizen that strives to make a

positive influence on our economy and society. We have

continued to engage with industry bodies and stakeholders

to find solutions to the ongoing socioeconomic effects of

Covid-19 and, more recently, the damage done by global

macro events. With a view to developing pipeline talent

for the local financial service industry, we continue to

offer bursaries to young Namibians pursuing a career in

financial services. We have also implemented an internship

programme to provide graduates with practical work

experience.

OUTLOOK

The Namibian savings environment is not only affected by

global geopolitical events but also by stressed consumers

having less income to save and invest. It is also worth noting

that active managers are under pressure globally, as a risk-

off sentiment and a shift to passives have resulted in a net

outflows environment.

We expect market volatility to continue, mainly due to the

increasingly unpredictable macro environment. The prevalent

challenges are likely to remain with us for the foreseeable

future, with recessionary pressures increasingly evident, in

developed markets. However, we remain confident in the

fundamentals of our business and our ability to identify

opportunities to deliver long-term returns for the benefit of

all our stakeholders.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to express my gratitude to our clients,

intermediaries and shareholders for the continued support

and trust that they place in our business. I would also like

to thank my fellow Board members and all NAM employees

for their ongoing contribution and continued dedication to

ensuring the success of our business.
