letter from the Audit and Risk

Committee of the General Partner on the execution of its duties as

the General Partner under the Partnership Agreement and including

those arising from the Audit and Risk Committee charter of the General

Partner, as well as other reporting matters requested by the Audit and

Risk Committee of the Company.

CODES, REGULATIONS AND COMPLIANCE

The Board retains the accountability and responsibility for overall

corporate governance. Management is accountable to the Board

for designing, implementing and monitoring corporate governance

processes, integrating these activities of the Company, and providing

the Board with sufficient information to assess the level of compliance.

Although authority and responsibility can be delegated, the delegator

remains ultimately accountable, provided that adequate controls and

report-back procedures are in place. The Company complied with various

codes and regulations such as the Companies Act, the Protection of

Personal Information Act, the JSE Listings Requirements and King IV.

PENALTIES, SANCTIONS OR FINES

During the year under review, no fines were levied for non-compliance with

statutory and regulatory requirements and there were no censures. The

Company was not party to any legal action for uncompetitive behaviour,

and no requests were received or denied for information in terms of the

Promotion of Access to Information Act.

MONITOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT

The risk of non-compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements

forms part of the identified risks and is assessed and responded to on an

ongoing basis. During the year, a compliance monitoring tool was put in

place to manage compliance and integrity risks that may flow from our

portfolio assets. Hence, the focus is only on critical legislation, regulations,

and codes of conduct that may result in a significant financial, reputational

and strategic risk to the Company.
