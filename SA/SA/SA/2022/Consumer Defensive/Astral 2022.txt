letter, ITAC once again found that poultry is

being dumped into the South African Customs Union (SACU)

poultry industry, and that evidence of material harm to the

industry can be demonstrated. ITAC in their latest findings

recommended to the Minister of the Department of Trade Industry

and Competition (the DTIC) that it would be appropriate to

implement anti-dumping duties against the mentioned countries.

However, the Minister of the DTIC chose to suspend the

implementation of the anti-dumping duties against the

aforementioned countries for a period of 12 months from his

announcement in August 2022.

Poultry producers feel strongly that the Minister’s announcement

flies against the spirit of the Masterplan, which specifically listed

tariff measures as an important pillar to put a stop to dumping. As

such, the decision calls into question the trust that was invested in

the Masterplan process, as the latest decision seems to demonstrate

that dumping is “okay”, even if for only a period of 12 months. The

decision will not assist South Africa’s efforts towards localisation,

job creation, transformation, investment or developing the rural

economy. In fact, it may actively cause harm and will certainly

disrupt industry investment plans for the foreseeable future.

The local economy remains under severe pressure, and with

escalating energy costs and Eskom load shedding adding to the woes

of the consumer, the country will need to see a major stimulus if jobs

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT (CONTINUED)

Astral’s Other Africa operations reported a good improvement in

earnings year-on-year, with a good performance reported from the

Zambian operations.

During 2021 Astral reported that the National Chicks Swaziland

operation was held for sale, as Astral had agreed to sell its 67%

interest to its joint venture partner in the business. In addition,

Astral received a firm offer which was accepted for the purchase of

the assets held within the Mozambican operations. The transactions

surrounding these matters were closed during the year under

review.

For further details on the financial performance of the Group and a

review of the operational activities, please refer to the Operational

Review found on

pages 50 to 60 as well as the Chief Financial

Officer’s Report on pages 112 to 114 of the Integrated Report.

Key investments

Capital expenditure for the year under review was R258 million

compared to the prior year’s R260 million. This amount represents

expenditure on normal ongoing and major replacement, and

includes R21 million towards the replacement of a broiler breeder

site at County Fair in the Western Cape, R27 million on a new value-

added production line at Festive in Gauteng, and R37 million

towards the expansion of broiler breeding capacity at Festive.

Key challenges going forward

Industry

The past two years has seen an expansion of poultry processing

capacity in the local industry, with projects now completed and

some in the making. This is a positive step forward for the industry

and a commitment to South Africa’s localisation drive, where under

the Poultry Sector Masterplan (Masterplan) all stakeholders agreed

to a number of actions that would support local production of

chicken so that it could make up a greater proportion of local

consumption. However, for such a plan to succeed certain measures

Dear shareholders

I have pleasure in presenting to you the 2022 Social and Ethics Committee Report. This committee was established in terms of

section 72 of the Companies Act and is a sub-committee of the Board. It fulfils its functions on behalf of the Group in relation to

social and economic development, governance, ethics, safety and health, environmental sustainability and employment matters.

South Africa continues to deal with widely reported ethics and socio-economic challenges in terms of governance, fraud, corruption

and environmental sustainability. The committee has thus sustained its efforts to ensure the Astral culture, value and belief system

subscribe to the Six Capitals model (Financial, Manufactured, Human, Social, Natural and Intellectual Capitals), which forms the

basis of our approach to responsible and accountable governance and sustained socio-economic investment.

This year, we assessed our potential impact in terms of the 17 UN SDGs and have narrowed our focus in terms of only including

those UN SDGs that we believe are relevant to the Group. References to the Six Capitals and to the relevant UN SDGs are used

throughout the Integrated Report for ease of reference.

The committee is satisfied that it has fulfilled its responsibilities as detailed in its Mandate and Terms of Reference for the 2022

financial year.

I would like to thank the members of the committee for their hard work, commitment and contribution towards achieving our

objectives as mandated by the Board.

ESG REPORT:

letter and spirit of the

Code of Ethics by observing the highest ethical standards and

ensuring that all business practices are conducted ethically.

A policy provides guidelines as to what constitutes fraud, theft,

corruption, or associated internal irregularities, to outline our

response to these and to detail the procedures to be followed in

order to report such incidents that are suspected or discovered.

Astral has a “zero tolerance” approach towards fraud and corruption

and protect employees who raise concerns relating to fraud and

corruption from victimisation.

Astral continues to use the services of Deloitte to provide an

independent “Tip-offs anonymous” hotline. All incidents reported

are investigated and appropriate action taken in terms of the

relevant policies and disciplinary procedures.

Copies of Astral’s Ethics Policy are displayed on all notice boards,

laminated abridged copies are handed to every employee and the

COO of each business unit is tasked to act as champion for his/her

business unit to ensure that the Ethics Policy is understood and

adhered to by all employees. The Ethics Policy forms a permanent

part of every management agenda and external suppliers are

required to adhere to the Ethics Policy. Any non-adherence is

reported to business unit management and in turn reported to the

CEO and Group COO and ultimately to the Board.

The Code of Ethics deals with:

 complying with all laws, regulations and codes;

 culture, ethics and values;

 dealing openly and honestly with customers, suppliers and other

stakeholders;

 respecting and protecting privacy and confidentiality;

 respecting human rights and dignity of employees;

 social responsibility;

 guidelines in respect of receiving and giving gifts and

entertainment;

 prohibiting the acceptance of bribes, directly or indirectly;

 prohibiting the payment or offering of bribes;

 integrity of financial information;

 protection of confidential information;

 protection and use of Group property;

 conflict of interest; and

 action on contravention of the Code of Ethics.

In terms of accountability, all employees are required to:

 commit to individual conduct in accordance with the Code of

Ethics;

 observe both the spirit and the: letter of the law in their dealings

on the Group’s behalf;

 recognise the Group’s responsibility to its shareholders,

customers, employees, suppliers and to society;

 conduct themselves as responsible members of society, giving

due regard to health, safety and environmental concerns, and

human rights, in the operation of the Group’s business; and

 report any suspected breach of the law or the Code of Ethics to

the Internal Audit Department or the Board who will protect

those who report violations in good faith.

The Board accepts overall responsibility for the adherence to the

Code of Ethics and has no reason to believe that there has been

any material non-adherence to the Code of Ethics during the year

under review. The Code of Ethics is reviewed on a regular basis by

the Social and Ethics Committee.

A copy of the Code of Ethics is available on our website,

www.astralfoods.com.

Dear shareholders

On behalf of the Human Resources, Remuneration and Nominations Committee and the Board, I take pleasure in presenting the

2022 committee report.

During the 2022 financial year, the poultry industry was challenged by record high poultry feed input cost, continued pressure on

poultry margins and subdued consumer spending. Record levels of unemployment, load shedding, high energy and fuel prices,

disconcerting trends such as poor service delivery and ineffective government policies continue to subdue investments.

Effective and efficient Human Capital optimisation receives the highest priority from the committee. Skills attraction, development

and retention to manage the magnitude of the daily risks within a niche business successfully, are key to Astral’s success. The

importance of our human resources, market-related remuneration and succession strategies cannot be emphasised enough.

The committee focuses on formulating a strategic human resources policy framework that aligns adequate skill availability and

financial performance with shareholder returns. This is done within a transparent, fair and comprehensive corporate governance

framework informed by applied corporate governance and ESG material topics.

The committee continuously reviews, analyses and benchmarks its policies against market practice and peer competitors. Human

Capital management, the remuneration policy, remuneration implementation governance and the Nominations Committee’s

decisions are aligned with business strategy.

This report deals with the functional sections of the committees’ responsibilities and provides an overview of 2022 activities

against its annual work plan. The goal is to align shareholder interest and sustainability through enabled human resources

strategies. The committee considered the overall risk environment, the risk appetite and risk profile of the Group against the

capability to attract, retain and motivate key talent. Human Capital within Astral is a competitive advantage and delivers on

performance objectives within a fair, responsible and best-in-class framework.

During the year, the committee received guidance from external advisors regarding the remuneration of Executive Directors,

prescribed officers and fees payable to Non-Executive Directors. The committee always remains committed to Astral’s values of

transparency, integrity, accountability, sustainability and governance compliance. The Nominations Committee recommended to

the Board the formation of an ESG Committee. The subsequent approval and appointment of the ESG Committee underpins the

Board’s commitment to sustained shareholder value.

I would like to thank the members of the committee for their hard work, commitment and contributions to achieve our objectives

for the year.

A sincere thank you to Astral’s Board, executives, management and employees who worked tirelessly during difficult and

unprecedented times to safeguard and protect shareholder investments and delivering excellent and industry leading results for

the year.

The Astral team has gone above and beyond their call of duty and the committee applauds their hard work, dedication and

commitment.

3.3.4.2 Long-Term Retention Plan (LRP)

This is a deferred cash scheme introduced as an alternative to share options. It aims to attract and retain critical skills

whilst aligning the performance of executive and senior management with shareholder interest.

The participants within the LRP scheme are limited to members of executive management and senior management

and all participants are subjected to 100% performance conditions with no guaranteed portion.

The continued use of the LRP scheme is reviewed by the committee based on its sustained reward philosophy.

The LRP allocations are made annually during October and are approved by the committee. Financial and non-

financial performance targets for the specific 36-month period are determined at the time of the allocation. The LRP

allocation vests over the 36-month period, subject to performance targets achieved.

Performance targets are reviewed annually and approved by the committee. Performance targets and LRP allocations

are set for the three-year period and do not change.
