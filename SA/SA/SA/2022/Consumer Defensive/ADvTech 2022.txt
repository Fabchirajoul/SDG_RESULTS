GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR

In 2022, ADvTECH students were able to return

to full-time in-person classroom learning,

following the lifting of COVID-19 lockdown

restrictions. The group will continue to

monitor the developments with regards to

COVID-19 and will implement the necessary

actions should the situation change.

We continue to experience the economic impacts

caused by the pandemic and various other local and

international events. The macro environment is

characterised by high inflation and interest rates,

supply chain delays, increased sovereign debt risk, the

additional continuing and increasing costs associated

with load shedding and low and/or shrinking GDP

growth forecasts. These forces resulted in the South

African economy contracting 1.3% in Q4 2022, against

market expectations of a contraction of 0.4%, according

to a median Bloomberg forecast by economists. This

contraction has pulled South Africa’s GDP back to

below pre-pandemic levels.

The Q4 2022 GDP numbers highlight the fact that the

South African economy cannot grow if rolling blackouts

are maintained at current levels. The perpetual rolling

blackouts which have occurred in the first quarter of

2023 will, in all likelihood, result in the South African

economy entering a recession, which is defined as two

straight quarters of contracting GDP. While the direct

impact of rolling blackouts is not as significant to

ADvTECH’s operations, as has been experienced by

other industries, the economic impact on consumers

has the potential to adversely impact our business and

has been identified as the top risk to which our group

is exposed.

Chris Boulle

During these trying times, we at ADvTECH remain

committed to academic excellence and our

singular focus on delivering value to our

customers.

In August 2022, we welcomed the release of the

draft policy on the recognition of higher education

institutional types by the Department of Higher

Education and Training (DHET). However,

considering the substance of the criteria and the

likely timeframe implied, ratification of an

institution could take a decade or more, which

would continue to severely prejudice private

institutions, despite them already being accredited

against the same criteria as public universities. This

creates a disadvantage to private institutions as

the university status has up until now been

preserved for the public institutions only. The

group believes that the right of prospective

students to choose a higher education institution

that is right for them, without being influenced by

perceptions around naming conventions, should

be one of the driving forces behind the DHET

fast-tracking the recognition of private institutions

as universities. We will continue to engage with

the DHET until the desired result is achieved.

In the rest of Africa, ADvTECH continues to make

good progress in Botswana and Kenya, with our

three schools’ brands, Gaborone International

Schools in Botswana and Makini Schools and

Crawford International School in Kenya. As leaders

in teaching and learning on the African continent,

together with our ability to embed technology for

education and leveraging scale to deliver value,

the group is well positioned to meet the

educational demands presented by further

expanding into other African markets.

Gaborone International School is currently

undergoing an expansion project to accommodate

the growth we are seeing at the school with phase

one completed in December 2022, which

comprised of the building of a new science and

technology centre, upgrading of sports facilities and

external road infrastructure, and phase two launched

at the end of January 2023 with further upgrades of

the campus. Makini School, our brownfield investment,

has experienced material success since ADvTECH

acquired the school with substantial demand due to

increased urbanisation in Kenya. Similarly, Crawford

International School, our greenfield investment, which

opened its doors in 2018 in Kenya, has seen good

growth since its establishment, with students

completing their studies at the school progressing into

top international universities. The group remains well

positioned to meet the educational demands

presented by various African markets, augmenting our

rest of Africa growth prospects.

SOCIAL INITIATIVES

As Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)

reporting continues to evolve globally, ADvTECH’s

objective is to improve on its ESG reporting journey

through a three-year plan, in order to ensure that we

align with various principles and reporting frameworks.

These include the United Nations Sustainable

Development Goals (UN SDGs) with a particular focus

on education (SDG 4), the Task Force on Climate-

related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and the JSE’s

Sustainability and Climate Disclosure Guidelines, which

was finalised in June 2022 and tailored to the South

African context, while being fully cognisant of global

best practice.

Education is crucial for people to uplift themselves. It is

one of the most important factors for escaping poverty

and enables growth, prosperity and sustainability. At

ADvTECH, we are proud to enrich people’s lives

through education, training and job placement. We

aim to make a meaningful difference to the people we

serve through our innovative approach. We promote

academic excellence as part of our curricula and we

are also passionate about embedding sustainability

LETTER – continued:

Managing Director, Varsity College and IIE MSA

Varsity College Nelson Mandela Bay campus donated

15 whiteboards and four notice boards to Papenkuil

Primary School foundation phase. Their launch

activities coincided with the Mandela week activities

which concluded with a character dress-up read-a-

thon where staff and students dressed up as book

characters to try to make reading fun for the students

and emphasise the importance of literacy. Staff and

students spent the morning reading a book to the

students while portraying the character they were

dressed as, giving them the ultimate reading and

visual experience.

Varsity College Pretoria campus hosted a day of

empowerment with a senior development workshop for the

principal, deputy principal, heads of department and teachers

at Nantes Primary School. The day included the opportunity

to spend the day at the campus with the staff in a very

informative Mathematics and English teaching techniques

workshop. To further focus on the school’s literacy needs, the

campus conducted a literacy needs analysis, followed by

collecting age-appropriate reading books, which was

delivered to the school. Varsity College Pretoria campus is

proud to be in partnership with this school, empowering the

youth for a better future.

Malus and clawback policy

ADvTECH has a malus and clawback policy to align shareholder

interests and the remuneration outcomes of employees. It allows

the group to reduce or recoup the incentive remuneration in

defined circumstances and is applicable to all ADvTECH employees

who participate in the variable incentive remuneration programme.

This policy ensures that excessive or inappropriate risk-taking is

not rewarded and ensures a fair outcome when variable

remuneration is awarded. The policy further contains trigger

events which would result in the implementation of the policy to

reduce or claw back incentive awards in line with the policy.

Some of the trigger events include:

• Where a material misstatement resulted in an adjustment in the

audited consolidated accounts of the company or the audited

accounts of any member of the group; and/or

• Where any information used to determine the quantum of an

incentive remuneration amount was based on an error, or inaccurate

or misleading information; and/or

• Where any action or conduct of a participant which, in the

reasonable opinion of the board, amounts to serious misconduct;

and/or
