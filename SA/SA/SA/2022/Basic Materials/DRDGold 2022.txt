LETTER

“Good corporate governance

is one of the cornerstones of

any good business.”

It is with pleasure that I present

DRDGOLD’s annual remuneration

report for FY2022 on behalf of the

Remuneration Committee and the

Board of Directors.

This report contains two sections. Part

A focuses on remuneration governance

and policy while Part B focuses on the

remuneration of Executive Directors,

Prescribed Officers, Senior management,

and fees paid to Non-executive Directors.

The Company’s Remuneration Policy

continued to drive positive outcomes and

guided the Executive Directors, Prescribed

Officers and Senior management in their

efforts to achieve stellar results and deliver

on DRDGOLD’s strategic objectives in the

year under review.

The Company met most of its performance

metrics during the year under review,

emphasizing the value of aligning

remuneration strategy with both individual

and Company performance.

During the year under review:

• The Remuneration Policy and

Implementation Report were tabled

for non-binding advisory votes and the

Directors' fees were tabled as a special

resolution at the Annual General Meeting

(AGM) held on 30 November 2021 and

approved. The results were as follows:

• Endorsement of the Remuneration

Policy: Votes in favour – 98.76%

• Endorsement of the Implementation

Report: Votes in favour – 99.02%

• Approval of Non-executive Directors’

remuneration: Votes in favour – 94.45%

• The Remuneration Committee resolved

to benchmark all three components

guaranteed remuneration, short-term

incentives (STI) and long-term incentives

(LTI) of the remuneration of the Executive

Directors as well as that of the Chief

Operating Officer against peers and

the market. Deloitte was mandated to

perform this function and submitted its

findings to the Remuneration Committee

in October 2021. Of specific interest to

the Remuneration Committee was how

environmental, social and governance

considerations are currently reflected

in the remuneration of our Executive

Directors, how this impacts behaviour

and whether or not this aspect should

be incorporated more explicitly in the

remuneration of our Executives. The

Remuneration Committee is currently

engaged in a number of work streams

emanating from the Deloitte report.

Any changes will be communicated to

shareholders at the appropriate time.

GOOD GOVERNANCE

The Remuneration Committee notes

increased recommendations of the

disclosure of pay parity ratios to enhance

transparency and assess the fairness of our

remuneration policy and its ability to address

inequalities, particularly on gender and

race. We engaged the services of Deloitte to

assist us in compiling the pay parity ratios in

terms of the newly issued JSE Sustainability

Disclosure Guide. Results will be tabled and

considered at the upcoming Remuneration

Committee meetings. We will endeavour

to disclose these in the FY2023 Annual

Integrated Report.

In the next financial year, the Remuneration

Committee will also focus on reviewing the

current short-term and long-term incentive

schemes, with the assistance of independent

consultants, Bowmans. More detail will be

disclosed in our report in FY2023.

Lastly, I would like to confirm that your

Remuneration Committee acknowledges

the value that is added to the business

through the application of fair remuneration

strategies and remains absolutely committed

to upholding good corporate governance

and remuneration best practice, in line

with the guidelines provided by the King

Committee on Corporate Governance.
