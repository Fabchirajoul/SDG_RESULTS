letter, it leads to undesirable consequences

for female employees who are nursing. The policy was written with city dwellers in mind who

are fairly close to their babies for routine breastfeeding,” explained Achille Dakouo, Deputy

HR Manager for the Fekola Mine.

After a period of consultation, the Collective and Fekola management developed a Supplementary

Maternity Leave Policy which takes the special circumstances of new Fekola mothers into

consideration. Fatimata summarized the policy: “The government statutory leave is only 14

weeks. At B2Gold, female employees can now apply for a three- to six-month extension on

these 14 weeks with a 50% salary, which can be extended for an additional three months with

a 30% salary. Should an employee not apply for any supplementary maternity leave in addition

to the statutory 14 weeks, she earns her full salary upon return to work plus an additional

30% to compensate for breastfeeding time.”

After successful implementation in November 2022, a total of 216 female employees had

already benefited from the Supplementary Maternity Leave Policy through the end of 2022,

with 26 applying for supplementary leave. While still relatively new, the Collective has helped

the Fekola Mine achieve significant change and improvement in its maternity policies, leading

to greater employment security and professional opportunity for women. These changes will

lead to increased female representation and participation in our workforce, making B2Gold

a more diverse and stronger Company.
