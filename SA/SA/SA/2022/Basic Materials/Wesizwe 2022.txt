Social responsibility programmes

Our social responsibility programmes fall outside of our SLPs

and are in line with our commitment to being a responsible

corporate citizen, which is essential to our commitment to

fostering positive relationships with our stakeholders. These

initiatives are delivered through our CSI programme in

collaboration with our major contractors and include:

• Local economic development projects

• Support for various non-governmental organisations (NGOs)

in celebrating significant calendar dates in South Africa

• Promoting the welfare of communities

In addition, we received 12 sponsorship requests in 2022, of

which we contributed to seven of them.
