chairman's report for

further details.

Our diversified portfolio of

commodities again benefited the

group in a year characterised by

volatile commodity prices. As

illustrated below, this diversification

positions ARM well as we continue

to focus on operating a world-class

business in a challenging sector.

In summary:

• ARM Ferrous headline earnings

decreased by 16% to R6.7 billion

(F2021: R7.9 billion) mainly on

lower iron ore prices

• ARM Platinum headline earnings

declined 34% to R3.1 billion

(F2021: R4.7 billion), largely due

to negative mark-to-market

adjustments (discussed further

on page 45 of this report)

• Higher export coal prices drove a

R1.2 billion increase in ARM Coal

headline earnings to R928 million

(F2021: R250 million headline

loss). Divisional loans owing to

Glencore Operations South Africa

(GOSA) were fully settled after the

rally in thermal coal prices

generated positive cash flows.

Looking ahead to F2023

Increasing global debt levels, a

recovery in global supply chains

after pandemic-related disruptions,

intermittent Covid-19 lockdowns in

China, rising global inflation, and a

dislocation in energy markets

following geopolitical turbulence

from the conflict between Russia

and Ukraine have all contributed to

heightened levels of uncertainty in

commodity and capital markets over

the past year.

In addition, accelerated tightening

of interest rates in developed markets

and recession risks in the US and

Europe have compounded volatility.

After starting F2022 at over

US$200 per tonne, iron ore prices fell

to below US$100 in December 2021.

Prices recovered in the last quarter

of the financial year under review,

before declining subsequent to year

end. The iron ore market is expected

to be largely balanced for calendar

year 2022, which supports current

price stability.
