Employee benefits

Employees, including senior management and executive directors, participate in a share-based remuneration scheme. The

scheme is equity settled. All shares allocated to the share option scheme are to be exercised during a five-year option period

in five tranches. Should the option holder resign from the company prior to the option maturity date, the shares will not be

issued. Payment of the strike price will therefore not be required, and options will be cancelled.
