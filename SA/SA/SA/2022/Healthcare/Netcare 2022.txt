The performance multiplier ranges from zero if none of the threshold levels are achieved to 100% for on-target

performance and up to 150% for outperformance:

• Below threshold – 0%

• Threshold – 50%

• On-target – 100%

• Outperform – 150%

Linear interpolation is applied for performance between threshold and target, and target and outperform.

The annual value of the performance multiplier is determined based on Group and functional scorecards. This

ensures that the scorecards for different roles drive the performance of the relevant entity/division/function

while retaining a minimum level of exposure to Group outcomes for all participants to avoid ‘silo’ behaviour.

CEO

Group BSC 100%

CFO

Group BSC 80% and divisional BSC 20%

Executives (F Band)

Group BSC 60% and divisional BSC 40%

A score of 60% is required on the BSC at divisional and/or personal and business unit levels to qualify for an

incentive.

Our value story

89

N E T C A R E L I M I T E D Integrated Report 2022:

letter of support from the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health to train 100 students on

formal nursing programmes. SANC will accredit the programme to commence training in 2023.

• 20 nursing students successfully completed the academic development bridging course, preparing

them for enrolment as registered nurses at Netcare Education (SDP2021: 120).

• Pleasingly, the number of women participating in our emergency medical care programmes has

increased as we attempt to redress the stereotypes associated in this male-dominated sector.

Management

and leadership

development

• 77 talented individuals who have the potential to progress to executive level are enrolled in the

Netcare leadership development journey. Participants are receiving greater exposure to the

Executive Committee and the Board. 16 executives and senior leaders have started an executive

coaching initiative. Four Leading the Netcare Way programmes for executives, unit managers and

nursing managers commenced early in SDP2022.

• The assessments of the management development programme participants in the SDP2020 and

SDP2021 cohorts were completed, with a 100% pass rate across all programmes. The throughput rate

for the 2020 programme was 58% improving to 78% for 2021; still below pre-COVID levels with the

higher turnover of nurses being a factor.

• Ten senior managers from across the Group embarked on Stanford University’s Applied Compassion

Training programme.

• Bursaries were provided to 41 employees and students of medical physics, radiotherapy and

radiography; aligned with scarce and critical skills needed within the Group (funded by the HWSETA1).

Internships and

other courses

• A 12-month clinical engineering capacity building project is being piloted in Gauteng.

• 7 005 employees attended CPD courses (SDP2021: 5 985).
