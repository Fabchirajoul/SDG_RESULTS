OUR CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS

Almost all the sales are into the private market in South Africa, as the division

does not sell anything into the public sector and very little of the product gets

exported. The division operates across all LSMs and recorded an average selling

price per unit of R36.52 (2021: R33.90).

The brands in the division are sold to customers across most channels,

including, but not restricted to:

• pharmacy (corporate pharmacy, pharmaceutical wholesale and independent

pharmacy)

• retail stores (comprise most of the large retailers as well as forecourts)

• wholesale (includes corporate as well as independent Cash and Carry)

• many speciality stores.:

THE DIVISION’S OPERATING MODEL

OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

The Adcock Ingram Over the Counter (AI OTC)

division manufactures, markets, and sells medication

with a focus on brands sold predominantly in retail

pharmacy, where the consumer investigates self-

treatment options and the pharmacist plays a role

in the product choice. Pharmacist-initiated therapy

is therefore the main driver of product use in the

schedule 1 (S1) and schedule 2 (S2) space. This

satisfies the growing need for primary healthcare in

South Africa.
