letter and spirit of the law and

regulations governing its conduct by ensuring the

organisation acts with due skill and diligence

Conducting its business in adherence to statutory,

supervisory and regulatory requirements

While Exxaro drives compliance with relevant regulatory

requirements in its jurisdictions, the law serves as a minimum

standard of conduct. Beyond complying with the law, Exxaro

promotes a compliance culture at all levels.

The group’s compliance philosophy is captured in a compliance

policy, which supports ethical and responsible corporate

citizenship, and seeks to create sustainable value for all

stakeholders by striving for operational efficiency, growth and

regulatory compliance with applicable laws.

The regulatory environment in which the group operates is

regularly revisited by management to identify material legislation

and to categorise each using a risk-based approach.

Key focus areas of the 2022 annual compliance plan included:

• Closing out of the POPIA implementation project with an

internal audit to ensure compliance

• Updating regulatory compliance content available to business

as well as the compliance calendar

Notwithstanding the regulatory jurisdiction of the business,

Exxaro has a compliance function that reports to the chief risk

officer. The group governance framework confirms the role of the

chief risk officer with respect to regulatory compliance in that

the person has oversight over group compliance management

to monitor regulatory compliance and ensure consolidated

compliance reporting.

Exxaro’s board is responsible for ensuring that the company and

its employees comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and

consider non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements

a key risk. Accordingly, the board has delegated the responsibility

for managing Exxaro’s compliance risks to the RBR committee.

The board’s RBR committee is responsible for:

• Overseeing regulatory compliance risks, policies and

frameworks

• Monitoring compliance with agreed policies, national and

international protocols and procedures on non-financial aspects

in collaboration with the SERC

• Ensuring compliance is continually monitored and reported by

management, and external and internal audit

Combined assurance model

Exxaro applies a combined assurance model to optimise assurance

by management, as well as internal and external service providers,

while fostering a strong ethical climate and mechanisms to

ensure compliance. Using our board-approved ERM approach,

management identifies key risks facing Exxaro and implements

the necessary internal controls with comparable information for

trend analysis where possible.

The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the use of a

combined assurance model to achieve the following objectives:

• Enabling an effective internal control environment

• Integrity of information used for internal decision making by

management, the board and its committees

• Supporting the integrity of external reports

The board and audit committee found the effectiveness of

controls for the year ended 31 December 2022 as satisfactory.

This was concluded principally through a process of management

self-assessment (including formal confirmation by executive

management), reports from internal audit, independent external

audit and other assurance providers.

Exxaro defines assurance broadly to cover all sources, including

external assurance, internal audit, management oversight

and regulatory inspections. The three lines of defence clearly

delineate the roles of internal stakeholders, ensuring common

procedural understanding when tackling risks.

Our combined assurance model includes and optimises all

assurance services and functions to collectively provide an

effective control environment and support integrity of information

used for internal decision making by management, the board and

its committees, and in our external reports including:

• Corporate governance disclosures in terms of King IV

• Financial statements and other external reports including our

integrated and ESG reports

The forum’s activities and outcomes of assurance reports are

presented quarterly to the audit committee.

Combined assurance report (page 73)

Overdue and repeat findings

A new issue tracking management system was installed and

configured with the business user launch and training in October

2022. This system will capture and track the status of all internal

audits and other assurance providers findings, and all overdue and

repeat findings will be reported at each audit committee meeting.

Independence of audit and assurance functions

To ensure independence of our audit and assurance functions,

the following measures have been put in place:

• Effective for the financial year ended 31 December 2022,

KPMG was appointed as Exxaro’s new independent external

auditor together with its delivery partner, AM PhakaMalele,

approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 25 May 2022

by way of a separate resolution of shareholders in terms of

the JSE Listings Requirements paragraph 3.84(g)

• Change in internal audit service provider: PwC and its service

delivery partner, Ngubane & Co, were appointed as Exxaro’s

internal audit service provider from 1 July 2022

• A framework for engagement of auditors to supply non-audit

services was adopted in 2021 and confirmed that KPMG, in

terms of its policy, is not allowed to perform non-audit services

• Internal audit function is confirmed by our group governance

framework as an independent control function across the group

• Internal audit charter (reviewed in 2022) informs the role and

scope of work of the internal audit function

• Chief audit officer of Exxaro and the internal audit function

report directly to our audit committee and is administratively

overseen by the finance director
