Director's

transfer from Fulu Ravele to Brian Harvey.

I take this opportunity to thank both Brett and

Fulu for their excellent service to the Group and

the Board. Post the reporting period we welcomed

the appointment of Alex Pickard as a Non-

executive Director representing Ivanhoe Mines

Limited on our Board.

The success of our policies and approach is,

I believe, well reflected in the growth of the

Group and its transition from explorer to being

on the verge of material production of valuable

commodities.

Chairman’s

report:

Managing Director, Chief Executive Officer:

Managing Director of ASX listed gold producer

North Flinders Mines, CEO and: Managing Director

of Oil and gas producers Beach Petroleum and

Claremont Petroleum, and

letter, the audit plan and the audit

fees payable to Mazars. The Audit Committee further satisfactorily monitored the External Auditor’s progress

against the approved audit plan and assessed the quality and effectiveness of the external audit function,

including receiving confirmation that there was no scope limitation or restriction of access to management.

Following the statutory audit, the External Auditor’s report provided the Audit Committee with the necessary

assurance on Renergen’s risk management processes, internal control environment and IT systems. It also

provided assurance that no reportable irregularities had been identified and that there are no unresolved

issues that impact the annual financial statements presented.

The Committee has recommended the re-appointment of Mazars as the independent External Auditor and

Mr Shaun Vorster as the designated, JSE approved audit partner for the financial year ending 28 February 2023,

for consideration by shareholders at the AGM to be held on 17 June 2022.

The approved Group audit fee for the year under review is R0.850 million (2021: R0.735 million). A formal

procedure has been adopted to govern the process where the External Auditor may be considered for non-audit

services and the extent of these services is closely monitored by the Audit Committee. Mazars did not provide

non-audit services during the year under review (2021: R21 700). Prior year non-audit services provided by Mazars

comprised IFRS training and providing certificates required by a lender and the BEE auditor of Tetra4.
