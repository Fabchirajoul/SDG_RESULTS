ABOUT BANNERMAN RESOURCES LIMITED

About Bannerman - Bannerman Resources Limited is an ASX and NSX listed exploration and development company

with uranium interests in Namibia, a southern African country which is a premier uranium mining

jurisdiction. Bannerman’s principal asset is its 95%-owned Etango Project situated near the Rössing uranium mine,

Paladin’s Langer Heinrich uranium mine and CGNPC’s Husab uranium mine. A definitive feasibility study and an

optimisation study has confirmed the viability of a large open pit and heap leach operation at one of the world’s largest

undeveloped uranium deposits.

From 2015 to 2017, Bannerman conducted a large scale heap leach demonstration program to provide further

assurance to financing parties, generate process information for the detailed engineering design phase and build and

enhance internal capability.

In August 2020, Bannerman completed a Scoping Study on an 8Mtpa development of Etango (Etango-8 Project). The

Scoping Study has demonstrated that this accelerated, streamlined project is strongly amenable to development –

both technically and economically. A Pre-Feasibility Study on the Etango-8 Project is underway with targeted

completion during 2Q 2021

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

BANNERMAN RESOURCES LIMITED

2020 ANNUAL REPORT

1

Dear Fellow Shareholder

I write during an extraordinary year in which the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound impacts on business and

society around the world.

Fortunately, Bannerman has withstood the challenges so far and, I am proud to say, emerged in a stronger and more

agile position with the completion of the Etango-8 Scoping Study, announced in early August 2020.

Over the past year we undertook a review of various scaling opportunities that might exist for the Etango Project.

The Etango-8 Scoping Study represents the successful culmination of that work. Etango-8 is a reimagined

development of the Etango ore body at an average production rate of 3.5 million pounds U3O8 per annum1. At this

scale we have improved project economics, significantly reduced development hurdles and dramatically lowered

pre-production capital costs whilst decreasing operating costs. Your Board is excited about Etango-8 because it

enables us to get into production sooner with a more manageable scale, whilst still having the option of increasing

our production rate in the future to take advantage of deepening forecasted deficits in the uranium market.

Accordingly, your Board approved the commencement of the Etango-8 Preliminary Feasibility Study, which is

expected to be completed by mid 2021.

Despite a volatile and challenging year for uranium equities, company promotion and various restrictions in Namibia,

we have not had any significant disruptions to our business. We did not allow the many distractions to affect our

safety leadership, with Bannerman now entering its tenth consecutive year without a lost time injury.

Equity markets for junior resources companies were highly volatile in response to early uncertainty regarding COVID-

19. These difficult market conditions were exacerbated by the cancellation of conventional investor relations

platforms, conferences and promotional travel. Whilst many other companies struggled to adapt to this change,

Bannerman benefitted from the virtual marketing foundations implemented over the past two years and your CEO,

Brandon Munro’s significant online profile as an international uranium expert.

The Namibian government acted decisively in response to the COVID-19 threat, implementing lock-downs and other

restrictions. At Etango, we had completed all testwork shortly before restrictions took effect and the remaining

study work was undertaken on a desktop basis. Accordingly, the various restrictions, including international travel

bans, did not affect our business.

Disruption caused by COVID-19 had an acute effect on global uranium supply. Cigar Lake, the world’s largest single

uranium mine, was placed into care and maintenance for six months. Production was also severely affected in

Kazakhstan, the world’s largest uranium production centre, after Kazatomprom suspended well field development

between April and August. Production was also affected to lesser extents at other uranium mines, resulting in

forecast global 2020 uranium production dropping by at least 20 million pounds, doubling the forecast 2020 supply

deficit and placing stress on both producer and customer inventories.

Nonetheless, nuclear fuel demand continues to be strong, with COVID-19 having only minor effects on global nuclear

power output. Although total electricity demand was substantially impacted for periods in certain markets, nuclear

power contributed disproportionately to meeting demand as it was generally preferred for its resilience. Nuclear

power again proved itself as a reliable power source, in this case because nuclear was not subject to the same supply

chain and labour risks that threatened other baseload power alternatives. Accordingly, forecast negative effects in

nuclear power in 2021 are not significant and reactor construction continues in key markets such as China, India and

Russia.

As with last year, Bannerman’s strategy is focused on generating shareholder value through maintaining financial

resilience, enhancing the value of our flagship Etango uranium project in Namibia and positioning the company for

the expected recovery in the uranium price.

1. Bannerman advised of the completion of a Scoping Study for an 8Mtpa development of its flagship Etango Uranium Project in Namibia (Etango-8

Project) in an ASX announcement 5 August 2020. Bannerman is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information

included in this ASX release, and Bannerman confirms that, to the best of its knowledge, all material assumptions and technical parameters

underpinning the estimates in this release continue to apply and have not materially changed.:

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

BANNERMAN RESOURCES LIMITED

2020 ANNUAL REPORT

2

As a result of our financial discipline we have, again, operated throughout the year without an equity raising and

maintained a healthy cash balance of $4.17m at 30 June 2020 (compared with $6.27m at 30 June 2019). We have

achieved this modest burn rate despite substantial investment in the Etango-8 Scoping Study and the cost of related

work at our Heap Leach Demonstration Plant. This was, in part, due to the willingness of your Board and

management to volunteer pay cuts during the last quarter of the year as a response to the uncertainty and volatility

arising from COVID-19.

Bannerman remains exceptionally well positioned within the uranium industry, as fuel buyers come to understand

the extent of supply depletion and widening deficits that will characterise this industry from 2025. Etango-8 offers

the potential to be in production by 2025, with the option of scaling up production as forecast deficits widen beyond

20282.

Etango is fortunate to be located in Namibia, which offers significantly lower political, logistical and social hurdles to

development. Further, Namibian uranium production offers several distinct advantages, including the ability to

market across all geopolitical blocks. Our in-country presence since 2006, consistent leadership in corporate social

responsibility and support of our various stakeholders has allowed us to fully embrace such advantages, including

community and government support for Etango. Over many years, we have demonstrated outstanding

environmental, social and governance credentials that are consistent with best practice ESG principles.

After a year in which Bannerman successfully responded to acute challenges, I would like to thank the Bannerman

team in Namibia and Australia for their dedication and effectiveness. I also wish to thank all Bannerman

stakeholders, including the Namibian government, our host community and the One Economy Foundation (which

holds a 5% ownership of the Etango Project) for their support during this period.

Yours sincerely,

Ronnie Beevor

Chairman
