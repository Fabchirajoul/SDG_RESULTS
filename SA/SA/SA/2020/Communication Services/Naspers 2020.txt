Record date, attendance and

voting

The record date for the meeting

(being the date used to determine

which shareholders are entitled to

participate in and vote at the meeting)

is Friday, 14 August 2020.

Votes at the annual general meeting

will be taken by way of a poll and not

on a show of hands.

A shareholder entitled to attend and

vote at the meeting is entitled to

appoint a proxy to attend, participate

in and vote at the meeting in their

place. A proxy need not be a

shareholder of the company.

Before any person may attend or

participate in a shareholders’

meeting, they must present reasonably

satisfactory identification and the

person presiding at the meeting must

be reasonably satisfied that the right

of that person to participate and vote,

either as a shareholder or as proxy for

a shareholder, has been reasonably

verified. Forms of identification include

a valid identity document, driver’s

licence and passport.

A form of proxy, which includes the

relevant instructions for its completion,

is attached for the use of holders of

certificated shares and ‘own name’

dematerialised shareholders who

wish to be represented at the annual

general meeting. Completing a form

of proxy will not preclude that

shareholder from attending and voting

(in preference to their proxy) at the

annual general meeting.

Holders of dematerialised

shares, other than ‘own name’

dematerialised shareholders, who

wish to vote at the annual general

meeting, must instruct their central

securities depository participant

(CSDP) or broker accordingly in the

manner and cut-off time stipulated

by their CSDP or broker.

Holders of dematerialised shares,

other than ‘own name’ dematerialised

shareholders, who wish to attend the

annual general meeting in person

(through electronic communication),

need to arrange the necessary

authorisation as soon as possible

through their CSDP or broker.

A shareholder may appoint a proxy at

any time. For practical purposes, the

form appointing a proxy and the

authority (if any) under which it is

signed, must reach The Meeting

Specialist Proprietary Limited (TMS),

via email to proxy@tmsmeetings.co.za

or the transfer secretaries of the

company (Link Market Services South

Africa Proprietary Limited, 13th Floor,

19 Ameshoff Street, Braamfontein 2001

or PO Box 10462, Johannesburg 2000)

by no later than 14:00 (SAST) on

Wednesday 19 August 2020 to allow

time to process the proxy. Should you

hold Naspers A ordinary shares, the

signed proxy must reach the

registered office of the company by

14:00 (SAST) on Wednesday 19 August

2020 to allow for processing. A form of

proxy is enclosed with this notice. The

form of proxy may also be obtained

from the registered office of the

company or on the company website

as a separate pdf download in the

2020 integrated annual report

available under the investors section.

All other proxies must be provided to

the company secretary before the

proxy exercises any rights of the

shareholder at the meeting.
