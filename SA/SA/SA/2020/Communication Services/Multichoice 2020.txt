LETTER FROM THE PHUTHUMA NATHI CHAIR

Welcome

On behalf of the Phuthuma Nathi board of directors,

it is my pleasure to present our report to the

shareholders of the Phuthuma Nathi share scheme.

As shareholders, you are at the forefront of real

transformation in South Africa. Phuthuma Nathi

owns 25% of MultiChoice SA through this share

scheme. The broad nature of our shareholder base

is one of great pride to me, and highlights

MultiChoice SA’s commitment to meaningful

broad-based empowerment. It has been 14 years

since its launch, and Phuthuma Nathi now has

81 479 black shareholders as at year-end,

comprising individuals, stokvels and black-owned

companies. Importantly, your investment in

Phuthuma Nathi continues to deliver value, with

approximately ZAR11.9bn in dividends paid

since inception.

You will notice we have structured our report

differently this year. Our goal is to help existing and

new shareholders better understand their investment

in Phuthuma Nathi, as well as the performance of

the underlying investment – MultiChoice SA. We

added sections to explain key terms, and highlighted

important information regarding MultiChoice SA’s

performance and governance.

We trust this new reporting format helps you make

better, informed decisions.

We welcome your feedback and input on these

changes and on how we can improve our reporting

in the future. Please share your feedback with us at

cosec@multichoice.co.za.

The year in review

Despite challenges, the 2020 financial year was

eventful for Phuthuma Nathi. From a share scheme

perspective, shareholders were offered the

opportunity to exchange some of their Phuthuma

Nathi shares for MultiChoice Group shares, which

are listed on the JSE, and give shareholders

exposure to the MultiChoice Group’s strategic

growth plans in Africa and its technology

business, Irdeto.

Following many roadshows and engagements with

our shareholders, it was pleasing to see them make

informed decisions regarding which investment

option best suited their needs. It is also worth noting

that following the implementation of the scheme

arrangement, Phuthuma Nathi acquired 100% of the

share capital of Phuthuma Nathi 2 from the

Phuthuma Nathi 2 shareholders. As a result,

Phuthuma Nathi 2 became a wholly owned

subsidiary of Phuthuma Nathi. This means there is

only one listed share scheme on the Equity Express

Securities Exchange (EESE), making trading in

Phuthuma Nathi shares simpler.
