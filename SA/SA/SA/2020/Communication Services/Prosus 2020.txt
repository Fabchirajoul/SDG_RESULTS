Prosus annual report 2020:

letter

Dear Madam/Sir

I am pleased to enclose the notice

of the annual general meeting of

Prosus N.V. (the company or Prosus),

which will be held at 14:00 (Central

European time) on Tuesday 18 August

2020. Formally, the meeting will

be held at ABN AMRO, Gustav

Mahlerlaan 10, 1082 PP Amsterdam,

the Netherlands.

In accordance with the Temporary

Act Covid-19 Justice and Safety,

shareholders can only attend the

meeting virtually via the internet at

www.abnamro.com/evoting and if

they wish, vote in real time online.

The meeting can also be followed

on the Prosus website

www.prosus.com/investors.

At the annual general meeting, our

chief executive, Bob van Dijk, will

update you on the progress of the

business in FY20. Subsequently,

introductions will be given on other

items on the agenda. Following these

presentations, we will have a full Q&A

session on all matters tabled before

we conduct the formal business of the

meeting (the voting on all tabled

voting items).

In accordance with the board rotation

plan, Don Eriksson, Mark Sorour, Emilie

Choi, Manisha Girotra and Rachel

Jafta are offering themselves for

re-election.

The end of FY20 marked the retirement

of Fred Phaswana as a director and

lead independent director of Prosus

(and Naspers). I would like to thank

Fred again on behalf of the board for

his contribution to the Naspers and

Prosus groups. Fred has been a

director in the Naspers group for over

15 years and played a key role in

transforming Naspers, and

subsequently Prosus, into one of the

top 10 global consumer internet

companies by market capitalisation.

As announced on 29 April 2020, the

board decided to nominate Ms Ying Xu

for appointment as a non-executive

director of Prosus.

Full explanations of all proposed

resolutions are set out in the explanatory

notes to this notice. The board believes

that all the proposals to be put to you

at the annual general meeting are in

the best interests of Prosus and all

shareholders. Accordingly, the

directors unanimously recommend that

you vote in favour of the resolutions, as

they intend to do themselves in

respect of their own shares.

The annual general meeting is an

important opportunity for all

shareholders to express their views by

asking questions on the above matters

and on any other topic relevant to our

business and the resolutions.

If you would like to be assured of the

fullest possible response to a question

asked in the annual general meeting,

it would be helpful if you could submit

your questions in advance of the

annual general meeting but ultimately

on 15 August 2020, at 14:00 CET.

Further questions may be posed

during the meeting by those

shareholders who submitted questions

timeously in advance. Of course, you

are also invited to write to me at any

time should you wish at

investorrelations@prosus.com.

Alternatively, you may ﬁnd the answer

to your question on our website at

www.prosus.com.

Enclosed with this: letter you will ﬁnd

the notice of the annual general

meeting being convened, together

with the agenda and the explanatory

notes. A voting instruction form has

been sent to those of you who are

registered in Prosus’s register of

shareholders. Our FY20 year-end

documents are available on our

website at www.prosus.com/

investors.

If you would like to electronically grant

a proxy with voting instructions to

Joyce Leemrijse, civil law notary with

Allen & Overy LLP in Amsterdam, you

will have to do so no later than 17:30

(CET) on Tuesday 11 August 2020.

Please refer to the information

provided on page 236 of the notice.

All your votes are important to us and

I would urge you to cast your vote.

You may also cast your own vote

electronically in real time during the

virtual annual general meeting. The

requirements are set out in the notice.

The results of the annual general

meeting will be announced in the

meeting, and subsequently via a press

release and on the Prosus website

www.prosus.com/news as soon as

possible following the conclusion of the

meeting.

The meeting will be broadcast on the

Prosus website www.prosus.com.

I look forward to engaging with you

virtually on 18 August 2020.

In accordance with the Dutch

Corporate Governance Code, the

draft report of the annual general

meeting will be made available to

shareholders on www.prosus.com

no later than three months after the
