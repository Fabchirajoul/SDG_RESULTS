letter of intent or at all.

The acquisition, financing, construction and development of new projects involves numerous risks, including:

•

difficulties in identifying, obtaining and permitting suitable sites for new projects;

•

failure to obtain all necessary rights to land access and use;

•

assumptions with respect to the cost and schedule for completing construction;

•

assumptions with respect to the biogas potential, including quality, volume, and asset life, for new projects;

•

the ability to obtain financing for a project on acceptable terms or at all;

•

delays in deliveries or increases in the prices of equipment;

•

permitting and other regulatory issues, license revocation and changes in legal requirements;

•

increases in the cost of labor, labor disputes and work stoppages;

•

failure to receive quality and timely performance of third-party services;

•

unforeseen engineering and environmental problems;

•

cost overruns;

•

accidents involving personal injury or the loss of life; and

•

weather conditions, global health crises such as COVID-19, catastrophic events, including fires, explosions, earthquakes, droughts and acts

of terrorism, and other force majeure events.

In addition, new projects have no operating history and may employ recently developed technology and equipment. A new project may be unable

to fund principal and interest payments under its debt service obligations or may operate at a loss, which may adversely affect our business, financial

condition or results of operations.

We may also experience delays and cost overruns in converting existing facilities from Renewable Electricity to RNG production. During the

conversation projects, there is a gap in production and relating revenue while the electricity project is offline until it commences operation as an RNG

facility, which adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations.

In order to secure contracts for new projects, we typically face a long and variable development cycle that requires significant resource commitments

and a long lead time before we realize revenues.

The development, design and construction process for our renewable energy projects generally lasts from 12 to 24 months, on average. We

frequently receive requests for proposals from potential site hosts as part of their consideration of alternatives for their proposed projects. Prior to

responding to an RFP, we typically conduct a preliminary audit of the site host’s needs and assess whether the site is commercially viable based on our
