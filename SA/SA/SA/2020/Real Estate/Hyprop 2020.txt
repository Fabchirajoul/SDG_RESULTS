E1.7.2 How

Details of the valuation methodologies used in valuing investment property, as well as the significant unobservable inputs

used, are set out in the table below:

Type

Valuation methodology

Unobservable inputs

Inter-relationship

between unobservable

inputs and fair value

measurement

Investment

properties

– continuing

operations

Discounted cash flow: The valuation

models calculate the present value of

the future net cash flows expected

to be generated by each investment

property. The cash flow projections

include specific estimates for five

years. The expected net cash flows

are discounted using a risk adjusted

discount rate as well as a risk adjusted

cap rate.

• Estimated rentals at the

end of the lease

• Vacancy levels

• Discount rate, and

• Reversionary capitalisation

rate.

The estimated fair value

increases if:

• The estimated rentals

increase

• Vacancy levels decline,

• Discount rates (market

yields) decline or

• Reversionary

capitalisation rates

decline (and vice

versa).

Investment

properties

– held-for-sale

Fair value less costs to sell:

Investment property held-for-sale is

measured at fair value less costs to sell

(FVLCTS) which, in instances where the

property is already sold, but not yet

transferred, is based on the sale price.

• Estimated rentals at the

end of the lease

• Vacancy levels

• Discount rate

• Reversionary capitalisation

rate, and

• Costs to sell.
