Governance:

letter of the law. The lack of water

security has an impact on our fire-

protection measures and managing this is

increasing costs. We can confidently say

that health, safety and hygiene will be an

even greater focus at our properties and

in our business in the year ahead.

Environmental approach

Environmental sustainability is an

important part of our operations, and

our key achievements in the year include

earning the first WELL building rating in

Africa and the first green certification

for an industrial building in Gauteng.

Last year we introduced our 20:20:20:1

strategy and we were confident of our

ability to at least make significant

progress in achieving the target of

20 net-zero buildings, R20m worth

of green lease recoveries, 20MW of

solar energy and the commercial

implementation of at least one

Greenovate Award Innovation. We

have increased the application of the

Greenovate innovation from one project

to two. The goals remain largely the same,

although we have to reassess some

specific projects in the light of the

changed business environment resulting

from RSA’s ailing economy and the

business interruptions caused by the

Covid-19 lockdown. We are also working

on setting realistic timelines to achieve

all our goals.

One commercially

implemented Greenovate

award innovation

Our green building

certification was ongoing

and we gained a greater

understanding of what this

certification entails.

We had three net-zero

certified buildings at the

end of the reporting period

Growthpoint remains

committed to enhancing

our management of this

objective in the coming year.

Carbon-zero buildings have

become our big drive, but

we underestimated the

complexity of our ambitious

target, especially when

balancing it with

commercially viable costs

Collections from the Green

Addendum have contributed

a R26.8m combined saving

for Growthpoint and our

tenants this year

We are reviewing ways to

refresh this aspect of the

business

We were on track to achieve

this goal. However, all capital

expenditure was placed on

hold in the second half of

FY20 including solar

installations

8.3MWh of solar potential

has been approved and will

be installed as soon as the

lockdown restrictions are

lifted. If we get back to

business as usual soon, we

are optimistic that our

overall target will be

achieved in the coming year

One solution from a previous

year’s Greenovate Awards was

successfully implemented at

the new Exxaro head office,

which was completed this year

Our goal has increased to two

projects in FY21 and while this

number is still small, the target

is ambitious in the context of

a very limited number of

development projects.

Integrating these innovations is

however expected to be more

achievable in future because a

new category for buildability is

being introduced to the

Greenovate Awards in 2020
