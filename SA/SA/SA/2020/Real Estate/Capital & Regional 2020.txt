Strategy Review

In 2020, we engaged a sustainability

strategy adviser to complete a review

and materiality analysis of C&R’s ESG

Strategy. The outputs of this review

will inform the development of a new

overarching integrated ESG strategy in

2021, and guide our reporting under the

Task Force on Climate-Related Financial

Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.

We have also partnered with

HDR | Hurley Palmer Flatt (HDR), a leading

independent multidisciplinary engineering

consultancy providing solutions for the

built environment, to assist in developing

our net zero pathway.

Our vision is that our centres are leaders

in sustainable practice, underpinned by

our commitment to net zero operations

and have a positive impact on their

communities. As leaders in sustainable

practice, we will partner with local

authorities, community groups and support

local initiatives for sustainable solutions to

environmental and social issues within our

communities. Our ESG strategy will build

on the following key areas:

 Progress made to date and future

aspirations regarding carbon

reductions;

 Waste and water management;

 Risk management associated with

climate change and the impact of

extreme weather events on our centres;

and

 Defining our short, medium and long-

term targets in line with the scenario

of maintaining a 1.5°C change, in

accordance with the Paris Agreement.

Our ESG strategy will be supported by clear

and measurable targets and will focus on

three pillars: Environmental Sustainability,

People & Community and Governance.

Everything we do is underpinned by

clear policies and procedures, which are

committed to the latest health and safety

standards, and ensure best practice

reporting and disclosure.

We are proud of our achievements in

maintaining a responsible business, striving

to meet the needs of our stakeholders and

being strong stewards of the environment.

However, we recognise there is always

potential for improvement. With much of

our assessment completed in 2020, we

are well poised to engage both internal

and external stakeholders throughout

2021 to chart our future ambitions and

set progressive actions that deliver better

outcomes for all.

The past 12 months have

accelerated stakeholder

expectations regarding

Environmental, Social

and Governance (ESG).

As part of our agenda

to ensure our assets

are fit for the future, we

have renewed our long-

standing commitment

to ESG best practice,

ensuring it continues to

serve our communities

and strengthens our

position, performance and

perspectives.
