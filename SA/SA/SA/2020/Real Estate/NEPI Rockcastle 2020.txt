Chairman's statement

10:

Chairman's statement:

Managing Director of Fortress REIT, a company

he joined in December 2015, following its acquisition of

Capital Property Fund.

As announced on 28 May 2020, Mr. Desmond de Beer

has retired from the Board, together with Mr. Alan Keith

Olivier who acted as his alternate. Mr. de Beer was a non-

Independent non-Executive Director of NEPI from 2008

and the Chairman of its Investment Committee and was

appointed as a non-Independent non-Executive Director of

NEPI Rockcastle on 15 May 2017. The Company values

Mr. de Beer's contribution to NEPI and NEPI Rockcastle.

The Board appointed Mr. Andries de Lange as non-

Independent non-Executive Director with effect from

27 May 2020. Mr. de Lange has extensive experience of

leadership roles, with a core specialty in corporate finance

and the property industry.

As announced on 29 September 2020, the Board approved

the appointment of Mr. Andreas Klingen, an existing

Independent non-Executive Director, to act as a member of

the Nomination Committee and Lead Independent Director,

effective from 28 September 2020. As Lead Independent

Director, Mr. Klingen will be tasked with: leading the Board

in the absence of the Chairman; serving as a sounding

board or trusted adviser of the Chairman; acting, if

necessary, as an intermediary between the Chairman

and other members of the Board; chairing discussions

and decision-making by the Board on matters where the

Chairman may have a conflict of interest, and leading the

performance appraisal of the Chairman with the other non-

Executive Directors ('NED') without the Chairman present.

Corporate Governance Framework

Throughout 2020, the Group continued to strengthen its

Corporate Governance Framework, designed to ensure

material compliance with King IV, as well as to voluntarily

align with relevant guidance in Dutch and UK governance

codes, under the close guidance of the Audit Committee.

With continuous improvement in mind,

PricewaterhouseCoopers ('PwC'), Isle of Man, were

engaged to independently assess the Group's Corporate

Governance Framework and review operational

effectiveness. As a result, significant alignment

was achieved between the three codes and PwC's

recommendations were implemented to further enhance

the Company's already robust and comprehensive

framework. PwC's recommendations regarding increased

effectiveness were considered by the Audit Committee and

management, and implementation prioritised starting the

end of 2020, with sustainable application beginning 2021.

As announced on 7 December, NEPI Rockcastle disposed

of its remaining listed securities portfolio, consisting of

1,202,008 shares in Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (URW)

for a consideration of approximately €75 million. The €25

million net loan facility associated with the URW shares

was repaid in August, using part of the proceeds from the

sale of the Romanian offices. The proceeds from the URW

shares were used to repurchase 17,717,760 NEPI Rockcastle

shares, representing 2.95% of the Company's issued

share capital. This transaction was executed between 23

November and 4 December, was in line with the Group's

previously announced (and gradually implemented)

strategy of redeploying capital from listed securities and

prompted by the improvement in the URW share price

immediately prior to the sale. The Transaction was accretive

in terms of EPRA Net Reinstatement Value per share from

2020 by 1%, and is estimated to be accretive in terms of

Distributable Earnings per share and EPRA Earnings per

share mostly starting 2021 (given the antecedent earnings

adjustment for 2020 and the limited time period from

implementation until year-end).

Corporate governance:

Chairman's

evaluation and that of each individual Board member

(including self-assessment).

The 2020 evaluation covered the following

considerations:

•

structure and composition of the Board and

Committees, including diversity, expertise and mix

of skills;

•

efficiency and transparency of operations,

processes and routines, including the quality of

the decision-making process, members' dynamic,

teamwork and collaboration including the display of

ethical values and tone from the top;

•

Board contribution to strategy definition and

performance monitoring;

•

Board contribution to the steering of corporate

governance and compliance;

•

Board contribution to risk management and internal

controls framework; and

•

Board contribution to performance evaluation,

compensation and succession.

A formal Board succession plan is in place to ensure

the effective and orderly succession of Directors.

The succession framework ensures that sufficient

knowledge, skills and expertise are available for the

Board to effectively govern the Group, to safeguard

a smooth transition and preserve knowledge and

experience. Succession planning includes:

•

identifying the knowledge, skills and experience

the Board should collectively possess to effectively

fulfil its roles and responsibilities;

•

ensuring an appropriate balance in terms of

diversity, expertise and knowledge among the

Directors, in accordance with the Board Profile

Paper;

•

identifying qualified individuals suitable for Director

nomination and recommending them to the

shareholders at the AGM;

•

achieving continuity through a smooth succession

of Directors (including Board and Committees

leadership) that balances perspective and

independence with experience and knowledge; and

•

satisfying best practice within the legal and

regulatory framework applicable to the Group,

in particular, compliance with the JSE, A2X and

Euronext listing requirements, and with the

statutory obligations in the various jurisdictions

where the Group operates.

The CEO succession plan was discussed by the Board

and potential successors were identified within the

Company.

Keeping up to date with trends, industry-specifics,

legal and regulatory developments, economic, social

and governance topics, is a constant priority and the

Directors' development programme includes dedicated

sessions covering these areas, delivered by highly

qualified experts. The Board and its Committees may,

whenever they consider appropriate, seek independent

professional advice concerning the Company's affairs

and gain access to any information they may need in

discharging their duties as Directors.

Remuneration Committee

The Remuneration Committee:

•

consists of at least three Directors, the majority of

whom must be Independent non-Executive Directors;

and

•

is chaired by an Independent non-Executive Director,

who is not the Chairman of the Board.

The Directors serving on the Remuneration Committee

will have diverse, complementary backgrounds and will be

independent of the management and the Company.

The Remuneration Committee assumed the following

responsibilities during 2020:

•

oversee the annual review of the Remuneration Policy

and principles;

•

monitor implementation and administration of the

Remuneration Policy;

•

determine remuneration for Executive Directors, in

alignment with the Remuneration Policy;

•

ensure that employees are properly incentivised

based on individual and Group performance;

•

ensure that the Group's remuneration principles are

aligned with the strategy in order to create long-term

value for the Group; and

•

recommend the fees paid to non-Executive Directors.

When determining the Remuneration Policy and practices,

the Remuneration Committee is being guided by the

following principles: clarity, simplicity, risk, predictability,

proportionality and alignment to Group culture.:

Director's KPIs have not

been adjusted for the impact of COVID-19: the structure and

target KPIs have been maintained at their level, pre-set before

COVID-19 pandemic commencement.

Ensure Group's

remuneration is

aligned to the

relevant market

and provides

internal fairness

The Group frequently

consults international

independent remuneration

experts to ensure a

proper understanding

of the benchmarks and

determine actions to

be implemented during

the annual remuneration

review processes.

Independent benchmarking survey data on pay levels by

country/industry/position were used in the 2020 salary review

of non-Executive Directors' fees and remuneration principles

overall.

For all staff, except Executive Directors, reports from Mercer

International were consulted.

and expectations of stakeholders, including employees.

These are outlined below:

Remuneration

Committee's

priorities

Approach

Processes implemented during 2020

Ensure

transparency

of Group's

remuneration

policy, pay

structures, pay

levels, objectives

and link

between pay

and business

performance

The principles and details

of Group's remuneration

policies, including

any changes made or

anticipated are publicly

presented in the Annual

Report.

Meetings with

management teams are

held annually within

the remuneration and

performance review

process to outline, explain

and clarify aspects of the

Group's remuneration

review decisions and

rationale.

The 2020 Annual report, the Remuneration Review and

the Implementation Report are presenting all details of

remuneration for both Executive and non-Executive Directors,

as well as principles of remuneration across the rest of the staff.

Allocation of reduced staff cost budgets was done at business

function level, allowing the top management team to take

a wider responsibility over managing the process of reward

review.

Individual discussions with team leaders were held by the HR

Director for budget allocation, as well as for the start of the

performance management process, to discuss principles of

remuneration, reward review and link to performance of teams

and individuals.

2. Alignment of ethics of pay

Ensure

alignment

of all staff

remuneration

principles and

pay structures

across all

countries in

which the Group

operates

The same remuneration

review process is

conducted at Group level

and in all countries where

NEPI Rockcastle is present.

The HR Director ensures

the roll out of the process

is aligned and the same

principles apply across all

countries.

The Remuneration

Committee is informed of

and annually approves the

performance and reward

review approach.

The HR function is a centralised function which ensures

HR services across the Group. Determination of specific

remuneration at the level of a team is done upon consultation

with HR reward specialist who provides, for each position

within the Company, an analysis of the job level, benchmarking

against specific functions and geographies and makes

recommendations in respect of appropriate pay levels and

expected dynamic during the first performance cycle.

This process ensures that same principles of pay are

consistently applied across all grades, functions and countries.

Ensure

remuneration

is determined

without

discrimination

The HR Director, as

mandated by the

Executive Management

and Remuneration

Committee ensures

through detailed reviews

of the reward processes

that pay levels are set free

from any discriminating

considerations: gender,

age, race, religion or other.

Fixed remuneration is determined based on role,

responsibilities, level of competence and experience, while

variable remuneration is determined based on performance,

impact and contribution. There is no consideration given in the

hiring or reward review process to any other element that could

lead to discrimination, such as gender, age, race, religion or

other.

The Remuneration Committee is also reviewing the principles,

mechanisms and implementation of reward review, to ensure

that only role and performance elements are considered in

reward determining decisions.

The HR department monitors relative pay of staff to ensure

fairness and ethical pay principles are observed.:
