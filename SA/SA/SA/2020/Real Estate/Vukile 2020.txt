Dear stakeholders

I am pleased to present the report of Vukile’s social, ethics and human resources committee (the SEHR committee) for the

year ended 31 March 2020. In line with the dual mandate of the committee the report is presented in two parts, namely the

remuneration report and the social and ethics statement. In addition to the social and ethics statement, we have provided a

comprehensive overview of Vukile’s transformation journey and social and community involvement – which can be found in

the environmental, social and governance (ESG) section set out on pages 95 to 97.

The remuneration report, in line with King IVTM’s prescribed format, is presented in three parts, namely the background

statement, the remuneration philosophy and policy, and the implementation report. The monitoring of the remuneration policy

and the remuneration implementation report is the responsibility of the committee.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on remuneration

Shortly prior to our financial year-end the world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic and resulting

lockdowns has had a severe impact on REITs around world. Both the South African and Spanish markets have been severely

damaged with the economic fallout likely to be felt for years to come. The impact of COVID-19 will necessitate the SEHR

Committee to carefully consider our remuneration policies and practices to ensure an adequate response to the economic

reality that we face. We shall endeavor to balance shareholders’ interests with the best interest of the company whilst always

ensuring the we have a committed and motivated management team to steady the ship through what will undoubtably be

rough waters in the next few years.
