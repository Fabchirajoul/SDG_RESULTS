DEAR STAKEHOLDERS

This past year has been a remarkable

one for Gold Fields. Firstly, the outbreak

of Covid-19 not only challenged our

personal lives, but also business-

as-usual across the regions where

we operate. Secondly, despite the

impact of the pandemic, Gold Fields

had another year of impressive

performance, with strong earnings,

cash-flows and value creation for our

stakeholders. Finally, 2020 was the

last year that Nick Holland led the

Company. He officially retired at the

end of March. A memorable era in

Gold Fields’ history has come to an

end, and we are embarking on a new

chapter with the appointment of Chris

Griffith as Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

from April onwards.

In last year’s report, I made initial

reference to our management’s

proactive and comprehensive

approach to mitigating the early

impacts of Covid-19 on our people

and operations. None of us could

have foreseen that, a year later, the

pandemic would still be with us.

Tragically, 10 of Gold Fields’ employees

and contractors have lost their lives, as

have many of our colleagues’ relatives.

On behalf of the Board, I want to

express our heartfelt condolences to

the families and friends of those who

have succumbed to Covid-19, as well

as to our colleagues who have lost their

loved ones.

In this Integrated Annual Report (IAR),

we report extensively on how our teams

managed to, first and foremost, protect

our employees and contractors, assist

our host communities and governments

in mitigating the pandemic’s impact,

and keep our mines and projects

operating strongly and safely. The

Board receives regular updates, via its

Risk Committee, of the actions taken

by the Company.

We expect that the pandemic will

remain a reality for months to come,

perhaps even years, and could impact

our operational plans in yet unforeseen

ways. The Board has requested the

Group’s management team to develop

strategies on how we can assist in

making vaccines available to our

workforce, and, where appropriate,

to families and communities, as well

as prepare our people and business

for this ‘new normal’. As such, we

are exploring ways of supporting our

employees who, for example, are

now permanently working from home

or are struggling as a result of the

continued impact of Covid-19. At an

operational level, we will continue to

test our people, provide them with the

necessary equipment and information

to protect themselves, and help them

in any possible way we can if they

contract Covid-19.

The Board has complete confidence in

the ability of Gold Fields’ management

team and its workforce to continue

dealing successfully with the ongoing

impact of Covid-19. Our 2020

operational performance speaks for

itself – despite the challenges and

disruptions of the year, the Company

delivered a strong set of results in 2020.

The impact of Covid-19 was limited

to approximately 3% of production

(approximately 80koz) and, while our

operations spent an additional US$30m

to deal with the pandemic or donate

to host governments, both costs and

production were within revised market

guidance.

The stable production and cost

profile was supported by a record

high gold price. Our financial results

also benefited from the gold price,

and included net cash-flow of

US$631m and normalised earnings of

US$879m – both more than double our

performance in 2019. We reduced net

debt by almost US$600m, placing our

balance sheet in a very healthy position,

and recorded a net debt:EBITDA ratio

of 0.56x – the lowest it has been in

almost a decade. Our shareholders

received a total dividend of R4.80/

share, three times that of 2019. They

also saw their shares hit record highs in

2020, though this has since retreated

in line with the decline in the gold price

from its record levels of over US$2,050/

oz in August last year.

In February 2020, our Board decided

to go ahead with the US$860m Salares

Norte project in Chile. Construction

proceeded as planned during the year

and is set for completion in Q1 2023.

Salares Norte is the latest building

block in the Company’s reinvestment

programme of the past three years,

during which we also effectively built

two new mines, Gruyere in Australia

and the Damang Pit Cutback in Ghana.

Both mines contributed meaningfully

to the Group’s cash-flow during 2020.

I am also particularly pleased to report

that South Deep again showed strong

financial and operational improvements

and contributed positive cash-flow

during 2020.

Gold Fields continues to focus on

maximising in-country and host

community economic impact. The

Group’s value distribution to national

economies amounted to US$2.85bn

in 2020 compared with US$2.58bn

in 2019. Of this, US$676m, 28%:

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS

This past year will always be

remembered as a time when

Covid-19 caused major losses and

upheavals to our personal lives while

disrupting business-as-usual for

many companies worldwide. Our

experience at Gold Fields was no

different, and, tragically, the pandemic

took the ultimate toll on many of

our people. As at 29 March 2021,

10 of our colleagues had tragically

passed away due to Covid-19-related

illnesses. My condolences go out to

their families, friends and colleagues.

Other colleagues were ill for weeks,

and all of us had our personal and

professional lives severely disrupted

by the stringent regulations and

protocols implemented to mitigate the

worst impacts of the pandemic.

Following a second wave of

infections around the world in early

2021, it seems inevitable that these

disruptions will continue for some

time to come. We are currently

looking at strategies on how we

can continue keeping our people

safe and how to ensure we make

vaccines available to them as soon

as is practical. We are seeking advice

from medical experts and are working

with governments, industry forums

and our peers on the best solution

for a vaccine roll-out and an eventual

return to business-as-usual.

Covid-19 inevitably affected the

Company’s 2020 operational

performance, albeit marginally.

Attributable gold-equivalent

production of 2.236Moz in 2020 was

2% higher than 2019 production and

within the revised guidance range

of 2.200Moz – 2.250Moz. However,

we had to revise our original 2020

guidance of 2.275Moz – 2.315Moz

in May to take into account the

78koz lost due to Covid-19-related

shutdowns at South Deep (32koz)

and Cerro Corona (46koz).

All-in costs (AIC) for 2020 were

US$1,079/oz, 1% higher than 2019

(US$1,064/oz) and within the revised

guidance range. All-in sustaining

costs (AISC) for the year were

US$977/oz (2019: US$897/oz),

again within the revised guidance

range. These costs were slightly

above the original 2020 guidance as

our operations spent approximately

US$30m on Covid-19-related

initiatives and interventions. This

includes investments in testing

GOLD FIELDS SHARE PRICE 2010 – 2020

During 2020, our share price on both the JSE and NYSE

improved by 46% and 42% respectively, on the back of

respective increases of 94% and 88% during 2019. While

the shares have retreated from their record highs reached

in August 2020, when the gold price hit its all-time high of

US$2,070/oz, we are still offering shareholders substantive

returns and healthy dividends. Shareholders who owned

1,000 Gold Fields shares on 1 January 2010, held on to the

1,000 Sibanye Gold stocks (now Sibanye-Stillwater) they would

have been awarded after its unbundling in February 2013,

would have been rewarded with a total return of 105% by

31 December 2020. That is an annual return of 7% on their

investment.
