LETTER

Five years ago, I wrote to the DRDGOLD board of directors

questioning how it was that the company could be worth a mere

$50 million. This, for a company producing 150 000 ounces of gold

at a profit margin of 18%, with operations that were running well

and with a good track record of dividend payments. And the

$50 million included a cash balance of $20 million, which meant

all our operations were valued at just $30 million.

Five years later, our production has increased to 174 000 ounces of gold

at a profit margin of 37% and, as you will see in this report, the outlook

for our future growth is excellent. Our operations are operating profitably

despite the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and the development of

FWGR has been very successful, with potential for significant expansion.

As a result of a lot of hard work by our dedicated workforce and a focus

on improving the productivity of our operations, combined with the

successful acquisition of FWGR from Sibanye-Stillwater and a welcome

Geoffrey Campbell | Chairman

helping hand from the gold price, the market capitalisation is now around

$1 billion (which includes close to $100 million in cash). This is a growth

story to be proud of and, whilst the higher gold price has helped the

South African gold mining industry in general, DRDGOLD has been a

standout performer.

It has been a great journey these past five years and we must take what

we have learnt from our past success and apply it to the future. We

will continue to be the pre-eminent surface re-treatment operator in

South Africa. We have built a vast store of knowledge and we continue

to develop our skills in moving huge tonnages of materials safely and

efficiently and working to maximise recovery and minimise cost.

The scale of our operations means that relatively small improvements

in productivity translate into big profits. A new area of interest is the

application of big data analysis. The complex systems that we manage

across the Johannesburg area generate terabytes of data and big data

analytics seeks to uncover information to help us make better informed

It is with pleasure that I present the annual remuneration report for FY2020

on behalf of the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors.

This report focuses on two sections: Part A focuses on remuneration

governance and policy and Part B focuses on remuneration of executive

directors, prescribed officers, senior management, and fees paid to non-

executive directors.

During these unprecedented times associated with the COVID-19

lockdown regulations, it was gratifying to note that the Company’s

Remuneration Policy continued to drive positive outcomes and guided

the executive directors, prescribed officers and senior management in

their efforts to achieve stellar results.

The Company continued to pay all employees in full during the various

phases of lockdown and did not need to reduce the staff complement.

These are remarkable achievements, given the difficulties that so many

other employers in the economy faced at the time. The Company

met most of its performance metrics during the year under review,

emphasising the value of aligning remuneration strategy with both

individual and Company performance.

Executives, non-executive directors and senior management voluntarily

contributed generously to the Solidarity Fund, which the President

announced on 23 March 2020. The objective of this fund was to unite the

nation in response to the COVID-19 crisis and focused on accelerating

critical interventions in supporting the health care system, enabling

resilience for the most vulnerable households and communities as well as

mobilising citizens in a solidarity campaign. The amount of R1.6 million that

our leadership group sacrificed from their salaries is truly impressive and

speaks volumes about the nature of the people who lead our Company.

In my previous report, I mentioned that the Remuneration Committee

was overseeing the implementation of the revised short-term and long-

term incentive schemes for senior employees. I am pleased to advise

that these revised schemes are now in place and have proved to be

effective incentives that align the interests of the leadership team with

the interests of our stakeholders by rewarding results in the form of cash

generation and total shareholder returns. The long-term incentive scheme

has been positively impacted by the realised value of the significant

increase of the Company’s share price on the back of the improved gold

price and the value proposition of the Company.

The Remuneration Committee remains committed to upholding good

corporate governance and remuneration best practice, in line with the

guidelines provided by the King Commission.
