Dear shareholders

This section provides you a useful overview of how Sibanye-Stillwater addresses the complex subject of remuneration, how

remuneration is used in the incentivisation of our employees while also enabling the creation of long-term value for shareholders and

how our remuneration policies were implemented during the year under review.

2020 was an exceptional year for Sibanye-Stillwater, in all senses of the word. Not only did we, like all other enterprises and

communities have to make significant operational adjustments due to the dynamic and uncertain conditions brought on by the

COVID-19 public health pandemic, but, having done so, the organisation then excelled in its tactical operational response through

the effective and safe utilisation of the resources it had available to work with and, aided further by favourable commodity prices and

exchange rates, delivered outstanding record results for the Group in 2020. One might say that, despite all the challenges this year,

Sibanye-Stillwater’s “cloud had a precious metal lining”.

We continue to note feedback from stakeholders on our remuneration reporting, and we welcome their comments or suggestions so

that we can continue to improve the quality of our reporting in this very important area.

SETTING THE SCENE WHAT DRIVES US ACCOUNTABILITY DELIVERING ON OUR STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK ANCILLARY INFORMATION:

managing director of Tovavect. Yuri Mokgosi grew up in the

Westonaria community and has lived around mines most of his life.

By choosing to step into the field of underground and above-ground drilling services for mining

and construction, the company has become a trailblazer in many ways. “We are explorers –

challenging the current industry status quo. We work with our clients to improve efficiency and

achieve results within shorter lead times.” This approach has seen Tovavect become a supplier

of choice to mining houses.

For Sibanye-Stillwater itself, opening up this contract to new suppliers presented a real

opportunity for its mines. “Tovavect’s appointment speaks directly to the legacy creation

we’re committed to through the CEO’s Fund,” explain Marion Green-Thompson, Vice

President, Transformation.

Tovavect has been supported by Phakamani Impact Capital, Sibanye-Stillwater’s enterprise and

supplier development partner for the contract. “The Sibanye-Stillwater CEO Fund has made

a loan of R2.8 million to the SME to assist in operational readiness,” says Green-Thompson.

“Phakamani has also deployed a mentorship and support team on the project to help wherever

needed, especially in the initial deployment phase.”
