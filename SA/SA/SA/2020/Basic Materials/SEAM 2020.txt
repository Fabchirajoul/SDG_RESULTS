Significant areas of judgement

In arriving at the figures disclosed in the financial statements, there are many areas where judgement is needed. These

are outlined in the critical accounting estimates and judgements in the accounting policies to the annual financial

statements. The Audit and Risk Committee has looked at the quantum of the assets and liabilities on the statements of

financial position and other items that require significant judgement and decided to note the following:

Going concern

Whilst the Company was considering various ways to raise funding, there were no sufficient and appropriate audit

evidence to support this statement. However, the Board is satisfied that there were adequate prospects for a rights issue

in the near future and prepared the annual financial statements on a going concern basis.

The Committee:



oversaw the value delivery on IT;



monitored that adequate business arrangements are in place for disaster recovery;



monitored that all personal information is treated by the Company as an important business asset and is identified;

and



reviewed and recommended to the Board for approval any policies proposed by management and relevant to the

areas of responsibility of the Committee.

Legal and regulatory requirements

To the extent that these may have an impact on the annual financial statements, the Committee:



reviewed legal matters that could have a material impact on the Group;



reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s procedures, including its risk management framework,

to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory responsibilities;
