DEAR SHAREHOLDERS AND STAKEHOLDERS

The Covid-19 pandemic significantly affected Harmony’s operations,

gold production and employees in the last quarter of the financial

year to June 2020 (FY20), following the South African government’s

imposed temporary closures on underground mines as part of the

nation-wide lockdown.

Harmony has successfully contained the spread of the virus throughout

its operations in collaboration with the Department of Mineral

Resources and Energy, labour unions, the Minerals Council South Africa

and our employees. All our employees are now back at work and we

have resumed full production.

The impact of the pandemic reduced gold production by 11%

compared to the previous year, resulting in a loss in revenue of

approximately R4 billion (US$255 million), turning a potential profit of

more than R3 billion (US$192 million) to a net loss for the period of

R850 million (US$54 million).

Despite these challenges, Harmony delivered on the strategic growth

objectives set in FY16, which are, inter alia, to:

• increase production to around 1.5Moz per year

• add quality ounces to reduce all-in sustaining costs

The acquisition of Mponeng and Mine Waste Solutions from AngloGold

Ashanti Limited (AngloGold Ashanti) will increase our production by

350 000 ounces a year to more than 1.5Moz and improve our profit

margins. We thank our shareholders for participating in the equity

capital raise of US$200 million in June 2020 to fund the acquisition of

these assets.

We recorded a remarkable increase in our share price, which was

126% higher year on year by end June 2020, resulting in a market

capitalisation of R43.3 billion (US$2.5 billion). Harmony was also

included in the FTSE-JSE Africa Top 40 in September 2020.

Gold continues to be viewed as a safe-haven investment. We remain

positive on the outlook for gold in the prevailing uncertain and volatile

macro environment. We believe this rising trend will continue. For

Harmony, this comes at an opportune time as we assume ownership of

the Mponeng and Mine Waste Solutions assets from AngloGold Ashanti.

We remain committed to organic and acquisitive growth. Harmony will

continue to focus on securing the renewal of Hidden Valley’s mining

licence and the special mining lease for the Wafi-Golpu joint venture in

Papua New Guinea.

Maintaining a safe and healthy

work environment

The safety and health of all our employees is our primary responsibility.

We are committed to ensuring that the work environment is safe and

that every employee goes home, every day, in a healthy condition.

Harmony’s suppliers also benefitted from a Government

relief programme through which an initial grant of R25 000

was provided along with other financial support through the

Unemployment Insurance Fund.

(FY19: R1.1 billion or US$82 million) was spent in the Morobe Province.

Harmony awarded contracts to local landowner companies for a diverse

range of goods and services including earthmoving equipment hire,

catering and accommodation, security services, bus transport and

labour hire.

At the time of writing, Papua New Guinea’s legislative and regulatory

environment is undergoing profound transformation, driven by the ‘take
