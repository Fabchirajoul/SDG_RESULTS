• Hudaco also concentrates on a better gender balance across its

workforce. Recruitment and development processes throughout

the organisation focus on female as well as black recruits to

ensure a balanced pipeline of talent.

Skills development and training

Successfully taking advantage of opportunities for growth, both

acquisitive and organic, depends on the quality of our people.

Given the shortage of technical and engineering skills in general

in South Africa and in particular among the black population, we

put special focus and resources on building these skills. We have

identified the building of the following skill sets within Hudaco as

being our key focus areas:

• The senior management team: We have identified members

of the senior management team whom we believe have the

qualities required for growth to executive level in due course.

These people have been given expanded responsibilities and are

being nurtured with a view to their being able to step into the

breach as more senior managers reach retirement age. Many

members of the senior management team have attended Master

of Business Administration (MBA) and other master’s degree

courses at various universities.

• Technical expertise: Critical relationships in the field are with

the technical and maintenance teams of our customers. They

place the orders upon which we depend for our turnover. We

need a constant supply of new sales staff with the right technical

skills to be able to adapt to and service our customers’ changing

needs. Although we are essentially a group of distribution

businesses, we run in-house learnerships where we can and

technical traineeships where we cannot.

Under the auspices of the group transformation and human

resources executive and with the assistance of the Wits Business

School, which is internationally recognised, the group normally

conducts a range of especially tailored development programmes

for people at various levels of management. The aim of this

programme is to provide a steady flow of leadership talent for the

group, with particular emphasis on developing black leadership.

We have had success in bringing potential black leaders through

the ranks and preparing them for future middle and senior:
