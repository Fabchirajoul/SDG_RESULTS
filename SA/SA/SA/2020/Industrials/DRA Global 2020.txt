Dear Shareholders,

The extraordinary events of 2020 are already well documented

and, as I write this Report, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to

impact us all. It is through the lens of the pandemic that I would

like to reflect on the year and report on the incredible progress

DRA Global has made over the past 12 months, in spite of the

challenges we faced.

The pandemic brought into sharp focus the importance and high

priority for the health, safety and wellbeing of our people, who

are at the core of everything we do. I congratulate the Executive

Team for a job well done during 2020 in managing the continuity

of our business and appreciate their ongoing efforts in remaining

vigilant as we continue to grapple with the effects of COVID-19.

With a global workforce of more than 4,500, across 20 locations,

it is not surprising that the pandemic has had a direct and very

real impact on our people and their families, and on behalf of the

Board I send our thoughts and support to all of those affected.

A positive outcome of the pandemic has been the ability to test

the resilience of our business and while we have come though

this challenge well, we will continue to make a concerted effort to

improve the operational safety performance of DRA.

You will be aware that in 2015-2016 we undertook a strategic

process to develop a five-year plan for the Group. This plan set

out a number of commitments, including to become a $1 billion

revenue company, growing our non-South African revenues and

taking the necessary steps to redomicile DRA from South Africa

in order to create a platform for further international growth,

including being listed on the ASX and JSE.

While these commitments were made prior to my time, I am

delighted to report that the Board and Executive Team have

met these commitments to shareholders and, all going well, we

expect DRA to become publicly listed in 2021.

A key supporter of developing and delivering that five-year

plan has been Leon Uys, DRA’s former CEO and a long-term

servant of the Group at an Executive level, as well as serving as

a Non-executive Director since 2013. It is therefore somewhat

appropriate that, having seen the culmination of his plan, Leon

has chosen to call time on his career with DRA and resigned

in early May. I know I am joined by the extended DRA family in

thanking Leon for his enduring service and wishing he and his

family every future success.:

Managing Director and CEO’s report: Managing

Managing Director and CEO’s report

customers will come back again and again, to an engineering,

project delivery and operations management company that is

forward-thinking. For DRA this means creating an atmosphere

that is conducive to creativity, growth and shared success.

Over the past year DRA has continued to grow its orderbook.

The longer-term forward opportunity pipeline has also increased,

with qualified opportunities of around $8 billion, across projects,

operations, maintenance and shut-down services, which is a

record for DRA.

Operational excellence

In 2020, DRA also embarked on an ambitious operational

excellence program across the group. The program focused on

creating synergies between the various functional groups and

operating businesses. Through our investment in the operational

excellence program, we have been able to generate savings

through efficiencies, as well as better integration of systems and

processes. The program has also been instrumental in enabling

DRA to be IPO ready in 2021.

Delivering shareholder value

Over the past year and amidst very challenging conditions

across the world DRA continued to deliver on, and was involved

in, some iconic projects. I would like to acknowledge the hard

work of our teams on their dedication and diligence in delivering

these projects. DRA’s involvement in the Kamoa-Kakula project,

which upon completion will be one of the largest copper mines

in the world, was a particular highlight. DRA continues to provide

services across the underground mine development, process

plant and associated infrastructure. DRA’s man-hours across the

project are in excess of five million and with zero LTI’s which is a

remarkable accomplishment.

Another significant project in execution for DRA is the Tri-K gold

project. Here again, the team worked throughout the COVID-19

pandemic with zero LTI’s and is on track to achieve first gold

in 2021. From operating and maintaining the highest diamond

mine in the world in Lesotho, to providing owners support to

new customers in Peru and Russia and from performing shut-

down services in the Australian outback to delivering world-class

projects across the African continent, the entire DRA team can

be proud of their achievements.

Health, safety and wellbeing

Over the year, DRA employees and contractors delivered more

than 12.3 million man hours across customer projects, and over

7.7 million additional man hours across operations, maintenance

and shut-downs, achieving LTIFR of 0.24 per 200,000 man hours

and TRIFR 0.72 per 200,000 man-hours. Our Projects business

achieved a LTIFR of under 0.1 in 2020, a fantastic achievement

which reflects our unwavering focus on safety. Zero Harm

remains at the forefront of all DRA operations and our focus on

safety is unwavering, transcending our diverse workforce across

various demographics and geographies. Our safety culture is

centred around six key pillars, being:

/

Leadership

/

Environment

/

Employee engagement

/

Behaviour

/

People

/

Systems

We will continue to adopt a progressive mindset in our approach

to safety and work closely with our customers and our industry to

eliminate safety incidents from the workplace.

Looking ahead

The next 12 months are pivotal for DRA and I am excited about

what lies ahead. We remain on track to deliver against our goals

culminating, we hope, in DRA being recognised as a leading

global engineering, project delivery and operations management

service provider to the mining, minerals and metals market.

From a corporate point of view, 2021 will bring a heightened

profile and new demands from our stakeholders. Preparing to

list is a major step for the Group and will provide the necessary

platform to support DRA’s longer-term strategic aspirations.

Having worked through the challenges of 2020 successfully and

with a strong pipeline of work in front of us, the outlook for our

operational performance is also healthy.

To conclude, I would like to acknowledge and thank our Chairman,

Peter Mansell, and the Board as well as my Executive Team for

their commitment and support over the past 12 months. Learning

from and being part of such an inspirational team is humbling

and I am grateful for the guidance and backing I receive from

my colleagues.

Stay safe and best wishes for 2021.

Sincerely,

Director's Report

Significant changes in the state of affairs

Minnovo put option

In 2017, the Group entered into a share purchase agreement with Minnovo Pty Ltd (Minnovo) to acquire 100% of the issued share capital

in Minnovo. The acquisition of Minnovo was completed in July 2018 and the former shareholders of Minnovo accepted cash and shares of

DRA Global Limited as full consideration. The share-based consideration was accepted only on the basis that the shares of DRA Global

Limited would be liquid within 18 months. The original period of 18 months has since lapsed. Whilst the Group has no obligation under the

share purchase agreement to buy-back the shares, the Group has entered into a formal put option agreement with the former shareholders

of Minnovo. The put option agreement grants these former shareholders the right to sell their shares obtained from the acquisition back

to the Group at the same price that the shares were issued in terms of the share purchase agreement only in the event that the listing

process has not completed by 30 June 2021. The put option agreement was approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting

on 29 July 2020. A put option liability of $18.9M was recorded based on 2,539,015 number of shares at $7.44 per share. Refer to note 21.

Shares issued and Share Buy-back during the period

On 5 May 2020, DRA Global Limited issued an additional 646,464 fully paid ordinary shares to management of New Senet Pty Ltd

(SENET) with a subscription price of $6.12 per share. The additional subscription by management of SENET will seek to motivate and

retain key employees of SENET beyond the earn-out period.

On 6 April 2020, the Group bought back 570,051 fully paid ordinary shares with a total value of $4,196,818 as settlement of employee

loans owing to the Group. Refer to note 22.

Impairment of intangible assets

The Group impaired $5.7M of goodwill relating to the Americas region’s cash generating unit (CGU). The Americas region was profitable in

the past and is expected to be profitable in the next 12 months. However, the operation in the Clean Energy sector is expected to reduce

significantly from FY2022 onwards due to expiration of tax incentives in the United States. At the date of this report, the tax incentive has

not been renewed and therefore has not been taken into account in the value-in-use calculations to determine the recoverable amount of

the CGU beyond FY2022. Refer to note 16.

There were no other significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the financial year.

Likely developments and expected results of operations

The Group plans to continue to provide diversified engineering and operation and maintenance services globally.

Distributions

There were no dividends paid, recommended or declared during the current or previous financial year.

Environmental regulation

The Group is subject to environmental regulation in respect of its projects and operations business activities in different regions. The

Group aims to ensure the appropriate standard of environmental care is achieved, and in doing so that it is aware of, and is in compliance

with, relevant environmental legislation. There were no breaches of environmental legislation for the year.:

Director's Report

Matters subsequent to the end of the financial year

BEE restructure

DRA South Africa Proprietary Limited (“DRA South Africa”) and its subsidiaries which are controlled by the Group are implementing a

restructure of DRA’s South African operations to facilitate the conclusion of a broad-based black economic empowerment (“B-BBEE”)

ownership transaction in terms of which private equity funds managed by Ascension Capital Partners Proprietary Limited (“Ascension

Funds”) will acquire the following interest in the relevant South African group entities:

/

35% ordinary share interest in DRA South African Group Holdings Proprietary Limited (“DRA SA Group”);

/

25% ordinary share interest in Minerals Operations Executive Proprietary Limited (“Minopex SA”) and DRA Plant Operations Holdings

Proprietary Limited (“DRA Plant Operations”); and

/

25% ordinary share interest in DRA Projects Group Holdings Proprietary Limited (“DRA Projects Group”).

Main Street 798 Proprietary Limited (RF) (“Main Street”), DRA SA Group’s previous B-BBEE shareholder, will remain indirectly invested in

DRA South Africa as an investor in Ascension.

In terms of the aforementioned restructure, DRA South Africa Group Holdings will replace DRA South Africa as the holding company of the

Group’s South African interests and DRA Projects Group will become the holding vehicle for the Group’s South African projects business.

The result of the restructure of the B-BBEE shareholding and introduction of Ascension as a B-BBEE partner in South Africa is that DRA’s

major operating businesses in South Africa will be certified 51% B-BBEE-owned and address the main procurement criteria set out in the

South African Mining Charter (Mining Charter 3). By addressing these criteria DRA will be able to continue to effectively compete within

the South African market, ensuring a platform for sustained growth.

At the date of this report the restructure had not been completed.

Stockdale Street’s Selective Share Buy-back

On 28 January 2021, the Group entered into a Share Buy-back Agreement with BPESAM IV M Ltd (IVM) and BPESAM IV N Ltd (IVN)

(together known as Limited Partners of Stockdale Street Investment Partnership IV) to purchase 30,000,000 of the shares in the Group.

The Buy-back consideration includes an initial cash consideration of ZAR 550,000,000 ($47,720,000) payable at completion date, a further

cash consideration of $30,280,000 payable prior to 31 December 2021, totalling approximately $78,000,000 and 25,000,000 Upside

Participants Rights (UPR). The UPRs have an exercise price of $3.10 per share with a price ceiling of $6.5 per share. Consequently, the

Indemnity and insurance of officers

In accordance with the constitution, except as may be prohibited by the Corporations Act 2001 every officer of the Group shall be

indemnified out of the property of the Group against any liability incurred by him or her in his or her capacity as officer of the Group or any

related corporation in respect of any act or omission whatsoever and howsoever occurring or in defending any proceedings, whether civil

or criminal. The contracts of insurance contain confidentiality provisions that preclude disclosure of the premiums paid, the nature of the

Director's Report

Proceedings on behalf of the Group

No person has applied to the Court under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 for leave to bring proceedings on behalf of the Group,

or to intervene in any proceedings to which the Group is a party for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of the Group for all or

part of those proceedings.

Non-audit services

Details of the amounts paid or payable to the auditor for non-audit services provided during the financial year by the auditor are outlined

in note 37 to the financial statements.

The Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the financial year, by the auditor (or by another person or firm

on the auditor’s behalf), is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001.

The Directors are of the opinion that the services as disclosed in note 37 to the financial statements do not compromise the external

auditor’s independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:

/

all non-audit services have been reviewed and approved to ensure that they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor;

and

/

none of the services undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for

Professional Accountants issued by the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board, including reviewing or auditing the

auditor’s own work, acting in a management or decision-making capacity for the Group, acting as advocate for the Group or jointly

sharing economic risks and rewards.

Auditor’s independence declaration

A copy of the auditor’s independence declaration as required under Section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out on page 144.

Remuneration report (audited)

The audited remuneration report is set out on pages 70 - 83 and forms part of this Directors’ report.

This report is made in accordance with a resolution of Directors, pursuant to Section 298(2)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001.

Rounding of amounts

The Company is of a kind referred to in Corporations Instrument 2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments

Commission, relating to ‘rounding-off’. Amounts in this report have been rounded off in accordance with that Corporations Instrument to

the nearest thousand Dollars, or in certain cases, the nearest Dollar.
