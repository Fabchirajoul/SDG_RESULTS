Chairman's report

The Adcorp Group is disappointed to report a net loss from

continuing operations of R609 million compared to a R256 million

profit for the prior year. The decline in performance can be

attributed to a combination of challenges in the Group's trading

environments,

unsatisfactory

operating

performance

and

significant impairments to our resource-based cash-generating

units. The year in review was also marked by changes in

leadership in key executive roles and a necessary yet disruptive

rationalisation process.

Following a sharp decline in performance at half-year 2020, the

Board embarked upon a review of the strategy and initiatives to

ensure that focus is placed on the Group's core competencies and

a sustainable balance of Group activities is maintained. The

changing business environment also necessitated an extensive

review of Adcorp's portfolio of companies, resulting in the Board's

decision to divest of non-core operations and explore opportunities

to exit Australia.

Trading environment

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic plunged the global economy

into the deepest contraction experienced in decades, the South

African economy was facing macroeconomic challenges akin to a

recession. South Africa's annual gross domestic product (GDP)

growth over the past five years has averaged 1.5%, fuelled by low

business confidence, increasing consumer and sovereign debt

levels, an inadequate education system and ongoing rolling

blackouts. Just as South Africa entered the COVID-19 lockdown,

the country's sovereign credit rating was downgraded to junk

status

by

Moody’s.

Consequently,

many

South African

organisations entered the pandemic already in precarious financial

positions which have only been exacerbated by the economic

lockdown imposed by the government to contain the spread of

COVID-19.

Lockdown has, and still is, affecting businesses severely with

approximately 85% of businesses reporting reduced turnover, a

third of businesses indicating that they were laying off staff in

order to cope with the effects of COVID-19, half of businesses

indicated a pause in trading activity with 10% of businesses

indicating permanent closure. Lockdown forced employees into

the confines of their homes. While some were able to remain

productive thanks to technology, others were not.

The Adcorp Group has also faced significant trading challenges in

the Australia region. In the last year, the Australian economy was

affected by an economic slowdown, droughts, fires and now,

similar to South Africa, the effects of COVID-19. Although

Australia's national response to the pandemic has been less

severe than in South Africa, contractor volumes in the industrial

sector have been adversely affected by the temporary closure of

facilities due to infections and the related deep-cleaning

requirements.

The cumulative effects of the pandemic and the resultant

permanent trends in Adcorp's markets remain to be seen.

However, economic recovery will be slow due to reduced demand

and damage to productive capacity.

Sustainability

Risks associated with the sustainability of the Group are dealt with

directly by the Board. The Group has experienced significant

leadership changes over the past five years. These changes,

coupled with constant rationalisation and restructuring processes,

have led to instability among staff and an inward-looking

organisation. These developments occurred within the context of

a weakened South African economy and a time of political

uncertainty in the Australian market.

The first steps to achieving a sustainable organisation will be in

creating stability in our leadership and operational structures and

entrenching a culture of customer and candidate centricity. In

addition, the Group has implemented several initiatives to improve

liquidity and operational performance in the short to medium term

to ensure long-term sustainability. These initiatives are aimed at

rightsizing the cost base of the entities in the Group and improving

overall performance. The Board and management are committed

to restructuring the Group in a sustainable manner as well as

reducing the debt levels to de-risk the business and strengthen

the balance sheet.:

Human Capital Committee

The Board has approved the constitution of a Human Capital

Committee which will be a combination of the current Nominations

and Remuneration Committees. The Chair of the Remuneration

Committee will become the Chair of the Human Capital Committee,

while the Chairman of the Board will still chair Board nomination

and composition matters as a sub-set of the Human Capital

Committee.

The role of the Human Capital Committee is to assist the Board

with the following:

• Ensure the Board has the appropriate composition for it to

execute its duties effectively including the establishment of a

formal process for the appointment of directors.

• Identify suitable members for the role of CEO, formalising the

appointment of executive managers, and considering the

performance of the executive team.

• Ensure formal succession plans for the Board, CEO and

executive management are in place and oversee the

development of identified successors through continuous talent

management.

• Ensure

the

principles,

design

and

implementation

of

remuneration for all staff within the Adcorp Group are aligned

with best practice and the reward philosophy regarding the

governance of remuneration.

• Monitor the health of the organisation including ensuring an

engaged workforce and cultural transformation.

independence and competence of the auditor.

The Audit and Risk Committee has nominated, for re-election at the annual general meeting of shareholders, Deloitte & Touche to

continue in office in accordance with section 94(7) of the Companies Act of South Africa.
