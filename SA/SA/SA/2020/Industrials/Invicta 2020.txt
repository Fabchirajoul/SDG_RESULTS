Letter to Stakeholders: Dear Shareholders and Colleagues,

I write to you during possibly the most uncertain economic times since the depression after the Second

World War.

As South Africans we face a fundamental structural downward shift in both GDP and GNP which are

estimated to only return to 2019 levels after a number of years.

The Invicta Group has dug deep and has critically assessed both the way in which our business

is conducted, as well as our business processes, to ensure that our operations are stable and

secure through the Covid-19 pandemic. These actions ensured that we will continue to

operate in a successful and efficient manner with more streamlined businesses.

The Covid-19 pandemic has allowed us to reconsider the valuation of amongst

others our goodwill attributable to some of our businesses, the value of certain

properties, as well as refining our inventory valuation processes. We have made

the necessary financial adjustments accordingly.

Sadly Covid-19 impacted many of our valued employees, with all

divisions needing to retrench staff, impose salary cuts and short

time amongst other measures. These decisions were not taken

lightly, but were necessary to ensure the continued sustainability and

stability of the business. The Group has done everything in its power to

alleviate, as far as possible, the hardship caused by these measures.

By making voluntary salary and fee sacrifices our directors and

senior executives have made a considerable contribution to these

initiatives.

I would like to welcome Steven Joffe who joined the Group as CEO in

January this year. Steven’s strong track record makes us confident that he

will make a valuable, strategic contribution as he steers the Group into the

future.

Further I would like to thank David Samuels who retired from the Board and also

as

Overview of the year

If I were writing this report in any normal environment, I would

have started by indicating what a tough year 2020 was. A year

which included load shedding, water restrictions as a result

of drought in many parts of South Africa, massive currency

volatility and hardly any growth. A year when previously giant

construction companies went into business rescue and our

sovereign debt was downgraded to “junk status”. A year that

included rising government debt and rising unemployment.

Having the benefit of reflecting on last year through the lens of

COVID-19, I think, however tough, last year was a “normal” year

for industrial South Africa.

I joined the Group in January and have been warmly received.

I thank our Chairman Dr Wiese and all the other members of

the Board for my reception. I was told there are no holy cows

and I can have very frank discussions with our Chairman and

the entire Board. I enjoy our engagements and the ability to

learn from our Board members and our Chairman.

I found a committed and passionate executive team. I thank

them too for welcoming me. The team consisting of Tony

Sinclair, Gavin Pelser, Loy Soo-Chew, Craig Barnard, Nazlee

Rajmohamed and Lize Dubery are experienced and I thank

them for allowing me to ask the difficult questions and for

teaching me about their business and indeed the entire Invicta

Group. We are lucky to have such experience in our Group.

Group financial performance

We reviewed the entire balance sheet, specifically goodwill,

property values, inventory, debtors and deferred tax and made

the appropriate provisions having regard to the current market

conditions.

We reduced net interest-bearing debt by R261 million

(excluding IFRS 16) and on top of this we paid R100 million of

the SARS settlement. We have R200 million of the settlement

to go, R100 million to be paid in September2020 and

R100 million in September 2021.

We confirmed trading facilities with our bankers and extended

term-facilities falling due in the short-term.

Lastly, we started to make progress on simplifying the balance

sheet, redeeming R450 million of Invicta Finance (Pty) Ltd’s

preference shares during the year.

Divisional Year in Review

Engineering Solutions Group (ESG)

ESG faced lower customer demand for our products due to

various economic and infrastructure challenges in the regions we

operate in. ESG’s revenue decreased by 1% from R5,24 billion to

R5,18 billion year-on-year, but would have been flat year-on-year

if it were not for the introduction of the countrywide lock-down

because of COVID-19 that reduced our trading days by four days.

A decline in the South African market was countered by increased

revenue in our African entities and the contribution of the

European acquisitions made late in the previous financial year. The

economic slowdown resulted in a buyers’ market where margins

were put under strain. Due to these pressures, ESG’s gross margin

decreased marginally year-on-year.

All ESG businesses embarked on a cost cutting and savings

programme to reduced expenses by a targeted 10% across

ESG. As a result of the very strict cost containment measures by

management, sustainable operating profit (after adding back

impairments and once-off items) decreased by only 3,6% from

R335 million to R323 million year-on-year.

The net impact of IFRS 16 resulted in a charge to the income

statement of R23 million (R32 million positive on the Operating

Profit level).

In the light of the economic downturn and the potential effect

of the COVID-pandemic, all goodwill and investments were

re-assessed and impairments were raised where appropriate,

totalling R543 million.

After a refinement of our stock obsolescence model, an additional

stock obsolescence provision was raised in the current financial

year, increasing our normal obsolescence provision by R135

million. A task team was constituted to focus on reducing obsolete

and slow-moving stock, by offering it to our suppliers and other

distributors both locally and internationally.

The downturn in demand was evident from early September 2019

and served as the catalyst for all ESG companies to commence

an aggressive stock reduction program, where they reviewed all

procurement commitments (imported and local) and delayed

or cancelled these as required. As a result, management has

reduced stock (before any stock provisions) in the second half of

the year by R163 million (R90 million for the full year).

Strict credit control measures and collection policies remains

in place across ESG, with a renewed focus on the collections

of overdue debtors. All ESG companies continued to cover all

debtors over R250 000 with credit insurance and to be cautious,

an additional provision of R15 million was raised due to COVID-19

at year end.

Additionally, extended payment terms were successfully

negotiated with suppliers.

The Department of Mineral Resources has put pressure on mining

companies and local government has, in turn, pressurised State-

Owned Companies to enforce purchasing from local previously

disadvantaged individuals. This has had a major effect on our tool

and equipment business, INDUSTRI, which underwent a major

restructure during the financial year.

The automotive business and its newly acquired Drive Shaft Parts

business performed satisfactorily and continue showing good

growth opportunities, especially in its European operations.

BMG had a tough second half with declining activity in mining and

general industry and volatile foreign exchange rates, resulting in

pressure on gross margins and competitors driving down pricing.

However, some divisions have shown market growth.

Rustenburg Engineering and Foundry faced major challenges in

upgrading equipment and infrastructure related to power outages

and water shortages.

ESG Exports once again showed double digit growth into the

rest of Africa, with Mozambique its main contributor. ESG Exports

also moved to a new facility. The opening of a bond store on

its premises in the new year will further assist with cross border

growth.

The remaining businesses had an acceptable year and have

restructured in anticipation of a tough year ahead.

We have over several years built the capacity and facility at

the BMG premises in Johannesburg, to deliver inventory to our

customers country wide on a next day delivery basis. We have

furthermore invested in an online platform and are determined to

have most of our products available online by September 2020.

BMG has deep and exceptional engineering skills. Our team, led

by Gavin Pelser, engaged with Virgin Unite and BMG is as part of

Global and African Philanthropists, who will help supply ventilators

and oxygen helmets to the African continent.

The Kian Ann Group (KAG)

KAG continues to find trading conditions in South East

Asia highly competitive, particularly in Malaysia, Indonesia

and Singapore itself. This has been the primary reason for

revenue decreasing 20% year-on-year, from S$161,4 million to

S$129,4 million. KAG’s strategy of diversifying its sales into other

geographical locations has helped mitigate this decline. Sales to

non-Asian regions now make up 27% of KAG’s revenue.

Gross profit for the 2020 financial year decreased 35%

year-on-year, mainly due to decreased sales, compounded by

an additional provision for slow moving stocks of S$5 million

(S$4 million after-tax impact) arising from a refinement of

our provisioning methodology during the year.

Total overhead expenses decreased by 9% year-on-year.

The adoption of IFRS 16 has resulted in a decrease of rental

expenses, which was partially offset by the increase in the

depreciation of right-of-use assets.

The performance of KAG was enhanced through the strong

performance of both its investment of 26% in Kunshan Kensetsu

Buhin (KKB) the roller manufacturer in China, as well as its 50%

shareholding in the parts distribution network in Canada and the

USA, where profits rose from S$3,7 million to S$4,7 million, an

improvement of 27%.

KAG’s 2020 results should be considered after taking into

account the exclusion of a once-off additional stock provision,

due to the refinement of the stock policy (S$4 million),

impairment of goodwill (S$0,7 million), fair value gains on

derivative assets (S$2,8 million) and an impairment of its

investment in an associate (S$0,3 million), compared to a gain

on disposal of a subsidiary (S$0,5 million) in FY2019, resulting

in profit attributable to shareholders decreasing by 25%

year-on-year, from S$10,9 million in FY2019 to S$8,2 million

in FY2020.

Board Composition

As at 31 March 2020, Invicta’s Board comprised of eleven

directors in a unitary structure, with five executive directors and

six non-executive directors, of whom two were independent.

While the ratio of independent non-executive to non-executive

directors fell short of the King IV recommendation, the Board

feels that there was nonetheless a balance of power and

authority on the Board.

During the 2020 financial year, Arnold Goldstone announced his

early retirement, effective 31 December 2019, with Steven Joffe

appointed 1 January 2020 as CEO

On 1 May 2020 the Board appointed Mpho Makwana and Frank

Davidson as independent non-executive directors and Iaan van

Heerden as non-executive director. Shareholders will be asked

to confirm their appointments at the next AGM.

Byron Nichles resigned from the board, effective 1 May 2020 to

pursue other interests and David Samuels will retire from the

board after the release of the 2020 annual financial statements.

Per the requirements of the Company’s MOI, a third of non-

executives will retire by rotation and offer themselves for re-

election. The directors retiring by rotation at this year’s AGM are

Dr Christo Wiese, Rashid Wally and Adv. Jacob Wiese. The Board

has confirmed its support of each of these resolutions.

The non-executive chairman, Dr Christo Wiese, is not considered

to be independent as he is also a major shareholder. Mr David

Samuels is appointed as the lead independent non-executive

director to take up the role of the chairman should there be a

conflict. Mpho Makwana will take over this role upon David’s

retirement.

As recommended in terms of King IV, the Board evaluated the

continued independence of Mr David Samuels, having served

on the Board for longer than nine years. The Board agreed that

David remained independent.

Subsequent to year-end, the Board resolved to appoint an

investment committee and to reconstitute the composition of

its committees. The membership of the committees will be as

follows, effective 31 July 2020:

Audit Committee:

Mandate

The topics covered by the Audit Committee’s mandate include

the review of financial information, compliance, internal audit

plans and findings, internal controls and the oversight of the

Group finance functions. It also monitors adequacy of insurance,

IT governance, legal matters, transfer pricing, tax, covenants and

working capital.

The Audit Committee is responsible for the integrity of financial

information and other reports released to the public, combined

assurance and the quality and independence of the external

auditors.

The Audit Committee is supported by the divisional audit

committees, the Risk Sub-Committee and the ICT Committee.

The Committee is satisfied that it has fulfilled its statutory

obligations and duties per its terms of reference during the

financial year. During the year it approved policies related to non-

audit fees, IFRIC23, stock obsolescence, IFRS 16 and reporting

protocols.

During the 2020 financial year the Committee consisted of two

independent non-executive director and one non-executive

director. After the changes to membership on 31 July 2020,

the composition of the Committee will be aligned with the

recommendations of King IV that all members be independent

non-executive directors.

For more information please refer to the Audit Committee Report

on pages 2 to 4 of the Annual Financial Statements

Mandate

The Remuneration Committee is mandated to contribute to the

long-term financial and commercial viability of the Group by

reviewing and maintaining compensation policies and plans, to

enable the Company and Group to attract and retain employees,

managers and executive directors and maintain an effective Board.

The Committee is responsible for assisting the Board to ensure

that the remuneration philosophy is applied consistently

throughout the Group, that the Company remunerates its directors

and executives fairly and responsibly and for ensuring that the

disclosure of such remuneration is accurate, complete and

transparent.

The Committee may request information from management or

external consultants, but no director may take part in a decision

on his or her own remuneration. The Committee is satisfied that it

fulfilled its mandate during the reporting period.

During the year in review the Committee amended the terms of

employment of certain executive directors, and approved bonuses

and increases early in the 2020 financial year. Due to the COVID-19

pandemic, increases in the 2021 financial year have been put on

hold. The Committee further recommended the reduction in the

fees of the non-executive directors for 2020 and 2021 by 25%. This

is in solidarity with staff having taken temporary pay cuts of up to

30% due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Focus areas for 2021 include the regular monitoring of the

impact of COVID-19 on staff salaries and benefits and reviewing

the structure of the short-term and long-term incentives for

executives.

Please also refer to the Remuneration Policy and the Remuneration

Implementation Report.

The Nominations Committee, consisting of the same members

as the Remuneration Committee, but chaired by Dr Christo

Wiese, meets as and when required to discuss the composition

of the board. During FY2020 the Committee interviewed and

recommended the appointment of the new CEO and three new

non-executive directors.

Mandate

Invicta’s Social and Ethics Committee is mandated to monitor the

Group’s activities in terms of Regulation 43 of the Companies Act

(2008). The Committee further guides the Board as to ways to

build and sustain an ethical corporate culture within the Group.

The Committee’s mandate is documented in a regularly reviewed

charter, and includes, inter alia, Group ethics; the 10 UN Global

Compact Principles; good corporate citizenship; environmental

protection, labour and empowerment.

During FY2020 the Committee approved policies on anti-bribery

and corruption, supply chain and environmental code of conduct.

It further reviewed wage gap information, the wellbeing of

employees during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Group BEE

levels.

The Committee is satisfied that it fulfilled its mandate during the

period and confirms that there are no instances of material non-

compliance to disclose.

While the Committee’s composition was short of the

recommended majority of non-executive directors during

FY2020, the membership changes that will become effective on

31 July 2020 will bring the composition in line with the King IV

recommendation.

1/1:

letter of the law and voluntarily imposes additional restrictions on

trading when required.

Directors disclose their other business interests in terms of the

Companies Act and Invicta’s conflict of interest policy. Directors

maintain a register through the Group Company Secretary of

their interests and disclose any interests they may have regarding

discussions to take place at each meeting.

While the Board sets the example and ethical tone, the executive

directors spread this throughout the Group through behavioural

leadership. There is no tolerance for unethical behaviour at any

level in the Group and every instance is investigated and dealt

with in a consistent manner. A code of ethics is in place for staff

and is provided when joining the Group and on an ongoing basis

through electronic platforms.

The Audit Committee and divisional audit committees receives

quarterly reports of calls to the independent whistleblowing

hotline, and reports of any fraudulent activities in the businesses.

The Social and Ethics Committee monitors the Group’s activities

and initiatives on a broader level and approved a new anti-

bribery and corruption policy during the year.

Environmental

protection, public safety

and employee wellness

Our businesses comply with the applicable environmental

standards and are regularly monitored with a view to reducing any

negative impact they may have on the environment.

As the Group is primarily engaged in supply and distribution of

products, we have a relatively low direct environmental impact.

We are nevertheless mindful of ways to minimise the effect our

operations have on the environment and continually monitor

elements such as the carbon footprint of products sourced from

different suppliers and the efficiency of the distribution methods.

Waste recycling occurs as a matter of course and measures

are implemented to ensure no oils and chemicals are allowed

to contaminate the water table and soil. Our businesses are

increasingly moving to solar energy as the costs decrease.

A supply chain social and environmental responsibility code of

conduct was adopted during the financial year.

Occupational health clinics are available to our staff at some of

our facilities to conduct screenings and provide basic medical

assistance. Free flu vaccines are made available at certain

facilities.

The Group has been proactive in addressing the Covid-19

pandemic, with staff education, temperature screening, sanitising

and social distancing implemented at an early stage. Warehouses

implemented shifts with a view to isolating smaller teams from

each other and administrative staff were assisted to enable

remote working wherever possible.

We are committed to continually maintaining the relevant ISO

standards (including 9001, 14001 and 45001) and the OHSAS

18001 Health and Safety Management System as appropriate

across our operations. Dedicated SHEQ officers in our divisions

ensure that our staff’s working environment remains safe.:

Our employees

The continuous education and training of our staff remains a priority in the Group. During the

year ESG launched their Siyakhula Learning Centre which offers high quality product training

to our employees and customers. The centre also provides our employees with a learning

platform containing resources, tools and learning paths to promote personal development,

develop critical sales skills and enhance technical competence.

B-BBEE and empowerment

Invicta South Africa Holdings (Pty) Ltd received a B-BBEE

rating of Level 7 in 2020 and Bearing Man Group (Pty) Ltd

a rating of Level 4.

KIB and AME

ESG remains committed to providing quality industrial

components, technical expertise and superior service

to South African industry in conjunction with our

country’s objective of promoting and uplifting previously

disadvantaged individuals (PDI’s). Societies embattled

by racial or ethnically defined wealth disparities are less

likely to be socially and politically stable. ESG’s B-BBEE

strategy contributes by accelerating the balancing of the

South African economy and fast-tracking the re-entry of

PDI’s into the market.

During FY2019/20 Invicta underwent one of its most

transformative and dynamic years, with the step-change

implementation of a 100% black-owned business

known as AME Kathu in the place of one of ESG’s

most successful branches. With a full year of

trade now under its belt, AME Kathu has achieved

and exceeded its FY2019/20 targets by almost

50%. ESG provides pillars of support for this new

B-BBEE company through systems infrastructure,

finance, HR, training and marketing to ensure

AME Kathu continues to succeed in the

long term.

Imminently, ESG will facilitate the

establishment several new AME

businesses to increase the number of

PDI’s who not only have ownership and

Another of ESG’s B-BBEE initiatives for FY2019/20, is

KIB. A purpose-built procurement company which in its

very first year was able to secure the business from one

of ESG’s largest suppliers. With the intention again of

uplifting PDI’s from within the business, KIB now boasts

23 suppliers and a wide range of products. KIB has

received their first customer referrals, prompting them

to create a platform to onboard new customers. Already

tendering on State-Owned-Enterprise (SOE) business

and listed on many supplier portals, KIB is growing from

strength to strength.:

History of the group through the decades

60’s to

80’s

West Rand Organ Company

(Pty) Ltd, the company that would

become Invicta, was incorporated in 1966

and was listed on the JSE in 1987 under the name

Skirtskip Clothing Limited. The Company disposed of its

interest in clothing manufacture in 1989 and acquired

companies involved in the engineering, textile

and leisure industries. The Company’s name

was changed to Nova Constantia

Limited and it acquired an

interest in Invicta Bearing

Company (Pty) Ltd.

90’s

In 1990 the Company

divested of its textile

interest and in 1991 the retail

bearing and transmission businesses

of Invicta Bearing Company was acquired.

At that time the Company’s divisions included

industrial consumables, engineering, sports goods

and telecommunications, but bearings soon

became the core business. In late 1991, the

Company changed its name to Invicta

Holdings Limited. Over the next

few years Invicta acquired

Autobax, CSE Equipment

Company and

Engineparts.

2010’s

In 2012, Invicta purchased

MacNeil Distributors and created

the Building Supply Group, which was

sold in 2017.

Invicta acquired Kian Ann in 2013 and delisted it

from the Singapore Stock Exchange. Kian Ann established

subsidiaries in Thailand and acquired stakes in Steve Woods

Ltd. in the UK, North American Tractor and Excavator Parts in

Canada, Kunshan Kensetsu Buhin Co Ltd in China, and entered into a joint

venture with SKL Equipment in India.

Meanwhile CEG established Landbou Agriculture After-Market

Spare Parts and acquired ESP Construction After-Market Spares,

HPE Hyundai Construction Equipment and Shamrock

Handling Concepts.

The ESG Group took form with acquisitions of

Man-Dirk, Hansen and Hyflo, Rustenburg

engineering, Forge Industrial Group;

McCloskey crushing equipment,

Driveshaft Parts and

Europe Driveshafts.

2000’s

During the 2000’s, BMG

became a part of Invicta and de-

listed from the JSE. During this decade

BMG acquired OST and established its

hydraulic business and fastener division, while CEG

acquired New Holland SA, Doosan Construction

Equipment and TCM Forklifts

Invicta created a 25% BEE

shareholding for South African

operations and acquired a

60% stake in Tiletoria.:

Governance of risk

The Risk Committee, Audit Committee, the boards of subsidiary companies, executive committees and management at

operational level assist the Board in discharging its responsibility for the governance of risk by identifying, monitoring, and

managing risks on an ongoing basis.

Risk management specifically includes the consideration of:

> the risk profile and management of strategic and operational risk within the Group;

> the risk profile and risk management of major projects and acquisitions;

> the impact of environmental, economic and geopolitical factors;

> the adequacy of self-insurance and external insurance programs; and

> the risk profile and management of information technology.

Risk management is driven bottom-up, with each division conducting a detailed analysis of its external and internal environments.

The results are reviewed and approved at divisional audit committees for submission to the Group Audit Committee. This

information is then re-assessed at Group level in terms of impact and probability. Material risks and any lapses in compliance are

reported to the Board.

Internal Audit

The Internal Audit department is an independent, objective

body providing assurance to the Group’s governance, risk and

control activities, and information to assist in the establishment

and maintenance of an effective system of internal control to

manage the risks associated with the various businesses within

the Group.

To ensure independence, Internal Audit reports functionally

to the Group Audit Committee and administratively to the

Group Commercial Director. Internal Audit is responsible for

undertaking reviews across the Group, examining the internal

controls and management of risks relating to the financial and

operational performance, and compliance activities of the

Group.

Internal Audit has unrestricted access to all information across

the Group to assist with its determination of the types and

levels of governance, risk and control that exist across the

Group. The Internal Audit function for the Asian operations

of the Kian Ann Group is currently outsourced to an external

service provider, RSM.

Internal Audit formally reports any material findings and

matters of significance to the Audit Committees on a quarterly

basis. These reports highlight whether actual or potential

risks to the business are being appropriately managed

and controlled. The progress in addressing previous

unsatisfactory audit findings or results is monitored until

the relevant operational management reports the proper

resolution of the problematic areas.

The Group’s benchmark for an acceptable audit rating is 80%,

with the Group achieving an overall average audit rating of

85% for the past financial year, thereby indicating that the

Group has an adequate and effective system of internal

control.

Internal Audit may also assist in the investigation of

call reports received from the Group’s anti-corruption

whistleblowing service which is made available to all

employees, customers, suppliers and stakeholders.

Key Focus Areas for 2021 will include (in addition to the

above) revising the audit process in line with the COVID-19

pandemic national lockdown restrictions, identifying wasteful

expenditure or abuse and continuing to review and assess

the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls within

the Group and aid in automating and simplifying business

processes to operate more efficiently.:
