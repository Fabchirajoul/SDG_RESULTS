LETTER TO

SHAREHOLDERS

I have said many

times before

that Pepkor is

more than just a

company. Pepkor

has a unique

culture and

deep meaning

for our employees,

customers and

other stakeholders.

In my: letter to shareholders

last year, I described 2019

as a year of consolidation,

and anticipated that Pepkor

would be able to benefit

from that consolidation

phase in the current year.

Pepkor undoubtedly benefited from that

consolidation period, which facilitated us to be

able to survive and emerge strongly from the

unprecedented challenges resulting from the

COVID-19 pandemic.

I am pleased to report that the Pepkor board,

management team and entire staff has worked

tirelessly during this year to protect our

employees and customers from the health and

safety risks, and to ensure that the businesses

survived.

The full lockdown implemented by the South African government in

March 2020, resulted in Pepkor having to absorb continuing costs

for a significant period without the benefit of revenue. During the

lockdown, the board met on a weekly basis to address particularly

the liquidity challenges facing the company. The gradual relaxation

of lockdown regulations by government enabled Pepkor to resume

trading, initially for essential products supplied by our businesses,

and later for our full range of discounted products that are provided

conveniently to our customers. Pepkor was well positioned in the

market, as our customers took advantage of the additional social

benefits and grants that were provided by government to purchase

affordable and essential products and services.

The strong trading post-lockdown and our focus on liquidity

issues, assisted by a successful over-subscribed accelerated

book-build, where slightly less than 5% of the company’s issued

shares were successfully placed, enabled the company to reduce
