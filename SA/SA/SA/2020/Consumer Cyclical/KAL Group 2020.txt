Letter from the chairman of

the Remuneration committee

(“Remcom”)

We present the remuneration report for the year

ended 30 September 2020 with great pleasure.

Our remuneration philosophy complies with

the recommendations of King IV and other

legislative requirements. We are continuously

monitoring any changes in legislation that might

impact our human capital and remuneration

policies and practices.

This report was compiled in the shadow of

the Covid pandemic, a random international

phenomenon that deteriorated the trading

environment and affected every part of the

business. Accordingly, we had to closely monitor

our human capital cost.

We adopted the three-part remuneration report

approach:

Part 2:

contains the

remuneration

policy

Part 1:

consists of a

background statement/

chairman’s: letter

reporting on factors

influencing the

remuneration policy

and any forward-

looking approaches

Part 3:

contains the

remuneration

policy

implementation

report

Remuneration report

The remuneration policy (“policy”) and

implementation report will be put to

shareholders at the upcoming annual general

meeting (“AGM”) for non-binding advisory votes.

This aligns with the JSE Listings Requirements.

The following are the results of the non-binding

advisory votes at the AGM for the past three years:

2019

100%

2018

100%

Context

We experienced a slow start to the year with the

results of the first six months being hampered

by constrained retail consumer spending,

adverse weather conditions, suppressed GDP

growth and increased competitor activity. The

second six months of the financial year bore

the brunt of the Covid impact with the effects

having been felt across the entire organisation.

Despite a difficult trading environment, and

although our targets were not achieved, through

hard work and commitment of the leadership

and their teams, the company was still able to

achieve respectable results.

The Board believes the Group is well positioned

for growth, although cautiously optimistic about

what the new year may herald, and we believe

that with the Group already having shown a high

degree of resilience, the future looks promising.

2020

The advisory votes on the

remuneration report received

96,61% and

98,76%

respectively
