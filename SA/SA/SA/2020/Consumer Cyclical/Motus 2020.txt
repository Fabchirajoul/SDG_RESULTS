Definition of COVID-19 in this report:

COVID-19 in the report refers to a new strain

of the coronavirus that caused a global health crisis.

This pandemic continues to impact most businesses

negatively. The impact of COVID-19 continues to

be felt across the world and in every country in

which Motus operates. In most cases in the report we

only refer to COVID-19 to capture the full extent of

the crisis. Photographs of people without masks were

either taken pre-COVID-19 or full health and safety

protocols were followed as appropriate.:

Managing Director of Renault South Africa

Proprietary Limited. Niall has been the CEO of

Hyundai Automotive South Africa for the past

three years.

Jaco Oosthuizen (48)

BCompt (Hons), CA(SA)

Jaco joined Imperial Holdings in 2001, from

Deloitte & Touche, where he was the General

Manager of the Motor Financial Services business.

letter of grant. After vesting,

the rights may be exercised by a participant within two years after vesting. Upon exercise by

a participant, the difference between the exercise price and the grant price is paid by:

• Delivering Motus shares that will or have been purchased on the open market; or

• Delivering Motus shares that will be received through call options (hedges); or

• The issue of new shares; or

• As a fall-back provision only, by settling the value in cash.

Deferred bonus plan (DBP)

Qualifying senior employees are required to purchase Motus shares which are held in escrow

by the company. On the condition that the participant remains in the employ of the Group and

retains the shares over a three-year period, a matching award of Motus shares is made on

vesting. A participant remains the owner of the shares for the duration of the three-year period

and enjoys all shareholder rights in respect of the shares. Although shares can be sold by the

participant at any stage, the matching award is forfeited in line with the level of sales of the

shares.

This scheme is replaced by the CSPs from the 2020 year and the last vesting of DBPs will take

place in September 2021.

Conditional share plan

Employees receive grants of conditional awards and the vesting is subject to performance

conditions. The performance conditions for the CSP are based on performance targets set by

the board.

The performance conditions applicable to annual CSP allocations are the same as those used

in respect of SARs explained above. For the 2021 financial year, the CSP criteria will be adjusted

to accommodate the current crisis as set out below.

CSPs are only awarded to the most senior employees and replace annual SARs and DBP

allocations.

Allocation of SARs and CSPs

Allocations of SARs and CSPs are made annually based on the following criteria:

• Performance of the participant.

• The job grading of the participant.

• Key retention considerations regarding participants.

The quantum of allocations of SARs and CSPs are calculated using a model developed by PwC

and is determined using the expected value of an allocation expressed as a percentage of

TCTC (fixed remuneration). The percentage allocated is determined based on retention

considerations and the job grading of the participant, which also determines whether a

participant receives both SARs and CSPs or only SARs or only CSPs. From 1 July 2020, only CSPs

will be issued and the number of participants in the scheme has been reduced.
