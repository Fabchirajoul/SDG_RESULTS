KEY OUTCOMES

A$233 000 (2019: A$200 000)

Into our fifth year of partnership, the Mimco

Our Watch initiative raises funds and generates

awareness of the importance of preventing

violence against women. During the year, Mimco

used events, promotional activities, partnerships

with media, and customer engagement campaigns

to drive awareness. A$233 000 from sales on

International Women’s Day in March this year were

donated to Our Watch. Mimco also partnered with

Marie Clare, a leading women’s publisher, with

an editorial and two podcasts to share the Our

Watch story with a wider audience in Australia.
