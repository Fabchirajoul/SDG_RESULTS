Governance

and remuneration:

chairman's fee from R1 800 000 to R1 575 000.

The board approved the appointment of Clifford Raphiri

as chair of the nominations and remuneration committee

with effect from 1 October 2020. Simon Ridley chaired the

committee from April 2019. In November 2019 he stepped

into the role of chair of the audit and risk committee. Given

the complexity of the business, the directors agreed that

focus was necessary in both committees. Simon will remain

a member of the nominations and remuneration committee.

In a year of significant change and less-than-favourable

performance, due in large part to factors outside the control

of the executive, it is crucial that key executive talent is

retained and rewarded for the hard work and innovation

required to remediate the group’s financial performance,

while maintaining the best possible alignment with

shareholder interests.

Remuneration report continued:

chairman's fee from

R1 800 000 to R1 575 000.

The board has recommended a reduction in the chairman’s

fee to align to the market data for companies of a similar size,

following the finalisation of the disposals during the year,

giving due consideration to the extensive involvement by

the chair in assisting with the transition of the new CEO and

to focus on remediation of the group’s financial performance.

The chairman fee remains a single fee.

The proposed fees for 2021 are set out on page 80 of the

integrated report.
