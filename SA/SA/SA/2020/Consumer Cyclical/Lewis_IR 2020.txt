managing director before being

appointed as group chief executive officer in 1991.

Alan retired in 2009 after serving Lewis with great

distinction over four decades. He was a doyen of the

furniture industry and steered the group through its

transition to a public company and the listing on the JSE.

As a non-executive director he made a tremendous

contribution to board and committee affairs with his

extensive knowledge of the business and the credit retail

sector.

Alan’s embracing personality, warmth, wisdom and sense

of humour will be missed by all who knew him.

Appreciation

Thank you to the executive team for their committed

leadership over the past year and during the ensuing

months of the national lockdown. I also extend my

appreciation to our management and staff across the

country and in our neighbouring countries for their

continued loyalty and hard work.

My fellow directors provide insightful guidance and

counsel while executing their oversight responsibilities

and I thank them for their continued support.

The benefit of effective stakeholder relationships has

been evident throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and I

thank our shareholders, customers, regulators, suppliers

and business associates for their engagement and

support during this time.
