Nictus Holdings | Annual Report 2020

Esteemed Stakeholders,

When the 2020 financial year commenced in April last year, we did not expect any major growth in the retail arena. What we did not antici-

pate was that we would see an even further contraction on the retail side.

The process of aligning our business to the changing markets and environment received a lot of focus over the past year and it is satisfying

to see that we made good progress in this regard. With the Covid-19 pandemic that is forcing a new set of rules upon us, I am confident

that with a culture to adapt that was established, we are ready and willing to also face this challenge and further adjust the Group in order

to ensure sustainability.

Financial

Pursuing our growth strategy, especially in the furniture sector, was challenging under the circumstances. This was where we experienced

the biggest contraction on turnover, however we managed to maintain our market share. The Tyres and Motor divisions were also under

pressure but managed to increase their market share and improved on the results of the previous year.

Properties performed better compared with the previous year mainly due to lower interest rates and effective cost management.

Insurance and finance also showed better results than the previous year and managed to grow in turnover and profitability. This was due

to concerted claims and cancellation management, as well as focussing on investment income to increase investment margins.

Finance cost was reduced in excess of 40% with decreased and succeeded to grow operating profit by more than 300% in the past year.

Although the profit was down on the previous year, I am grateful for the results achieved and believe that from this point on we can only

improve on the current status.

Systems and Procedures

We further enhanced our systems and procedures during the past year. We focussed on the control environment throughout the Group and

gained a lot of ground in this regard. The recent pandemic opened our eyes to new ways of doing things more effectively and efficiently

and this will be further explored in the year ahead.

Customers and Stakeholders

The relationship with our suppliers is key to the long-term success and sustainability of the Group. This was experienced and enhanced

during the year under review and will continue in the year to come.

Customers remain pivotal to our business and we managed to grow our market share in most of the sectors we operate in, despite the

difficult circumstances. We remain one of the major players in our retail sectors with all the companies, as well as in the insurance industry.

Learning and Growth

Our workforce stabilized to an energetic, enthusiastic core that is driving the business to new heights to come in the next few years. There

was much emphasis on the training, upskilling and development of our staff. This will be further rolled out in the year ahead.

In my opinion growth in the next few years and in view of the recent pandemic to a macro economy, is unlikely. The Group will only grow if

we reinvent ourselves, and operate more effectively and efficiently by rendering excellent products and service for the next 24 -36 months.

Expectations

With the current situation being unstable and uncertain, I am convinced that we were well-groomed during the past and will be prepared

for the challenges that lie ahead. We enforced a learning culture that is adaptable to change and that is maturing as time goes by.

We as a Group will continue to strive to be exceptional wealth creators in these difficult and uncertain times and with the Grace and support

of our Heavenly Father, we will prevail.

My best wishes to you all,

Philippus Tromp: Managing

Managing Director’s mandate is detailed in the business plan, which includes

the framework for the delegation of authority. The Board boasts a spread of skills and a wealth of experience.

The majority of the members of the Board are non-executive, half of which are independent. The Board is committed to facilitate a balance of authority and

power and believes that, in terms of expertise and experience, an effective composition is achieved. Board decisions are rigorously deliberated and based

on the consensus principle.

The appointment of Directors is a formal process, which the Remuneration and Nomination Committee oversees. The induction process is managed by the

Chairperson and: Managing

Managing Director, and functionally to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee. Internal audits’ coverage plan is risk-based

and is approved by the Audit Committee annually.

The internal audit function forms an important part of the risk management process and is considered in compiling the risk report, which is presented to the

Board for further evaluation.

The Audit Committee oversees the external audit activities, including the recommendation of the appointment, the assessment of required qualifications,

independence, audit approach and methodology, reporting and performance evaluation of the auditors.

The Audit Committee reports to the Board as well as to the shareholders on how it has discharged its duties.

GOVERNANCE OF RISK

The Risk Committee has the objectives to attend to the overview and monitoring of Nictus’ risk management processes. The Risk Committee reports to the

Board and Audit Committee on work undertaken in establishing and maintaining an understanding of the risks that need to be addressed and the adequacy

of actions taken by management to appropriately address such risk areas.

The Board considers and determines the levels of risk tolerance as well as risk appetite during its periodic review of the Group’s risk profile. This risk profile

determines the ambit within which the Board allows management to take on risk-inclined projects. The Board has appointed the Risk Committee to assist

in carrying out its risk responsibilities by providing oversight of Nictus’ risk management activities.
