MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

WILLEM THERON

Chairman

Stakeholders (from employees and

advisers, to analysts and clients)

often ask the question: can they trust

PSG Konsult with their money and

their future?

PSG Insure continued to grow strongly during the current

year, while PSG Wealth performed solidly. PSG Asset

Management experienced an especially difficult year,

however, the board took a long-term view of performance.

PSG KONSULT CONTINUES TO CREATE

VALUE FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS

The group relies on the performance of equity markets.

Therefore, macroeconomic factors like interest rates,

inflation, socioeconomic growth and political stability

affect the group. This year, there were several factors that

swayed the market, including socioeconomic instability in

South Africa, president Trump’s impeachment trial in the

United States, Brexit and the coronavirus (COVID-19).

Despite the changeable external factors, PSG Konsult’s

investment philosophy remains stable and long term.

The group invests in research to develop diversified

PSG Konsult achieved strong results in an

environment where consumer confidence is

low and uncertainty prevalent.

portfolios and clear investment plans. Advisers encourage

clients to adhere to these long-term plans, making only

small adjustments to allow for outside influence.

PSG Konsult’s stable track record is evidence that the

group’s conservative investment approach creates

sustainable financial value for clients. This is the group’s

primary objective. If this objective is achieved, it results in

value and employment stability for employees and advisers,

boosting local economic activity and ultimately delivering

sustainable returns to shareholders.

One of the board’s key functions is to set clear risk

parameters. Advisers are independent and have freedom

when it comes to product choice. However, to ensure

PSG Konsult remains a group that stakeholders can trust,

the risk parameters set by the board apply.

While the group’s focus is on financial value creation,

PSG Konsult’s contribution to stakeholders and to a more

prosperous South Africa is wider than that. The group:

•

safeguards and grows clients’ assets;

•

strives for diversity of employees; and

•

uses its extensive footprint, especially in South Africa,

to help communities.

It is important to the board that the group is, and is seen to

be, a responsible corporate citizen.
