SYNTHESIS:

LETTER

Dear Capprec Investors and

other Stakeholders,

Capital Appreciation is a relative newcomer

to the JSE Listings register in South Africa,

having been constituted as a Special Purposes

Acquisition Company (SPAC) in October 2015 and

only acquiring its first operational businesses

in May 2017. Given the Company’s short history,

it is pleasing for me to be able to comment on

another robust set of Group financial results for

the year ended 31 March 2020.

In short, the Payments division recorded an

increase in its clients’ payment terminal estate

of 32% during the year and a 40% increase in

transaction related revenue. The growing demand

for digital and cloud-based services, enabled the

Services division to increase its revenue by more

than 40%. GovChat, a Group associate, only in

its development phase, already demonstrated

its compelling technology platform by enabling

more than one million qualifying individuals

to electronically apply for the Department of

Social Development’s recent SRD (Social Relief

of Distress) grant, an exceptional achievement,

revealing GovChat’s power of communication and

engagement for multiple applications.

I am encouraged by the impressive

progress each of the operational

subsidiaries has accomplished,

particularly in a year characterised

by declining investor confidence

and economic uncertainty.

Operating environment

The COVID-19 virus identified early in 2020,

with its escalating rate and effect of infections,

has presented one of the most difficult and

testing economic periods that South Africa has

ever encountered. The pandemic has created

unprecedented uncertainty and immeasurable

consequences across every dimension of community

life and commercial endeavour. Its effect on

South Africa and the global economy has been

unparalleled, both in its magnitude and momentum.

Our operational response to the COVID-19 pandemic

is detailed in the operating context section of this

report. I would however wish to record my special

thanks to our Capprec executives and the Group’s

personnel, for their immediate and coordinated

response to the crisis, acting with agility and

collective purpose, fostering co-operation across

divisions, demonstrating their commitment,

technical knowhow, skills and creativity, in caring

for staff and colleagues and in assisting clients to

maintain the functionality of their systems, their

service requirements and generally deal with their

daily needs.

The technology sector

I need not herein dilate on the historical evolution of

technology, it now being germane to every sphere of

human activity and endeavour. Such technological

progress has similarly evolved in the banking and

financial sector and, given each of our business unit’s

proven and well established reputations, the Group

remains well positioned to provide our institutional

and corporate client base with new, creative and

visibly differentiated digital service offerings.

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an even

broader personal and commercial interest in digital

related services. These applications are now being

recognised as essential product delivery channels,

existential for creating, nurturing and maintaining:

Capprec Group long-term share incentive schemes

The share incentive scheme (SIS)

The SIS allows executives and senior managers to participate in the appreciation of Capprec’s share price over

time, subject to predefined performance criteria.

The SIS is an option-type plan (at no cost to the participant), with share options awarded being equity-settled

subsequent to the exercise thereof. The SIS awards a conditional right for a participant to receive a number

of shares, the value of which is equal to the difference between the market value of the Capprec’s share on

the date of exercise and the date of grant. In other words, the participant is able to enjoy the increase in

Capprec’s share price from the date of grant until the date on which the conditional rights are vested and

thereafter exercised.

The share price growth over the SIS period is settled in Capprec ordinary shares, with the gain subject to

income tax. To the extent that the SIS grant price exceeds Capprec’s share price at the time of exercise,

no gain or cost is realised by participants.

The SIS plan has been a successful retention mechanism since listing. This is in line with international trends

towards less volatile and lower geared LTIs, which have proved to provide better alignment with shareholder

interests and are more likely to avoid extreme pay-outs. The Remuneration Committee will assess the future

use of share options on a periodic basis, as required.
