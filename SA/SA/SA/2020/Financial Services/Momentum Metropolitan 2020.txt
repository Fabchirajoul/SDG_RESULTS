CHAIRMAN'S REVIEW

Before Covid-19 struck the Group

had been making good progress

with its Reset and Grow strategy

and was well on the way to

meeting its growth objectives by

F2021.

The Covid-19 pandemic has now

set the Group back by between

18 to 24 months in its Reset

and Grow strategy. It is quite an

unfortunate coincidence that the

Covid-19 pandemic struck our

country at a time when it was

also experiencing an economic

recession, and this combination

of events has resulted in rising

levels of unemployment and

poverty.

Meanwhile, progress with the

fight against corruption in both

government and corporates,

which appears to be endemic,

has been quite disappointing. I

am appalled by the number of

cases of corruption surfacing

that have deprived those facing

unemployment and poverty of

the vital assistance they needed

during the Covid-19 lockdown.

Hopefully, the actions that the

President has now taken to

address corruption and also

to speed up the prosecution

process for those found to be

on the wrong side of the law will

result in rapid and appropriate

action being taken against the

culprits. It is important to restore

the confidence of our nation in

the criminal justice system by

ensuring that acts of corruption

do not go unpunished.
