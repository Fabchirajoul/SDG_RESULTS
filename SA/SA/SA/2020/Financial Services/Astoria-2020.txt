FORM OF PROXY

Attached:

Dear shareholders

On 24 March 2021, RECM and Calibre Ltd (“RAC”) announced the distribution of 90.1% of its shareholding in Astoria to its shareholders.

This process will conclude on 19 April 2021. We write this inaugural shareholder’s: letter to the future shareholders of Astoria, being the

current shareholders of RAC.

ASTORIA’S STRUCTURE

Astoria is a global investment company which is domiciled in Mauritius and has primary listings of its shares on the Mauritius Stock

Exchange (“SEM”) and the JSE Limited(“JSE”).

Astoria’s board takes responsibility for the strategy and governance of the company. The responsibility for managing Astoria’s portfolio

of assets rests with RAC Advisory (Mauritius) Ltd (“RACAM”), a Mauritian domiciled investment advisory company associated with Piet

Viljoen and Jan van Niekerk, who are also non-executive directors of Astoria.

OUR AIM

Astoria aims to grow its Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per share, measured in US Dollars (“US$”), at a high real rate over time. We invest in

good businesses, partner with good management teams, and do so at good prices.

If we manage to achieve this, we will also generate good returns in other currencies, including the South African Rand (“rand”), in which

many of our shareholders own their shares.

There is no restriction on geography, currency or type of investment in Astoria’s mandate. We intend utilising the total flexibility of this

mandate, but our experience, networks, history and understanding currently reside in South Africa and this shows in the composition of

the investment portfolio as it stands.

OUR APPROACH

Our natural inclination leans toward being “value investors”, but as our portfolio shows, we are not blind to opportunities which arise when

investors extrapolate depressed conditions, underestimate future potential or neglect assets due to forced selling, high leverage or just

plain investor fatigue. We respect the capital cycle, where high returns attract more capital, leading to lower returns, and also the other

way around. Scarcity is always valuable.

PORTFOLIO

Astoria purchased a portfolio of assets from RAC on 1 December 2020 for $19.3m. On conclusion of this transaction, Astoria’s Net Asset

Value (“NAV”) per share was 40.1¢ (R6.12). This is the base from which we measure our efforts in growing the NAV per share of Astoria.

By 31 December 2020, the NAV per share had increased to 46.6¢ or R6.83. This uplift of 16% in US$ (11% in rand) was due mainly to the

increase in value of Trans Hex and Afrimat, combined with some rand strength over the month of December.

Letter CL280218)

Name of Entity: Astoria Investments Ltd

Reporting Period: Year ended 31 December 2020

We, the directors of Astoria Investments Ltd, confirm that, to the best of our knowledge, the Company has not fully complied with the

principles of The National Code of Corporate Governance for Mauritius and the King IV on Corporate Governance for South Africa for the

reasons stated below:

PRINCIPLE 15: The Board ensures that assurance services and functions enable an effective control environment, and that

these support the integrity of information for internal decision-making and of Astoria’s external reports Areas of Non-Application

of the Code:

Organisations should consider having an effective and independent internal audit function that has the respect, confidence and cooperation

of both the Board and the management.

Explanation for Non-Application:

The Company has not established an internal audit function due to the Board having decided that the cost of this is not justified bearing in

mind the Company’s size and the relative simplicity of its business model. The Board will consider the need for an internal audit function

on an annual basis, taking into account advice from the Audit and Risk Committee and the Company’s auditors.

letter, terms, audit plan and budgeted audit fees for the

financial year ended 31 December 2020. The Committee considered the fee to be fair and appropriate. No amounts have been paid to the

appointed external auditors for non-audit services during the financial year.

PURPOSE

From an oversight perspective, the Committee is primarily responsible for:

• Assessing the independence of and recommending the appointment of the external auditors;

• Evaluating the performance of the external auditors;

• Reviewing the scope and effectiveness of the external audit functions;

• Determining the fees paid to the auditors and the auditor’s terms of reference;

• Ensuring that the appointment of the auditor complies with the provision of the Companies Act of Mauritius 2001 and any other

legislation relating to the appointment of auditors, the rotation of Audit Firms as well as designated audit partners;

• Agreeing to the timing and nature of reports from the external auditor;

• Considering any problems identified in the going concern or internal control statements;

• Ensuring that adequate books and records have been maintained;

• Ensuring the integrity, reliability and efficiency of the Company’s risk management strategy/ policy and portfolios;

• Ensuring that the Company adheres to the requirements of the relevant regulatory bodies including the Mauritius Financial Services

Commission, SEM and the JSE;

• Resolving and dealing with any complaints concerning the accounting policies, the content and audit of financial statements and

related matters; and

• Ensuring the expertise and experience of the financial director are appropriate.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fair value of unlisted financial instruments held by Astoria are determined using a variety of valuation techniques which require

significant management judgement. The Committee therefore considers the fair value of the unlisted investments as a key area of focus

when reviewing the annual financial statements. As part of the review, the Committee has satisfied itself that the methodologies and inputs

applied in determining the fair values are acceptable methodologies in terms of industry norms. Going forward the Committee will continue

to focus on the determination of the fair values of the unlisted financial instruments.

Following our review of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, the Committee is of the opinion that, in all

material respects, they comply with the relevant provisions of the Mauritian Companies Act 2001 and International Financial Reporting

Standards (“IFRS”) and that they show a true and fair view of the financial position as at 31 December 2020 for Astoria and of its financial

performance and cash flows for the year then ended.

not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express an audit opinion or any form of

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider

whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise

appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this

other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Corporate Governance Report

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Corporate Governance Report. Our responsibility under the Financial Services Commission’

Circular: Letter CL280218 is to report on the compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance (the “Code”) disclosed in the Corporate

Governance Report and assess the explanations given for non-compliance with any requirement of the Code. From our assessment of

the disclosures made on corporate governance in the Corporate Governance Report, the Company has complied with the requirements

of the Code

Responsibilities of the

Letter, the Corporate Governance

Report, the Audit and Risk Committee Report, the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Statement of Responsibility by Chief

Financial Officer, the Secretary’s Certification, the Group Structure, the Notice of AGM and the Form of Proxy. The other information does

not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express an audit opinion or any form of

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider

whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise

appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this

other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements

The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International

Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial

statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,

disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either

intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,

whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,

but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be

expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the

audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform

audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve

collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the

circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures

made by the directors.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence

obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability

to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report

to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions

are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the

company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial

statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
