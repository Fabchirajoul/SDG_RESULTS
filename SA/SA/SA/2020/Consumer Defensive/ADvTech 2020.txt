Code of conduct

ADvTECH’s code of conduct outlines what the

group considers appropriate behaviour and is

circulated to all employees.

Insider trading

The group has a board approved policy on insider

trading which states that no director, executive,

manager or any employee who is likely to come

into possession of price-sensitive information may

deal directly or indirectly in the company’s shares

during closed periods.

Dealing in the company’s shares by directors and

members of the leadership operating committees

necessitates the prior clearance from the chairman

and group CEO (as applicable). The company

secretary retains a record of such dealings and

approvals. Identified employees who are likely to

have access to price-sensitive information require

clearance from the group CEO before trading in

the company’s shares.

Malus and clawback policy

During 2020, ADvTECH adopted a malus and clawback policy with

the intention of aligning shareholder interests and the remuneration

outcomes of employees. It allows the group to reduce or recoup the

incentive remuneration in defined circumstances and is applicable to

all ADvTECH employees who participate in the variable incentive

remuneration programme.

Examples where the malus and clawback policy would be

implemented include, but are not limited to:

• where a material misstatement resulted in an adjustment in the

audited consolidated accounts of the company or the audited

accounts of any member of the group; and/or

• where any information used to determine the quantum of an

incentive remuneration amount was based on an error, or inaccurate

or misleading information; and/or

• where any action or conduct of a participant which, in the

reasonable opinion of the board, amounts to serious misconduct;

and/or

• where any events or behaviour of a participant or the existence of

events attributable to a participant, which led to the censure of the

company or a member of the group by a regulatory authority, or

have had a significant detrimental impact on the reputation of the

company; and/or

• the board or RemCom, in their discretion, deems it necessary to

apply malus or clawback.

Minimum shareholder requirements policy

ADvTECH has adopted a minimum shareholder requirement (MSR)

policy with the intention to align shareholder interests with executive

objectives and to drive an increased level of executive accountability

for the longer-term sustainability of the organisation.

The policy is based on the following principles:

• Each executive’s MSR target is determined using the individual

guaranteed annual remuneration.

• The target must be achieved within five years from approval of this

policy (March 2021) or from the start date in the case of new

appointees, unless otherwise determined by the RemCom

considering market conditions and related factors.

• The scheme is not intended to compel executives to incur debt to

acquire ADvTECH shares, but rather that executives should retain

shares acquired through the operation of share incentive schemes.
