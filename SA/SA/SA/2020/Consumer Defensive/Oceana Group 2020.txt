DEAR SHAREHOLDERS

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Oceana Group Limited’s 2020 Remuneration Report.

This report summarises the Group’s philosophy, policy and framework for remuneration with a particular focus on executive directors,

non-executive directors and management. Payments made to non-executive and executive directors during the year can be found in our

AFS at http://oceana.co.za/investors/financial-results/

Oceana remains committed to responsible corporate governance practices, creating sustainable growth in shareholder value through

consistent improvement in earnings, growth and expansion of capital, and engaging with its shareholders and other stakeholders.

As the REMNOM, it is our responsibility to ensure that responsible governance practices have been implemented and to provide a clear

understanding of our remuneration policy.

In line with our commitment to fair and responsible remuneration, we continuously review our remuneration policies and practices to

ensure that they remain fit for purpose and are aligned with Oceana’s strategic objectives. We regularly investigate the internal wage gap

and any disparities within remuneration within the Group, with the average increase in executive remuneration being determined after

consideration of the average increase in remuneration for management and general staff. In 2020, the average executive increases were

once again lower than that of other employees.

We have carefully reviewed the Group’s remuneration policy and ensured that the remuneration practices are aligned with the policy

objectives. The committee is satisfied that our current remuneration policy is still relevant and has thus agreed that the reward framework

will remain in place.: LETTER FROM THE

CHAIRMAN OF THE

REMUNERATION AND

NOMINATION COMMITTEE

(REMNOM)

Oceana remains committed to

responsible corporate governance

practices, creating sustainable

growth in shareholder value through

consistent improvement in earnings,

growth and expansion of capital,

and engaging with its shareholders

and other stakeholders.
