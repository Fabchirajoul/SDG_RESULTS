PBT GROUP • INTEGRATED REPORT 2020

LETTER TO

STAKEHOLDERS

PBT Group is pleased to report its results for

the period under review. As our year-end was at

31 March 2020, these results have not been materially

impacted by the devastating effect of the COVID-19

pandemic on the South African and world economies.

Although our business model suits remote working,

the possible effect on our results for the next reporting

period is largely unknown. We are grateful for a good

start to the new financial year and for satisfactory cash

conversion during April and May 2020. Our statement

of financial position is strong and we are confident

that we can weather the storm.

Business activities and Group results

In 2019 PBT Group funded Spalding Investments 10 Proprietary Limited, a BEE

and staff-owned company, by subscribing for preference shares to the value of

R16.5 million in the company. As the only surety for this investment is the underlying

investment in PBT Group Limited, this investment has been eliminated from the

consolidated statement of financial position. Similarly, the preference dividend of

R1.2 million received has been eliminated from the consolidated statement of profit

or loss and other comprehensive income. The total shareholding of 10 373 282 is

treated as treasury shares for accounting purposes.

The earnings per share and headline earnings per share have been reflected as a

split between continuing and discontinued operations.

•

Total profit after tax from continuing operations for the period was R46.0 million

(March 2019: R33.7 million).

•

The profit before tax for continuing operations for the period was R66.0 million

(March 2019: R50.7 million).

•

Headline earnings per share was 30.79 cents per share (March 2019: 19.17 cents

per share, post 1-for-10 share consolidation).

•

Headline earnings per share for continuing operations was 30.79 cents per

share (March 2019: 18.18 cents per share, post 1-for-10 share consolidation).

•

Headline earnings per share for discontinued operations was 0.00 cents per

share (March 2019: 0.99 cents per share, post 1-for-10 share consolidation).

•

Earnings per share was 30.65 cents per share (March 2019: 25.32 cents per

share, post 1-for-10 share consolidation).

•

Earnings per share for continuing operations was 30.65 cents per share

(March 2019: 17.97 cents per share, post 1-for-10 share consolidation).

•

Earnings per share for discontinued operations was 0.00 cents per share

(March 2019: 7.35 cents per share, post 1-for-10 share consolidation).

LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS [CONTINUED]

Whilst in the process of assembling the accelerators to

enhance our data services, our application development

competency also expanded unexpectedly. The open-

source approach to create the accelerators and enable ease

of integration, configuration and platform independency,

required specialised application development and not only

data skills. Our application development team has not only

achieved great results internally, but also client facing.

The team participated in the very successful development

of a mobile application. The application is being used

extensively in the financial sector and more phases of

enhancements are in the planning phase. The experience

gained from this also enables PBT Group to establish new

opportunities in the data services market – COVID-19 data

being one example and client behaviour another.

PBT Group has maintained a sound business strategy that

is based on a solutions approach in adding value to our

clients.

The strategic objectives that underpin PBT Group’s ongoing

success are:

Be technology agnostic

PBT Group has throughout its existence remained

technology agnostic. As data integrators we have adopted

and adjusted to many technology stacks over the years in

alignment with our clients, whilst remaining objective. This

has enabled us to always assist with a true client solutions

approach, rather than a technology approach. We view

technology as an enabler, not a solution. We believe that

our clients support this trust and objectivity.

Specialise in data

Data specialisation remains the basis of PBT Group as

an organisation. Data explosion has been an ongoing

phenomenon. It started off with the internet, but has

truly gained momentum with the introduction of social

media, mobile technology and the Internet of Things (loT)

(millions of devices, from cars to fridges, are connected

and continuously generate petabytes of data). Data has

therefore become central to every single business aspect,

e.g. recruitment, procurement, finance, marketing, strategy

and planning. Client engagement and retention is no longer

possible without near real-time access to data. The ongoing

evolvement of technology enables the harnessing of big

data and significant progression in more advanced analytical

techniques resulting in AI. AI, when applied effectively,

in turn is transforming and adding value in many industries.

However, at the heart of it all is data, and this will not change

in the foreseeable future.

Worldwide expansion

PBT Group is continuing to build our consultant base

on experience obtained over more than two decades to

maintain world-class standards. We are now competing

internationally with operations in Melbourne (Australia),

PBT Group remains

committed to sound

corporate governance

principles, including

integrity, transparency

and accountability, and we

subscribe to the Code of

Corporate Practices and

Conduct as set out

in King IV.

Dublin (Ireland), London (United Kingdom) and Amsterdam

(the

Netherlands).

Through

partnerships,

successful

projects and our traditional high-quality delivery, all the

mentioned markets are now set to expand within the next 18

to 24 months, depending on the impact of the unexpected

pandemic of COVID-19.

Big data/data lake

The term big data, now often referred to in the context of a

data lake, originated from the accessibility to unstructured

data, to differentiate it from other/structured data. A data

lake is becoming the norm rather than the exception and it

might soon become “just data” again. A large component of

PBT Group’s consulting base has been part of the industry

that gave rise to the term big data. The telecommunication

companies were the first to generate millions of records of

data every second. The social media phenomenon further

opened the door for petabytes of unstructured data

in the form of videos, pictures and text to be generated

continuously. They were also the first to realise the potential

of analysing the data. Connectivity is what defined big

data. Being part of this process allowed PBT Group to gain

valuable experience and is assisting greatly in many data

lake initiatives.

Cloud

With the advent of the big data and data lake concepts,

the move to the cloud was inevitable. More and more data

required scalable infrastructure which was not financially

viable within a decentralised model. Cloud environments

allow businesses to focus on core differentiators whilst

being able to outsource standard components and availing

Letter to Stakeholders, which

contains the details of the distribution, was distributed to

shareholders on Friday, 17 July 2020.

The implications of the elections above are as follows:

•

A gross dividend of 11 cents per PBT ordinary share from

income reserves will be subject to dividend withholding

tax at a rate of 20%. Consequently, a net final dividend

of 8.8 cents per share will be distributed to those

shareholders who are not exempt from paying dividend

tax. In terms of dividend tax legislation, the dividend

tax amount due will be withheld and paid over to the

South African Revenue Service by a nominee company,

stockbroker or Central Securities Depository Participant

(CSDP) (collectively the “regulated intermediary”) on

behalf of the shareholders. However, all shareholders

choosing this option should declare their status to

their regulated intermediary, as they may qualify for a

reduced dividend tax rate or exemption.

•

A capital reduction distribution of 11 cents per PBT

ordinary share is not subject to dividend withholding

tax as the distribution is paid out of capital reserves.

As the distribution will be regarded as a return of capital

and may therefore have potential capital gains tax

consequences, shareholders are advised to consult their

tax advisers regarding the impact of the distribution.

Please refer to the Directors’ Report for more details on the

distribution timetable.

Acknowledgements

We would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our

clients for their continuing support, our staff, management

and our Board of Directors for their hard work and input

during the 2020 financial year.
