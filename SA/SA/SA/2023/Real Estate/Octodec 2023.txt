OUR LEADERSHIP

CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW:

managing director

In response to shareholder feedback, the board is investigating the possibility and viability, including cost,

of internalising the management function. A vital consideration is whether ultimately an internalisation will

make a measurable positive impact on Octodec and its shareholders. Shareholders will be kept abreast of

developments in this regard.

Additional topics that received board attention

The board’s key areas of focus also included exploring development opportunities and potential disposals and

acquisitions to refine Octodec’s portfolio and boost distributable income. We emphasised maintaining a robust

balance sheet, ensuring healthy cash flows, and adhering to bank covenants.

ESG considerations also received attention. The board has welcomed and embraced ESG principles and

integrated them into our oversight of business management. It has become part of our DNA. We actively

incorporate ESG into our risk assessments and mitigation strategies; including during the review of the group

strategy, the consideration of refurbishments, disposals and acquisitions, and energy-related challenges.

Our long-standing commitment to strong governance and ethical conduct remains unwavering. We strive to

operate ethically and responsibly to deliver the best outcomes for all stakeholders. We also oversaw the proper

documentation and implementation of compliance management plans for both essential and topic-specific

regulatory requirements.

ESG considerations and principles have become part of our DNA.

Additionally, we focused on enhancing internal controls within the information and communication technology

environment, particularly in areas like cybersecurity.

The audit committee oversees these crucial areas, and in March, the board participated in a cybersecurity

training. This emphasis on cybersecurity was not prompted by any specific incident but by the recognition that

the world of technology is rapidly changing and companies must be prepared for all that this might entail and

that we must be adaptable. Data protection and backups have always been priorities; however, the dynamic

technology landscape necessitated our focused attention.

We are satisfied that the group has taken the necessary steps to mitigate risks, enhance systems and ensure

the appropriate skills are available within City Property.

In closing

We do not anticipate substantial improvements to the operating environment in 2024. Successfully navigating

this period will require sustained diligence, dedicated effort and candid discussions.

The Octodec board is dedicated and industrious. Our directors are approachable, open to discussions

and maintain a collegial rapport. I thank my fellow Board members and the Management and employees

of Octodec and City Property for their dedication and support during a challenging year. Without all of you,

Octodec’s success would not be possible.

Chairman’s

review

Insights from our: managing director

A: Our property portfolio is unique due to its geographical concentration, which can be challenging but is offset by diversification across our various sectors. Vacancies are diminishing, particularly in the residential sector.

I am proud of our residential performance, even during economic downturns. Rising interest rates have led to higher demand for more affordable housing options. Our residential offering, which makes up 34% of our total portfolio,

primarily targets the in-demand low- to mid-Living Standards Measure (LSM) rental market, which is largely driven by urbanisation.

Our convenience shopping centres consistently excel because they serve essential community needs. In terms of street shops, performance varies between Johannesburg and Tshwane, but both are recovering well post-COVID-19.

A challenge in the CBDs has been that banks are moving away from their traditional large-format CBD branches, due to digitisation. As a result, we have been looking at alternatives for these spaces, including converting them into

smaller spaces to appeal to a broader retail base.

Killarney Mall’s income increased despite higher vacancies. We are working with architects to optimise the space to improve tenant mix and occupancy, and we are negotiating expansions with certain anchor tenants.

Despite municipal challenges, our light industrial tenants are performing well. Our small-scale industrial properties are well-maintained, but some of the surroundings suffer neglect in terms of infrastructure upkeep and maintenance

by the Councils.

The office sector remains subdued. However, a significant proportion of Octodec’s offices serve Government departments and entrepreneurs which provides a good balance of tenant stability and adaptability. We have introduced

free Wi-Fi and shared meeting spaces in certain of our office buildings as a value-add to our tenants.

INSIGHTS FROM OUR

MANAGING DIRECTOR

managing director

A: There are eight Octodec buildings in the vicinity of the explosion. Fortunately, there was no harm to Octodec tenants or employees and all our buildings remained structurally intact. We promptly provided backup generator power and

water to buildings whose services were interrupted until regular services were reinstated by 31 July. The explosion has been reported to our insurers, and the impact on vacancies has been minimal with our overall residential vacancies in

Johannesburg increasing by 1%, from 5% to 6% since the explosion.

In response to the evacuation of Lara’s Place, we opened Anderson Place, a largely unoccupied office building in Marshalltown, to house displaced tenants. Evacuees received tea, coffee, blankets and even Wi-Fi where possible.

This unforeseen explosion emphasised the need for the ongoing maintenance of the extensive underground pipeline network in the city and its surroundings, spotlighting declining regional infrastructure maintenance. While the

incident may raise concerns about CBD operations, it also highlighted Octodec’s ability to manage portfolio risks with agility. An essential factor was having a capable team of building managers and security companies who –

led by Robert Gibson, Head of Department for the Johannesburg commercial portfolio – adeptly handled the situation.

A: The allowance cap significantly impacted many of our student tenants’ capacity to afford rents. We responded by lowering rents on specific units at The Fields to accommodate NSFAS-supported students. We are also actively engaging

with NSFAS and industry peers to seek a solution to the accommodation cap allowances.

In addition, we cater to the demand for affordable, furnished student accommodations, especially for NSFAS-supported students. While the allowance cap has posed challenges for many of our student tenants, it underscores the suitability

of our shared apartment solutions, where students can use their diminished allowance to rent a room in a comfortable and quality apartment with all the amenities they need.

A: The successful completion of the City Property management agreement renegotiation was a highlight this year. Appreciation is due to all those who worked on the details, as well as the board of directors, for their role in

facilitating a seamless and favourable outcome. Our lead independent director, Derek Cohen, explains the process and key elements of the agreement on pages 74 and 75 of this report.

A: Octodec’s strategy has three main objectives: Creating sustainable value for shareholders, optimising our portfolio and strengthening our balance sheet.

Our tenants face difficult market conditions, making it challenging to ensure sustainable rental increases across the portfolio in the face of low employment rates, high inflation and interest rates. However, Octodec’s core competencies

and extensive experience positions us to create lasting value for shareholders by optimising our diverse and affordable portfolio of properties to meet tenant needs.

To improve the quality of our portfolio, we identify properties that are no longer core to our business for disposal and we are selective in deploying capital into investments that deliver attractive yields and meet our standards of

performance into the future. To safeguard our balance sheet, it is essential to be prudent and assess the feasibility and profitability for every investment undertaken.

We sold and transferred seven properties to the value of R109.4 million in 2023, and invested R123.9 million in refurbishments in response to the demand for high quality, affordable spaces.

A highlight for 2023 and moving into 2024, is the renovation project for the vacant building located in the City of Tshwane into the HealthConnect Medical Centre. This project is a testament to our unwavering commitment to meeting community

needs and a response to the growing demand for quality medical suites in the area. We are also investigating the conversion of a vacant office building into a residential building to meet the needs of the lower LSM market.

As part of our annual strategic review, we carefully assessed the evolving landscape, evaluating the ongoing relevance of our current strategy. This assessment guided our efforts to adapt and shape an updated strategy. City Property

and Octodec’s executive and management teams developed a strategy to realise this vision. Our revised vision centres on Octodec’s legacy of innovating to generate sustainable economic value and meet the needs of the

communities we serve.

Particularly during challenging periods, it is crucial that we reaffirm our commitment to enhancing our buildings to support flourishing community ecosystems, while maximising shareholder returns.:

managing director

A: We offer a compelling value proposition tailored to the evolving requirements of tenants. Despite market fluctuations, our focus remains on creating dignified yet cost-effective living, working and shopping spaces. We aim for

innovation within our means, delivering value at a sustainable rate, considering the challenge of high capital costs.

To further enable entry-level affordability, we have enhanced our spaces by equipping 26 existing residential apartments with semi-furnished options, for sharing. The demand for this entry-level space is evident, and we provide affordable

options without compromising on our standards of maintenance, cleanliness and security at our buildings.

Our commitment to enhancing tenant experiences is evident in innovative offerings such as our sought after recreation areas, playgrounds and the cashless laundry facilities. These amenities contribute to tenant satisfaction and retention.

In addition, Octodec takes a proactive and comprehensive approach to environmental sustainability. We strive to integrate sustainability principles into all facets of our operations and have linked them to the Key Performance Indicators

for City Property.

For example, we upgraded the lighting systems in 7 buildings from outdated fluorescent tubes. This switch not only enhances brightness but also reduces consumption, aligning with our environmental and cost-conscious goals. Initiatives

involving solar energy adoption and water saving are also being implemented across our properties.

The implementation of digitised marketing and leasing processes by City Property not only aid efficiency, but also help reduce vacancies.

A: Our success is indelibly linked to the prosperity of the CBDs in Johannesburg and Tshwane.

With a history of transforming Gauteng’s inner cities through property redevelopment and community engagement, Octodec is more than a mere rent collector. We prioritise partnership and community upliftment over sheer profit. We encourage

investors to attend our regular CBD tours to experience first-hand the work we are doing both inside and outside of our properties.

Octodec is a proactive contributor to solutions. As an example, in the CBDs, we have introduced planters and greenery along the exterior of many of our buildings. This not only adds to the visual charm but also offers a welcome contrast to the

urban landscapes. This initiative benefits our tenants and the broader community, all achieved without the need for substantial capital investment.

In addition, Octodec, via its property manager City Property, was proudly involved in the launch of the Church Square Revival Project, a public-private community initiative led in conjunction with the City of Tshwane. Working in close collaboration

with the communities, the rejuvenation project aims to make Church Square, one of the most iconic and historically significant precincts in the country, a cleaner, more accessible tourist destination and public space.

We actively seek to enhance the communities around us by supporting causes linked to education, empowering underprivileged

families and aiding communities in need.

Our recent social initiatives underscore this dedication. Collaborating with the Dis-Chem Foundation, FutureLife, and Nivea, we have provided over two million nutritious meals to children through an anti-hunger initiative. Additionally,

our Kibooks online reading platform – which is free to Octodec tenants – promotes literacy and empowerment among young readers. The establishment of an Early Childhood Development (ECD) centre at Pete’s Place and a

Community Clinic in partnership with Dis-Chem at Perl Modes serves tenants and the local community, while The Fields now boasts an event space hosting movie screenings and mental health talks for student tenants.

Apart from their regular tenant-related responsibilities, our building managers assume a pivotal role in nurturing community connections. Their relationships with various inner-city stakeholders, including community leaders, taxi drivers,

hawkers and more contribute to ensuring safer, cleaner CBD environments and preserving spaces that uphold dignity for everyone.

City Property executive engaged our building managers and other employees through one-on-one “tea-and-a-talk” sessions, as well as the “City Square” group event held in August. As always, we received valuable feedback

and insights from them as the ones with their “boots on the ground”. I want to express my sincere gratitude for the dedication of our exceptional team and employees, who have gone above and beyond during challenging periods.

Your unwavering commitment does not go unnoticed. I also want to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to my chairman and Board of Directors for their valuable ongoing guidance and support.:

Operational opportunities

• Enhancing tenant engagement through digital platforms and data analysis

• Implementing streamlined business process automation to drive cost efficiency

See the City Property chief operating officer’s review on page 48.

At the operational level, we are focused on seizing opportunities such as ESG opportunities:

• Developing and refurbishing buildings to provide quality accommodation that enhances the well-being of our tenants and the communities they reside in

• Adapting residential and commercial spaces to better align with tenant needs and preferences, while incorporating value-added features

• Promoting environmental sustainability by improving energy, water, and waste management practices, and encouraging our tenants to do the same

Our collaborative approach to

stakeholder engagement:

Dear stakeholders

It is my pleasure to provide you with an overview of the activities of the SERT committee for the year.

Committee priorities for 2023

The committee met three times during the year to review performance in the following areas, as required by its terms of reference:

• The governance of stakeholder relationships, introducing specific interventions to improve their quality and effectiveness; improved financial and other reporting was developed to showcase how Octodec addresses

stakeholders’ needs, interests, expectations and concerns

• The enhancement of Octodec’s ethics and whistle-blowing programmes, recognising the increased pressure on employees

• The implementation of Octodec’s transformation strategy to improve its B-BBEE rating, reputation and overall impact

• The implementation of the group human resources strategy and key policies to ensure integration and effective management of employees

• The implementation of Octodec’s environment, health and safety, and quality initiatives through City Property

• Considered plans presented by management to address safety-related compliance in Octodec’s properties

Remuneration

The SERT committee is responsible, inter alia, for the sound governance and oversight of Octodec’s

remuneration policy and implementation. Material matters related to remuneration are covered in our

remuneration review presented from page 88.

Ethical business practices

The committee oversees organisational ethics in accordance with the recommendations of King IVTM.

Octodec adheres to a comprehensive code of ethics, employees’ whistle-blowing policy, and external

whistle-blowing policy, all of which align with the principles outlined in King IVTM.

The values and principles of the United Nations Global Compact are incorporated into our code of ethics,

policies, and procedures. We recognise and respect individuals’ right to anonymity when reporting non-

compliance, and the Be Heard “hotline”, which is outsourced to an independent service provider, Be Heard

Now (Pty) Ltd, serves as an accessible channel for reporting concerns.

The SERT committee actively reviews feedback received through the hotline. In 2023 no contraventions

of the code of ethics or gift register policy were reported, and there were no instances of unethical or

inappropriate behaviour.

Committee mandate

The statutory committee operates in terms of section 72(4) of the Companies Act (read together with Regulation 43 of the Companies Regulations, 2011) and King IVTM, and as a committee of the board for all other duties assigned by

the board on behalf of the group and is governed by board-approved terms of reference, which are reviewed and approved annually by the board.

Guidelines for the SERT committee include the anti-corruption principles of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Employment Equity Act, No 55 of 1998, as well as elements of the JSE Socially

Responsible Index criteria and the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, No 53 of 2003.

The SERT committee is responsible for monitoring the Group’s compliance with relevant legislation and regulations, and prevailing codes of best practice relating to social and economic development, good corporate citizenship, the

environment, health and public safety, consumer relations and labour and employment.

Assisting communities in need

Ending childhood hunger starts with a meal

In another initiative to address the pressing issue of childhood hunger, Octodec and City Property

employees joined forces to pack meals for Rise Against Hunger. The meals we packed are highly

nutritious, comprising rice, soya, a dehydrated vegetable mix and essential minerals and vitamins, all

formulated in line with UNICEF standards to combat malnutrition.

Octodec sponsored 112 903 meals, which will feed 490 children five meals a week for an entire year.

As in previous years, the meals will be distributed to early childhood development centres across

Gauteng through the Rise Against Hunger network.

This project has now spanned over five years, providing nearly 630 000 meals in total and serving as a

powerful reminder of the positive change possible when Corporate South Africa comes together for a

common goal.

This journey would not be possible without the incredible

support of Octodec and City Property. From the bottom of our

hearts, thank you for your dedication to our mission.

Integrated Report 2023

77:

managing director.

Board discussions are robust because the board has a combination of skills, backgrounds,

experiences, and perspectives to thoroughly examine management’s strategic assumptions and guide

the group through an ever-changing and dynamic environment.

Ethical culture

We uphold the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical leadership, instilling trust

and confidence within our diverse stakeholders, including tenants, employees, suppliers, regulators,

investors and society at large. A strong ethical culture serves as a foundation for our core purpose,

values and strategy. To safeguard this ethical culture, we regularly review our governance structures to

align with best practices and adapt to regulatory changes.

The audit, risk and SERT committees report to the board on different aspects of ethics.

The board, assisted by the SERT committee, conducted its annual review of the group’s code of

ethics, which outlines the key behaviours and actions expected by directors, employees, suppliers

and business partners. All employees are required to attest to the code of ethics on appointment.

A group-wide ethics communications campaign continues, with different illustrations of ethical behaviour

frequently communicated to employees. In 2023, the board oversaw ethics training for employees.

The Octodec board is dedicated and industrious. Our directors

are approachable, open to discussions and maintain a collegial

rapport. – Sharon Wapnick, chairman

Good performance

There are well-entrenched structures within the group to ensure that proper assurance and oversight

are given to strategic and operational performance. The board undertook several discussions during the

year related to strategy, performance, governance and risk management. Material matters considered by

the board, and decisions and actions arising, are set out in more detail from page 28.

The board is satisfied that during 2023, Octodec achieved the required outcomes of King IV™. The major

significant control relied on for the achievement of King IV™ outcomes is the reliance on competent and

experienced management and executives who have demonstrated their understanding and capability

to provide the required documentation and processes necessary for the achievement of the outcomes.

Legitimacy

The board retains overall responsibility for the concept of integrated thinking as encapsulated in King IVTM,

which underpins corporate citizenship, stakeholder inclusivity, sustainable development and integrated reporting.

As part of its succession planning strategy, and with the assistance of the nominations committee, the

board committees’ memberships were reviewed to ensure that its members contribute according to

their strengths and diverse experience.

The board ensures that the group’s reports enable stakeholders to make informed assessments of its

performance and longer-term prospects.:

managing director are kept separate and distinct and clearly articulated in the board charter. This

ensures a balance of power and authority and precludes any one director from exercising unfettered powers of decision-making.

the company and the board.

The board is satisfied with the fulfilment of responsibilities in accordance with the board’s charter.

Board committee memberships and attendance

In 2023, board attendance was 98.89%, with committee

attendance 100%, reflecting a steadfast commitment

to effective governance and active participation.

2024 key focus areas

• Maintain a relentless focus on understanding Octodec’s strategy and its future.

• Implement and monitor a succession plan for the managing director.

• Enhance the board’s ability to govern through ongoing uncertainty and volatility, focusing on how

management is addressing geopolitical and economic risks and uncertainty.

• Prioritise board’s oversight through the lens of ESG, including climate risk and DEIB (Diversity,

equity, inclusion, and belonging), embedded in risk and strategy discussions and monitor local and

global regulatory developments. Clarify the role of the committees in overseeing Octodec’s ESG

and climate risks and the scope and quality of ESG/sustainability reports and disclosures.

2023 key focus areas and how they were addressed

• Reformed and refocused Octodec’s strategic vision and medium to long-term strategy. The

revised strategy, which will take effect from the 2024 financial year is outlined on page 24.

• Considered opportunities for development and acquisitions to enhance the portfolio and grow

distributable income, one example is the development of the HealthConnect Medical Centre,

which is detailed on page 54.

• Oversaw ESG initiatives, particularly those relating to the environment and climate change,

following an ESG gap analysis, the outcomes of which are highlighted on page 63.

• Monitored balance sheet management to ensure a healthy cash flow and a balanced approach to

capital and balance sheet management, ensuring compliance with bank covenants. Refer to the

financial director’s review on page 44.

• Documented and mandated compliance management plans in respect of core and topical

regulatory obligations, as identified in the regulatory universe. Information about the strategy and

implementation plan for compliance management, Octodec’s structures for managing compliance

and the key relevant laws and regulations applicable to the group are set out on page 86.

• Underwent training to ensure adequate knowledge of the risks and opportunities related to the

information and communication technology environment, and documented and implemented

internal controls. Refer to the chairman’s review on page 6 for context.

Our board and board committee activities

The activities and matters discussed at board and board committee meetings are guided by annual work

plans, which balance relevant reviews over the course of a financial year. The board charter and detailed

duties of each committee as set out in their respective terms of reference are available on Octodec’s

website: www.octodec.co.za/about-us/#corporate-governance-downloads.

Board

The board charter was reviewed and updated on 16 February 2023. The board focus areas represent

issues, in addition to the normal annual plans, that require heightened intervention or focus in a particular

year or specific strategic support and enablement by the board to achieve the company’s strategic

objectives.

Dear shareholders,

The SERT committee is tasked by the board to establish and

independently oversee the implementation of our total remuneration

philosophy and policy. This will support the achievement of the

group’s strategy and grow stakeholder value on a sustainable basis.

Octodec only employs building staff (building managers, cleaners

and handymen), the group company secretary, the assistant

company secretary, and more recently, the compliance officer

who was appointed on 1 August 2023. Therefore, this remuneration

review only deals with Octodec employees and with the directors’

remuneration, in terms of the Companies Act (see our reporting

boundary on page 4). It also deals separately with the remuneration

paid to City Property for the services performed as property and

asset manager from pages 94 to 103 of this report.

The board recognises total remuneration as a critical tool for

ensuring that employees enable the business to create value

sustainably. The board oversees remuneration practices and

procedures administered by City Property in terms of the

management agreement. City Property uses total remuneration to

attract and retain talented high-calibre, high-performing employees.

Voting results at the previous AGM

There were no material concerns or items raised by shareholders based on the remuneration policy changes that were implemented in

the previous reporting period. The positive response to our improved disclosures is evidenced by the substantial improvement in voting

outcomes at the FY2022 AGM. We received an 88.10% vote in favour of the implementation report. The remuneration policy continued

to receive high voting support, with 88.09% voting in favour. The few shareholders who voted against the remuneration policy and

implementation reports did not request further engagements with Octodec.

In terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, shareholders are required to endorse, by way of a non-binding advisory vote, the remuneration

policy and implementation report as presented in this report. Results of voting at the AGMs since 2021 are shown in the table below:

Octodec is committed to developing and sustaining quality, long-term relationships with all key

stakeholders, including shareholders. Our philosophy is to engage openly and inclusively to

benefit from stakeholders’ insights and address concerns and priorities.

Constructive feedback is shared with our board and relevant board committees and contributes significantly to Octodec’s positioning,

supported by adequate structures, to deliver long-term value for all its stakeholders. We are aware of our competitive and challenging

operating environment and continuously examine any relevant issues raised by our stakeholders to further develop and strengthen Octodec.

input on an ongoing basis throughout the year and not only through their attendance at board and

board committee meetings.:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S

REPORT

To the Shareholders of Octodec Investments Limited

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Octodec Investments Limited and its subsidiaries

(‘the group’) set out on pages 116 to 144, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position

as at 31 August 2023 , and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income,

the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the

year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant

accounting policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated

financial position of the group as at 31 August 2023, and its consolidated financial performance and

consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting

Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities

under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the

Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance

with the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors’ Code of Professional Conduct for Registered Auditors

(IRBA Code) and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of financial statements

of the Group and in South Africa. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the

IRBA Code and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits of the Group

and in South Africa. The IRBA Code is consistent with the corresponding sections of the International

Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants

(including International Independence Standards). We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained

is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.:

letter of representation/: letter of electronic participation, or they must provide the

CSDP or broker with their voting instructions in terms of the relevant custody agreement/mandate entered

into between them and the CSDP or broker.

In the interest of efficiency, shareholders are kindly requested to submit completed forms of proxy at

Tuesday, 30 January 2024. Any forms of proxy not lodged by this time must be e-mailed to TMS to be

Please note that a proxy may delegate his/her authority to act on a shareholder’s behalf to another person,

subject to the restrictions set out in the attached form of proxy as stipulated in section 58(3)(b) of the

Companies Act.

Unless revoked before then, a signed proxy form shall remain valid at any adjournment or postponement

of the AGM and the proxy so appointed shall be entitled to vote, as indicated on the proxy form, on any

resolution (including any resolution which is amended).

CSDPs, brokers or their nominees, as the case may be, are recorded in the company’s subregister as

holders of dematerialised shares held on behalf of an investor/beneficial owner in terms of Strate, when

authorised in terms of their mandate or instructed to do so by the owner on behalf of whom they hold

dematerialised shares in the company, may vote either by appointing a duly authorised representative to

virtually attend and vote at the AGM or by completing the attached form of proxy in accordance with the

instructions thereon and returning it to TMS.

Octodec does not accept responsibility and will not be held liable for any failure on the part of the CSDP
