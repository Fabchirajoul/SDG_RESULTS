Remuneration report:

Dear shareholders,

I am pleased to present Hyprop’s remuneration report for FY2023.

The past year has been difficult, with the fallout from geopolitical events exacerbating an already

challenging environment in which loadshedding and an underperforming economy in South Africa caused

distress for citizens generally, including our stakeholders.

As always, our employees have responded positively - particularly those at our centres who engage directly

with shoppers and tenants who are also dealing with uncertain times. They are deserving of being called

HYperformers.

RemCo is accountable to the Board for ensuring the remuneration policy and practices are aligned with

Hyprop’s strategic objectives, are performance-based and are fair and reasonable to all stakeholders. We

review our remuneration structure regularly to ensure it is consistent with industry best practice, and aim

for a trusted and transparent relationship with stakeholders.

In FY2023 we implemented the new Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) approved by shareholders in July

2022 and aligned the European team’s remuneration to the corporate policies and practices.

We recognise the importance of ensuring RemCo collectively possesses the required skills and expertise.

Gavin Tipper and Stewart Shaw-Taylor stepped down from the Board and RemCo during FY2023, and Spiro

Noussis and Annabel Dallamore were appointed as members of RemCo. I was appointed as the RemCo

Chair, with effect from the 2022 Annual General Meeting.

Progress during FY2023 and focus areas for FY2024

The challenging operational and financial environment, increasing levels of semi-gration from Gauteng

to the Western Cape and emigration from South Africa, and the general skills gaps in South Africa have

heightened the need to focus on retaining and attracting key talent, while also managing costs.

RemCo has placed a greater emphasis on a pay-for-performance philosophy, not only for short- (STI) and

long-term incentives (LTI), but annual total guaranteed package (TGP) increases as well. RemCo has placed an

emphasis on monitoring the affordability of ongoing costs of remuneration increases and awards.

Following the acquisition of 100% of the four EE properties from Hystead in March 2022, RemCo reviewed

and approved a remuneration structure for the Hyprop Europe team in 2023, which is based on the

same remuneration policies and principles as the rest of the Group, and includes cash settled LTPAs and

deferred awards based on the LTIP. A temporary special monthly allowance was implemented to assist EE

employees during the current unprecedented high inflation environment.

Following input from shareholders, the STI and LTI performance measurements and targets for the 2024

awards were aligned with the Group’s strategic objectives. The streamlined measures focus on operational

goals (for Group and each region respectively) for STI measures and strategic financial (total return),

shopping centre health (cost to income ratio) and ESG (B-BBEE, reduction of electricity and water usage)

measures for the LTI.

Remuneration consultants

In FY2023, PwC, Vasdex Associates and 21 Century Proprietary Limited assisted RemCo to ensure

remuneration practices are fair and transparent, competitive and affordable. RemCo is satisfied that the

remuneration consultants engaged were independent and objective.

Shareholder engagement

The Remuneration report aims to provide shareholders with sufficient information to assess the Group’s

remuneration policies and their implementation, in order to make an informed decision when voting on

the remuneration related resolutions proposed at the AGM, in terms of section 66(9) of the Companies Act

and King IV™.

In addition, RemCo formally engages with shareholders to discuss remuneration matters as and when

needed, most recently in June 2022 to discuss the new LTIP.

No engagement with shareholders was required following recent AGMs, at which the applicable remuneration

resolutions were approved by shareholders by the following majorities:

This report is presented in three sections:

Cash Deferred awards

A cash settled incentive in terms of which a portion of awardees’ annual bonus is deferred for a period of

three years subject to the employment condition as specified in the award: letter. The incentive amount

increases/decreases based on performance and is payable in three equal tranches over the vesting period,

provided the awardee remains in the employ of the Group.

Linking remuneration to strategy and performance

The remuneration of Hyprop’s employees, TGP, STIs and LTPAs, are tied to the Group’s performance.

TGP

•

Increases are guided by the performance rating of the individual and the Group’s performance.

•

Exceptional increases may be offered to high performers.

•

Supports the retention of and rewards high performers.

STI (in the form of cash and Deferred awards under the LTIP)

•

Rewards the achievement of challenging financial, operational, ESG and strategic objectives aligned to

Group, portfolio, divisional and centre KPDs.

•

Structured to reward collaborative performance across the Group and create a high-performance

culture.

•

The business KPDs (Group, portfolio, divisional and centre) ensure that employees and teams focus on

the key measures necessary to drive the Group’s performance. Performance is measured against the

business KPDs and individual performance appraisals.

LTPA (in the form of CUP awards, or the LTIP or other LTPAs)

•

Aligns the interests of employees with those of shareholders and the Group’s long-term sustainability.

•

Incentivises performance against key measures aligned to the Group’s strategy.

•

Attracts, motivates and retains executive directors, executive management, senior managers and

employees with specific core, critical and/or strategic skills.

Linking pay to performance

The following graphs illustrate the potential remuneration outcomes for executive directors at threshold,

target and stretch levels (the latter solely for outstanding performance) for awards in the 2024 financial

year comprising TGP, STI and LTPAs. In the event that the threshold level of performance is not achieved,

only the TGP would be payable.

Full details of the LTIP are available on the Company’s website www.hyprop.co.za.

2. Deferred awards

South Africa - an equity settled share plan where a percentage of the annual bonus, determined in accordance with the Company’s remuneration policy, is awarded as Restricted Shares in lieu of paying the

specified percentage of the annual bonus in cash, the vesting of which is subject to the employment condition.

In conjunction with implementation of the LTIP, a cash settled phantom share plan and deferred awards, based on the same principles as the LTIP, were implemented for Eligible Employees of the Group who are

not employed in South Africa, as follows:

1. Cash LTPAs (Long-term performance awards)

A cash settled phantom share plan, with a performance period of not less than 3 years.

This award of phantom shares is subject to forfeiture if the performance conditions and the employment condition as specified in the award: letter are not satisfied.

2. Cash Deferred awards

A cash settled incentive in terms of which a portion of awardees' annual bonus is deferred for a performance period of 3 years. This incentive increases/decreases based on achievement of performance targets

and is payable in 3 tranches over the vesting period, provided the awardee remains in the employ of the Group.

L2.2.2 CUP

The CUP consists of two components – performance shares and retention shares. The allocation between performance and retention shares was 70:30 for all participants.

Awards under the CUP were made on an annual basis. No new awards were made in the current year. Awards are settled by the issue/transfer of Hyprop shares to qualifying employees. These are not new shares

issued but rather shares acquired in the market and held by Hyprop Employee Incentive Scheme.

Performance shares

The performance conditions for shares allocated as performance shares are as follows:

40% Growth in distribution per share relative to the peer group

40% Share price performance relative to the peer group

20% A strategic component, which is determined by the remuneration committee in line with the prevailing circumstances and projects at the time of the award.

Each of the performance conditions is measured over a three-year performance period. Participants must be employed at the end of the vesting period for the award to vest.

Retention shares

Retention shares vest after five years, provided the participant is still employed by the Group.
