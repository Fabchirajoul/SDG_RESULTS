VUKILE 2023 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT:

Dear Shareholders,

Thanks to the work and effort of the entire team of

Castellana Properties and the support of all of you,

we can proudly and emphatically say that we have

closed a year of record numbers since the beginning

of our journey. That is why, once again, we would

like to thank you for your trust.

This work has also been reflected in the area of

sustainability, which is increasingly important

in the company’s business, and we have been

demonstrating this in recent years. Following the

release of our first Annual Sustainability Report

of FY22, we have received multiple awards

that recognise our firm commitment towards

sustainability, good governance, and our mission,

vision, and values.

These include the 3-star rating in our first year

participating in the GRESB ranking, the EPRA

sBPR Gold Award for our efforts in the area of

sustainability and the special EPRA sBPR Most

Improved Award recognising how much we have

improved since we started monitoring our activity.

This year, we aim to continue improving results, so

we will continue producing the Report based on

EPRA criteria and have already adopted the GRI

(Global Reporting Initiative) international standard.

We continue facing challenges with the desire

and enthusiasm to overcome them and to surpass

ourselves. The total value of the portfolio (GAV),

In addition, thanks to Castellana’s team active

management, a differentiating factor compared to

other companies in the sector, the operating net

income (NOI) has been increased in comparative

terms by 9% to 58 million Euros.: Letter from

During this last fiscal year, Castellana

initiatives in our shopping centres, but

also at corporate level, thus building

our future legacy: having generated

Letter from the CEO continued

This type of action reinforces our commitment

to make our shopping centres and retail parks

economic and social drivers for each of the

communities in which they are located. Proof of this

is their capacity to generate employment, as well as

the various grants made to associations and local

authorities through donations, space transfers or

didactic activities and awareness-raising events

such as the latest campaigns against cyberbullying

or the Date al Play campaign, aimed at promoting

physical activity and combating a sedentary

lifestyle.

Regarding the rating of our own employees, in

GPTW (Great Place to Work) we have once again

improved our score for another year. The staff

confidence index, which stands at 91%, improving

by four points on the previous year, shows that we

are the real estate company in Spain with the best

data. This score highlights one of the core values

of Castellana Properties: human capital, that is,

our team, is for us an essential asset and the one

we take the most care of, hence we have the best

industry score in the GPTW score and in the pride

of belonging that is also measured by that score.

Along the same lines, and as we have

demonstrated in the past, in the corporate

governance sphere we continue to focus on

integrity and transparency and have therefore

continued to analyse possible opportunities for

improvement.

During this year, we have improved the entire

Corporate Governance System to further

strengthen our firm commitment to ensuring

compliance with ethical principles of transparency,

integrity and accountability. Proof of this is the

Evaluation of the COSO standards in Castellana

against the best practices of Internal Control, the

Cybersecurity Maturity Analysis under ISO 27001

standard, the Facilities Audit of the operational

and technical management of the assets and the

continuous improvement of the Internal Control

System over Financial Reporting (ICFR), the Crime

Prevention Model or the Corporate Risk Map,

including new emerging risks.

Lastly, the renewal of the EPRA BPR Gold Award

in financial reporting, which tests and rewards the

good work, professionalism and integrity of our

financial team.

As a sign of our commitment to ESG, in this financial

year in Castellana we have developed and put into

effect the Environmental and Energy Management,

Net Zero, Biodiversity, Health and Well-being,

Circular Economy, Positive Local Impact and IT

Government policies.

At Castellana Properties, we are committed to

leading the way to a more sustainable and just

future. So for next fiscal year we will continue

working hard to improve our ESG standards and

make a difference in the community and the

environment, thereby becoming one of the most

profitable yet sustainable retail companies in Spain.
