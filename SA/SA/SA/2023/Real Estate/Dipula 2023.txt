Letter from the Chairman

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present Dipula’s remuneration report for the

2023 financial year.

We firmly believe that providing fair and market-related

remuneration is instrumental in motivating and retaining top-

tier talent. Our committee has meticulously designed our

remuneration policy to incentivise the execution of the

Group’s strategy, a strategy that ultimately generates and

safeguards value for our stakeholders.

To guide our employees, we leverage our strategic value

drivers, which play a pivotal role in assisting them to meet,

and sometimes even surpass, their KPIs. This approach

ensures alignment with our overall strategic objectives and

fosters the achievement of exceptional results.

The Group’s remuneration principles and philosophy remain

the same as the previous year and will continue to be

monitored and implemented by the committee.

Shareholders’ endorsement of the remuneration policy

and remuneration implementation report 2023 AGM

If the remuneration policy or remuneration implementation

report, or both, are voted against by more than 25% of

the votes cast at the AGM of the Company to be held on

21 February 2024, the Company will engage with dissenting

shareholders within 30 days of the AGM to address all

legitimate and reasonable objections and concerns.

2023 AGM feedback

the Group’s remuneration policy and 51% against

the remuneration implementation report. In line with the

Background statement

Part 1

Our vision is to become a leading, diversified South

African REIT that consistently delivers sustainable returns. We

achieve this by providing relevant spaces to our valued

tenant partners, creating meaningful impacts and thinking

beyond conventional boundaries. To realise this mission,

it is imperative that we have a team of highly skilled

employees who embody our corporate values. Consequently,

remuneration becomes a critical tool in attracting and

retaining top-tier talent, individuals who play a pivotal role in

executing our strategy and creating value for all stakeholders.

Dipula has a combined Remuneration and Nomination

Committee, which operates under separate terms of reference

as detailed on

page 106 of this report. During the year,

three of Dipula’s longstanding Board members retired. Syd

Halliday who served as chair on the committee in respect of

remuneration matters was replaced by Nthime Khoele. For

the purpose of this report, reference will be to the

Remuneration Committee (the committee).

letter relating to the Annual Financial Statements that was signed by management;

 Reviewed the external auditor’s report including the key audit matters included in the report;

 Confirmed that the REIT risk management policy has been complied with in all material respects, as further disclosed in the

governance review included in the Integrated Report; and

 Considered the JSE Pro-active Monitoring Report and its impact on the annual financial statements.

Reportable non-compliance of the JSE Listings Requirements

On 17 January 2023, the JSE opened an investigation into the sale by Mr B Azizollahoff of Dipula shares, which was effected

on 19 October 2022 (coinciding with the company’s closed period) and announced on SENS on 21 October 2022. This

dealing was in breach of paragraphs 3.66 and 3.69 of the Listings Requirements, which prohibit directors from dealing in

the company’s securities without first seeking clearance to do so, and dealing in the company’s securities during a closed

period or when in possession of unpublished price-sensitive information.

On 24 May 2023, the JSE found Mr Azizollahoff to be in breach of the Listings Requirements and imposed a public censure

and fine of R50 000. Mr Azizollahoff co-operated fully with the JSE’s investigation, has apologised unreservedly for

this unintentional error and remains a valued member of Dipula’s Board who has provided guidance to the company since

it’s listing.

External auditors

In accordance with paragraphs 3.84(g)(iii) and 22.15(h) of the JSE Listings Requirements, the committee has satisfied itself

that the external auditor, Mazars, is independent of the Group, as required by the Companies Act, which includes consideration

of compliance with criteria relating to independence or conflicts of interest as prescribed by the IRBA. Requisite assurance was

sought and provided by the auditor that internal governance processes within the audit firm support and demonstrate its claim

to independence.

The committee has also satisfied itself with the quality of the external audit work being performed by Mazars in respect of the

financial year-end under review.

There is a formal procedure that governs the process whereby the external auditor is considered for non-audit services. The

committee approved the terms of the service agreement for the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor and

approved the nature and extent of non-audit services that the external auditor provided in terms of the agreed pre-approval

policy. For the year under review, non-audit service fees paid to Mazars were immaterial relative to the audit fees.

The committee nominated and recommended the re-appointment of Mazars as the external auditor of Dipula Income Fund

Limited, as well as the re-appointment of the designated partner, Susan Truter. The 31 August 2024 financial year will be the

fifth year of Mazars’ appointment as the Company’s external auditor and Susan Truter as the lead partner.

Internal financial controls and the finance function

The internal audit function is outsourced to an independent service provider and is an integral part of the risk management

framework. Internal audit reports directly to the committee and operates in terms of the internal audit plan approved by the

committee. Based on enquiries made, the assurance obtained from management and the reports obtained from the internal

and external auditors, the committee has satisfied itself that no significant breakdown in current controls, procedures and

systems have occurred during the year that could have a material impact on financial reporting.

Tax and treasury oversight

The committee receives regular feedback on both tax compliance and tax risk matters of the Group from management and is

satisfied that the Group faces no material tax risks or that a material non-compliance event has occurred.

In respect of the treasury function, the committee receives regular feedback on the Group debt, debt covenants and interest

rate hedge position and is satisfied that treasury risks are adequately managed.

IT governance

The committee periodically reviews the Group’s management and operation of IT and considers it appropriate to enable the

Group to function optimally and securely.

Going concern

The committee, through its review of the 2024 budget, cash flows and consideration of the solvency and liquidity assessments

together with discussions with management, reported to the Board that it supported management’s view that the Group will

be a going concern for the next financial year.

Annual financial statements

The committee assists the Board with all financial reporting and reviews the Annual Financial Statements, as well as results

announcements and interim financial information.

The committee was satisfied with adequate accounting treatment of the matter.

Following a review by the committee and based on processes and assurances obtained, the committee recommended the

Annual Financial Statements of Dipula Income Fund Limited for the year ended 31 August 2023 to the Board for approval.
