Integrated report 2023

2:

letter in the 2022

integrated report that the application of discretion might be required by

the committee in interpreting and applying the affected factors to ensure

that FY2023 STI outcomes were reasonable from both executives’ and

shareholders’ perspectives.

Initial scoring of the FY2023 scorecard resulted in pro forma performance

outcomes for the three executive directors of between 122% and 135%,

owing to several of the KPIs scoring being above target and at stretch.

The committee, however, considered that this initial percentage score

would result in overly generous bonuses for the executive directors, given

the circumstances of the past financial year. Accordingly, in approving the

final bonuses for the three executive directors, the committee applied a

discretionary deduction of 25% off the top of the amounts as generated by

the STI scorecard and bonus formula, which resulted in FY2023 bonuses

being paid to the directors of between 92% and 103% of their respective

total guaranteed annual packages (TGPs).

The committee recognises that its decision to pay bonuses at this level

to the executive directors may be ill-received by some shareholders in

the context of the company having lost its REIT status in FY2023. The

committee was, however, of the view that it was appropriate to award

these moderated bonuses to the executive directors on the strength of

their overall delivery against the scorecard KPIs relating to operational

performance, balance sheet management and strategy implementation,

which were all met by management.

letter in the 2020 integrated report, that the

exercise of discretion might be required by the committee in October 2023

to moderate any unintended outcomes when these FY2020 awards came

up for vesting after the expiry of their three-year vesting period.

Initial assessment by the committee of the stipulated performance criteria

for the FY2020 awards yielded scores of above-target on both financial

measures and at-stretch for both non-financial measures, thus indicating

a vesting percentage of 174% of the original awards. The committee

recognised that this vesting outcome could be considered a ‘windfall gain’

as contemplated in principle 14 of King IV, when viewed in conjunction

with the material recovery in the FFB share price since the date of original

grant of these awards in October 2020.

In accordance with its stated commitment to good corporate governance

and remuneration practices, the committee therefore sought to exercise

discretion to limit the scoring on both the financial and non-financial

measures so as to arrive at a moderated vesting outcome. The committee

has, however, been legally unable to do so, owing to the absence of an

explicit right of discretion in the CSP rules, as approved by shareholders in

December 2019, allowing the committee, post expiry of the vesting period,

to override the vesting outcomes as determined by strict assessment of

the stipulated performance conditions.

Accordingly, the committee’s remedies to this unforeseen outcome of the

FY2023 CSP awards have been limited to taking steps, firstly, to ensure

that this situation cannot recur in future years and, secondly, to effect

some clawback in the next round of annual CSP awards of what the

committee deems as ‘windfall’ vesting, through implementing the following

rectifying actions:

• Amendment of the committee’s charter to entrench, as an overarching

principle, the right of discretion of the committee as an implicit and

fundamental element of all remuneration components

• Review of the CSP rules with a view to incorporating an explicit legal

right of the committee to exercise discretion to moderate the final

quantum of conditional awards post vesting so as to moderate future

‘windfall’ outcomes, as defined

• Limitation in the FY2023 annual round of CSP awards of any awards to

be granted to the beneficiaries of this FY2020 CSP vesting to 50% of

the ‘normal’ level of awards they might otherwise have been granted

• Adjustment to the annual CSP award ranges by lowering the bottom

end of the range by 10% and resetting the ‘normal’ level of annual

award to the midpoint from the top of the range, as has been practice

in the past.

The latter two actions, namely the limitation of the FY2023 CSP awards

for the FY2020 CSP participants and the resetting of the annual award

ranges, have been agreed with the executive directors and other scheme

participants and will be implemented at the time of making the FY2023

CSP awards, which, as will be explained later in this report, the committee

has decided to defer until after the shareholder general meetings to vote

on the proposed scheme of arrangement in process.

Given the legal constraint on the committee’s ability to exercise discretion

in respect of the FY2020 CSP awards post vesting, the committee trusts

that its commitment to the implementation of the above rectifying and

other related actions will be seen as facilitating appropriate alignment of

management and shareholder interests and upholding a culture of best

practice remuneration governance.

Details of the vesting of FY2020 CSP awards are provided in the FY2023

remuneration implementation report on page 93.

Framing of FY2024 scorecard

At the time of compiling the FY2024 remuneration policy, the committee

has again been faced with the uncertainty of a possible change to the

company’s capital structure through a scheme of arrangement to buy

back all FFB shares using a portion of the company’s shareholding in

NEPI Rockcastle. If this scheme is approved by shareholders, it will have

significant impacts on the company’s balance sheet and income statement

in FY2024 and beyond, and hence on some of the key parameters used

in the STI scorecard. The committee has therefore decided to frame the

potentially affected metrics and targets for FY2024 on the assumption

that the proposed scheme of arrangement will not be passed, with the

intention of resetting them with retrospective effect, in the event that the

scheme is approved.

Following the engagements with and feedback from shareholders, the

committee has made several changes to the structure and composition

of the STI scorecard for FY2024, particularly in response to calls for

the simplification of the scorecard through fewer and clearer KPIs, for

the introduction of more relative (as opposed to absolute) performance

measures and for the replacement of qualitative measures with more

objectively measurable metrics. The committee has also revised the

weightings of KPIs considered to be of particular strategic importance over

the coming financial year, notably management of the company’s gearing

level, continuation of the asset recycling programme and roll-out of the

sustainable energy projects.

The committee is comfortable that the revised FY2024 STI scorecard

represents an appropriate balance of relevant performance factors,

comprising a mix of financial versus non-financial, quantitative versus

qualitative and company versus individual measures.

Details of the executive directors’ FY2024 STI scorecards are provided in

the FY2024 remuneration policy report on page 99.

Deferral of FY2023 CSP awards

In accordance with its annual remuneration cycle, the committee would

normally have approved an annual round of CSP awards in October 2023

in respect of FY2023. As with the framing of the FY2024 STI scorecard,

the making of these FY2023 CSP awards has, however, been complicated

by the proposed scheme of arrangement currently in progress, to the

extent that any fresh award of conditional shares under the CSP might

be deemed to constitute a ‘prohibited share issue’ in terms of the TRP

regulations applicable to the scheme.

Accordingly, the committee has decided that it would be advisable to defer

the making of any FY2023 CSP awards until after the shareholder general
