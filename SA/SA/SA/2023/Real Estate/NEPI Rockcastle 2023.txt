Chairman's statement

NEPI Rockcastle’s results in 2023 exceeded expectations

yet again, setting a new record for earnings per share.

The key driver was the operational performance of

our properties, where we saw a solid increase in

Net Operating Income (NOI) across all the countries,

underpinned by rising footfall and tenant sales. The

quality of the Group’s assets was confirmed by the

strong interest shown by both retailers and consumers, as

evidenced by higher occupancy and an increased number

of visitors.

This year’s performance was supported by a more

favorable macroeconomic environment in Central and

Eastern Europe (CEE) than anticipated at the start of

2023. Although economic growth slowed down due to

high inflation and restrictive monetary policies prevalent

throughout the period, the region managed to avoid

a recession and continued to outpace the Western

European economies. Inflation rates began to decline, and

together with falling energy and commodities prices, the

stage has been set for more relaxed monetary conditions

in 2024. Additionally, consumption habits in CEE continue

to support traditional retail. Customers in our region

were relatively undeterred by high inflation, compared to

their western peers, while online retail penetration rates

remain low.

Active asset management, delivered through an

integrated in-house platform, has helped NEPI Rockcastle

outperform most of its peers across a wide range of

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). A sustainable growth

mindset drives both the day-to-day operation of our

properties and the investments we make in developments

or acquisitions of existing assets with strong potential.

The acquisitions made in 2022 and the developments

completed in 2023 have already made a notable impact

on results. We will continue to look for such opportunities

to grow the business through accretive investments as

well as organically.

Financially, we continued to secure the resources for

future growth, all the while being mindful of the

challenges ahead. Our balance sheet is as strong as

ever. For the last two half-years, we have given our

shareholders the opportunity to acquire new shares via

a scrip dividend, a proposition that has been taken up

by a large majority. We also prepared the Group for

the next material debt maturity, that of the bond issue

expiring November 2024, by contracting a green loan

from a syndicate led by IFC. The valuation of the Group’s

portfolio continued to increase, which was rare among

our peers in 2023. The conclusion from the above is that

the Group remains in a very solid financial position, with

conservative leverage and no major unfunded obligation

coming due in the near future.

ESG remains of utmost importance to the Company, and

we continued to make significant progress in achieving

major reductions in the Group’s emissions and carbon

footprint. Sustainability is now closely connected with

our financing, all new facilities having green features. We

completed the installation of solar panels in almost all

Romanian properties and started to produce green energy

for a significant portion of our needs. The Company’s

efforts are supported by a dedicated Sustainability

Committee at the Board level.

I would like to thank my fellow Board members,

management and the entire NEPI Rockcastle team for

another year of great results and achievements. I am

confident there will be more to come.

Investment Committee

Members of the Investment Committee must have

signiﬁcant property investment, retail and relevant market

knowledge. The Investment Committee Chair must be

a non-Executive Director with adequate ﬁnancial and

investment experience.

The senior management of the Group is responsible for

identifying new investment opportunities, optimising the

performance of existing assets (for example, through

refurbishments, extensions and re-tenanting), and, where

necessary, proposing the disposal of assets which

no longer contribute to the Group’s income growth

strategy. The CEO will coordinate and monitor all

acquisitions, capital expenditures and disposals, and will

recommend those which exceed his mandate to the

Investment Committee.

The Committee is responsible for formulating the

overall investment strategy of the Group and for

establishing investment guidelines. The Committee’s

activity complies with all applicable ﬁduciary, prudence

and due diligence requirements, which experienced

investment professionals would utilise, and with all

applicable laws, rules and regulations issued by relevant

local and international bodies.

The purpose of the Investment Committee is to:

•

consider management recommendations for mergers,

acquisitions, investments, capital expenditure and

disposals, and make proposals to the Board

for approval

•

authorise transactions that fall within its mandate,

analyse and recommend to the Board those that fall

outside its mandate

•

evaluate and monitor investments performance

over time.

The Board and the Committees considered their activity

during 2023 and conﬁrm that they are satisﬁed that they

have fulﬁlled their responsibilities in accordance with their

charters and the Corporate Governance Framework.

Stakeholder engagement and

relationship management

The Board oversees stakeholder relationship management,

while responsibility for the day-to-day execution has been

delegated to the Executive Directors and, further on, to

line management.

NEPI Rockcastle has a transparent information

communication policy, enabling stakeholders to assess

the Group’s economic value and prospects. The Company

encourages proactive engagement with shareholders,

including during the Company’s semi-annual results

presentations and Annual General Meetings, where

Directors are available to respond to shareholders’

inquiries on how the Board has executed its

governance duties.

The Executive Directors have regular discussions on

operational trends and ﬁnancial performance with relevant

stakeholders, where they believe this to be in the Group’s

best interest. No information is shared preferentially only

to some stakeholders.
