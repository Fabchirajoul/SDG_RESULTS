Managing Director

and Chief Executive Officer Godfrey Gomwe on

page 5, where he has provided an account of

the business of the year, and how management

has executed its strategies. These developments

include progressing the detailed planning of the

flagship Makhado Project, resulting in materially

higher steelmaking hard coking coal production

capacity, and the addition of another cash

generating asset with the recommissioning of

the Vele Aluwani Colliery. The recapitalisation

of the Group though the fully underwritten

Rights Issue also reflects the continued support

of our major shareholders.

Our integrated approach to health and safety

remains a critical pillar of the business and we

continue to focus on achieving zero harm. We

are encouraged by the positive results of many

of our safety indicators.

MC Mining is committed to deploying its

financial and human capital to support South

Africa’s economic growth. It is widely accepted

that economic reform and private sector growth

are vital ingredients for the country’s recovery.

At MC Mining we are committed to being an

active player in this space, contributing both

employment opportunities and our high-

quality steelmaking HCC product, an essential

ingredient in the manufacture of steel, a critical

driver of industrialisation.

It is clear that the road to economic success

requires strong private sector collaboration:

the development of the Makhado steelmaking

coal project with a 28-year life of mine will

deliver profound outcomes in the area where

we operate, creating a common purpose for all

stakeholders and improving the conditions of

those living in the vicinity of the project.

The Uitkomst Colliery employs more than

520 people; the recommissioning of the

Vele Aluwani Colliery in December 2022 has

resulted in the creation of 333 new jobs; and

the Makhado Project itself is expected to yield

650 new jobs. In the remote areas where we

operate, jobs and income have a meaningful

and visible impact on the local economy. Our

established Makhado Centre of Learning will be

fundamental to facilitate skills development in

the Vhembe district where Vele, Makhado and

the GSP are located. The scarcity of skills in this

area, particularly mining related expertise, has

been a key learning from the recommissioning

of the Vele Colliery, and hence accelerating

activities at the centre.

The global energy shortage is expected

to result, in the long term, in elevated

international coal prices due to an

extended period of under-investment.”

OVERVIEW

The financial year generated numerous positive

outcomes for MC Mining, most notably:

• Safety remains a foremost priority. and the

Group recorded six LTIs in FY2023 (FY2022:

six LTIs);

• Strengthening of the Group balance sheet

and stabilisation of finances with the

completion of a fully underwritten Rights

Issue raising gross proceeds of A$40 million

(approximately $26.6 million) to fund

the continued development of Makhado,

settlement of debt and for general working

capital purposes;

• Uitkomst secured a route to market to sell

its coal on a more lucrative market in H1

FY2023, resulting in a 91% increase in

revenue (FY2023: $44.8 million vs. FY2022:

$23.5 million);

• Implementation of Operation Phenduka

optimisation strategy at Uitkomst in

June 2023 which allows for increased

time underground per shift, leading to

an increase in ROM coal production and

reduction in unit costs;

• Completion of the Makhado steelmaking

coal CHPP optimisation study indicating

an increase in annual processing capacity

from 3.2Mtpa to 4.0Mtpa, followed by the

appointment of Erudite to undertake the

detailed designs for the Makhado CHPP

and infrastructure;

• Finalisation of a five-year Makhado

Project Implementation plan, improving the

confidence levels of Makhado feasibility

studies for the first five years, from +-70%

to +-90%, and, incorporating a detailed

execution plan for the construction of the

East Pit and related infrastructure and a

detailed mine plan;

• Subsequent to the Implementation Plan, the

Makhado LOM plan was updated resulting in

the LOM increasing from 22 years to 28 years

SAFETY

remains a foremost priority: the Group recorded six LTIs in FY2023

(FY2022: six LTIs)

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022

led to significant changes to international coal

prices and, combined with the global energy

shortage, thermal coal prices rose significantly.

Uitkomst did not have a route-to-market to

export coal and, in July 2022, concluded

the Marketing Agreement with Overlooked,

facilitating the export of the colliery’s coal.

This ensured Uitkomst could take advantage

of higher international coal prices. Following

a decline in international thermal coal prices

in H2 CY222, Uitkomst’s marketing initiatives

focussed on supplying domestic customers.

During FY2023, Uitkomst sold 241,366t of

coal (FY2022: 225,096t), comprising 230,181t

(FY2022: 199,065t) of premium duff and sized

peas and 11,185t (FY2022: 26,031t) of high

ash, coarse discard coal, generating sales

revenue of $34.2 million (FY2022: $23.5 million),

with $11.4 million (FY2022: $nil) derived from

export coal sales. The increase in Uitkomst’s

revenue per tonne is attributable to sales on the

Uitkomst’s key production and financial metrics for FY2023 and FY2022 are detailed below.

loadshedding by Eskom, the state power utility,

resulting in higher energy costs due to the use

of generators during these periods.

MAKHADO PROJECT

Background

MC Mining has a 67% interest in its flagship

Makhado steelmaking HCC project, which

spans an area of over 60km² across five farms

in the Soutpansberg coalfield in the Limpopo

province. During 2015, the Company agreed to

sell 20% of the project to the Makhado Colliery

Community Development Trust, comprising

seven beneficiary communities. An agreement

was also signed with a black industrialist,

facilitating his acquisition of a 6% interest

in Makhado, and the IDC acquired a 6.7%

shareholding in terms of its existing R160 million

($8.5 million) loan facility.

The ‘shovel ready’ Makhado Project has all the

regulatory permits and owns the necessary

surface rights required to commence mining

operations. No LTIs were recorded during the 12

months (FY2022: nil).

Makhado steelmaking HCC

South Africa produces significant quantities of

thermal coal but has a very limited domestic

supply of high-quality steelmaking coal. Once

developed, Makhado is expected to be the

only significant steelmaking HCC mine in the

country. The project will also provide direct

and indirect benefits to communities located in

an area with significant unemployment levels

and is expected to create approximately 650

permanent job opportunities once operational.

The limited production of high-quality

steelmaking coking coal in South Africa results

in ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited (AMSA)

and other coke producers having to import

steelmaking HCC for the manufacture of

metallurgical coke, a key ingredient in the

production of steel. Steelmaking HCC has

historically attracted significantly higher sales

prices compared to thermal coal and the

development of Makhado is expected to deliver

positive returns for shareholders. MC Mining

has secured an off-take agreement with AMSA

for the purchase of between 350,000t and

450,000t of steelmaking HCC annually, with

sales prices linked to a published, US dollar-

denominated HCC64 (mid-volatile HCC) index.

First coal production is expected 18 months

from commencement of construction, which is

expected during H1 CY2024.

An owner’s team was appointed in early

FY2023 to drive the planning and development

of the Makhado Project. During the period,

the Company also appointed independent

experts to complete an optimisation study on

the Makhado coal handling and processing

plant (CHPP) resulting in the annual capacity

increasing from 3.2 million tonnes per annum

(Mtpa) to 4.0Mtpa. The Company subsequently

appointed Erudite (Pty) Ltd (Erudite) to

complete the detailed designs for a full process

design for the Makhado CHPP and also

employed independent consultants to review

the Makhado mine plan.

The revised Makhado mine plan forms part

of the detailed execution plan and the results

of the CHPP optimisation study were used in

Erudite’s detailed CHPP and infrastructure

design work, required by potential funders

to complete their assessments. Erudite

commenced obtaining detailed execution

quotes for the construction of the CHPP.

This process will progress in conjunction to

of orders for long lead items, and a further

ZAR55 million ($3.0 million) for electricity

supply infrastructure. The various work streams

that commenced includes, amongst others:

• detailed design, procurement and

construction of the power supply overhead

transmission line, with construction team

mobilised onsite – a critical path activity;

• refurbishment of onsite accommodation to

house project construction crews;

• placement of orders for key long-lead time

items, including the payment of a deposit of

ZAR19.0 million ($1.0 million);

• mobilisation of contractors for the

construction of the main access road,

main bridge and civil works for bulk water

reticulation; and

• progress with the erection of fencing to

secure the project site.

CHPP and remove a significant portion of the

ongoing costs associated with the colliery.

The assessment of outsourcing opportunities

resulted in the conclusion of a five-year

Contract Mining Agreement (Mining

Agreement) with Hlalethembeni Outsourcing

Services (Pty) Ltd (HOS) in December 2022. As

a result operations were resumed with limited

financial and human capital requirements,

adding a further cash generating unit to MC

Mining’s portfolio, and alleviating the ‘use it or

lose it’ risk associated with unutilised mining

assets in South Africa.

HOS is mining in terms of an agreed mine plan

on an exclusive basis until December 2027. HOS

is responsible for all mining and processing

costs while the Company remains responsible

for the colliery’s regulatory compliance,

rehabilitation guarantees, relationships with

authorities and communities as well as the

supply of electricity and water. Construction of

the overhead electricity line was completed in

April 2023 and the Vele CHPP was connected

to the national power grid in May 2023. HOS

successfully de-watered the Vele open-cast pit

and produced 96,673t (FY2022: nil t) of thermal

coal during H2 FY2023 and created 333

permanent jobs. Ramp-up to full production

is expected to occur in H2 CY2023 with HOS

targeting monthly production of 60,000t of

saleable thermal coal from Vele.

GREATER SOUTPANSBERG PROJECT

Background

The GSP is situated in the Soutpansberg

coalfield in the Limpopo province, located

within close proximity to the Makhado Special

circuits that would allow for the simultaneous

production of SSCC and thermal coal.

Compliance

Compliance with regulatory and licensing

requirements at the colliery is closely monitored

through– internal inspections, external audits

conducted by the Department of Water,

Sanitation and Environment (DWSE), as well

as audits conducted by the Environmental

Compliance Officer. Vele also participates

in a Project Steering Committee in line with

the historic October 2014 Biodiversity Offset

Agreement (BOA) between the Company,

the Department of Environmental Affairs

(DEA) and the South African National Parks

(SANParks). The colliery also participates in the

Environmental Management Committee (EMC),

established as an oversight committee in terms

of the colliery’s Environmental Authorisation

(EA). The EMC comprises various stakeholders

from regulatory authorities, relevant organs of

state, municipal representatives, civic society

and stakeholders identified during the initial

public process.

Recommencement of Operations

The revised plan to construct the CHPP

construction of a CHPP at Makhado

and improved market conditions created

optionality for the potential recommencement

of operations at Vele. Previous Makhado

development strategies incorporated the

processing of Makhado crushed and screened

ROM coal at Vele. The outsourcing of

operations at Vele was identified as the optimal

strategy as this would secure the necessary

investment from a third party to de-water the

opencast pit, modify and recommission the

Makhado Project Funding

The Company continued the Makhado Project

composite debt/equity funding initiatives

during FY2023. The fully underwritten,

renounceable A$40.0 million (equivalent to

approximately $26.6 million) Rights Issue

completed in November 2022 contributes

funding for the Makhado detailed planning,

early works and long lead time items. The

Company also secured an extension for the

repayment of the existing ZAR160.0 million

($9.8 million) and contractor BOOT funding

arrangement of ZAR155.0 million ($8.3 million).

The completion of the revised LOM plan and

models, in addition to the Implementation

Plan, are prerequisites for funders, and have

significantly enhanced achievable options for

funding. The detailed planning and ancillary

information compiled during FY2023 is being

used by potential funders in their due diligence

processes and the composite debt/equity

funding initiatives are expected to be finalised

in the first half of CY2024.

VELE COLLIERY

Background

The 100%-owned Vele Colliery is in the Tuli

coalfield of the Limpopo province. Due to the

global economic downturn and depressed

coal prices, the colliery was placed on care

and maintenance in August 2013. Previous

assessments of strategies to exploit the asset

confirmed significant capital and technical

investment required to optimise production

of both semi-soft steelmaking coal (SSCC)

and thermal coal at the colliery. The Vele

Coal Resource comprises both steelmaking

SSCC and export quality thermal coal but the

colliery’s CHPP does not have the requisite fines: Managing

of the entity, directly or indirectly, including

any director (whether executive or otherwise) of

that entity. The Executive Director, FM Duval as

as General Manager:

Finance and Administration satisfied the

definition of ‘key management personnel’

during the FY2023 and are separately disclosed

in the remuneration report. No further “key

management personnel” have been identified

which should be disclosed separately.

25. REMUNERATION POLICY

The remuneration policy of MC Mining has been

designed to align key management personnel

objectives with shareholder and business

objectives by providing a fixed remuneration

component and offering specific long-term

incentives based on key performance areas

affecting the Group’s financial results. The

Board of MC Mining believes the remuneration

policy to be appropriate and effective in its

ability to attract and retain management

personnel to run and manage the Group,

as well as create goal congruence between

Directors, management and shareholders.

The Board’s policy for determining the nature

and amount of remuneration for management

personnel of the Group is as follows:

• The remuneration structure is developed

by the Nomination and Remuneration

Committee and approved by the Board after

professional advice is periodically sought

from independent external consultants.

• Management personnel receive a base salary

(based on factors such as length of service

and experience), performance rights and

performance incentives.

• Incentives paid in the form of cash and

performance rights are intended to align the

interests of the Directors, management and

the Company with those of the shareholders.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee

reviews senior management personnel

packages annually by reference to the Group’s

performance, executive performance and

comparable information from industry sectors.

The performance of senior management

personnel is measured against criteria agreed

annually with each executive and bonuses

and incentives are linked to predetermined

performance criteria. The performance criteria

vary and are determined in line with each

individual’s performance contract. The Board

may, however, exercise its discretion in relation

to approving incentives, bonuses, options

or performance rights, and can recommend

changes to the Nomination and Remuneration

Committee’s recommendations. Any changes

must be justified by reference to measurable

performance criteria. The policy is designed to

attract the highest calibre of executives and

reward them for performance results leading to

long-term growth in shareholder wealth.

All remuneration paid to management

personnel is valued at the cost to the Company

and expensed.

The Board’s policy is to remunerate Non-

Executive Directors at market rates for

time, commitment and responsibilities. The

Board amended the policy with regards

to remuneration of shareholder nominee

Non-Executive Directors who will receive

remuneration in line with Non-Executive

Directors. This is effective from March 2023

and the remuneration for the March to June

2023 period was accrued at year-end. The

Independent Auditor’s Report

TO THE MEMBERS OF MC MINING LIMITED

Report on the audit of the financial report

We have audited the accompanying financial report of MC Mining Limited (“Company”), and its

subsidiaries (“Group”), which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at

30 June 2023, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement

of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and

notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, and the

directors’ declaration.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of MC Mining Limited is in accordance with the

Corporations Act 2001, including:

i. giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 30 June 2023 and of its

financial performance for the year then ended; and

ii. complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities

under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the

Financial Report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the

auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of

the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional

Accountants (Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also

fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a

basis for our opinion.

Material uncertainty related to going concern

We draw attention to Note 1 in the financial report, which describes several matters concerning the

Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Group’s ability to continue as a going concern

is dependent on future debt and equity funding at a level satisfactory to enable ongoing operations

and future developments to be completed These circumstances indicate that a material inherent

uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going

concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
