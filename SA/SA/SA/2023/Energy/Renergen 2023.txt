running of the business (the purview of the CEO).

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

The King IV™️ Report on Corporate Governance for

South Africa 2016 highlights the importance of a

Board that appropriately balances knowledge, skill,

experience, diversity, and independence to discharge

its governance role objectively and effectively.

Renergen recognises both the benefits of a diverse

Board and the recommendations contained in the

King IV™️ report. To confirm its commitment, the Board

has adopted a policy for promoting diversity at a

Board level. The policy focuses on promoting diversity

attributes of gender, race, culture, age, field of

knowledge, stills and experience.

INDEPENDENCE

All the Directors have a duty to act, always, with the

independence of mind in the best interests of the

Group. The Board believes that the Independent Non-

executive Directors of the Group are of appropriate

calibre, diversity, and number for their views to carry

significant weight in the Board’s deliberations and

decisions.

The Independent Non-executive Directors are highly

experienced and have the skills, background, and

knowledge to fulfil their responsibilities. The Board

determines the classification of Independent Non-

executive Directors on the recommendation of the

Nomination Committee. In assessing the independence

of the Independent Non-executive Directors, character

and judgement are considered together with any

aspect of their existing relationships or circumstances

which are likely to affect or could appear to influence

their judgement and due regard for the criteria of

independence as set out in King IV™️, the JSE Listings

Requirements and the ASX Corporate Governance

Principles and Recommendations.

At any time, all Independent Non-executive Directors

have unrestricted access to management and the

Group’s external auditors. In addition, all Directors are

entitled to seek independent professional advice – at

the Group’s expense - on any matters about Renergen

and when necessary.

The Board also considers the impact of each Director’s

interests, including those in the business regarding

direct or indirect shareholding and an interest in a

contract with the Group. Conflicts of interest, actual or

perceived, are monitored.

All Directors of the Group and its subsidiaries must

adhere to the Group’s policy on dealing in the Group’s

securities, designed to prevent insider trading in terms

of the Financial Markets Act, 2012. In this respect,

the Board operates according to the regulations and

requirements laid out by the JSE and ASX.

BOARD CHARTER

The Board Charter provides guidelines to Directors

regarding, among other things, the Board’s

responsibilities, authority, composition, meetings,

and the need for performance evaluations. The Board

Charter also provides clear division obligations to

balance power and authority and ensure that no single

Director has unfettered decision-making powers.

SUCCESSION PLANNING

The Nomination Committee oversees succession

planning for Non-executive Directors and monitors

the succession planning for Executive Directors

and understands that it is of crucial importance in

the sustainability of the business. Renergen has

a succession plan in place for Executive Directors

and Senior Management, which provides for the key

management of the Group.

The Group is committed to improving its talent pool

through ongoing efforts to manage human capital,

including career development and recruitment. These

efforts are designed to provide both short-term and

long-term management depth, and the Board is

satisfied with this progress and efforts.:

Exploration. Date appointed to Board: 25 November 2015

Our Board of Directors:

Managing Director of ASX listed gold producer North Flinders Mines,

CEO and: Managing Director of Oil and gas producers Beach Petroleum

and Claremont Petroleum, and

letter, the audit plan and the audit fees payable to BDO. The

Audit Committee further satisfactorily monitored the external auditor’s progress against the approved audit plan and

assessed the quality and effectiveness of the external audit function, including receiving confirmation that there was

no scope limitation or restriction of access to management. Following the statutory audit, the external auditor’s report

provided the Audit Committee with the necessary assurance on Renergen’s risk management processes, internal

control environment and IT systems. It also provided assurance that no reportable irregularities had been identified

and that there are no unresolved issues that impact the consolidated and separate financial statements presented.

The Committee has recommended the appointment of BDO as the independent external auditor and Mr Jacques

Barradas as the designated, JSE approved audit partner for the financial year ending 28 February 2024, for

consideration by shareholders at the next AGM.

The approved Group audit fee for the year under review is R1.26 million (2022: R0.85 million). A formal procedure

has been adopted to govern the process where the external auditor may be considered for non-audit services and

the extent of these services is closely monitored by the Audit Committee. BDO and Mazars did not provide non-audit

services during the year under review (2022: Rnil).

EVALUATION OF THE CFO AND THE FINANCE FUNCTION

The Audit Committee evaluated the expertise and performance of the CFO, Brian Harvey, for the financial year ended

28 February 2023 and is satisfied that he has the appropriate expertise and experience to carry out his duties as the

CFO of the Group. The expertise, experience and adequacy of the resources making up the finance function were also

considered, and the Audit Committee was satisfied that these are appropriate.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Audit Committee reviewed regular reporting on the risks faced by the Group. Risk management underpins the

execution of the Group’s strategic initiatives and the management of material issues. The Audit Committee’s

responsibilities with respect to risk management encompass:



Reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management framework, policies, strategies and plans in place for

recommendation to the Board for final approval.



Approving the Group’s risk identification and assessment methodologies.





Reviewing the effectiveness and efficiency of systems within the Group and receiving assurance that material

risks are identified, and that the appropriate risk management processes are in place, including the formulation

and subsequent amendment of Group policies.



Reviewing the appropriateness of resources directed towards areas of high risk.



Regularly receiving a register of the Group’s key risks and potential material risk exposures, and reporting to the

Board any material changes and / or divergence to the risk profile of the Group.

Audit, Risk and IT Committee Report:

mandated SBSA to fully underwrite the remaining US$250.0 million.



A 10% disposal of Tetra4 to the CEF for R1.0 billion. In this regard the CEF successfully completed due diligence

pertaining to this acquisition and engagement with various stakeholders is currently underway to bring this

transaction to fruition.



A potential international public offering (“IPO”), subject to market and other conditions, the proceeds of which

are intended to comprise a portion of the equity funding for Phase 2 construction (see IPO section below).

Upon completion of Phase 2 of the VGP, the Company expects that it will deliver a substantial amount of energy to the

South African economy and will also transform South Africa into one of the world’s large helium exporting countries.

Exploration activities

In March 2022, we achieved early success from two wells in our drilling campaign – Frodo and Balrog and saw an

increase in the flow rate from a previously drilled well, R2D2, which following clean-up operations increased its flow

rate by 18 000 standard cubic feet (“scf”) per day (or 15%). Frodo achieved a flow rate of 23 000 scf per day and Balrog

a flow rate of 90 000 scf per day, the latter through a diverter and following clean-up. The success of the exploration

techniques applied to these wells will guide future exploration initiatives. Frodo was sited using only the latest fault

structure interpretation, while Balrog was sited using Tetra4’s “conviction scoring” AI methodology, based on non-

invasive markers with no other geological input. The wells were drilled to intersect the planned fracture sets at around

500m total vertical depth and will feed into Phase 1 of the VGP.

In June 2022 we drilled a new gas blower, Gandalf, the third well in our drilling campaign for the year under review.

Gas was intersected at 480m from surface with a flow rate of around 90 000 scf per day. The target depth is 1 200m

and after initial testing the well was cased in preparation to drill to the full depth. At present the drillers are preparing

to drill through the cement and further to the target depth.

During the second quarter of the financial year a new well, Han, was drilled to a measured depth of 624m, striking gas

of approximately 80 000 scf per day. Drilling was halted to log the well to delineate the gas bearing features in the well.

During the same period, the Don Vito well, previously drilled in June 2021 as a vertical pilot hole to log and determine

the depth to the base of the Karoo (to plan the trajectories of wells R2D2 and C3PO), was examined and commenced

flowing gas. This was interpreted to indicate that with the passage of time the well cleaned up naturally. The well

is now producing approximately 75 000 scf per day. Given that the well was a pilot well and was not anticipated to

produce gas, it is now being completed for production before being connected to the Phase 1 gas gathering pipeline.

In addition to the drilling campaign carried out during the year under review as outlined above, gravity and

aeromagnetic surveys were also undertaken and completed in September 2022. The data is now being interpreted to

improve the resolution of the geological model and optimise drillhole location accuracy in the Phase 2 area. These

surveys, together with seismic data reprocessed during the third quarter, have provided enhanced resolution on a

number of potential gas bearing features, including their extent, depth and orientation. In addition, several significant

magnetic highs have been identified in the western part of the reserve area and are of particular interest as they are a

series of cap rock above other newly identified gas bearing structures.
