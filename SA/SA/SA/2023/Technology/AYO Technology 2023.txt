Managing Director

Digital Matter

Afrozaar’s Publisher’s Toolbox and PT Sportsuite products provide a

modular digital ecosystem for media and sports content providers.

With its now mature technology platform, the priority is to expand

the sales team and reach. Afrozaar remains focused on three key

territories: United Kingdom/Europe, Africa and North America.

The UK office has done well this year in growing the business in the

region. Establishing in-country representation in the US will be the

main focus for 2024.

The company’s products are facing growing competition globally

and enhancements are needed. With the correct funding structure,

its products can grow significant market share and revenue in

2024. The commercial model remains sound, with respectable

gross margins and dependable annuity income. Bolstering the

development and sales teams will therefore be the main success

factor determining performance in the coming year.
