letter of engagement which, together

with the Board charter and respective Committees’ terms of reference and Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI), form the

basis of the director’s appointment. The Board adopted a resolution whereby directors who have reached a nine (9) year

tenure, should automatically retire from the Board, subject to appropriate succession and Board composition requirements

being in place. Exceptions are allowed in terms of the MOI. The Nominations Committee plays an important role in the

appointment of new directors as well as the identification and removal of underperforming or unsuitable directors.

The Company’s MOI provides that at least one third of the NEDs retire by rotation every year and, if eligible, may offer

themselves for re-election by shareholders.
