Shareholders complimented our remuneration policy for including comprehensive ESG targets.

Our ESG targets are underpinned by long-term environmental sustainability, social transformation and governance plans that are

reviewed regularly by the particular Board committees that oversee implementation. ESG targets will continue to form part of our

BSC1 going forward.

Shareholders queried why benchmarking had not been undertaken for the CEO and CFO.

CEO/CFO benchmarking was not undertaken in FY 2022 as the previous benchmark undertaken in FY 2021 showed that the CEO and

CFO guaranteed packages aligned well with market trends. However, the CFO’s guaranteed package was at the lower end of the

market median. Additionally, the STIs were also lower than industry benchmarks (especially the CFO’s). This was to be corrected by the

allocation of SIP in December 2022. The committee engaged Bowmans to conduct the benchmarking exercise at the beginning of the

calendar year to be tabled for consideration at its February 2023 meeting.

The findings of the benchmark showed that the CEO’s ‘on-target’ total remuneration at the standard policy level, without catch-up

awards, closely aligned to the market median at 99% of market and at 135% of the market inclusive of catch-up awards. The CFO’s

total ‘on-target’ remuneration on a normalised basis (excluding catch-up awards) fell below the tolerance band but aligned closer to

the market median at 97% inclusive of catch-up awards. The committee therefore approved a higher salary adjustment for the CFO.

Netcare’s non-executive directors are remunerated on a fixed fee basis. Certain shareholders suggested the basis

should be meeting attendance.

A fixed fee structure takes into account a number of other ad hoc and unscheduled meetings that directors are required to attend at

short notice, and accordingly we consider the current remuneration structure to be appropriate. The retainer only policy is the most

common for JSE companies as well as in several global markets. A pay per meeting policy can encourage an excessive number of

meetings.

Shareholders recommended the benchmarking of Board members’ remuneration.

Board members’ remuneration is externally benchmarked every two years and the findings inform the recommended fee increases

submitted for shareholder approval. The last benchmarking exercise was conducted by PwC in FY 2022. Therefore, no benchmarking

was performed in FY 2023.

The Remuneration Committee considered the outcome of the FY 2022 PwC benchmarking exercise together with the fact that since

FY 2019, it has not awarded increases to non-executive directors, except for certain committees where fees benchmarked below the

market median. The committee recommended a 6.0% fee increase for selected committees whose fees remained below the

benchmark tolerance band and market median, as approved at the 2023 AGM.

For FY 2024, the committee is proposing a CPI-linked 5.0% adjustment in non-executive director fees. No fee increases for Board

members and members of the Social and Ethics Committee have been proposed, as these are currently above the market median.

The performance multiplier ranges from zero if none of the threshold levels are achieved to 100% for on-target performance, and up

to 150% for outperformance:

• Below threshold – 0%

• Threshold – 50%

• On target – 100%

• Outperform – 150%.

Linear interpolation is applied for performance between threshold and target, and target and outperform.

The annual value of the performance multiplier is determined based on Group and functional scorecards. This ensures that the

scorecards for different roles drive the performance of the relevant entity/division/function while retaining a minimum level of

exposure to Group outcomes for all participants to avoid ‘silo’ behaviour.

CEO: Group BSC 100%

CFO: Group BSC 80% and divisional BSC 20%

Executives (F Band): Group BSC 60% and divisional BSC 40%

Each executive is required to achieve 60% of their divisional and/or individual BSC to qualify for an incentive.

Deferred shares vest over a five-year period for executives, with minimum shareholding requirements applicable. This is to ensure

that executives are exposed to share price performance and are aligned to shareholder objectives, while offering them

competitive remuneration.
