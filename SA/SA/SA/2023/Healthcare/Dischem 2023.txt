Dis-Chem Integrated Report 2023

32:

Dear Shareholders

On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased

to present the Dis-Chem remuneration report for the 2023

financial year. This year we undertook a detailed and holistic

review of our remuneration report, with the focus of aligning

our report to the leading practice reporting principles set out in

the King IV Report on Corporate Governance. I am also pleased

to report that we enhanced our disclosure standards to better

articulate the link between key actions taken and how these,

together with our remuneration policy and practices, support

the successful execution of our business and reward strategies.

We also enhanced the disclosure of incentive outcomes and

implemented changes to our policy to align this closer to

leading governance principles. We trust this will meet the

expectations of all our stakeholders.

Remuneration and performance during

the 2023 financial year

The 2023 financial year was a challenging one for all our

stakeholders, with inflation, rising interest rates, the global

socio-political disruptions and local energy crisis being front

of mind.

A summary overview of the remuneration outcomes for 2023 is

as follows:

2023 guaranteed pay adjustments

The average annual performance-linked salary increases for

all employees, linked to Consumer Price Index (“CPI”), was 5.5%

and came into effect on 1 March 2023. The same principle was

applied in 2022, and the average annual increase applied was

4.5%. The overall average increase of 5.5% was within the market

median of between 5% and 6%. The increases take into account

affordability for the Company as well as comparative placement

within the market.

2023 Short-Term Incentive (“STI”) outcomes

Group performance is set against short term targets and

budgets. A considerable portion of executive and senior

management remuneration is variable, and designed to

incentivise performance. The Group performance resulted in

the below short term incentives paid:

STIs are paid in June following financial year-end

The payment of STIs ensures the alignment of employee

performance and shareholder interests. Bonus shares are

awarded as a portion of achieving STI outcomes, ensuring the

link between short- and long-term incentives.

Adjustments to non-executive director

(“NED”) fees

Based on past practice, NEDs received the same increase as the

average Company increase (4.5% in 2022).

A benchmarking exercise was performed comparing NED fees

to five similar retailers in terms of market capitalisation and

complexity. The increase in the fees aligns with the market

average as well as the evolution of the committee roles which

was taken into consideration. A two-year time frame was

recommended and approved to implement such increases.

Key areas of focus and key decisions taken by the

committee during the reporting period

During the year under review, the remuneration committee

focused on the following items:

Total Guaranteed Package (“TGP”) (all employees)

• Approved the overall salary and wage increases for the

Company.

Executive and senior management

• Approved increases for executives and senior management.

• Approved Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial

Officer (“CFO”) performance agreements.

Fair pay

The Company complied with national minimum wage

legislation in terms of the Security industry and the Wholesale

and Retail Sector.
