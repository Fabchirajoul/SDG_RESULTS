Dear Stakeholders

We are pleased to present our 2023 Integrated Annual

Report, which is our primary report prepared for all our

stakeholders. We have structured the report in order to

comprehensively, but concisely, disclose who we are as

a company, why and how we conduct our business, and

the value we create for all our shareholders.

We appreciate that the report includes significant detail

about our Company. We have tried to make this easier

by designing it as an interactive report so that, you

can quickly and easily move between sections that interest

you by using the various navigation tools within the report.

Integrated thinking is embodied in our core purpose

of Making life better for all stakeholders. Our robust

corporate governance framework, processes and

controls ensure that our strategic decision making

considers stakeholder concerns, our operating

environment, risks and opportunities; all of which also

inform our business model.

This Integrated Annual Report details how we have used

our six capital resources, in a balanced and carefully

considered manner, and whether we have created,

preserved or eroded stakeholder value during the year.

The performance review section (

pages 98 – 152)

follows the six capital model format so the reader can

see how these capital resources were used, how they

performed, and what outcomes and trade-offs resulted

from their use.

Reporting scope and boundary

Our report provides a comprehensive view of

Life Healthcare Group Holdings Limited (Life Healthcare,

the Group or the Company) and covers the period

1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023 as well as all

relevant information and material events after our

year-end up to 8 December 2023.

We show a summary of the Group’s main segments on

page 4.

We provide an overview of our business model, governance

structures, strategy and progress against our strategic

objectives, and how these are influenced by the material

matters, risks and opportunities, stakeholder concerns and

the external environment that we face and how these could

have a direct or indirect impact on our ability to create,

preserve or erode value for the Group and our stakeholders

over the short (less than one year), medium (between one

and two years) and long term (three or more years).

In addition, this report includes financial and non-financial

information relating to our two major geographical

segments (southern Africa and International) and their

underlying business components.

Process disclosures

The Group Executive Management Committee

(Group ExCo) is responsible for the compilation and

presentation of the report. At the same time Board and

its Committees are involved in reviewing and approving

the reporting suite.

The following steps were taken leading up to the publication

of our Integrated Annual Report and related material:

• An executive management workshop was held in early

July 2023 to determine areas for improvement in our

disclosure and to set out responsibilities for compiling

the report.

• Our material matters (

page 18) were determined

by analysing various Board and Group ExCo papers

related to the Group’s strategy, operating environment

and key risks business risks. Our material matters were

then grouped into key themes, including mapping showing

how these relate to the Group’s risks and stakeholders.

They were then reviewed by Group ExCo and subsequently

submitted to the Audit Committee and Risk, Compliance

and IT Governance Committee in July 2023 where they

were approved.

• Our disclosures related to Environmental, Social and

Governance (ESG) matters (see

pages 128 – 139)

continue to be a prominent topic at both Group ExCo and

Board levels. The Sustainable Development Committee

(SD Committee) has driven the increased reporting of

our ESG metrics. It is responsible for drawing up our

Group-wide ESG targets and the roadmap for achieving

these targets.

• Our ESG-related

Sustainability Report was compiled

by this SD Committee, reviewed by Group ExCo and

approved by the Social, Ethics and Transformation

Committee in November 2023.

• Our long-term environmental targets were approved by the

Board in May 2023 and have been published in this report

(see

pages 134 – 135).

Combined assurance

We followed a combined assurance process during the

preparation of this Integrated Annual Report, with the

Board, its Committees and management responsible for

finalising the disclosures contained herein. The Group’s

annual financial statements were independently audited by

our external auditors, Deloitte. The summarised financial

information included in this report was extracted from the

Group’s audited annual financial statements. However,

this report in its entirety has not been independently

assured.

A number of non-financial indicators for which

Deloitte has provided a limited assurance conclusion.

For further information regarding these indicators and

Board responsibility and approval

Life Healthcare’s Board is ultimately responsible for

the integrity and completeness of this Integrated

Annual Report, and is assisted by its Committees and

the Group ExCo throughout the reporting process.

collected and the assurance thereof, the Board
