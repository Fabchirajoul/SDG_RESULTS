Message from the Chairman

Trevor Manuel

Chairman

In 2023, Old Mutual continued creating

value for our stakeholders, despite a

backdrop of seismic geo-political shifts

and volatile international markets.

Focused execution, responsible capital

allocation and sophisticated financial

risk management underpinned our

growth and ensured that the Group

performed well against the strategy.

We are pleased with our overall positive financial results achieved

in the face of tough economic challenges.

Our customer focused approach has enabled us to generate strong

new business and continued sales momentum in 2023. We delivered

double digit sales growth of 17% across our life segments as we grow

market share profitably within our key markets. Consequently,

we delivered exceptional value of new business growth of 37%.

The effects of state capture continue to be felt in all spheres

of South African society. While there has been an effort to restore

the institutions and rebuild the economy, more work is necessary

to eradicate corruption completely and regain institutional strength.

Against this backdrop, it is crucial that regulators adopt a pragmatic

approach, striking a balance between fiscal requirements and

providing clear regulations and long term regulatory certainty.

Foreign investors disinvested more than a trillion rand from South

African equities and bonds over the past decade, primarily due

to regulatory uncertainty and execution stasis. This money is being

redirected to competing markets that appear to be on a more sound

governance and regulatory footing.

This is a stark reminder that Africa, particularly South Africa, has

to compete to attract and retain investment. This is an ongoing

challenge, and Old Mutual stands ready to collaborate with

regulatory authorities and government stakeholders to create

an environment conducive to business growth and investment.

2024 is destined to be a record-breaking election year, with 19 African

countries scheduled to go to the polls. This will likely extend the

period of political uncertainty, but may also signal the beginning

of a new regulatory environment in many countries.

Committed to customers

We remain committed to generating sustainable and suitable

returns for all our stakeholders. We accomplish this through

partnerships that drive the creation of responsible business. We

take our responsibility as the stewards of our customers’ savings

and financial wellbeing seriously. Our products and services are

constantly evolving to help our customers manage their savings

and mitigate financial risks. The Board is particularly pleased with

the increase in our sales metrics during the year, which reflects our

customers’ trust in our organisation.

Strengthening our integrated financial services ecosystem is a key

strategic customer focus. Our approach involves partnering with

our customers on their life journey to achieve financial wellness.

We leverage our advanced technology and our committed people

to sustain, grow and protect our customers’ prosperity, ensuring

we become their lifetime financial partner of choice.

This ecosystem will be further enhanced with the launch of our

new bank in 2024, which should accelerate the integration of Old

Mutual’s financial services. The bank’s use of artificial intelligence (AI)

is expected to dramatically speed up processes, keep operating costs

and bank charges low, and facilitate the development of convenient

and relevant new financial offerings.

Meeting specific sustainability and ESG

challenges

We see our business as a force for good that is accountable

to customers, employees, shareholders and other stakeholders.

Broad based sustainability goals and environmental, social and

governance (ESG) principles are an integral part of our core business

strategy and specific ESG metrics are included in our remuneration

structures. Our approach recognises the interconnectivity between

economic, social and biophysical systems and the urgency to be

more socially inclusive, low carbon and resource efficient.

As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, we are active

contributors to the Sustainable Development Goals. In particular,

our commitment to responsible investment practices entails

recognising, evaluating and scrupulously incorporating material ESG

risks and opportunities into investment and ownership decisions.

We deepened our active stewardship footprint by consistently

monitoring key metrics and calling out irregularities and

discrepancies when we encounter them.

Climate change is a key environmental risk facing our Group, posing

a threat to the sustainability of our business operations and the

communities and countries in which we operate.

As a signatory to both the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative and the

Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance, Old Mutual plays a leading advocacy

role in the Just Transition. We made significant progress towards

achieving our Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance 2025 intermediate

targets. We also transitioned funds to track the MSCI World Climate

Paris Aligned Index and the Old Mutual Investment Group launched

the Old Mutual Global ESG Active Fund, which targets listed global

companies with high governance ratings and low carbon emissions.

Climate change brings opportunities for Africa. We have untapped

renewable energy potential, a young workforce and significant

natural resources, all of which can drive green industrialisation and

economic growth. Old Mutual has invested more than R167 billion

in the green economy over the last year and this will remain a focus

going forward.

Stronger through transformation

We retained our broad-based black economic empowerment level 1

status and made strong progress in gender diversity, meeting our

target for female representation on the Board. We set ambitious

targets for women in leadership positions, supported by multiple

targeted development opportunities.

Our employees continued to navigate the dynamic macro-

environment adeptly, including embracing the new ways of working.

The Board ensured employees received holistic support, while the

business, with our backing, invested in attracting and retaining

critical skills and nurturing a high-performance culture.

One of our 2023 transformation highlights was increasing the

minimum salary of our employees in South Africa to R180 000 per

year. This makes me very proud, especially because we are among

the first companies in the financial services sector to take a decisive

step towards narrowing the wage gap and one of the first to provide

voluntary disclosure in our Remuneration Report.

2023 also had the first dividends flow to the participants in Old

Mutual’s Bula Tsela B-BBEE deal. Bula Tsela was launched in 2022

to help broaden Old Mutual’s shareholding by providing shares

to black South Africans.

Governance

Good corporate governance is fundamental to the Group’s success, sustainability and legitimacy.

The Board spent significant time ensuring that the organisation-wide corporate governance

principles, frameworks and risk management practices function as designed, recognising this

as one of our key stewardship responsibilities.

We maintained our focus on succession planning during the year. In particular, we are committed

to replacing the six directors set to rotate off the Old Mutual Board by 2026. The Board also

maintains keen oversight of executive management succession planning, ensuring that we have

a pipeline of talent and a strategy refresh the team. The appointment of Busisiwe Silwanyana and

Jurie Strydom to the Board last year reflects our succession planning efforts. We wish them

a stimulating and productive tenure.

We are pleased that a significant majority of our shareholders are satisfied with the Board’s work

over the past year. All ordinary and special resolutions were passed at our Annual General Meeting

held in May 2023 and the 2022 Remuneration Policy and implementation report received more

than 84% and 95% support, respectively.

In closing

Looking ahead, I believe we will continue building on the momentum gained in 2023 by further

expanding and enhancing our integrated financial services offering. However, we expect the

operating environment to remain uncertain and volatile.

I would like to thank the respected members of the Board for their unflagging dedication

to the Company and all its stakeholders.

I would also like to thank our CEO, Iain Williamson, and the executive team for their astute

leadership and steady direction. Together with their talented teams, they make it possible for

the business to consistently deliver excellence to all our stakeholders. Last, but not least, I want

to express my appreciation to all our loyal Mutualites for the positive impact they make in the

lives of our customers and communities.

Ngiyabonga! Kea leboga! Baie dankie! Thank you! Asante!
