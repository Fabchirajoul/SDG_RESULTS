Directors are appointed by the shareholders at the annual

general meeting (AGM) and interim board appointments are

allowed between AGMs. One-third of the longest serving,

non-executive directors are required to retire at each AGM and

may offer themselves for re-election. If recommended by the

directors and supported by the board, the board then proposes

their re-election to shareholders.

Fees

The remuneration of board members is reviewed by the board of

directors and approved and ratified at the AGM. Non-executive

directors receive fixed fees for service on boards and board

committees. This includes a retainer that has been calculated in

line with market practices. There are no contractual

arrangements for compensation for loss of office. Non-executive

directors do not receive short-term incentives, nor do they

participate in any long-term incentive schemes. The fees for

non-executive directors are reviewed on an annual basis to

ensure that such fees at all times remain market-related.
