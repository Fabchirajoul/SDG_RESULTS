letter of appointment and new

directors undergo a comprehensive

induction programme to facilitate

their understanding of the business

environment and markets in which

the group operates. The induction

includes sessions with all of the

executives.

In addition to the annual board

evaluation process, newly

appointed directors are subject to

a peer review of their performance,

contribution and commitment

after their first year and may be

removed or not recommended for

election at the first annual general

meeting (AGM) of shareholders

following their appointment. During

2023 an evaluation of all non-

executive directors were completed

in informing the nomination to

shareholders at the AGM.

The company’s memorandum of

incorporation requires one-third of

non-executive directors to retire by

rotation each year. The third is made

up of directors appointed during the

year in casual vacancies, after which

the longest-serving directors are

required to retire by rotation.

Nomination for re-election is

informed by the individual director’s

performance, contribution and

attendance. Information on directors

standing for election is included in

the AGM notice.

Directors may serve a maximum

of three terms of three years (nine

years in total) from the date of their

first election. The retirement age for

executive directors is 62 years and

for non-executive directors 70 years,

although the nominations committee

may extend the retirement age

beyond 70 subject to annual review.

Board succession is a continuous

area of focus, both from an

emergency and long-term

sustainability perspective. In the

year under review, it continued to

receive attention.

In addition to board succession,

organisational succession planning

and management development form

a key part of the group’s strategy to

build a reliable leadership pipeline.

The nominations committee also

ensures the overall efficacy of the

succession processes, principles

and bench strength, with a specific

focus on the executive, heads of

control functions, Alexander Forbes

Investments Limited executive and

key employees, rainmakers and other

critical positions.

The board has an approved

emergency succession plan.

Board

diversity

As part of our ongoing focus

to maintain the highest

corporate governance

standards and in line with

the JSE Limited Listings

Requirements, the group has

adopted a diversity policy

on the promotion of broader

diversity at board level.

The policy focuses on the promotion

of the diversity attributes of gender,

race, culture, age, field of knowledge,

skills and experience. The board,

with guidance from the nominations

committee, has considered and

applied the diversity policy in the

nomination and appointment of

directors. The board has determined

specific targets for certain indicators.

As at 31 July 2023,

Alexforbes exceeded

its target of

women (four)

Based on the 2022 PwC Executive

Directors report2 and the 2022 PwC

Non-executive Directors report3, our

executive board members are the

same as the JSE average and our non-

executive board members are younger

than the JSE average.

Our board needs to strike a balance

between having sufficient acumen

to provide strategic guidance that is

rooted in experience while ensuring

that no age group is marginalised

in decision-making processes. Our

youngest director is 42 years old and

our average age is 53, which is lower

than the average age for directors for

JSE-listed companies.
