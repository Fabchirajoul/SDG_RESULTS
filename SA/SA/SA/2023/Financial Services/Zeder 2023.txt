director's remuneration is set out on page 39 of this annual report. Due to the limited number of individuals employed

at group level, disclosure of the remuneration of the three highest paid employees who are not directors is not deemed to be

relevant as it adds no value to stakeholders.

Remuneration Policy and Implementation Report

Zeder's Remuneration Policy and Implementation Report, as set out on pages 32 to 47 of this annual report, will be presented to

shareholders for non-binding advisory votes.

In terms of the roles and responsibilities of the remuneration committee, the remuneration committee reviews and approves, on

an annual basis, the Remuneration Policy which is designed to assist in the achievement of the group's strategy and objectives

and to attract, motivate, reward and retain employees in an ethical and responsible manner.

The remuneration committee provides strategic guidance and input to other remuneration committees in the wider group and

each investee has its own remuneration committee to evaluate the remuneration committee's strategic guidance and inputs, to

ensure the execution of the specific company directives and to cater for industry-specific remuneration and incentive drivers,

including specific company incentive-based remuneration applicable to other staff levels.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE

The Zeder Audit and Risk Committee ("audit and risk committee") consists of three independent non-executive directors,

namely Mrs S Cassiem (chairperson), CA Otto and Mrs NS Mjoli-Mncube. Mr CA Otto was a member for the past nine years,

Mrs NS Mjoli-Mncube for the past six and a half years and Mrs S Cassiem for the past two years. Mr JH le Roux, a select group of

Zeder finance employees, the external auditors and other directors are permanent invitees to the audit and risk committee, but

they do not form part of the audit and risk committee's formal decision-making process.

DIRECTOR'S BASE SALARY

1.1

Base salary

The base salaries of executive management were previously benchmarked to both local and international best

remuneration practices. Benchmarking was performed with reference to companies comparable in size, industry, business

complexity and the level of responsibility that the individual assumes to ensure that remuneration is market-related. Base

salary increases were awarded based on inflation, except where there were changes in responsibilities and roles or

aforementioned benchmarking warranted higher increases.

To help drive a long-term focus and decision-making with the ultimate objective of maximising shareholder wealth,

thereby better aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders and other stakeholders, the executive

does not qualify for short-term bonuses. Therefore, their short-term remuneration comprises only a fixed base salary,

payable in cash, which is comparable to the remuneration practices of certain other JSE-listed investment holding

companies in the financial services sector.

The table below provides information on the total remuneration of Zeder's executive director:

30% of the executive director’s annual base salary was deferred for a period of 12 months, and is payable in monthly contributions in

the ensuing year. The deferred payments carries interest at the SARS official rate to compensate for loss in time value of money and is

subject to malus/clawback provisions which could lead to the repayment by the executive director of the deferred component of the

salary amount received during the preceding 12 months. Included in the total cost-to-company, are minor deductions made to group life

cover, membership to a retirement fund and membership to a medical aid scheme (where applicable).

To help drive a long-term focus and decision-making with the ultimate objective to maximise shareholder wealth, thereby better

aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders and other stakeholders, the executive does not qualify for short-term

discretionary bonuses.

Share options exercised during the year were exercised within the extended and approved exercise windows. As a result of the strategic

review and resultant prohibited period for trading in Zeder shares, participants were not allowed to exercise share options during the

2021 and 2022 financial years. As a result of the cautionary withdrawal during the 2023 financial year, participants exercised shares

options relating to the past 3 financial years. As a result, the non-cash gains from exercise of share options (pre-tax) and number of Zeder

shares received via net settlement during the year comprise of the following:

The approved Zeder SIT Deed, entitles the board, acting through its remuneration committee, to instruct the SIT's trustees to effect

such adjustments to the Strike Prices, as defined in the Zeder SIT Deed, of awarded but unexercised share options as the remuneration

committee "shall consider fair and reasonable in the circumstances…" and to take account of special dividends and various other

corporate actions listed in that clause. On 9 May 2022 and 14 November 2022 Zeder distributed gross special dividends of 92.5 cents

and 10 cents per share, respectively, to the Zeder ordinary shareholders as a special dividend from income reserves and on 4 April 2022,

Zeder distributed its entire shareholding in KAL Group to the Zeder ordinary shareholders as a pro rata distribution in specie. In

accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements and the Zeder SIT Deed, the Zeder SIT's trustees adjusted the Strike Prices of the awarded

but unexercised share options. The external auditors, Deloitte & Touche, reviewed through non-audit services, and the JSE approved,

the adjusted strike prices accordingly.
