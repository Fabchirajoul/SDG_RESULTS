Dear shareholders

On behalf of the Board and as Chair of the Remuneration

Committee, I am pleased to introduce the Directors’

remuneration report for the year, full report can be found within

the Investec Group Remuneration Report which is published

separately. We appreciate the constructive engagements we

had with our shareholders and executives during the year.

Performance in the year

The Group successfully navigated a complex macro-economic

backdrop. We achieved 21.6% adjusted operating profit growth

to £835.9 million and a Return on Equity (ROE) of 13.7%.

The strong revenue performance was supported by continued

client acquisition, resulting in higher average advances, rising

interest rates and increased client activity. Fee and commission

income in our Wealth & Investment businesses was negatively

impacted by the effects of the market sell off on average funds

under management.

The overall performance also reflects the effects of inflationary

pressures on operating costs as well as normalisation in both

discretionary expenditure and expected credit impairment loss.

We continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity levels while

striving to provide improved shareholder returns, including

dividends. This year we have achieved our financial targets

announced in guidance provided in November 2022, a year

ahead of schedule.

We returned approximately £780 million to shareholders,

comprising ordinary dividends, the share buy-back / repurchase

and the distribution of the 15% shareholding in Ninety One.

Full details of our performance for the year can be found in the

section ‘Our Performance’ in the Integrated Report.

Remuneration overview for the year

In August 2021 shareholders approved a revised Directors’

Remuneration Policy that we believe is aligned with our

strategy to simplify and focus the business for growth, through

five strategic objectives:

• Capital discipline;

• Growth initiatives;

• Improved cost management;

• Digitalisation; and

• Greater connectivity.

Performance against targets:

Below we cover the salient features of the 2023 remuneration

achievements, illustrated through the lens of the Group Chief

Executive remuneration outcomes.

• Short-term incentive (STI) achievement against both the

financial and non-financial measures was between on-target

and stretch

• Long-term Incentive (LTI) achievement against the financial

measures achieved stretch level and between on-target and

stretch for the non-financial measures.
