DIRECTOR'S REVIEW

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS

We are pleased with the Group's financial results for the

past year given the challenging operating environment. The

Group's normalised headline earnings of R5 079 million,

were positively impacted by improved mortality experience,

due to the modest impact of Covid-19 in the current year,

and a strong improvement in investment variances from

favourable shifts in yield curves.

The Group delivered normalised headline earnings of

R5 079 million for the 12 months ended 30 June 2023,

up 16% from the prior year. Normalised headline

earnings per share increased by 19% from 287.2 cents to

342.3 cents. Headline earnings per share increased by 5%

from 297.3 cents to 310.7 cents and earnings per share

improved by 20% from 260.6 cents to 313.3 cents.

Operating profit improved by 31% to R4 419 million,

from R3 363 million in the prior year, supported by the

improved mortality experience and investment variances.

Momentum Life, Momentum Corporate, Guardrisk and

Momentum Health delivered pleasing results. Momentum

Investments reported marginally lower operating earnings,

mainly due to lower mortality profits on the annuity and

structured business as well as lower new business sales

on the Momentum Wealth platform, Operating earnings in

Metropolitan Life were mainly impacted by unfavourable

lapse experience on the protection business, as well as

assumption changes reflecting operating headwinds.

Within the Non-life Insurance segment, Momentum Insure

was negatively affected by high claim ratios given adverse

experience and premium increases which lagged rising

claims inflation. Africa saw a significantly improved result

primarily due to positive investment variances and mortality

experience, as well as actuarial basis changes.

Investment return from the Group’s shareholder assets

declined by 35% to R660 million from the prior year, mainly

as a result of a significant fair value gain on the Group’s

investment in venture capital funds in the previous year,

followed by a modest negative movement in the current

year.

Following a review of Momentum Insure's expected future

growth prospects, gross written premium and earnings

expectations have been adjusted downwards. As a result,

we have impaired the remaining R478 million goodwill held

from the acquisition of the Alexforbes Short-term Insurance

business. More positively, earnings include the positive

adjustment of R563 million to the carrying amount of the

Group’s remaining interest in our health insurance joint venture in India, Aditya Birla Health Insurance (ABHI), following

the dilution of the Group’s investment because of the introduction of a new shareholder. Note that the impairment

within Momentum Insure and the gain on our ABHI interest are excluded headline earnings and normalised

headline earnings.

1 Normalised headline earnings adjust the JSE definition of headline earnings for the dilutive impact of finance costs related to preference shares that can be converted into

ordinary shares of the Group, the impact of treasury shares held by policyholder funds and the iSabelo Trust, the amortisation of intangible assets arising from business

combinations, the impairment of loans to subsidiaries following the Group’s disinvestment, B-BBEE costs and the amortisation of the discount at which the iSabelo Trust acquired

the Momentum Metropolitan treasury shares. The adjustment for the impact of treasury shares removes mismatches that are unique to financial institutions that invest in their

own securities on behalf of clients. During 2023, the definition of NHE was refined to include the impairment of loans to subsidiaries, following the Group’s strategic decision to

disinvest from Kenya.

2 Operating profit represents the profit (net of tax) that is generated from the Group’s operational activities and reflects normalised headline earnings excluding the investment

return on shareholder funds.

3 Return on equity expresses normalised headline earnings as a percentage of start-of-year net asset value, adjusted for the items outlined in footnote 2, as well as the adjusting

items to determine headline earnings.

Return on equity and return on embedded value

Return on equity (ROE) for the year was 22.3%, marginally down from 22.7% in the prior year. This strong ROE follows

the Group’s earnings improvement offset by an increase in opening equity relative to the prior year. Group embedded

value per share was R33.75 on 30 June 2023.

The return on embedded value (ROEV) per share was 17.0%, an improvement from 11.7% in the prior year. All per-

share metrics benefited from share repurchases made over the past 12 months.
