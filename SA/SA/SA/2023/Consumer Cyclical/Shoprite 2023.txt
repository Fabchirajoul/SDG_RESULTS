About this report

Shoprite Holdings Limited (the Shoprite Group, or the Group or the

Company) is an investment holding company headquartered in

Cape Town, South Africa. The Company’s primary listing is in the

Food Retailers and Wholesalers’ Sector of the Johannesburg Stock

Exchange (JSE). The Company has three secondary listings on the

A2X, the Namibian Stock Exchange (NSX) and the Lusaka Stock

Exchange (LuSE).

Our Integrated Report provides insight into the Group’s business model, governance

processes and strategy. It evaluates our economic and environmental, social and

governance (ESG) outcomes to provide a balanced, transparent and integrated view of

our creation of value in the year under review, and our prospects of creating sustainable

enterprise value in the medium and long term.

This year’s theme of our report, Investing through the cycle, reflects the Group’s

commitment, despite the enormous cost burden of load-shedding, to maintain its

business-as-usual customer price and value proposition while continuing to invest in our

medium-to-long-term strategic objectives. We believe sustaining our investment in our

customers via prices, promotions and stock availability, store refurbishments, new stores,

store operations, our supply chain, learning and skills development, our people, technology

and digital, which will protect and extend our market-leading position in the future.

We are doubling down on our digital investment to maximise our share-of-wallet and

unlock alternative income. We are investing in additional supply chain capacity to meet

the organic growth demands of our expanding store network, which includes new store

formats, supplying the new stores we acquired, and transforming our fresh foods

supply chain to support our substantial market share gains. We invest in and empower

our people and unemployed youth through learning and skills development. Our

investment in the sustainability and growth of our business provides additional employment

opportunities, and through our investment in the Shoprite Employee Trust, we can

improve our employees’ financial status. Our investment in lower prices shields our

price-sensitive customers and contributes to food security, as does our tireless efforts to

contain our internal food inflation. By investing in local, commercially

viable small, medium and micro-enterprises (SMMEs), we are providing

them with access to working capital on favourable terms and helping

them grow into larger-scale suppliers with

the ability to employ more people from local

communities. Our efforts to reduce our

impact on the planet include investing in renewable energy and programmes to

reduce our water and electricity consumption.

SHOPRITE HOLDINGS LTD Integrated Report 2023:

letter

The Group’s ability to deliver on its strategy and gain market share in an economy reporting marginal growth

can be attributed to its unwavering commitment to providing customers with the lowest prices, its execution and

leadership strength, operational agility and continuous focus on innovation.

Our operating environment

Globally, the operating environment

continues to be challenging, with

economies struggling to contain inflation

as the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues. In

South Africa, efforts to reduce inflation have

been hampered by high petrol and diesel

prices, high food inflation and a weak rand.

In addition, our progress towards achieving

our net-zero carbon emission target

was affected by the need to use diesel

generators during load-shedding, however,

we remain committed to achieving this

target by 2050.

Last year, I reported that from an external

environment perspective; 2022 was

probably the most challenging year the

Group had ever faced. It gives me little

comfort to report that for different reasons,

2023 was equally hard if not more so,

due to the significant increase in Eskom’s

load-shedding, failing infrastructure and

poor municipal service delivery, which

contributed to the overall challenges.

In this report, you will read about the

impact of load-shedding on our value

creation, our suppliers’ productivity, and

our actions to preserve our cold chain and

serve our customers from well-stocked

stores, including increasing our inventory

levels. We discuss the negative impact

on climate change of having to use diesel

generators in our business during load-

shedding. As is to be expected under these

circumstances, business confidence is low

and exacerbated by concerns about risks to the

African Growth and Opportunity Act, which is

vital to the South African economy.

For South African citizens, it has been a

particularly challenging few years. Our core

South African supermarkets business has

remained focused on assisting our customers

to stretch their budgets to cope with the ever-

increasing cost of living. Food inflation has

remained well ahead of wage inflation; transport

and utility costs have all increased; and to

get inflation under control, the South African

Reserve Bank (SARB) has been steadily

raising interest rates since November 2021.

Extreme weather conditions have affected

communities, as has the high level of crime.

The poorly performing economy has resulted

in some companies needing to reduce their

workforce, with those affected joining the

unemployed when unemployment is already

unacceptably high.

Delivering despite the operating

environment

Despite the challenges presented by the

external environment, the Group continues to

deliver consistently on its Smarter Shoprite

strategy, which provides the basis for our

continued investment through the cycle.

The Group’s ability to deliver on its strategy

and gain market share in an economy

reporting marginal growth can be attributed

to its unwavering commitment to providing

customers with the lowest prices, its execution

and leadership strength, operational agility

and continuous focus on innovation. Recent

examples of our innovation are the result of

the excellent work done by our ShopriteX

digital innovation hub. They include the

Xtra Savings rewards programme; the

Checkers Sixty60 on-demand grocery

delivery service; Rex, the Group’s own

customer insights platform (our suppliers

use data analytics accessible through Rex

to optimise the sale of their products in our

stores); and Rainmaker Media, which uses

data analytics for precision advertising.

An inclusive approach

The Board has adopted a stakeholder-

inclusive approach to addressing the

interests and expectations of stakeholders.

This included engaging with shareholders

on ESG and remuneration, which is

addressed in the Remuneration review on

pages 92 and 93 of the Integrated Report.

Our shareholders continue to communicate

their expectations that our focus as an

organisation extends beyond improving

profits and returns to non-financial aspects

that contribute to our value creation and

sustainability. The Group’s purpose to uplift

lives every day by pioneering access to

the most affordable goods and services,

create economic opportunity and protect

our planet, and the inclusion in our strategy

of the driver, a force for good, indicates

that our approach is aligned with their

expectations.

More specifically, the priorities conveyed

to us by our shareholders during the

year fall into two broad categories.
