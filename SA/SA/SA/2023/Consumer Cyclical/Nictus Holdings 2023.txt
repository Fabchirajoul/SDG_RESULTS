MANAGING DIRECTOR’S REPORT

REPORTS

Looking back at the 2023 financial year, which followed a 15-month fiscal year ended 30 June 2022, one can only

be thankful in the grandest sense of the term. What we have experienced in the past 12 months is solely due to

Grace, dedication, and ownership over the preceding year. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to each

and every stakeholder of the Exceptional Wealth Creation team. I am convinced that we are progressing toward

the ideals we set for ourselves.

The N$1 billion turnover was a long-standing goal for the Group and was last achieved in our 2014 financial year.

Despite the recession that ensued, compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic, we are grateful to have reached this

target once again. Most segments performed comparably to the 15-month period of the 2022 financial year, with

a few even surpassing the previous results. Additionally, we came within 96% of the profit achieved in the 2022

financial year—a humbling achievement for which we are grateful.

We are committed to becoming Exceptional Wealth Creators for all our stakeholders and are consistently seeking

to expand our offerings through related diversification. We remain steadfast in our values and strive to work for

the betterment of the country and its people. Despite the global and local uncertainties brought about by looming

recessions, I believe we are poised for growth in these circumstances. Opportunities always exist; one merely

needs to seek them out and seize the best ones. Our management team, employees, and leadership have

exhibited an unprecedented level of ownership and commitment, which I am immensely proud of. Once again, I

extend my heartfelt appreciation to each and every employee for their dedication and contributions.

I am excited about what the future holds for the Group. The new ventures undertaken in the past 18 months are

living up to expectations, and I am confident that they will mature within the next 24 months, contributing to our

vision of becoming Exceptional Wealth Creators. As previously mentioned, new opportunities are on the horizon

that could further contribute to our goals. This is a continuous process that we are committed to investigating.

We are determined to maintain our independence throughout this entire process and to retain control of our

destiny.

Once again, all praise and glory go to our Heavenly Father, of whom we are merely stewards. I extend my

gratitude to my fellow board members for their patience and unwavering support.

With gratitude and a steadfast commitment to being Exceptional Wealth Creators.

PHILIPPUS TROMP:

Managing Director operates within the

bounds of the business plan, which incorporates the framework for authority delegation. A diverse range of skills

and extensive experience enriches the composition of the Board, ensuring a well-rounded perspective.

Non-executive Directors constitute the majority of the Board, with the majority of these being independent.

Striking a balance of authority and power, underpinned by expertise and experience, remains a focal point. Board

decisions are reached through rigorous deliberation, guided by consensus and thorough analysis of relevant

information.

Appointment and Development of Directors

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee oversees the formal appointment process for Directors. A

comprehensive induction process ensures a thorough understanding of Nictus’ values. Continual development

programs enhance the capabilities of Directors, and our commitment to appointing suitably skilled individuals

underscores our dedication. Directors are expected to stay abreast of economic, social, statutory, and

environmental changes to respond and comply effectively in a dynamic environment.

Annual internal evaluations of the Board, Committees, and individual Directors, and the potential for outsourcing

such evaluations when necessary, ensure optimal performance. These evaluations provide insights into areas of

improvement and avenues for continuous development.

The Board is supported in fulfilling its responsibilities by well-organized Board Committees and a proficient,

suitably qualified, and experienced Company Secretary. A governance framework is in place, encompassing

both the Holding Company and its subsidiary Boards. This framework ensures robust representation across all

subsidiary Boards. Board Committees are thoughtfully constituted, comprising of Board members and, in the

case of the Social, Ethics, and Sustainability Committee, a member of Senior Management who is not a Board

member. Their authority, objectives, and functions are governed by clearly defined terms of reference, mandates,

and charters, which undergo annual reviews to maintain their relevance. These Board Committees maintain a

direct reporting line to the Board.

Managing Director and functionally to the Chairperson of the Audit and Risk Committee. The internal

audit’s coverage plan, based on risk assessment, receives annual approval from the Audit and Risk Committee.

The internal audit function plays a significant role in the risk management process, informing the compilation of

the risk report, which is subsequently presented to the Board for comprehensive evaluation.

Overseeing external audit activities, including the recommendation of auditor appointment, assessment of

qualifications, independence, audit approach, methodology, reporting, and performance evaluation, falls within

the purview of the Audit and Risk Committee.

This Committee also undertakes the responsibility of overseeing and monitoring Nictus’ risk management

processes. Its role encompasses establishing and sustaining an understanding of the risks that warrant attention,

and evaluating the adequacy of management’s actions to address and mitigate such risks. Furthermore, the

Board, in collaboration with Subsidiary Boards, assesses risk tolerance and appetite during periodic reviews of

the Group’s risk profile. This profile shapes the scope in which the Board permits management to engage in risk-

inclined initiatives.

To facilitate the design, implementation, and monitoring of Nictus’ risk management plan, the Board, assisted by

the Audit and Risk Committee, has entrusted this responsibility to the Group’s risk management team.

Continual risk assessments are conducted by management, providing regular feedback to the Audit and Risk

Committee and the Board. The collective wealth of expertise, paired with the established framework and risk

methodology, enhances the Group’s capacity to anticipate unforeseeable risks.

Nictus’ risk methodology encompasses the analysis and implementation of suitable responses to identified risks,

aligned with the Group’s strategic objectives.

Nictus employs a blend of daily and periodic activities to monitor risks, spanning various levels within the

organization. The oversight and management of Nictus’ risk management process rest with the Group’s risk

management team and the Audit and Risk Committee.

Assurances concerning the effectiveness of the risk management process are provided by both management and

internal audit to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board.

The Audit and Risk Committee’s fulfilment of duties is reported to both the Board and shareholders, showcasing

transparency in discharging its responsibilities.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT:

Managing Director. The Board has delegated the duty of implementing an IT

governance framework to the Group: Managing

Managing Director. While the internal auditor maintains an open invitation to

all Management Committee meetings, they are briefed on strategic and risk-related developments by participating

senior executives. Access to minutes of meetings is also granted. Additionally, the internal auditor is invited to

attend Audit and Risk Committee meetings and engages frequently with senior executives. Equipped with the

appropriate skills, experience, and resources, the internal audit is adeptly positioned to fulfil its mandate.

GOVERNING STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS

The annual report, in conjunction with the Group’s business plan, serves as a reflection of the values and priorities

held by Nictus concerning its stakeholders. These encompass a diverse array of interests, and the report outlines

strategic actions to ensure positive perceptions about the Group and its endeavours. The Board undertakes

an ongoing process of assessing feedback from distinct stakeholder groups, meticulously considering their

perceptions.
