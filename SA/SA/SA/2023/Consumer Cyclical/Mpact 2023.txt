letter of admission from an accredited public tertiary

institution based in South Africa;

 the race and gender of the beneficiary;

 geographical location, taking into account the Mpact

operations; and

 an interview with the student.

The approach of the Foundation has not been to limit or

stipulate fields of study, with students enrolling for varying

degrees in fields such as logistics, accounting, education, social

work, industrial engineering, applied chemistry and medicine.

The academic bursaries that are awarded cover full boarding

and tuition, an allowance per semester, as well as stationery

and prescribed books. Students are offered the opportunity to

gain work experience during placements at Mpact operations

in their July holidays for which they are paid. The vacation work

I believe that having access to good

education can change each person’s

life for the better; it can change

circumstances for individuals, their

families and future dependants.

It also provides the opportunity

for them to become part of

the economically active

population in our

country.
