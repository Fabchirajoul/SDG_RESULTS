INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023:

LETTER TO

STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUED

CONTINUED JOURNEY TO IMPROVED DISCLOSURE

AND ENHANCED REPORTING

The Integrated Reporting and Assurance Services provider (“IRAS”)

conducts an annual review of ESG reporting by JSE-listed companies.

Employing their Sustainability Data Transparency Index (“SDTI”),

their 2022 methodology rated companies according to 203 key

indicators (“disclosures”), including: standard disclosures; economic;

governance; labour; health and safety; environmental and CSI/SED.

The Group’s results of the 2022 IRAS assessment are summarised

below.

Note: the scoring for the 2021 financial year data was adjusted due

to the inclusion of 60 new indicators within the 2022 financial year

survey (eight scored), and the elimination of scoring for three prior

year indicators. All of the new indicators resulted from stakeholder

engagement with multiple ESG/Sustainability experts, including

33 that came directly from the JSE’s Sustainability Disclosure

Guidance launched in the first half of 2022.

Although the score of 61,54% declined from 63,46% in 2021, the

result qualifies as ‘good’ as defined by IRAS and substantially

exceeds the JSE average score of 50,68%.

In light of the weaker score received on the revised health and safety

and labour indicators, effort has been made to expand our disclosure

in this regard. The Human Resources and Training report in this

document contains substantially more information than in previous

years. This enhanced disclosure should result in an improved score

in the 2023 assessment.

Human Resources and Training report page 78.

In order to ensure consistent improvement in reporting standards,

management will continue to use the SDTI checklist as an internal

gap analysis, in conjunction with other ESG best practice frameworks,

as well as the JSE’s recently launched disclosure guidelines.

JSE SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE AND

CLIMATE DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE

The Board supports the philosophy and intent of the JSE

Sustainability and Climate Disclosure Guidance documents that

serve as voluntary guidance tools to improve the quality of ESG

reporting, and accordingly, has incorporated them in the disclosure

gap analysis which is conducted on a regular basis to benchmark the

business’s reporting standards against best practice.

The Board is satisfied that the following disclosures, as recommended

by the guidelines, are being adopted in this report.

1. Governance – the Board’s oversight of sustainability and climate-

related impacts, risks and opportunities, and its process for

integrating sustainability issues into the overall governance

approach.

2. Strategy – how an assessment of sustainability and climate-

related impacts, risks and opportunities has influenced the

organisation’s strategy, and what impact this has had on the

organisation’s overall performance, both positive and negative.

3. Management – how sustainability and climate-related impacts,

risks and opportunities are identified, assessed, and integrated

into the organisation’s management processes.

4. Metrics, targets, and performance – the performance metrics

and targets used by the organisation to measure, monitor, and

manage its sustainability and climate impacts, risks and

opportunities, and its performance against these metrics

and targets.

Reference: information extracted from the JSE Sustainability Disclosure

Guidance and Climate Disclosure Guidance.

Note: the reports in this IAR on corporate governance, the

environment, remuneration and material risks and opportunities

elaborate on our ESG endeavours in terms of governance, strategy,

management, metrics and performance.:

Environmental sustainability is core to all our strategies. The Group

is committed to minimising the environmental impact of operations

for our customers, our staff and all other stakeholders and remains

committed to developing and sourcing products that not only

require fewer resources to produce, but enable our customers to

save water, electricity and waste. We continue to innovate and invest

in technology to use our resources more efficiently.

The Group continuously develops its overarching environmental

sustainability framework including metrics, targets and reporting.

Sustainability forums have been established to monitor progress,

innovate and work towards achieving the targets. Improved tracking

of relevant metrics against targets is ongoing.

The Group is committed to reducing, reusing, recycling and

recovering as a key principle to limit our waste and minimise our

contribution to emissions, effluents and landfill.

As in all our business processes, continuous improvement will be

required to develop the capabilities we need to deliver on our

targets.
