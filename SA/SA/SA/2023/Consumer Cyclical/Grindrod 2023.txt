Suppliers agree to adhere to Grindrod’s position concerning corruption, to take

measures to deter corruption in their operations and to immediately report to

Grindrod any suspicion of corruption in their dealings, be these with Grindrod or

on Grindrod’s behalf. In addition, any potential business partner must fully

disclose previous dealings and current relationships that may present a

heightened risk of Grindrod being associated with corrupt activities.

Grindrod has two anonymous reporting hotlines, which all stakeholders can

use to report wrongdoing. Moreover, the organisation enforces a comprehensive

whistleblowing policy to protect those reporting.

analysis and approval process. Obtaining Ethixbase360 Tcertification means that

membership helps companies conduct business ethically and in compliance with

the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-bribery

legislation. Ethixbase360 provides continuous monitoring of individuals and

company names listed in its due diligence reports using a database of Politically

Exposed Persons (PEP) and Denied Parties.

Grindrod is committed to the protection of human rights and the prevention of

slavery and human trafficking in all its forms and has a zero tolerance approach to

modern slavery. Grindrod’s anti-slavery and anti-trafficking policy clearly

prevention of slavery and human trafficking in all its forms. Please refer to

Grindrod’s anti-slavery and anti-trafficking policy.

Our suppliers are critical to our success, and we aim to build strong, proactive and

long-term working relationships with them. Grindrod’s Sustainability Code of

Conduct for Suppliers (Code) sets out the minimum standards and expectations

for environmental, social and ethical performance for all our suppliers and

encourages all those with whom we do business to observe the same standards,

and we expect our suppliers to apply similar requirements for their own

supply chain.

This Code affirms Grindrod’s commitment to labour and human rights, and the

expectation that suppliers observe and respect internationally recognised human

letter of demand. Due to

the cross-default Grindrod has also issued a: letter of demand on the fair value loan.

^ On 01 July 2023, a long-term debt funding arrangement was restructured to facilitate a repayment, reducing the quantum of the loan

as well to revise the underlying securities provided to the funder. Any proceeds on realising this investment now forms part of the

revised security under the new arrangement.

^^ Due to negative industry/market factors, a liquidity challenge arose in the latter part of the current year and the investee defaulted

on funding repayments as at 31 December 2023. Accordingly, an adjusted net asset value is considered the most appropriate

valuation benchmark (Dec 2022: price multiple approach). Adjustments relate to increased credit losses applied on the financing

book. The Group does not guarantee any of the debts in the business.
