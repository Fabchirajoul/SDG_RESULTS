CEO AND EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE

The Board, with the assistance of the Human Capital

INDEPENDENT ADVICE

The Board, Board committees and individual directors

If appropriate, the advice may be made available to

other directors.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Board assumes responsibility for the governance

of risk by setting the direction for how risk should be

approached and addressed that encompasses both

opportunities and associated risks to be considered

when developing strategies for Novus Holdings.

The Board with the assistance of the Risk

Management Committee has approved the risk

management system that articulates and gives effect

to its set direction on risk. The executive team further

continues to monitor and identify key risks in the

business.

Novus Holdings’ risk management system includes

the establishment of various policies, strategies,

processes, procedures and tools for identifying,

measuring, monitoring, managing and reporting of all

material risks to which Novus Holdings is exposed.

The risk management framework sets out the key

principles that guide the implementation of risk

management at all levels. At Novus Holdings, risk

management is an integral part of the management

processes. The Group’s effectiveness is enhanced

when risk management is part of the culture and

is embedded in its daily practices and business

processes.

There are a number of assurance role players that

provide different types of assurance and are referred

to as the three lines of defence.
