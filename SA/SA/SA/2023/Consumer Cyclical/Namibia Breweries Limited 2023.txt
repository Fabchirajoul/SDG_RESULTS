Forward-looking statements

This integrated annual report contains statements about

NBL that are or may be forward-looking. Examples of

forward-looking statements include statements about a

future financial position or future profits, cash flows, strategy,

estimates of capital expenditures, acquisition strategy or

future capital expenditure levels, and other economic factors

such as interest and exchange rates.

These generally use forward-looking words or phrases such

as ‘believe’, ‘aim’, ‘expect’, ‘anticipate’, ‘intend’, ‘foresee’,

‘forecast’, ‘likely’, ‘should’, ‘planned’, ‘may’, ‘estimated’ and

‘potential’, or similar words and phrases.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and

uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on

circumstances that may or may not occur in future.

NBL cautions that forward-looking statements are not

guarantees of future performance.

Notice of annual

general meeting:

Managing Director at DB Breweries in New Zealand. We look

forward to working with him and the Management Team as

we prepare NBL for a new phase.

NBL has a proud heritage of more than 100 years.

At HEINEKEN, we understand what that means. This year

we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Heineken®

brand and over 100 years of operating in Africa. We have

deep roots in the continent and believe in the long-term

prospects for Africa and Namibia. As the baton passes from

O&L to HEINEKEN as the new majority shareholder, we feel

responsible for leading NBL to even greater success over the

next 100 years.

I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate

Sven Thieme for his stewardship of the NBL business and to

thank the previous Board for their commitment and focus on

ensuring ongoing success while steering NBL successfully

through the transaction and approval process.

As we turn a new page in the story of NBL, it is my honour

to welcome the whole NBL family, including the colleagues

who have joined from former Distell Namibia, to the wider

HEINEKEN family. I have been impressed with the positive

and resilient approach of the NBL team. Thank you for

your commitment and professionalism during a period of

uncertainty and change. As a result of your efforts, we can

now look forward to this new chapter with excitement and

energy.

A purpose-led and future-oriented

business

During this transition period we shall integrate the different

businesses and invest in infrastructure and upgrades.

This will be challenging for the business and our people,

compounded by difficult market conditions and consumer

pressures. Financial and operational results for the past year

reflected rising hardship, with lower volumes and decreased

operating profit.

We believe, however, that NBL has a strong foundation

and that our embedded values, long-term perspective,

entrepreneurial spirit, and respect for people and the planet

will carry us through this cycle. By adopting the HEINEKEN

purpose to brew the Joy of True Togetherness to inspire

a better world, we are building on NBL’s previous purpose

of Creating a Future, Enhancing Life. NBL’s values will

live on and find new focus as we align to HEINEKEN’s Brew

a Better World 2030 agenda. This ambitious programme

will continue NBL’s good work over recent years in making

meaningful and positive contributions towards the SDGs.

The NBL of the future will bring significant benefits for our

stakeholders, including:

‒

An exciting opportunity to grow the iconic Windhoek

brand not only in Namibia and South Africa, but across

Africa.

‒

Adding premium beer offerings to NBL’s established

mainstream portfolio.

‒

Creating a complimentary multi-product category offering

that can serve multiple consumer occasions and benefit

from key emerging industry trends.

‒

Strengthening our portfolio of brands across categories,

including wine, cider and spirits.

‒

Unlocking synergies with NBL as the sole distributor of

all HEINEKEN Beverages products in Namibia, including

additional local manufacturing.

Together we commit to being a strong partner for growth

in Namibia and positively impacting the communities we

operate in.

A new micro, small and medium

enterprise development fund for

Namibia

One of the conditions set by the Namibian Competition

Commission for the approval of the HEINEKEN transactions

was the establishment of a micro, small and medium

enterprise (MSME) development fund. The fund will develop

suppliers in our value chain and will enable us to invest in

technical trade, operational and digital skills as well as service

support including technical, packaging, advertising and

promotions. Their first priority is to decide on a governance

structure and constitution that will direct the allocation of up

to N$25 million over the next five years.

ensures a clear distinction between governance oversight

and executive management responsibilities, promoting

effective corporate governance.

In the course of fulfilling their duties, all NBL Directors

have the right to seek independent advice when deemed

necessary.

NBL has established procedures that require Directors to

promptly disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest

they may have in relation to specific agenda items. Directors

are obligated to recuse themselves from discussions or

decisions involving matters where they have a conflict

of interest, or there is a potential or perceived conflict of

interest. Directors are generally expected to avoid any direct

or indirect interests that may conflict with the best interests

of the company.

Managing Director’s report from page 30.

Changing consumer purchasing behaviour: Pressure on

consumer disposable income translates into buying decisions,

with a move outside of the beer category, usually towards higher

alcohol-by-volume products. This is especially observed in the

mainstream segment, where choices include mainstream wines,

RTDs, ciders and spirits and so gaining market share in the

Namibian alcohol industry as a whole. Furthermore, declining

consumer disposable income also results in liquids competing for

a share of the wallet, against non-liquids such as food and other

basic needs

We continuously explore opportunities for new beverages through innovation

in our value chain while also remaining committed to supporting low- and

non-alcoholic beverages within our portfolio. Confirming beer as a credible

choice that meets consumers’ functional, emotional and social needs will be

a key focus going forward. Pressure on the beer segment (specifically in the

mainstream) remains a challenge, and key focus areas have been put in place

to stabilise and grow Namibian NBL beer volumes.

Read more in the section on beverage and consumer trends from page 26.

Compliance: By complying with laws, regulations, standards,

policies, processes and procedures, we act as a good corporate

citizen and protect the interests of our stakeholders. Non-

compliance can result in business disruption, fines, penalties, loss

of income and reputational damage.

We have clear roles and responsibilities around compliance and execute

compliance requirements according to the combined assurance model. We

identified NBL’s legal compliance universe and report on a regular basis to the

NBL Audit and Risk Committee, which has oversight of compliance.

Read more in the governance report from page 46.

Cybercrime: While technology brings significant efficiencies

and opportunities, it brings the risk of cybercrime that can result

in financial losses and reputational damage due to phishing,

ransomware, data loss, and the cost impact of the recovery of

data.

We conduct annual cyber risk assessments to identify exposure within the IT

environment. These assessments consist of IT control audits and internal and

external vulnerability tests. We also focus on continuous employee awareness

and education on cybercrime and assess user awareness status through

simulations.

General IT security measures are continuously updated. When we evaluate

the current state of information security, any weaknesses are immediately

addressed through the implementation of corrective actions. NBL has cyber

liability insurance cover and offsite disaster recovery infrastructure.

Proxy Form, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report. The other information does not include the consolidated and separate financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated and separate financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion

thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is

materially inconsistent with the consolidated and separate financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other

information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated and separate financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the

requirements of the Companies Act of Namibia and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated and separate financial statements

that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated and separate financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as

applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group and/or Company or to cease operations, or

have no realistic alternative but to do so.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error

and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always

detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to

influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated and separate financial statements.:

Managing Director and

Finance Director) are the Group’s ‘Chief Operating Decision Maker’ within the meaning of IFRS 8.

The operating segments have been identified and classified in a manner that reflects the nature of the products offered by the Group.

Operating segments whose total revenue, absolute profit or loss for the period or total assets are 10% or more of total Group revenue, profit or loss or total assets, are reported separately.

The measure of profit or loss used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes), which includes revenue and expenses directly relating to a business

segment but excludes net finance charges and taxation, which cannot be allocated to any specific segment.

(t) Fair value measurement

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value

measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

‒

In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

‒

In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest

level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

‒

Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at measurement date

‒

Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.

‒

Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
