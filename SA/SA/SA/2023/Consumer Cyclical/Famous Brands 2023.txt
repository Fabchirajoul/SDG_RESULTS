managing director of Mala Mala

Game Reserve.

Thabo is a well-rounded business

leader with extensive hospitability

experience, and we look forward to

his contributions.

John Halamandres, a long-standing

non-executive director, will retire

from the Board after the Annual

General Meeting on 20 July 2023.

John was appointed to the Board in

November 1994 and held the roles

of: Managing Director and CEO at

Famous Brands. As a founding

member of the Company, he has

played an important role in the

Group’s success and continued

evolution. We are thankful for his

dedication to the Group over several

decades and wish him well with

his retirement.

Every business must work

towards becoming energy

independent.

Succession planning is a major priority for the

Board both at executive and non-executive

level.

Appreciation

I thank our franchise partners for their

continued faith in our brands and

business model. Many of our

franchise partners have been with the

Group for many years, and growing

and developing our brands with

them is a privilege.

I thank Darren Hele for his exceptional

leadership and positive influence on

the business. He is a hands-on leader

who is both strategic and

operationally very strong. He has

been with Famous Brands for over

20 years and together with his

experienced executive team have

steered the Group with aplomb.

I thank my fellow Board members

for their commitment, wisdom and

insights throughout the past year.

Also, thank you to all our employees,

shareholders, suppliers and other

stakeholders for contributing to our

success in the past financial year.

Santie Botha

letter to President Ramaphosa

outlining our concerns regarding the

energy crisis and its crippling effect

on businesses.

The open: letter, issued on behalf

of the Consumer Goods Council

of South Africa members, noted

the consumer goods industry’s

significant contribution to gross

domestic product (GDP) and

position as South Africa’s largest

employer. Instead of expanding

and creating new employment,

the industry spends billions on

diesel. This financial burden is

unsustainable and will result in

higher pricing for consumers, who

are already under severe financial

strain. We need urgent and decisive

action to solve the energy crisis.

As an industry, we advocated for

suspending the fuel duty levy and

road accident fund for the consumer

goods industry for as long as load

shedding occurs. We are a critical

sector in providing stable food,

medicines and other essential goods

supplies. As a critical sector, we

should qualify for fuel rebates similar

to the mining, agriculture, fisheries

and forestry sectors.

Thankfully, during the National

Budget speech in February 2023,

Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana

announced a diesel fuel levy refund

to food manufacturers for two

years, effective 1 April 2023 to

31 March 2025. We have

commenced the process to

register the relevant plants on

this scheme. Unfortunately,

at the time of publishing this

report we have not been able

to successfully register for this

scheme.

The Minister also announced

a 125% tax deduction on the

cost of renewable energy assets

for businesses. The incentive,

which will be available for two years,

applies to assets brought into use

for the first time from 1 March 2023

onwards and cover all project sizes.

This decision is welcomed and

certainly strengthens the investment

case for renewable energy.

Responding to the

KwaZulu-Natal floods

In April 2022, parts of KwaZulu-Natal

were affected by devasting floods,

impacting many lives and

businesses. In total, 99 restaurants

were closed due to damage or

poor accessibility to the locations.

The floods also affected our

KwaZulu-Natal franchise partners as

holidaymakers cancelled their Easter

trips to the region.

Fortunately, our KwaZulu-Natal

Distribution Centre did not suffer

any direct damage, although

employee attendance and damage

to the road infrastructure did create

some delivery delays. The Logistics

team quickly rallied to ensure that all

restaurants were serviced, and none

were affected by dropped product

deliveries. With the support of

TruBev, we assisted our franchise

partners with water deliveries of

over 100 kilolitres to keep their

businesses operational.

The Debonairs Pizza team and our

franchise partners wasted no time

supporting those in need. The brand

donated seven tonnes of food to

Quick fact:

load shedding costs the country more

affected families through its long-

standing Doughnation corporate

social investment (CSI) initiative. I am

impressed by the camaraderie and

resilience of our KwaZulu-Natal

franchise partners. They have faced

several challenges in the past few

years, including the civil unrest in

July 2021, poor tourism seasons

due to COVID-19 and, more recently,

the beach closures due to sewerage

spills in December 2022.

Read more about our CSI activities

in 2023 on page 107.

Executing our Logistics

strategy

The new KwaZulu-Natal Distribution

Centre was commissioned in

November 2022. The centre offers

several advantages over the previous

centre, it is larger and has a more

efficient layout. In addition, it offers

the opportunity to generate up to

334 kWp of our electricity needs

from our rooftop solar installation.

In October 2022, we announced our

intentions to purchase the Midrand

Campus head office. Our head office

has been at 478 James Crescent,

Halfway House in Midrand, since

1990. The purchase, finalised in

February 2023, was for the acquisition

of Steers Properties (Pty) Ltd and

Halamandaris Props (Pty) Ltd.

The properties will be redeveloped

and expanded to better align with

the Group’s strategy for its Logistics

division. This includes investing in

new cold storage facilities to allow

Famous Brands to relocate its

Cold Storage Centre to Midrand

from Crown Mines. This purchase

is another step in better utilising

our head office campus. In

November 2021, the Group

purchased the adjoining property

at 39 Richards Drive.

Midrand is well-suited as the heart

of our Gauteng Logistics operation.

This transaction paves the way

toward a better functioning, bigger,

fit-for-purpose campus. It will allow

us to consolidate Gauteng Logistics

operations allowing for great

efficiencies and, ultimately, cost

Wage negotiations

We concluded our wage

negotiations on 31 May 2023

agreeing to a two-year deal.

Looking to the future

We see opportunities for growth

and improvement throughout our

business. In our Brands division,

we will continue to grow our

footprint through franchising,

licensing and Company-owned

stores. We are working on exciting

partnerships with retail groups and

prominent loyalty programme

providers.

In 2023, we opened three drive thru

restaurants in South Africa and will

focus on growing this format in

2024. The format meets consumers’

growing requirements for

convenience and security. In 2023,

we trialled a new Steers Fried

Chicken as a clip-on, standalone

concept on an existing Steers outlet.

The consumer reception has been

positive, and if the pilot is successful,

we will roll it out further.

We are investing in delivery

technology to improve our last

mile efficiency for own delivery.

Partnerships with third-party

platforms will remain critical. Here,

menu engineering across third-party

platforms and own delivery will be

essential to deliver targeted gross

profit margins. Investing in

consumer-facing technology is

important in ensuring our relevance

and meeting consumer needs.

In our Manufacturing division,

we continue to drive operational

efficiencies, improve product quality

and explore ways to reduce our

environmental footprint.

Our Logistics strategy is progressing

well with our plans to relocate our

Gauteng cold storage facilities to

Midrand. We are still investigating

potential sites for a cross-docking

facility near Mthatha in the Eastern

Cape. Increasingly, our Logistics

strategy is enabled by technology.

Since 2016 , our franchise partners

have used an online ordering

platform. We have plans to grow our

share of the overall basket through

an upgraded and improved targeted

online strategy.

The Retail division will focus on

expanding its distribution footprint,

growing volumes and launching

new product lines and extensions.

Read more about our investments

in consumer-facing technology

on page 82.

Supporting our

franchise partners

We never lose sight of the franchise

model being our main channel for

reaching consumers. The

sustainability of our franchise

partners is essential for the

continued success of our Brands,

Manufacturing and Logistics

divisions. We always prioritise

franchise partner sustainability.

There are many ways to drive

innovation through trading

formats, technology and

product innovation.

Chief Executive Officer’s report

letter on page 19).

Each company has its unique culture

and way of doing business and

Famous Brands was no different.

Although I was on the Board, this

was a new challenge for me. I did

not know what to expect or the

challenges that I would face.

I found a warm and friendly

environment that made me feel like

I was part of a family from the first

day. This is a good reflection on

Famous Brands which originated in

a family setting. The friendly,

family-oriented environment, echoes

through the offices and into the

boardrooms and I was well received

by Exco, by my new finance team

and by the business in general.

In this environment, I was able to

assimilate the business quickly and

easily and it enabled me to

introduce new and alternative

accounting strategies, systems and

processes. There were some

challenges that we had to overcome,

but that was par for the course and I

was able to draw on my experience

whenever these challenges arose.

I will miss being part of this family-

oriented business. However the time

has come for me to enjoy my

retirement and spend more time with

my family. It has been an amazing

journey and I thank the Board for

entrusting me with this role, and for

giving me the opportunity to be part

of this growing business. I wish you

continued success and prosperity

going forward.

I would like to welcome

Nelisiwe Shiluvana, who will assume

the role of Group Financial Director

on 1 August 2023. She is a great

asset to the team with her broad-

based finance experience, starting

with her reporting and operating

functions in the telecoms industry

to her consulting experience as a

partner at EY. She has a depth of

knowledge and experience in

finance and will continue the

journey of re-shaping the Group

finance function so that it becomes

more streamlined, focused and

resilient. She has been a critical part

of the team that has re-shaped

finance, especially the reporting side,

in the last 18 months.

I believe that Neli is an excellent

choice and the right candidate

to take over the reins from me.

I wish Neli the very best with this

new venture.

Remuneration

consultants

Where appropriate, the Committee

obtains advice from independent

remuneration consultants. The

Committee employs the consultants

directly, with direct engagement

from the Committee to ensure

independence.

In 2023, the Committee engaged

the services of two remuneration

consultancies, namely 21st Century

Pay Solutions and Deloitte. The

consultancy 21st Century Pay

Solutions was contracted to conduct

an annual benchmarking study on

the STI scheme. The study

considered the STI on target and

maximum pay against the market

and concluded that the STI was in

line with the market.

Deloitte was consulted to perform

the following services:

–

Review the current LTI scheme

including benchmarking the

scheme against remuneration

arrangements from the

broader South African market.

The benchmarking exercise

also analysed the on-target

pay mix from a best practice

perspective. The findings

suggest that the Famous Brands

CEO and executives are well-

positioned from a guaranteed

pay perspective but fall slightly

below market benchmarks from

a cash target pay and total on

target pay perspective.

–

Design and recommend a

revised LTI scheme, in the form

of a Long-Term Share Plan, that

is fit for purpose and ensures the

attraction and retention of key

senior management employees

through market-aligned

incentivisation.

–

Review the STI scheme,

considering current practices,

targets, and pay mix and propose

a new STI scheme. Read more on

page 146.

The Committee is satisfied with the

independence and objectivity of

both 21st Century Pay Solutions and

Deloitte as being independent

consulting firms with extensive

experience in remuneration.

The Remuneration Policy and the LTI

in particular have gone through a

substantive review in the past two

years to adjust to today’s business

and economic realities. This includes

considering the impact of both GBK

and COVID-19. This was completed

to ensure that it remains relevant

and achieves its intended objectives

of retaining and rewarding our

management.

However, we acknowledge that the

Remuneration Policy is a living

document and is subject to regular

review and change. In 2023, we

policy

Our Remuneration Policy aims

revised our Remuneration Policy, to

improve clarity and completeness.

The Remuneration Committee’s

mandate (refer page 135) is to assist

the Board in discharging its oversight

responsibilities relating to all

compensation matters.

Our policy design

Our remuneration policy, setting out

the Group’s remuneration principles

and practices, applies to all

employees. It provides a high-level

guideline for implementing the

Group’s remuneration strategies and

designing and managing

remuneration processes.

The policy was designed around the

following themes:

–

Support for the business strategy,

objectives and long-term

interests of Famous Brands and

its stakeholders, aligned with the

Group’s beliefs and values.

–

Maintain a competitive reward

system to attract, motivate

and retain high-performing

individuals, including industry-

competitive packages.

–

Apply consistent and responsible

business and remuneration

practices, sound and effective

risk management and

governance.

–

Develop performance metrics

that are demanding and

sustainable and cover all relevant

aspects of the business.

The policy also considers King IV

(principle 14), the Companies Act

2008, the Basic Conditions of

Employment Act 1997, the

Employment Equity Act 1998 and

other applicable legislation.

The use of remuneration consultants

The Committee can obtain advice from independent remuneration consultants, where appropriate. The

Committee employs and engages with them directly to ensure independence. The Committee reviews the

consultants’ independence annually.

The Committee typically engages consultants to perform the following services:

–

Job evaluation and organisational design.

–

Executive salary surveys.

–

Annual benchmarking of STI scheme.

–

Review of the LTI scheme.

–

Advising on the remuneration report for the IAR.

Long-term incentives

The LTI is designed to drive the longer-term strategic and sustainable focus of Famous Brands, ensuring alignment

between the long-term interests of executives and shareholders. It serves as a wealth creation mechanism for executives

and drives the creation of shareholder value when strategic performance drivers are met. In 2024, the Long-Term Share

Plan will replace the existing LTI. The current granted awards will continue to vest as per the rules of the current scheme.

Current Scheme Vesting structure and methodology

The vesting structure in terms of the new share plan has been simplified. All share awards vest in year three,

provided that the service condition and performance conditions which were set at award date are met. (Refer to

page 142). Share appreciation rights no longer exist in the new Share Plan.:
