Letter from the Phuthuma Nathi chair

Dear shareholder

On behalf of the Phuthuma Nathi board, I feel

privileged to once again report back to our Phuthuma

Nathi share scheme shareholders through our FY23

integrated annual report. I like to take the time to

remind our readers each year that we have 76 961

black shareholders in the Phuthuma Nathi scheme

(2022: 78 515), with the scheme holding a 25%

direct investment in MultiChoice SA. This means that

the individuals, stokvels and black-owned companies

in our Phuthuma Nathi share scheme own an indirect

investment in MultiChoice SA through a holding

structure that is effcient and cost effective.

On page 14, we update our historic return on

investment summary so that you can better

understand how to think about your returns on your

Phuthuma Nathi shares. As you may have heard

elsewhere, past performance is no guarantee of

future performance, meaning that just because our

scheme has done exceptionally well for shareholders

over time, does not mean that it will necessarily

continue to do so. But we sincerely hope to continue

to deliver great value for our shareholders, as does

the MultiChoice SA organisation. MultiChoice SA has

paid a total amount of ZAR16.4bn in dividends since

Phuthuma Nathi’s inception. An investor in the

Phuthuma Nathi 1 scheme would have earned

around 33% annual return on their initial investment,

with roughly 17% of that coming from capital growth

and the remainder from dividend payments.

MultiChoice SA has

managed to retain its

dividend, albeit at a

slightly lower level which

The year in review

Our integrated annual report unpacks the MultiChoice

SA operational performance for FY23 on page 54 and

the fnancial performance on page 65.

In short, the MultiChoice SA team has done

exceptionally well to steer the ship through an

increasingly challenging economic and consumer

environment. We all know how tough it has become

for South Africans in recent years and these

underlying issues were compounded in the current

year by the severe and sustained escalation in

loadshedding. Our country is in crisis and it has

unfortunately started to negatively impact

MultiChoice SA.

MultiChoice SA was able to sustain subscriber

growth in FY23, with the 90-day active subscriber

base growing by 3% YoY. However, subscription

revenues were down 4% over the same period due

to deteriorating subscriber activity and reconnection

rates as a direct result of loadshedding and

economic pressure on customers affecting their

ability to afford pay-tv services. Overall, MultiChoice

SA revenues were also down 3% as growth in

advertising revenues normalised this year. Although

MultiChoice SA continued to work hard to manage

its cost base to offset revenue pressure, its trading

margins and free cash fows came under some

pressure. Despite these challenges, MultiChoice SA

still managed to declare a dividend, albeit at a

slightly lower level.

If you exchanged a portion of your Phuthuma Nathi

shares for MultiChoice Group shares in FY20, or

have bought MultiChoice Group shares directly

through the JSE and would like to better understand

more about the broader group’s performance,

I recommend visiting the MultiChoice Group website

for its full integrated annual report and other fnancial

reporting information.

From myself and my colleagues on the board, thank

Chair: Phuthuma Nathi

Dividend

The MultiChoice SA board has recommended a

dividend of ZAR5.5bn to its shareholders

(2022: ZAR6.0bn). Phuthuma Nathi will receive

ZAR1.375m of this amount. The Phuthuma Nathi

board intends to distribute the full amount

received and declare a dividend of ZAR1.375bn

(2022:ZAR1.5bn) which amounts to ZAR20.37

(2022: ZAR22.22) per Phuthuma Nathi share.

The declaration of the ZAR1.375bn Phuthuma Nathi

dividend is subject to the approval of the MultiChoice

SA dividend of ZAR5.5bn, which will be confrmed

at the MultiChoice SA AGM on 23 August 2023.

On approval, the Phuthuma Nathi dividend will be

payable to shareholders recorded in the share

register on 23 August 2023 and paid on or about

4 September 2023.

After the 20% dividend tax amounting to

ZAR4.07 per share (2022: ZAR4.44) is deducted,

Phuthuma Nathi shareholders will receive a net

dividend of ZAR16.30 per share (2022: ZAR17.78).

We would like to remind our shareholders that some

of their Phuthuma Nathi dividends that were declared

in prior years remain unclaimed. To date, more than

ZAR108.5m of unclaimed dividends have been paid

but there is still ZAR203.9m remaining to be claimed

and we hope that the entitled owners come forward

to claim payment in due course.

Directors and company secretary

During FY23, the Phuthuma Nathi board consisted of

four directors: Mandla Langa, Clarissa Mack,

Calvo Mawela and Herman Wessels. Clarissa Mack

and Herman Wessels retired from the board on

6 June 2023. Advocate Kgomotso Ditsebe Moroka

SC and James Hart du Preez were recently appointed

as directors by the board and will stand for election

by shareholders at the upcoming AGM. Carmen

Miller is the company secretary.

The profles of the current directors are

on page 15.

letter to fag some of

the operating highlights from the year given the

enormous effort that our teams put in to keep the

company moving forward.

Operating highlights for FY23:

• South Africa: Despite the challenges noted

above, the South African business still managed to

grow its 90-day base by 3% YoY, while

simultaneously growing its new business lines,

including DStv Insurance which grew revenues by

22% YoY. The business also tripled the size of its

linear streaming base through our DStv via

Streaming and saw our DStv Internet subscriber

base grow by over 5x, albeit both platforms

growing from small bases in the prior year. We

continued to enhance our Compact package

“We are hard at work at managing

our South African business through

unprecedented challenges while

implementing many initiatives to

enhance our organisation and add

value to our customers’ lives.”
