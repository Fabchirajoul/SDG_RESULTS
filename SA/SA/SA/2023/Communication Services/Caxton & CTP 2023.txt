MANAGING DIRECTOR’S REPORT

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Earnings

The group is pleased to present a record set of results for the

full year ending 30 June 2023, driven by revenue growth

and a well contained cost base, as follows:

•

Earnings per share increased by 34,4% from 151,2 cents

to 203,3 cents

•

Headline earnings per share increased by 20,2% from

157,0 cents to 188,6 cents

Revenue grew by R995,2 million (16,6%) from R5 979,3 million

to R6 974,6 million on the back of price increases to recover

the large raw material input cost increases and volume

increases in the packaging business, while volumes in the

newspaper and commercial printing plants remained

largely unchanged. The second half of the year’s growth

softened as loadshedding and inflationary pressures

impacted consumer demand.

Raw material pricing and supply was a year of two halves:

•

Initially we were faced with supply constraints for all

grades of paper and board and along with that, large

price increases driven by oversubscribed mills, increased

freight costs and lastly energy surcharges as a result of

the Russian/Ukraine war. This was well managed by

holding excess stock and where possible, recovering the

increases from customers, and

•

The second half of the financial year saw supply chains

gradually returning to normal, customers destocking

and subdued demand resulting in mills having excess

capacity and pricing starting to soften, although not

returning to anywhere near the price levels prior to the

supply chain crisis. In response to the above scenario

the group has started to trim stockholdings to more

normalised levels.

Margins came under further pressure in the second half of

the year as demand softened, competition intensified and

with reduced purchasing, our average cost of stock

remained high. Margins are expected to remain under

pressure as the more expensive stock is worked through.

Having said this, in the current results certain more expensive

stock items that have been revalued to the lower

replacement value, at a cost of R51,8 million.

The margin pressure was mitigated by a well-controlled

cost base with staff costs growing by only R84,6 million

(6,9%) to R1 307,7 million while other operating expenses

grew by R81,3 million (7,7%) to R1 139,7 million. This is a

commendable achievement in the face of the high

inflationary environment and the impact of loadshedding

which added R25,4 million of diesel costs and R23,6 million

of machine repair costs incurred as a result of the flood in

KwaZulu-Natal in the period under review. Loadshedding

also had an impact on maintenance costs, as we have

witnessed increased electronic failure on equipment, and

when combined with the high cost of imported spares

meant a significant year on year increase, in the region of

28%. In addition, the group faced higher distribution costs

(as the price of fuel reached record levels) and a large

increase in insurance premiums (as the insurance market

hardened). These increases were offset by very good

operational management of the other overheads, cost

saving initiatives at our subsidiary, Cognotion Holdings

Limited, and disposal of Private Properties Proprietary

Limited by Cognition Holdings Limited.

Profit from operating activities before depreciation and

amortisation increased by R153,1 million (18,5%) to

R981,1 million. After depreciation of R238,7 million, profit from

operating activities increased by 25,8% to R742,4 million.

The above performance includes the following effect of our

insurance claim for the catastrophic Kwa-Zulu Natal floods

which impacted our Durban commercial printing plant,

and highlights that the effects of global warming can no

longer be ignored. The net impact on operating profit for

the year is an increase of R84,6 million, as follows:

•

Interim Insurance receipts of R118,2 million – reported in

other operating income

•

Increased insurance premiums due to the swing

clause in our policy, based on the size of the claim, of

R10,0 million – reported in other operating expenses

•

Repairs of R23,6 million spent during the year to bring

the equipment back into production - reported in other

operating expenses

The finalisation of the equipment loss and business

interruption claims are imminent as it has been submitted

to insurers and should be completed shortly.

As reported previously:

•

The group’s subsidiary, Cognition Holdings Limited sold

its 51% share in Private Property South Africa Proprietary

Limited for R150,0 million (R147,8 million net of

transaction costs) resulting in a profit on disposal of

R78,9 million.

•

The group purchased the outstanding shares in associates

Mooivaal Media and interest in Capital Media from Media

24, resulting in a deemed loss on disposal of R1,5 million

and impairment of goodwill of R1,2 million, and

•

On redemption of our listed preference share investment,

an impairment of R1,2 million was recognised.

Net finance income grew by R15,7 million (13,3%) with

increased dividend flows being offset by reduced interest

income and slightly reduced forex losses. The increased

dividend came from our investments in Mpact Limited

(R57,4 million), Thebe Convergent Technology Holdings

Proprietary Limited (R11,2 million) and unlisted preference

shares (R44,6 million) due to the increasing interest rate

environment. No dividends were received from Novus

Holdings Limited - in a post reporting date transaction,:

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S REPORT continued

Stationery

This small operation delivered excellent results with revenues

growing by 18%, driven by the recovery, during the

back-to-school period, by our largest retail customer.

Margins were maintained despite increased raw material

prices. The unit has been focused on reducing stock

holdings and positive outcomes have been achieved.

DIVIDENDS

The board has declared a dividend of 60.00 cents (2022:

50.00 cents) per ordinary share (gross) and a preference

dividend of 490.00 cents (2022: 410.00 cents) per

preference share (gross) for the year ended 30 June 2023.

The dividends are subject to the Dividend Withholding Tax.

PROSPECTS

There is no doubt the upcoming financial year will deliver a

more difficult economic environment with the impact of a

constrained consumer starting to dampen demand. This

could, in turn, reduce demand from retailers for our media

publishing and printing business and could impact certain

segments of our packaging markets. In the packaging

markets we are fortunate to service those sectors that often

are less affected, being the alcohol, QSR and cigarette

sectors. As always, the management of costs will be

paramount. The group is fortunate to have large cash

resources to deploy where we see opportunities either in

our existing businesses or through acquisitions.

TJW Holden: Managing

Managing Director, in recognition of the

extraordinary efforts management has made in delivering

half year profits far exceeding pre pandemic levels. The

improved performance of the group in the past full financial

year has seen a further bonus allocation to key

management after year end and will be reported in the

2024 financial year.

If 25% or more votes are cast against the remuneration

policy or the implementation of the remuneration policy,

the Board undertakes to actively engage with the

dissenting shareholders to address all legitimate and

reasonable objections and concerns.

The group believes that the remuneration reporting reflects

a no-frills approach to this subject which has served the

group well for many years and that the remuneration report

and the implementation report accurately reflect the basic

tenets of the group’s remuneration determination, which is

subject to the active moderation of the group’s controlling

shareholder and CEO, within the framework of the

Remuneration Committee.

Standards and certifications

CTP Printers Johannesburg is FOGRA Process Standard

Offset (“PSO”) certified, which is achieved with consistent

and predictable colour reproduction to ISO 12647-2

standards. This certification provides proof externally of the

quality the group is capable of and internally it ensures

smooth production.

FOGRA works with, and is associated with, the German Print

Federation (“GPF”) and thus the standards that are set are

endorsed by the European printing community. In order to

attain the certification, 70% is required as a minimum

standard from all aspects that are tested.

CTP Printers Cape Town, SA Litho Label Printers, CTP

Packaging, CTP Printers Johannesburg, Caxton Works,

Gravure Durban, Boland Printers and CTP Cartons and

Labels have also maintained the Forestry Stewardship

Council® (FSC®) Chain of Custody certification. This allows

these divisions to produce work carrying the FSC logo and

provides assurance that the raw material used as well as

the production process conforms to standards of social and

environmental awareness. The paper manufacturers that

we use are also either FSC® or PEFCTM certified and some

of the paper mills have also been awarded the EU Flower

for environmental excellence. Further work with the FSC is

being undertaken in the context of the Caxton and CTP

Paper Pledge.

SA Litho is ISO FSSC 22000 certified (secondary food

packaging certification) while CTP Cartons & Labels and

CTP Packaging are ISO FSSC 22000 certified (primary food

packaging certification). CTP Flexibles is BRC certified. The

FSSC 22000 and the BRC food safety system certifications

provide frameworks for effectively managing an

organisation’s food safety responsibilities. FSSC 22000 is fully

recognised by the Global Food Safety Initiative (“GFSI”) and

is based on existing ISO Standards. It demonstrates that our

divisions have a robust Food Safety Management System in

place that meets the requirements of customers and

consumers. The FSSC 22000 food safety certification is a

prerequisite for suppliers of all major food and beverage

brands – major brands will not entertain business with

suppliers who do not have this certification as a minimum. In

the Packaging arena, this means that our customers can

use our packaging for direct food contact applications and

be secure in the knowledge that we have met the

necessary food safety requirements, ensuring that our

packaging is contaminate free.

Thuthuka Packaging, CTP Gravure Johannesburg, CTP

Cartons & Labels, and Boland Printers are ISO 9001:2015

accredited.

Legal compliance

The Social and Ethics Committee is responsible for

monitoring all workplace, B-BBEE and environmental

legislation and regulatory compliance requirements across

the group. We have engaged specialist consultants to assist

in the ongoing gap analysis between new environmental

legislation and current practice. The Company secretary

and the Group B-BBEE practitioner ensure regular updates

of changes to standards. Professional advisers and

attorneys who understand our business provide advice and

input as required.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

In order to provide and maintain, as far as possible, a work

environment that is safe and without risk to our employees

and the members of the public who visit our premises, all

operations are responsible to ensure that the group’s health

and safety policy is adhered to.:

Managing Director. The

committee is tasked with identifying initiatives aligned with

the BEE Codes and monitors progress towards reaching the

group’s transformation targets. Quarterly feedback is

provided to the CAT Audit and Risk Committee.

Ownership and management control

The Black Ownership of group entities is measured using the

flow-through principle from CAT. Overall Black Ownership

remained similar in the past 12 months, with the Black

Female shareholding being 6.1% in economic interest, and

Black shareholding 13.6% in economic interest. In a

post-year-end transaction Caxton has concluded a black

ownership transaction which will see a further 15% of the

measured entity’s shares being acquired by black

shareholders, thereby enhancing the ownership and giving

rise to a possible Level 2 BEE Status.

Driving diversity and inclusion is an integral part of the

group’s transformation and human resource strategies.

The group ensures that it is compliant with the Employment

Equity Act as all the designated employers within the group

report annually via the Department of Employment and

Labour’s (“DOEL”) website on progress towards reaching

the individual workplace Employment Equity Plan targets.

Employment Equity Committees meet on a quarterly basis

where progress towards reaching Employment Equity

targets is measured. The group also provided input, via

Printing South Africa, for the proposed Printing and

Packaging sub-sector targets that are expected to be

implemented by the DOEL in 2024 or 2025.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT continued:

managing director) who

regularly reviews the available financial information regarding the operating results of the identified operating segments

in order to make decisions about resource allocations and performances.

The group’s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. The Group

identified three reportable segments: Publishing, printing and distribution, Packaging and stationery and Other. The

Publishing, printing and distribution segment derive revenue from newspaper publishing and printing, digital assets,

Web and gravure printing and Book and magazine printing.

The Packaging and stationery segment derive revenue from selling packaging and stationery products.

The Other segment derive revenue from dividends and intergroup admin fees.

1.20

Share-based payments

The group also operates a phantom share option cash settled share-based payment scheme. An option pricing model

is used to measure the group’s liability at each reporting date, taking into account the terms and conditions on which

the bonus is awarded and the extent to which employees have rendered service. Movements in the liability (other

than cash payments) are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

1.21

Key management assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates

and assumptions that may affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and

expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that

are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements

about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ

from these estimates.
