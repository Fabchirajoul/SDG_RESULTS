Dear Stakeholders,

Last year I concluded my report by stating that we would continue to keep our eyes on the long

game, while navigating the short-term bumps as best as possible. We had a strong performance

in FY2022, growing headline earnings per share by 25.9%, and then followed that up with 10.6%

growth for the first half of the current (FY2023) financial year.
