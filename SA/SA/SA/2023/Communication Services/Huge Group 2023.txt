letter to Shareholders

“Despite the uncertainty of our operating environment and the larger

global environment, we are pleased with the resilience demonstrated

by the businesses in our investment portfolio over the past financial

period. We remain firm in our belief that within all challenges lie

significant opportunity and consider ourselves privileged to have a

range of opportunities that, within the next financial year, are likely to

lay the foundation for exponential long-term growth.”

VERAN KATHAN

INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN

Overview

As South Africans, we are no strangers to adversity, and it is almost incumbent on me to start a conversation

with Shareholders by bringing into focus at the start of my: letter the tough economic conditions that underpin

the financial results of all JSE-listed companies. The ever-present challenges associated with escalating global

interest rates and inflation, global political instability and the war in the Ukraine, combined closer to home

with the difficulties brought about by factors such as the energy demand management measures imposed by

Eskom, our own political climate, the thematic issues of corruption, fraud, and mismanagement of both public

and private institutions and the legacy issues faced by a country emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic

have all contributed to the unbelievable pressure faced by the boards of directors and executive management

of businesses across our country.

It has been my privilege to take on the role as the independent, non-executive chairman of Huge Group

during this past financial period – Huge Group is an Investment Company that has, despite these difficult

circumstances, managed to grow its overall investment portfolio by number of investments and create a

platform for growth that will, in the coming months and years, undoubtedly deliver significant stakeholder

value.

Investment philosophy and strategy

The Board of

letter, set out on pages 7 to 8, seeks to address those factors

which could have a significant impact on Huge Group's ability to deliver its strategic objectives.
