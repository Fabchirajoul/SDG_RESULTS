letter of the law, including aligning

tax treatment with commercial reality. We

seek certainty on tax matters where

possible. In all our dealings with tax

authorities, including where we seek

certainty, our relationships are centred on

transparency. Where tax authorities have

adopted cooperative compliance

arrangements, we will therefore favourably

consider participation.

As set out in our tax strategy, we allocate

value by reference to where it is created

and managed within the normal course of

commercial activity, and we pay tax on that

basis. We do not use tax haven jurisdictions

to manage taxes and we follow

international tax transfer pricing guidelines

and local transfer pricing regulations, to

ensure that the right value is allocated to

each country of operation.

Tax transparency

We are committed to providing tax

transparency to our stakeholders. We

see the benefits of this transparency in

all our stakeholders, including:

– Shareholders: the knowledge that we

are deeply committed to good tax

governance and responsible tax

practices, thereby mitigating tax risk
