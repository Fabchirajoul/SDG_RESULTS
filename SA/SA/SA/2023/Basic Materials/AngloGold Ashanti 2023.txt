Dear shareholders

As I reflect on 2023, a year that presented both significant

challenges and remarkable achievements for AngloGold

Ashanti, I am struck by the extraordinary resilience of our

people and the greatly improving prospects of our business.

This was a year marked by decisive action, a clear reset of our

corporate structure, and ultimately, substantial progress

toward delivery on our commitments.

We continued our strategic journey to safely regain the cost

competitiveness that had been lost by the Company in recent

years. It is with pride and humility that I can report a strong

safety performance, which is not only our priority but also the

bedrock of our strategy. In 2023, we reported a 13%

improvement in our total recordable injury frequency rate to

1.09 injuries per million hours worked and a second

consecutive year with no fatalities at the mines and plants we

operate. We are among the safest mining companies

anywhere and will spare no effort to ensure we can continue

that performance.

Corporate restructuring

The most significant milestone of 2023 was the successful

corporate restructuring of the business, which has seen the

transition of our primary listing to the NYSE, our headquarters

to Denver and our official domicile to the UK. This places us

directly in the world’s leading capital market, and the largest

equity market for gold shares, among the world’s most highly

valued producers. We believe this will, in time, lower our cost

of capital and position us well for future growth opportunities.

We also recognise that this redomiciliation is only one step –

albeit an important one – in the process of achieving a

fundamental revaluation of the Company relative to our North

American peers which have long traded at higher valuations.

Alongside the fundamental improvements we are making – in

both an absolute sense and relative to these peers – we

believe the new structure will in time enable AngloGold Ashanti

to trade and be valued more in line with this peer group.

I am grateful to South Africa’s financial and market regulators

for the manner of our engagement, in particular the care taken

to understand our unique circumstances and strategic

requirements. We retain an important corporate office in

Johannesburg that services many parts of our larger business,

and a secondary listing on the JSE, in Johannesburg, which

remains a deep and well-regulated capital market for us. This

retains our link to Africa, host to important production and

future growth, and source of exceptional talent in our business.

Delivery on commitments

Given the old saying that trust is earned in teaspoons and lost

in buckets, it’s been a priority for me – and for my colleagues

across the organisation – to make good on our commitments,

including our market guidance. I’m encouraged that we remain

one of the few large gold producers to have met our gold

production and total cash cost guidance during a period in

which we, like many in the industry, have faced fierce

inflationary headwinds and the usual assortment of production

challenges and interruptions.

The complex pivot to concentrate processing at Cuiabá, in

Brazil, to allow for additional engineering and technical work

during 2023 at our Calcinados TSF to meet international

safety standards currently considered best practice, could

have ended hopes of achieving production targets were it not

for the site team’s extraordinary recovery to meet budget. In

May, at Siguiri, a faulty weld made more than a decade ago

caused the failure of a carbon-in-leach tank in the plant,

curbing production for several weeks while repairs were

effected. Again, a resilient site team completed the job

ahead of schedule, and by year-end volumes had returned to

near-normal run-rates.

letter were tabled at the Committee for

consideration and approval, for both PwC UK responsible for the

audit opinion on the Company stand-alone financial statements

and the Group UK Annual Report, as well as PwC SA for the

2023 Annual Report on Form 20-F to be filed in due course.

As chairperson, I meet with the primary engagement team

members in private before each scheduled meeting where I am

also briefed on general matters relating to the accounting and

auditing profession as it may impact AngloGold Ashanti.

As part of its ongoing assessment of the independence and

effectiveness of the External Auditors, the Committee also

considered, during its evaluation of PwC, factors such as:

•

Quality of planning, delivery and execution of the audit

•

Quality and knowledge of the audit team, specifically the

senior team, including the lead engagement partner

•

Robustness of the audit, including the audit team’s ability to

challenge management as well as demonstrating

professional scepticism and independence

During 2023, the External Auditors’ remuneration was $10.7m

comprising of audit fees of $8.1m, audit-related fees of $2.4m,

tax fees of $0.1m and all other fees of $0.1m. The audit

related, non-audit and tax service fees were approved by the

Committee in line with the Group Standard, and these fell well

within the thresholds set according to US and UK regulatory

requirements.

The Committee did not note any significant adverse findings

and considers the service provided by the External Auditors to

have been independent and robust.

Finance function and the Chief Financial

Officer

In evaluating the finance function the Committee considered

its interactions with the senior finance team throughout the

year, the private discussions held with the CFO and input from

the auditors both internal and external. It also examined the

root cause analysis performed on the significant deficiencies

and material weaknesses identified during the year and the

associated remediation steps. It put this in the context of a

year of great change with a major corporate restructuring

being carried out, which necessitated changes in reporting, at

the same time as working with a new firm of auditors following

a tender process concluded in 2022. The Committee also

received feedback on an internal assessment conducted on

the skills, expertise and resourcing of the finance function.

Following this the Committee concluded that:

•

the finance function’s management philosophy and control

environment were consistent

•

the organisational structure of the finance function was

appropriate, in that it had the required authority and

responsibility that promoted accountability and control,

while recognising that improvements were planned in 2024

in this area

•

the finance function has properly applied accounting

principles in the preparation of the financial statements and

the accounting of complex and non-routine transactions

•

the Group’s financial reporting procedures were generally

effective and reliable with required guidance given to

operations during the year

and, as a result, the Committee was satisfied with the overall

adequacy and appropriateness of the function while

recognising areas of improvement required.

The Committee further reviewed the expertise and experience

of the Chief Financial Officer, Gillian Doran, and was satisfied

with the appropriateness thereof.
