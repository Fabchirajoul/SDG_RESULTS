letter of demand

received from SARS dated 17 September 2021.

The: letter of demand resulted in a tax liability of R87 million of which the capital amount is R77 million and the interest is

R9 million. Keaton disputed the audit outcome based on factual reasons that SARS did not take into consideration in arriving

at their conclusion. Keaton is of the view that SARS basis of seeking to claim diesel refunds previously paid to Keaton during the

audit period is misdirected.

Keaton has performed an analysis of the merits of SARS’ claim and is of the view that such a claim will be limited to R13 million.

SARS considered the Keaton Mining Proprietary Limited dispute filed and paid the diesel refunds to the amount of R33 million in

December 2022. Keaton Mining Proprietary Limited is of the view that SARS has not considered all the facts when deciding to partly

refund and applied for the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR SARS) on the basis that 70% of the remaining disallowed diesel

refund of R44 million can still be refunded. SARS proposed the ADR meeting to take place in FY24.

• Mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss. The group automatically applies this classification to all debt instruments which

do not qualify at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income.
