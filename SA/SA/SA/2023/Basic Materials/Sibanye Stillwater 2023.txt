The Corporate governance

framework presents a governance

picture of the new regions in the

shape of a diamond

Based on the assessment of the 16 governance

elements, it has been determined that the

regions are effectively governed, and their

governance framework is both efficient and

transparent, meeting Group and global

standards. All assessed areas have been marked

as green, indicating strong performance.

However, there are a few amber areas identified,

signalling areas for improvement. These amber

areas are slated for implementation by the end

of 2024, ensuring continued enhancement and

alignment with best practices in governance.:

letter, phone (including the anonymous toll-free line

which is independently managed). Moreover, stakeholders can walk into any office at Sibanye-Stillwater and register a complaint.

Sibanye-Stillwater officials are often called to receive memorandums during community and labour protest. All memorandums received are

responded.

In 2023, the SA region accounted for 123 complaints (171 in 2022) relating to various categories, as outlined in the graph below. Our US

region also monitors grievances received and received 13 complaints. Also see our Grievance procedure available,

arrange a senior secured project finance facility of up to

US$400 million to fund the construction and development of the

project. They also advanced project permitting, with all outstanding

permits expected to be obtained during 2024.

Projects in Australia

Mount Lyell (Queenstown, Tasmania)

With the full acquisition of New Century Resources during 2023,

the group obtained the option to acquire the historic (in care and

maintenance) Mount Lyell (Mt Lyell) copper project in Tasmania,

Australia. The property is located close to the west coast of

Tasmania, near the township of Queenstown, 170km north-west of

Hobart. The option was exercised in November 2023, and the

property is currently the subject of a feasibility study into the re-

opening of the mine.

The historic mine, where first mining took place in 1883, was closed

and placed on care and maintenance during 2014 after over

100 years of production from both open pit and underground

mining areas. The current underground workings were last mined

using a sub-level caving mining method. Open pit and sub level

open stoping mining methods were historically employed prior

to 1999.

The project study, which will be advanced to an Association for the

Advancement of Cost Engineering (AACE) Class 3 Level in H2 2024,

targets mining from three underground deposits (Prince Lyell,

Western Tharsis and Copper Chert), via sub-level caving and open

stoping mining methods. It anticipates the construction of a new

concentrator plant, as well as the refurbishing of the historic vertical

shaft.

In H2 2023, US$5 million (R85 million) was expensed and an

additional US$14 million (R268 million) was capitalised in recognition

of the acquisition consideration and transaction cost.

Other projects

The Group also has a considerable number of projects in South

Africa (at various stages) which could potentially be developed

depending on developments in the economic and regulatory

environment. More information about these projects is available in

the Mineral Reserves and Resources report.

Sandouville

As the Sandouville nickel refinery has no mining activities, the

Sandouville site does not produce or store residues. Most nickel-

containing sludge, from effluent treatment, is collected, dried,

gathered in a suitable storage area and recycled back into the

production process when appropriate. By the end of 2023, the

quantity of nickel sludge stored on the site will have reached

6,250 tonnes.

Keliber lithium project

Keliber has not commenced with mining activities. Construction

of the Päiväneva TSF is scheduled to start Q1 2024.

AUS region

Century operations

The Century TSF is an upstream TSF that is being re-mined for

reprocessing, with the resultant tailings being deposited in the

original open pit. The capacity of the pit is sufficient and there are

no requirements for additional TSFs. Once depleted, the footprint of

the existing TSF is to be rehabilitated as part of mine closure.

Mt Lyell

Mt Lyell has one TSF, Princess Creek, a downstream TSF with an

engineered earth embankment. It will be used on the re-

commissioning of operations. As and when required, the

embankment will be raised in accordance with the original design

and permit conditions.

US PGM operations: Recycling of PGMs

Sibanye-Stillwater is one of the US’s largest recyclers of PGMs from

spent autocatalysts, feeding 310 koz of 3E in 2023. The recycling

segment is self-funded and delivers favourable free cash conversion

rates. Recycled tonnes/day and ounces fed to the furnace during

2023 were 10.5 and 310,314, respectively. Also see our Group

impact report supplement, https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/

news-investors/reports/annual/

To enhance the Group’s exposure to a circular economy,

the recycling segment continues to investigate growth options

across geographies and commodities. For further information, see

the life-cycle assessment that the International Platinum Association

performed using the cradle-to-gate approach for primary and

secondary production. The categories considered in the life-cycle

assessment was primary energy demand, global warming potential,

acidification potential, eutrophication potential, phytochemical

ozone creation potential and blue water consumption. (See ipa-

MINIMISING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT continued

SIBANYE-STILLWATER INTEGRATED REPORT 2023

208:

Dear shareholders

Following a 47% vote ‘Against’ the Remuneration implementation

report by shareholders at last year’s AGM as well as a 17% vote

against the Remuneration policy, we undertook extensive steps to

engage with dissenting shareholders as well as with major

shareholders on these matters, irrespective of how they had voted.

Accordingly, following the various comments and concerns raised,

the Remuneration Committee undertook a further review of our pay

structures and made several adjustments to address these concerns.

We are optimistic that the changes, including some further

improvements to our remuneration-related disclosures will meet with

our shareholders’ approval.

Calibrating the link between pay and performance

In particular, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the concerns

raised about the perceived excessive upside LTI opportunity for

executives. The main contributor to this was the practice of using an

‘on-award multiple’ for each executive by which the quantum of

the LTI awards was factored up based on the executive’s personal/

strategic delivery scorecard result. This was highlighted as an area of

concern by some shareholders because it could lead to

unreasonably high LTI outcomes at vesting. Following a further in-

depth review of market practice in this regard, the Committee

determined that shareholders’ perspectives were fair and so the

application of an LTI ‘on award multiple’ has now been

discontinued and will no longer be applicable going forward. It was

not applied to the LTI awards effective in March 2024.

Furthermore, in terms of LTI award outcomes, shareholders will recall

that last year we reported that we had adjusted our Remuneration

policy to ensure that the share prices used in determining the issuing

and the vesting of LTI awards would be fairly representative of the

Group’s long-term value, and not influenced by short-term share

price anomalies (i.e., shorter-term ‘spikes’ and ‘troughs’ in the price).

This method of potentially moderating the applicable share price to

be applied at the time of granting or vesting of share-price linked

awards was aimed at mitigating against anomalous beneficial

outcomes to executives when share prices are unusually high at the

time of vesting or unusually low when the LTI awards are granted.

We can report that this approach was applied during the year

under review. An example of the effect of its application was that,

although the applicable share price for the March 2023 LTI awards

did not exceed the ‘cap’ or fall below the ‘floor’ price levels as

calculated in terms of the revised policy, the number of share-price

linked units awarded in March 2023 was 13% less than would have

been awarded under the previous arrangement. This was due to the

30-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP) share price at

R42.78 – applicable under the revised policy – being higher than the

3-day VWAP share price at R37.21 – which would have been

applied under the previous policy.

Notwithstanding these policy refinements, we are confident that our

approach to performance-related pay, with our pay mix remaining

somewhat more performance-geared than many peers, is

appropriate for incentivising and rewarding management in pursuit

of the Group’s strategy for delivering shareholder value over time.

This approach intends to provide greater upside in years where

operational and strategic performance aligns with shareholder

value delivery, and a leaner outcome in years where shareholder

value regresses due to a commodity downturn.

Benchmarking

The Remuneration Committee recognises that remuneration

benchmarking exercises ought to be undertaken judiciously, as and

when structural or market changes suggest the need for such. One

of the particular challenges that the Committee faces is the most

appropriate way of dealing with the various jurisdictional

remuneration distinctions and practices in the respective

employment markets in which Sibanye-Stillwater executives operate,

or over which they have accountabilities and responsibilities.

No broad-based benchmarking exercise was undertaken in 2023

but it is expected to be an area of focus during 2024. The work

commissioned by the Remuneration Committee in the meantime

has indicated that broadly speaking, Sibanye-Stillwater’s

Remuneration policy is remains fairly competitive with the markets in

the various jurisdictions where our executives are employed and are

accountable though dealing with norms for pay mix that vary

substantially across jurisdictions requires further consideration. We

have nonetheless made remuneration adjustments in respect of

some C-suite members to secure internal parity and market

competitiveness recognising the evolution of their roles into a full

global leadership scope as a result of the regionalised configuration

adopted during 2022. Details are given in part 3 below.

It is an ongoing imperative of the Remuneration Committee that our

benchmarking approach does not result in inflated reference points

due to any inappropriate incorporation of global comparators, and

much care is being taken to ensure that the benchmarking

approach we adopt results in credible and fair reference points for

the various regional employment markets. This can be achieved by

applying currency equivalencing that is not based on a raw

exchange rate conversion between currencies, or a simplistic cost-

of-living adjustment. The methodology under development ensures

that reference points reflect an equitable pay level in each

jurisdiction to ensure competitiveness in the respective employment

markets.

Aligning with shareholder interests

Following feedback from our shareholders on the appropriateness of

Matching share unit awards being made to the minimum

shareholding requirements, the Remuneration Committee

determined that the existing MSR plan will be ringfenced, and no

new executives will be eligible for the matching share units allowed

for under the original MSR plan as from 1 April 2024. The majority of

the matching awards that may accrue to current executives have

already been made limiting the potential for further awards under

the existing arrangement. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied

that the incentive of Matching share units to date was appropriate

in order to achieve its aim of encouraging additional exposure of

executives to Sibanye-Stillwater equity and given that this was a

unilateral introduction of a new policy for existing executives. We are

satisfied with the rate of commitment of shares by executives

towards the MSR plan which is now two years into its first five-year

period for attainment of the target levels of committed shares.
