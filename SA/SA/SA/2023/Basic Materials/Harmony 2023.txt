Dear shareholders

and stakeholders

Creating value for our shareholders

and stakeholders

Harmony retained its position as South Africa’s

largest gold mining company by volume despite a

challenging operating environment. Global supply

chain disruptions and sharp input cost increases

were exacerbated by the effects of the Russia-

Ukraine conflict. In South Africa, the energy and

water crises, accompanied by local community

expectations and activism, continued amid rising

inflation. Interest rates rose sharply as central

banks moved decisively to curb inflation.

Against this backdrop, the gold price neared

all-time highs at R1 249 714/kg (US$2 011/oz).

The combination of high gold prices and strong

operational performances resulted in solid financial

results for Harmony.

I am pleased to report that Harmony met its

production guidance of 1.4Moz – 1.5Moz. This

was achieved through allocating growth capital

to high-margin and long life assets, allowing

Harmony to beat its underground recovered grade

guidance of 5.6g/t, and contain costs below

R900 000/kg, resulting in total production of

1.47Moz.

Harmony’s management took an important step in

derisking the business and bolstering its position as

a gold-copper miner, with a growing international

footprint through the successful acquisition of the

Eva Copper Project in the mining district of

Queensland, Australia.

“Harmony continued to make significant

progress towards transforming into a

globally competitive gold-copper

producer whilst delivering safe, profitable

ounces and adhering to its sustainability

commitments and good governance.”
