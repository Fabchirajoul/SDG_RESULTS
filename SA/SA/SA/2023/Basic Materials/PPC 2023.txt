Dear shareholders

On behalf of the RTC (or the committee), I am

pleased to provide an overview of both director and

wider workforce remuneration for the year ended

31 March 2023.

The committee determines, on behalf of the board,

the company’s policy on the remuneration of

executive directors and prescribed officers and the

total remuneration packages and contractual terms

and conditions for these individuals. The committee

also provides oversight of all employee rewards to

ensure the alignment of rewards throughout the

group and approves the mandate for annual pay

increases, as well as the parameters and overall

cost of the STIs and LTIP for the South African

operations and provides guidance through group

policies to the international subsidiaries.

In line with King IV and the JSE Listings

Requirements, the report is presented in three parts:

this background statement (part 1), followed by the

company-wide remuneration philosophy and policy

with a specific focus on the policy as it applies to

executive management for the current financial

year (part 2) and lastly, implementation of the

policy for the 12 months from 1 April 2022 to

31 March 2023 (part 3). As usual, parts 2 and 3 will

be put forward for separate non-binding votes at

the upcoming AGM.

We take pride in our balanced approach to creating

long-term, sustainable value for investors while

delivering a high-quality service for our customers,

a great place to work for our people and having a

meaningful, positive impact on the communities we

operate in.

As a committee, we are focused on ensuring that

the reward our senior executives receive reflects the

results of the company and remains proportionate

to the overall employee base and the returns

received by shareholders. We are mindful of the

external focus on executive pay and the need to

ensure outcomes that are fair and responsible and

reported transparently.

We are currently focused on ensuring that our

remuneration approach and supporting policies

drive the performance culture which we have

worked hard to instil.

We operate in a competitive market, and as a

remuneration committee, we have had to spend

significant time considering our remuneration policy

in light of our increased difficulties in retaining and

attracting the type of talent we need to achieve

the performance that we require to take our

business forward. The global mobility of talent, the

challenges associated with attracting, retaining, and

incentivising critical skills, particularly in our remote

areas, and the challenging macro-environment

in which we are operating all contribute to this

challenge. We have spent time and effort to ensure

that we have access to meaningful datasets to drive

our decision-making and policy-setting.

During the reporting year, and to date, we have

also, as a joint committee and a board, spent

considerable time and energy on the task of finding

a CEO successor, following our current CEO’s

announcement that he would not be renewing his

current contract. This included talent mapping,

and appropriate salary benchmarking and pay

structuring to ensure we can effectively use the

remuneration strategy to attract the right individual

into this role. We have also focused on ensuring that

a smooth handover happens when appropriate, and

have provided for the current CEO’s personal KPIs

to take this into consideration. We have also spent

time considering succession on a wider basis.

OUR PERFORMANCE AND SUMMARY OF

REMUNERATION OUTCOMES

PPC continued to operate in tough conditions in

the various markets in which it operates, due to a

global rise in energy costs, and a negative trend in

market demand caused by a decline in disposable

income, and the absence of any material increase

in demand from infrastructure spending in certain

markets (South Africa and Botswana). The South

African market presents a specific challenge to

the business with load shedding and other

economic issues.

For this LTIP performance period, there was a zero

outcome due to the share price depreciation over

the period combined with the decline in economic

value (negative PPC economic value creation

(PEVC)), largely attributable to the subdued

performance of the South African business. This

means that no forfeitable shares were awarded

to executive directors and prescribed officers

this year.

Annual bonuses for executive directors and

prescribed officers were also paid at low levels

this year, due to the outcomes of the balanced

scorecards , largely driven by the non-performance

against EBITDA margin and free cash flow for 2

out of 3 contributing regions, caused by margin

pressure arising from rising input costs, the muted

cement demand across South Africa and Botswana

and the loss of market share in Zimbabwe as

a result of the longer than usual kiln stop for

maintenance at the Colleen Bawn plant. However,

we remain confident that the subsidiaries outside

South Africa and Botswana are well-positioned

to continue to deliver a strong performance with

regular and increasing dividend declarations to

South Africa and the management team is focused

on implementing initiatives to ensure the South

African business can sustainably navigate the

subdued demand environment.:
