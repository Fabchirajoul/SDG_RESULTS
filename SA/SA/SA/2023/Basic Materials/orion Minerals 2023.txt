Managing Director and

CEO, Errol Smart and $0.77 million from Tembo Capital

(which were issued in satisfaction of amounts repaid by

Orion under the Loan Facility (refer below)); and

y Placement Options: for every Share issued under the

Placement, each investor received four free attaching

options (3.5 billion options). The options are unlisted, have

an exercise price of 1.7 cents (ZAR20 cents) and an expiry

date of 30 November 2023.

June 2022 Placement

On 22 June 2022, the Company announced a capital raising

of up to $20 million at 2.0 cents per Share, to underpin the

next phase of development of its portfolio of advanced base

metal assets in South Africa’s Northern Cape Province.

Given the significant volatility experienced in global financial

markets at the time, the raising was undertaken in three

tranches with first commitments received for the first two

tranches (~$6 million). No Shares were issued in relation to

tranche 3. The two tranches completed are summarised

below:

y Tranche 1: in June 2022 and July 2022, the Company issued

a total of 156 million Shares at an issue price of 2.0 cents

(being ZAR22 cents) to raise $3.1 million (together with one

free attaching unlisted option for each two Shares issued,

with an exercise price of 2.5 cents (being ZAR27.5 cents)

and an expiry date of 30 June 2023), using the Company’s

15% placement capacity under ASX Listing Rule 7.1; and

y Tranche 2: the Company raised $2.9 million through the

issue of 145 million Shares at an issue price of 2.0 cents

(being ZAR22 cents) per Share (together with one free

attaching option for each two Shares issued on the

terms set out above), including $2 million from Orion

Non-executive Director Tom Borman and $0.2 million

from Orion’s Chairman, Denis Waddell.

Share Purchase Plan

In addition to the capital raising announced on 22 June 2022,

Orion also announced a share purchase plan (SPP) providing

shareholders an opportunity to increase their shareholding in

the Company at the same offer price as the Shares issued

under that capital raising (refer above).

Under the SPP, Eligible Shareholders could subscribe for

new Shares in parcels starting from $2,000 (or ZAR20,000),

up to a maximum of $30,000 (approximately ZAR330,000),

at an issue price of 2.0 cents (ZAR22 cents) per Share,

without incurring brokerage or transaction costs. The SPP

opened on 28 June 2022 and closed on 12 August 2022.

On 22 August 2022, the Company issued 67.3 million Shares

under the SPP at an issue price of 2.0 cents per Share

(ZAR22 cents), raising $1.35 million.

The SPP attracted strong support from shareholders,

particularly those in South Africa, which was a pleasing result

given the volatility experienced in global financial markets

and commodity prices during the SPP offer period.

01 CORPORATE PROFILE:

Managing Director and CEO of the Company and the Group.

It is the Group’s objective to provide maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of a high quality Board and management

by remunerating directors and executives fairly and appropriately with reference to relevant employment and market conditions.

To assist in achieving the objective, the Board links the nature and amount of executive directors’ remuneration to the Group’s

financial and operational performance.

The expected outcome of the Group’s remuneration structure is:

y Retention and motivation of directors and executives;

y Attraction of quality management to the Group; and

y Performance rewards to allow directors and executives to participate in the future success of the Group.

Remuneration may include base salary and fees, short term incentives, superannuation contributions and long term incentives.

Any equity based remuneration for directors will only be made with the prior approval of shareholders at a general meeting.

All base salary and fees, short term incentives, superannuation contributions granted to key management personnel during

the year was fixed under service agreements between the Company and key management personnel and was not impacted

by performance related measures. In relation to the payment of bonuses, options and other incentive payments, discretion is

exercised by the Board, having regard to the overall performance of the Group and the performance of the individual during

the period.

The Board of directors is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the executive and

non-executive directors. The maximum remuneration of non-executive directors is the subject of shareholder resolution

in accordance with the Company’s Constitution, and the Corporations Act 2001 as applicable.

The total level of remuneration for the financial year for all non-executive directors of $275,000 ($329,600 excluding $54,600 of

consulting service fees provided by a director related entity (refer Note 24)) is maintained within the maximum limit of $350,000

approved by shareholders. When setting fees and other compensation for non-executive directors, the Board may seek

independent advice and apply applicable benchmarks. The Board may recommend additional remuneration to non-executive

directors called upon to perform extra services or make special exertions on behalf of the Group.

There is no scheme to provide retirement benefits, other than statutory superannuation when applicable, to non-executive

directors.

The Chairman will undertake an annual assessment of the performance of the individual directors and meet privately with

each director to discuss this assessment. Basis for evaluation for assessing performance is by reference to Company charters

and current best practice.

Consequences of performance on shareholders wealth

In considering the Group’s performance and benefits for shareholders wealth, the Board of directors has regard to the following

indices in respect of the current financial year and the previous five financial years.
