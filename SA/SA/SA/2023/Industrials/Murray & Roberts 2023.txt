managing director of the

company, formally declare that there was no unethical behaviour

involved in the compilation of the tender.

All our businesses have an anonymous whistle-blower facility that

can be used to report incidents of fraud, corruption, or other

unethical behaviour. The administrators refer complaints to

management, which are thoroughly investigated, with appropriate

action taken when required.

PROSPECTS

The global economic outlook remains uncertain, with geopolitical instability persisting and inflation remaining stubbornly high,

notwithstanding the sustained efforts of central banks to bring inflation under control. These efforts are driving interest rates to

multi-decade highs, resulting in some global financial instability and the prospect of a global recession looming. This, in turn, is

resulting in downward pressure on commodity prices and increased risk aversion from mine owners that may result in some

investment decisions being postponed.

Notwithstanding these headwinds, the demands placed on the industry to supply the commodities required for the transformation of

the world’s energy supply, the ever increasing need to replace depleting ore reserves and the fact that the major operators have robust

balance sheets means that, at least to some extent, investment into replacement and expanding capacity is almost certain. This will

create continued demand for our services and provide opportunity for the growth of our multinational business in the medium term.

The platform result for FY2023 was severely impacted by the disruption to the Group resulting from the voluntary administration of

MRPL. However, FY2024 will see a return to stability for the platform, growing the order book and delivering an improved operating

and financial performance, to provide a solid foundation for growth. We are confident the platform’s true potential will be seen in

FY2025 and beyond.

Statutory duties

In addition to the duties set out in the terms of reference, the

Committee performed the required statutory functions in terms

of Section 94(7) of the Companies Act of South Africa.

Effectiveness of the external audit

process

The Committee reviews the quality and effectiveness of the

external audit process. In particular, the Committee considers

the independence of the external auditor. In this regard, the

Committee has established an approvals framework for the

pre-approval of non-audit services to be rendered by the

external auditor and reviews these fees on an ongoing basis.

PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. (“PwC”) served as external

auditor for the financial year ended 30 June 2023. The

designated auditor is JFM Kotzé. The Committee considers his

tenure and that of other key audit partners within the Group in

order to reduce familiarity threats to independence.

The Committee is satisfied that the external auditor is

independent and has nominated PwC for re-election at the

forthcoming annual general meeting of shareholders, with

JFM Kotzé as the individual registered auditor. PwC and

JFM Kotzé are properly accredited.

Financial director and finance

function

The Committee considered and satisfied itself of the

appropriateness of the expertise, experience and performance

of the Group financial director during the year. The Committee

also considered and satisfied itself of the appropriateness of

the expertise and adequacy of resources in the finance

function as well as the experience of senior members of

management responsible for the finance function.

Internal audit

The Group internal audit function was established to assist the

Board and Executive Management with the achievement of

their objectives and has remained a vital part of the Group’s

governance and combined assurance structures. Internal audit

is an independent assurance provider on the adequacy and

effectiveness of the Group’s governance, risk management and

control structures, systems and processes.

The centralised function operates in terms of a formal

mandate, in conformance with the International Professional

Practices Framework for Internal Audit. Internal audit

assurance can only be reasonable and not absolute and does

not supersede the Board’s and management’s responsibility for

the ownership, design, implementation, monitoring and

reporting of governance, risk management and internal

controls.

The chief audit executive leads the internal audit function which

covers the global operations and is resourced with both

internal employees and external resources. It assists the Board

and management in maintaining an effective internal control

environment by evaluating those controls continuously, using a

risk-based approach, to determine whether they are

adequately designed, operating efficiently and effectively, and

to recommend improvements. The internal audit assurance

consists of independent evaluations of the adequacy and

effectiveness of risk management, internal controls, financial

reporting mechanisms and records, information systems and

operations, safeguarding of assets (including fraud prevention)

and adherence to laws and regulations. It includes a review of

strategic risk mitigations, a risk-based review of major projects,

key business processes and systems, the Group’s

sustainability information, IT governance and IT general

controls. A combined assurance model was applied to ensure

a coordinated approach to all assurance activities, appropriate

to address the significant risks facing the Group.

The annual plan is based on an assessment of risk areas that

internal audit and management identify, as well as focus areas

highlighted by the Committee and management. The plan also

considers work performed by other assurance providers in the

Group. The annual audit plan is updated as appropriate to

ensure it remains responsive to emerging risks and changes in

the business. A comprehensive report on internal audit findings

is presented to the Committee quarterly. Follow-up audits are

conducted in areas where major internal control weaknesses

are found. The internal audit activity has a quality assurance

and improvement programme, and is subject to an

independent external quality assurance review every five years.

The independence, organisational positioning, scope and

nature of work of the internal audit function were evaluated by

the Committee in June 2023 and determined to be appropriate

and consistent with the internal audit strategy and mandate.

The Committee approved internal audit’s risk-based audit plan

for financial year 2024, having discussed the scope of work

and its relationship to the Group’s risks. The Committee met

quarterly with the chief audit executive, in the absence of

management. Furthermore, the chair of the Committee held

regular one-to-one meetings with chief audit executive. This

enables further evaluation of the work performed.

The internal audit function reports directly to the Committee

and their mandate in relation to the internal audit function is to:

■ Approve the appointment and dismissal of the chief audit

executive;

■ Review and recommend to the Board for final approval, the

internal audit charter including, inter alia, the purpose,

authority and responsibility of the internal audit activity;

■ Receive a summary report of the major findings of all

assurance and special investigation internal audits and

management’s responses. Review and track management’s

action plans to address results of internal audit assignments;:

SHAREHOLDERS’

INFORMATION

The multi-year rolling internal audit plan is designed to provide

assurance that the major risks and key processes are

effectively mitigated and managed, to recommend

improvements and track the implementation of audit

recommendations.

The Group Integrated Assurance Framework governs and

coordinates the overall approach to Group risk management.

This entails understanding, identifying, reporting, managing

and mitigating Group risk, and includes the process of

independently auditing Group policies, plans, procedures,

practices, systems, controls and activities to ensure that the

Group achieves the level of operational efficiency and

compliance required by the Board.

The efforts of the various internal and external assurance

providers are coordinated to ensure coverage of agreed risk

areas and to minimise duplication and eliminate gaps.

A formal combined assurance model is in place and is being

reviewed annually by the Committee. Notwithstanding the

output of the combined assurance model, board members

form their own opinion on the integrity of the information and

reports, and the degree to which an effective control

environment has been achieved.

The Committee is satisfied that the Group has optimised the

assurance coverage obtained from management and internal

and external assurance providers. The Committee is also

satisfied that the various external assurances that are obtained

and related systems and procedures are effective in achieving

the following objectives:

■ Enabling an effective internal control environment

■ Supporting the integrity of information used for internal

decision-making by management, the Board and its

committees

■ Supporting the integrity of external reports

■ Minimising assurance fatigue

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those that PwC, in their professional

judgement, were of most significance in their audit of the

consolidated financial statements of the current period:

■ Estimation uncertainty involved in accounting for revenue

from contracts with customers

■ Recognition and recoverability of uncertified revenue

balances

■ Middle East accounting treatment

The audit report contains an emphasis of matter in respect of

material uncertainty related to going concern.

Significant areas of judgement

The Committee assists the Board by performing an oversight

role over financial reporting, which includes assessing the

appropriateness of significant estimates and judgements

specifically covered by the key audit matters and those

disclosed in note 43 and note 45.

Group and company financial

statements

It is our view that the Group and Company financial statements

present fairly, in all material respects the Group and Company

financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries as at

30 June 2023 and its Group and Company financial

performance and its Group and Company cash flows for the

year then ended in accordance with IFRS and the requirements

of the Companies Act. In preparation of the annual financial

statements the Group and the Committee has taken into

consideration the feedback included in the most recent Report

Back on Proactive Monitoring of Financial Statements provided

by the JSE. The Committee recommended the Group’s and

Company’s annual financial statements to the Board for

approval. It is satisfied that they comply with IFRS and that the

financial statements have been prepared on a going concern

basis following an assessment of solvency and liquidity

requirements.

SHAREHOLDERS’

INFORMATION

The Group is confident that it would be able to implement the

actions outlined above, and any potential financial restructuring

that may be required, for it to realise its assets and discharge

its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Board is

therefore satisfied that the Group and Company financial

statements comply with IFRS on a going concern basis.

Should, however, these actions not achieve the desired

outcome, especially dividends from the international mining

companies to repay the term debt, or the South African banks

rejecting the deleveraging plan, it will give rise to uncertainty

regarding the potential of any further financial restructuring,

which may cast significant doubt on the Group and the

Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and its ability

to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal

course of business.

Uncertified revenue

The Group’s uncertified revenue decreased to R445 million

(FY2022: R1,2 billion), due mainly to the exclusion of previously

recognised uncertified revenue through the deconsolidation of

Clough.

The recognition of uncertified revenue is common practice for

engineering and contracting companies and the Group is

confident that revenue recognised as uncertified, will be

certified and paid once attendant commercial matters have

been resolved.

Segmental disclosure

The Group operated under two strategic platforms as at

30 June 2023. An analysis of the Group’s results reflects the

financial position and performance of each platform (refer

to Annexure 3 of the consolidated financial statements).

1

Authorised and issued share

capital

Full details of the authorised and issued capital of the

Company at 30 June 2023 are contained in note 11 of

the consolidated financial statements.

The total number of ordinary shares that may be

utilised for purposes of the Murray & Roberts Holdings

Limited Employee Share Incentive Scheme (“Scheme”)

is limited to 5,0% (FY2022: 5,0%) of the total issued

ordinary shares of the Company, currently 22 236 806

(FY2022: 22 236 806) ordinary shares. As no shares

have been issued to date in connection with the

Scheme, this limit remains unutilised.

In terms of the Forfeitable Share Plan (“FSP”),

employees were allocated shares during the year by

the remuneration committee totalling 7 236 487 shares

(FY2022: 450 954). The shares held in escrow by the

FSP on behalf of the beneficiaries were purchased on

the market and have not been issued by the Company.

2

Dividend

The Board of directors of the Company (“Board”)

considers a dividend on an annual basis, post year

end. Considering the Group’s current liquidity position,

the Board resolved not to declare a dividend this year.

3

Discontinued operations

Discontinued operations comprise Murray & Roberts

Pty Ltd (“MRPL”), ERI, RUC, together the “MRPL

Group”, Insig, Middle East Operations, businesses

included within the previous Southern Africa

Infrastructure & Buildings Platform and the Genrec

Operations. Refer to note 32 for further details.

Middle East Operations

The Middle East Operations were classified as a

discontinued operation in the 2020 financial year as a

result of being abandoned, as defined in terms of

IFRS 5. By 30 June 2021, the discussions to dispose

of the Middle East Operations had progressed to an

advanced stage of negotiations and as a result thereof

these companies met the criteria, in terms of IFRS 5,

to be classified as a disposal group held for sale. At

30 June 2023, the sale and purchase agreement is still

pending regulatory approval and the long stop date

has therefore been extended to 15 September 2023.

The Middle East Operations continue to meet the

criteria to be classified as a disposal group held for

sale in terms of IFRS 5, even though the one-year

period has been exceeded as the delay in sale is due

to circumstances beyond the Group’s control.

Special resolution

During the year under review the following special

resolutions were passed by shareholders:

1. Fees payable to Non-Executive Directors

2. Financial assistance to related or inter-related

companies.

3. Amendment to the Memorandum of Incorporation.

To the Shareholders of Murray & Roberts Holdings Limited

Report on the audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements

Our opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated and separate financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated and

separate financial position of Murray & Roberts Holdings Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together the Group) as at

30 June 2023, and its consolidated and separate financial performance and its consolidated and separate cash flows for the

year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of the Companies

Act of South Africa.

What we have audited

Murray & Roberts Holdings Limited

pages 93 to 178 comprise:

the consolidated and company statements of financial position as at 30 June 2023;

the consolidated and company statements of financial performance for the year then ended;

the consolidated and company statements of comprehensive income for the year then ended;

the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended;

the consolidated and company statements of cash flows for the year then ended; and

the notes to the annual financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those

standards are further described in the

statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence

Code of Professional

Conduct for Registered Auditors (IRBA Code) and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of financial

statements in South Africa. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IRBA Code and in

accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in South Africa. The IRBA Code is consistent with

the corresponding sect

Overall group materiality

R 112.14 million

How we determined it

0.9% of consolidated revenue from continuing operations

Rationale for the materiality

benchmark applied

We selected revenue from continuing operations as the benchmark because, in our view, it

is a benchmark against which the performance of the Group can be consistently measured

in circumstances of volatile year-on-year earnings. This benchmark has remained a key

driver of the Group

We chose 0.9% based on our professional judgement, after consideration of the range of

quantitative materiality thresholds that we would typically apply to entities operating within

this industry.

How we tailored our group audit scope

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated

financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the

industry in which the Group operates.

The Group consists of 215 reporting components. Our scoping assessment included consideration of financially significant

components, based on indicators such as the comp

contribution to consolidated assets, consolidated revenue and

consolidated profit before taxation as well as risks associated with the component. Based on this assessment we identified 10

financially significant components, for which full scope audits were performed. Specified audit procedures were performed on

significant account balances and transactions for a further 12 components as a result of significant account balances and

transactions within those components. In order to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence in respect of those

components that were considered to be financially inconsequential, the group engagement team performed analytical review

procedures in respect of the financial information of these components.

In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by us, as

the group engagement team and component auditors from other PwC network firms. When the work was performed by

component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have at those components to enable us to conclude

on whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial

statements as a whole.

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the

consolidated and separate financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit

of the consolidated and separate financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a

separate opinion on these matters. In addition to the matter described in the Material uncertainty related to going concern

section, we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report in respect of the separate financial

statements.

Refer to the following accounting policies and notes to the

consolidated financial statements for the disclosures as it

relates to this key audit matter:

Accounting Policy 1.10 Amounts due from/to

contract customers,

Accounting Policy 1.17 Provisions and

contingencies,

Accounting Policy 1.22 Revenue,

Note 8 Amounts due from/to contract customers,

Note 26 Revenue, and

Note 43 Critical accounting estimates and

judgements.

As at 30 June 2023, amounts due from contract customers

included uncertified claims and variations receivable

amounting to R 388.6 million and contracts in progress of R

1 billion.

Variation in contract work, claims and incentive payments

are recognised as revenue to the extent that collection is

highly probable, and the amounts can be reliably measured.

The Group applies significant judgement in assessing

whether the extent of collection of variation orders and

claims is highly probable.

Each variation order or claim is assessed individually to

establish entitlement and to conclude on the strength of the

claim.

The Group utilises legal experts, engineers and quantity

surveyors to assess probabilities in determining the amount

to be recognised relating to uncertified revenue and in

addition considers the customers credit risk in assessing the

recoverability of amounts recognised are considered highly

probable.

We considered the recognition and recoverability of

uncertified revenue balances to be a matter of most

significance to our current year audit due to the following:

Significant estimates and judgements applied

relating to the merits and quantum in determining

the probability of recovery of these balances; and

The magnitude of uncertified revenue balances

recognised in relation to the consolidated financial

statements.

Our work on the recognition and recoverability of uncertified

revenue balances entailed the following:

With the assistance of our quantity surveying

expertise and inspection of correspondence

relating to claims and variation orders, we

assessed the reasonableness of the merits and

quantum of variation orders and claims recognised

in favour of and against the Group. We accepted

the merits and quantum of variation orders and

claims recognised in favour of and against the

Group as reasonable;

confirmations and opinions and held discussions

with the legal experts, to understand the current

status and progress on claims and variation orders

in the dispute resolution and arbitration process. In

experience and objectivity by inspecting their

qualifications. We did not identify any material

exceptions;

We assessed the competence, capabilities and

legal experts, contract

engineering experts and quantity surveyors

through inspection of their qualifications,

professional memberships and obtaining an

understanding of their work. No aspects requiring

further consideration were noted;

We assessed the reasonableness of judgements,

estimates and assumptions made in relation to

uncertified revenue balances, through discussion

with the directors, engineering experts and

quantity surveyors and inspection of relevant

documentation such as correspondence between

parties, contractual agreements, signed variation

orders etc. We accepted the judgements,

estimates and assumptions as reasonable; and

For a sample of uncertified revenue balances, we

assessed the recoverability of uncertified revenue

balances receivable, through testing of receipts

subsequent to period end and where receipts

remained outstanding, specific client

circumstances such as force majeure notifications,

industry specific circumstances and publicly

available financial information and media reports

were considered. Furthermore, we assessed the

loss (ECL) allowance on uncertified revenue

balances, by independently recomputing the ECL

allowance. Our testing did not identify any material

exceptions as it impacts on the recoverability of

the uncertified revenue balances.

Middle East accounting treatment

Refer to the following accounting policies and notes to the

consolidated financial statements for the disclosures as it

relates to this key audit matter:

sale and discontinued operations,

Note 32 Discontinued Operations, Assets and

Liabilities Classified as Held for Sale,

Note 42 Events after reporting period, and

Note 43 Critical accounting estimates and

Our work performed in addressing this key audit matter

entailed the following:

We evaluated the reasonableness of

continued classification of the Middle East

operations, as a disposal group held for sale, in

terms of IFRS 5 through discussions with legal

counsel, management, the

representative and inspection of the Sale and

Purchase agreement and related long stop

extensions. We found the assessment to be

reasonable;

We assessed the reasonableness of estimates

transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities

within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,

supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant

audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding

independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on

our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of

the consolidated and separate financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe

these

rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences

of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.:

(b) Loans from non-controlling shareholders will not or

may not be settled in the issuer’s or the Group’s

own equity instruments.

If the loans from non-controlling shareholders do not

meet both conditions (a) and (b) they are classified as

financial liabilities.

The raising or repayment of non-controlling interest

loans that are classified as equity instruments has no

impact on the effective shareholding of the non-

controlling shareholder.

1.4

Business combinations

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the

acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a

business combination is measured at fair value, which

is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair

values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities

incurred by the Group to the former owners of the

acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group

in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-

related costs are recognised in profit or loss as

incurred.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the

consideration transferred, the amount of any non-

controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of

the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the

acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date

amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the

liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of

the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets

acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of

the consideration transferred, the amount of any

non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair

value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the

acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately

in profit or loss as a gain on bargain purchase.

Non-controlling interests that represent ownership

interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate

share of the entity’s net assets in the event of

liquidation may be initially measured at the non-

controlling interests’ proportionate share of the

recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net

assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a

transaction-by-transaction basis. Other types of

non-controlling interests are measured at fair value or,

when applicable, on the basis specified in another

IFRS.

When the consideration transferred by the Group in a

business combination includes assets or liabilities

resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement,

the contingent consideration is measured at its

acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the

consideration transferred in a business combination.

Changes in the fair value of the contingent

consideration that qualify as measurement period

adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with

corresponding adjustments against goodwill or gain on

bargain purchase. Measurement period adjustments

are adjustments that arise from additional information

obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which

cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date)

about facts and circumstances that existed at the

acquisition date.

The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair

value of the contingent consideration that do not

qualify as measurement period adjustments depend on

how the contingent consideration is classified.

Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is

not measured at subsequent reporting dates and its

subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset

or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting

dates in accordance with IAS 37: Provisions,

Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as

appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being

recognised in profit or loss.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is

incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which

the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional

amounts for the items for which the accounting is

incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted

during the measurement period (see above), or

additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect

new information obtained about facts and circumstances

that existed at the acquisition date that, if known,

would have affected the amounts recognised at that

date.

Goodwill

Goodwill is recognised as an asset at the acquisition

date of a business. Goodwill on the acquisition of a

subsidiary is included in intangible assets.

Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, an impairment test

is performed annually or more frequently if circumstances

indicated that it might be impaired. Any impairment is

recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not

subsequently reversed. For the purpose of impairment

testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s

cash generating units expected to benefit from the

synergies of business combinations. Any impairment

loss of the cash generating unit is first allocated

against the goodwill and thereafter against the other

assets of the cash generating unit on a pro-rata basis.:

These financial assets are deemed to be impaired

such as:

■ Significant financial difficulty of the subsidiary;

■ Liquidation, voluntary administration, business

rescue proceedings or other forms of financial

The Company monitors its credit exposure to loans

advanced to the subsidiary on an ongoing basis by

assessing the subsidiary’s financial position at reporting

1.8

Foreign currencies

Foreign currency transactions

A foreign currency transaction is recorded, on initial

recognition in functional currency, by applying to the

foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate

between the functional currency and the foreign

currency at the date of the transaction.

At the end of the reporting period:

■ foreign currency monetary items are translated using

the closing rate;

■ non-monetary items that are measured in terms of

historical cost in a foreign currency are translated

using the exchange rate at the date of the

transaction; and

■ non-monetary items that are measured at fair value

in a foreign currency are translated using the

exchange rates at the date when the fair value was

determined.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of

monetary items or on translating monetary items at

rates different from those at which they were translated

on initial recognition during the period or in previous

audited financial statements are recognised in profit or

loss in the period in which they arise.

When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is

recognised in other comprehensive income and

accumulated in equity, any exchange component of

that gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive

income and accumulated in equity. When a gain or

loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in profit or

loss, any exchange component of that gain or loss is

recognised in profit or loss.

Cash flows arising from transactions in a foreign

currency are recorded in functional currency by

applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange

rate between the functional currency and the foreign

currency at the date of the cash flow.

Foreign currency monetary items

Exchange differences arising on translation are

recognised in profit or loss except for those arising on

equity loans that are denominated in the functional

currency of either party involved. In those instances,

the exchange differences are taken directly to equity as

part of the foreign currency translation reserve.

Foreign operations

The results and financial position of a foreign operation

are translated into the presentation currency using the

following procedures:

■ assets and liabilities for each consolidated statement

of financial position presented are translated at the

closing rate at the date of that consolidated

statement of financial position;

■ income and expenses for each item of profit or loss

are translated at exchange rates at the dates of the

transactions; and

■ all resulting exchange differences are recognised in

the statement of other comprehensive income and

accumulated as a separate component of equity,

being the foreign currency translation reserve.

Foreign currency differences are recognised in other

comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign

currency translation reserve, except to the extent that

the translation difference is allocated to non-controlling

interest.

When a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety

or partially such that control, significant influence or

joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the

translation reserve related to that foreign operation is

reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss

on disposal. If the Group disposes of part of its interest

in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant

proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to

non-controlling interest.

On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative

exchange differences recognised in the foreign

exchange reserve relating to that operation up to the

date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated

statement of financial performance and other

comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on

disposals.

Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that

forms part of a net investment in a foreign operation

are recognised initially in the statement of other

comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign

currency translation reserve. On the disposal of a

foreign operation, all of the accumulated exchange

differences in respect of that operation attributable to

the Group are reclassified to profit or loss.:

STATEMENTS

SHAREHOLDERS’

INFORMATION

The Group has three types of financial assets that are

subject to the expected credit loss model:

■ trade and other receivables and amounts due from

contract customers for the sale of goods and

provision of services;

■ debt instruments carried at amortised costs; and

■ debt investments carried at fair value through other

comprehensive income.

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to

impairment requirements of IFRS 9, no impairment loss

was identified or recognised in the current period.

The IFRS 9 simplified approach was applied in

determining the ECL for trade receivables and amounts

due from contract customers which uses a lifetime

expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and

contract assets to be recognised from initial

recognition of the receivable. A lifetime ECL represents

the expected credit losses that will result from all

possible default events over the expected life of a

financial asset.

Financial assets are considered to have low credit risk

when they have a low risk of default and the

counterparty has a strong capacity to meet its

contractual cash flows in the near term. Impairment

losses on trade receivables and contract receivables

are presented as impairment losses within operating

expenses. Subsequent recoveries of amounts

previously written off are presented as a reversal of

impairment losses previously recognised within other

operating income.

The Group considers a trade receivable to be credit

impaired when one or more detrimental events have

occurred such as:

■ Significant financial difficulty of the customer;

■ Liquidation, business rescue proceedings or other

forms of financial reorganisation are implemented; or

■ Any other event where the likelihood of full

settlement is remote.

In instances where the Group determines a receivable

to be credit-impaired, the receivable is excluded from

the portfolio for the purposes of calculating an ECL

and a specific credit loss is raised based on an

assessment of the individual circumstances relating to

the default event.

For the other financial assets, the Group recognises

ECLs that reflects changes to the individual credit risk

profile of each financial asset at the reporting date.

Expected credit losses are recognised:

■ For credit exposures for which there has not been a

significant increase in credit risk since initial

recognition, expected credit losses are provided for

credit losses that could result from default events

that are possible within the next 12 months;

■ When the credit risk of financial assets significantly

increased and the resultant credit quality is not low

risk, then credit losses are provided for over the

remaining life of the exposure;

■ When financial assets have already become credit

impaired (or default events have occurred), a lifetime

approach is adopted on the net amount less

allowance. These are individually assessed.

A financial asset is considered to be in default when

contractual payments are 90 days past due.

Trade and other receivables and amounts due from

contract customers, are written off when there is no

reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that

there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include,

among others, the failure of a debtor to engage in

a repayment plan and a failure to make contractual

payments for a period of greater than 120 days

past due.

The carrying amount of a financial asset is reduced

through the use of an allowance account and changes

to this allowance account are recognised in profit or

loss. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously

written off are credited against the allowance account.

Refer to note 38.6 (Financial risk management) for

additional ECL disclosure.

Derecognition of financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when

the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset

expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and

substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership

of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither

transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and

rewards of ownership and continues to control the

transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained

interest in the asset and an associated liability for

amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains

substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership

of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues

to recognise the financial asset and also recognises

a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the

difference between the asset’s carrying amount and

the sum of the consideration received and receivable:

Amounts due to contract customers

Amounts due to contract customers (a contract liability)

relates to amounts that are received in excess of the

work completed. These amounts comprises advance

payments received and over-certified balances on work

performed.

Over-certified balances are recognised to the extent

that the amounts invoiced on the contract exceed the

gross amounts of costs incurred on a contract plus

recognised profit (less recognised losses).

Advance payments received are assessed on initial

recognition to determine whether it is probable that it

will be repaid in cash or another financial asset. In this

instance, the advance payment is classified as a

non-trading financial liability that is carried at amortised

cost. If it is probable that the advance payment will be

repaid with goods or services, the liability is carried at

historic cost. Refer to accounting policy note 1.9

Financial Instruments in this regard.

1.11 Intangible assets other than goodwill

An intangible asset is an identifiable, non-monetary

asset that has no physical substance. An intangible

asset is recognised when it is identifiable, the Group

has control over the asset, it is probable that economic

benefits will flow to the Group and the cost of the

asset can be measured reliably.

Computer software

Acquired computer software that is significant and

unique to the business is capitalised as an intangible

asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and

bring to use the specific software. Costs associated

with maintaining computer software programs are

capitalised as intangible assets only if it qualifies for

recognition. In all other cases these costs are

recognised as an expense incurred.

Costs that are directly associated with the development

and production of identifiable and unique software

products controlled by the Group and that will probably

generate economic benefits exceeding one year, are

recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include

the costs of software development employees and an

appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Computer

software is amortised on a systematic basis over its

estimated useful life from the date it becomes available

for use.

Patents and other rights, trademarks and

customer relationships

Separately acquired patents and other rights,

trademarks and customer relationships are recognised

at the purchase price and other costs that are directly

associated with the acquisition including professional

fees, costs of registration and employee benefits.

When acquired as part of a business combination,

these assets are recognised at fair value on the

acquisition date.

With the exception of trademarks, these intangible

assets have a finite life and are amortised over its

estimated useful life from the date it becomes available

for use.

Trademarks with an indefinite useful life are not

amortised, but tested annually for impairment.

1.12 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are tangible assets that

the Group holds for its own use or for rental to others

and which the Group expects to be used for more than

one period. Property, plant and equipment could be

constructed or purchased by the Group. The

consumption of property, plant and equipment is

reflected through a depreciation charge designated to

reduce the asset to its residual value over its useful life.

The useful lives of property, plant and equipment are

set out in note 2.

The residual value, useful life and depreciation method

of each asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting

period. If the expectations differ from previous

estimates, the change is accounted for as a change in

accounting estimate.

Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment

with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost

of the item is depreciated separately. The depreciation

charge for each period is recognised in profit or loss

unless it is included in the carrying amount of another

asset.

The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an

item of property, plant and equipment is included in

profit or loss when the item is derecognised. The gain

or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of

property, plant and equipment is determined as the

difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any,

and the carrying amount of the item.

Measurement

All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less

accumulated depreciation and accumulated

impairment losses, except for land, which is stated at

cost less accumulated impairment losses. Cost

includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the

acquisition of the item and includes transfers from

equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow

hedges of currency purchases of property, plant and

equipment.:

INFORMATION

A discontinued operation is a component of the entity

that has been disposed of or is classified as held for

sale and that represents a separate major line of

business or geographical area of operations, is part of

a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of

business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary

acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results

of discontinued operations are presented separately in

the statement of profit or loss.

1.15 Inventories

Inventories comprise raw materials, consumable stores

and in the case of manufacturing entities, work-in-

progress and finished goods. Consumable stores

include minor spare parts and servicing equipment that

are either expected to be used over a period less than

12 months or for general servicing purposes.

Consumable stores are recognised in profit or loss as

consumed.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net

realisable value.

The cost of inventories is determined using the

following cost formulae:

■ Raw materials – First In, First Out (“FIFO”) or

Weighted Average Cost basis.

■ Finished goods and work-in-progress – cost of

direct materials and labour including a proportion of

factory overheads based on normal operating

capacity.

Net realisable value represents the estimated selling

price in the ordinary course of the business less all

estimated costs of completion and costs incurred in

marketing, selling and distribution.

1.16 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether

the contract is, or contains a lease. A contract is, or

contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the

use of the identified asset for a period of time and in

exchange for consideration.

The following is assessed to determine if a contract

conveys the right to control the use of an identified

asset:

■ Whether the contract involves the use of an

identified asset, which may be specified explicitly

or implicitly. The asset must be physically distinct

or represent substantially all of the capacity of a

physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a

substantive substitution right, then the Group does

not have the right to use the identified asset

■ Whether the Group has the right to obtain

substantially all of the economic benefits from the

use of the identified asset throughout the period

of use

■ Whether the Group has the right to direct the use

of the identified asset throughout the period of use

only if:

» The Group has the right to direct how and for

what purpose the asset is used

» The relevant decisions about how and for what

purpose the asset is used is predetermined and

the Group has the right to operate the asset

without the supplier having the right to change

those operating instructions or the Group has

designed the asset in a way that predetermined

how and for what purpose the asset will be used

The Group as a lessee

At the commencement of the lease term, a right-of-use

asset and a lease liability is recognised on the

statement of financial position.

The right-of-use asset is measured at cost comprising

the amount of the initial measurement of the lease

liability, any lease payments made at or before the

commencement date less any lease incentives

received, any initial direct costs incurred and an

estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in

dismantling and removing the underlying asset,

restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the

underlying asset to the condition required by the terms

and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are

incurred to produce inventories.

The lease liability is measured at the present value of

the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The

lease payments are discounted using the interest rate

implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily

determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined,

the incremental borrowing rate is utilised.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the

lease liability include:

■ fixed payments, including in substance fixed

payments, less any incentives receivable;

■ variable lease payments that depend on an index or

rate, initially measured at the index or rate as at the

commencement date;

■ amounts payable under residual value guarantees;

■ the exercise price of an option if this is reasonably

certain to be exercised; and

■ payments of penalties for terminating the lease if this

is accounted for in the lease term.:

SHAREHOLDERS’

INFORMATION

An onerous contract is considered to exist where the

Group has a contract under which the unavoidable

costs of meeting the obligations under the contract

exceed the economic benefits expected to be received

from the contract.

When it is probable that total contract costs will

exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is

recognised as an expense immediately through profit

or loss, to the extent that the remaining contract costs

are deemed to be unavoidable in terms of IAS 37.

Estimating the total contract costs involves a significant

level of estimation and judgement. Refer to note 43 for

further disclosure in this regard.

1.18 Share-based payments

An expense is recognised where the Group received

goods or services in exchange for shares or rights over

shares (“equity-settled transactions”) or in exchange for

other assets equivalent in value to a given number of

shares or rights over shares (“cash-settled

transactions”).

Employees, including directors, of the Group receive

remuneration in the form of share-based transactions,

whereby employees render services in exchange for

shares or rights over shares (“equity-settled

transactions”).

The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees

is measured by reference to the fair value at the date

at which they are granted. The fair value is determined

independently by using the Binomial Lattice model. In

valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken

of any performance conditions, other than conditions

linked to the price of the shares of the Group (“market

conditions”).

The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised,

together with a corresponding increase in equity over

the period in which the non-market performance

conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the

relevant employees become fully entitled to the award

(vesting date).

No expense is recognised for awards that do not

ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is

conditional upon a market condition, which is treated

as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market

condition is satisfied, provided that all other

performance conditions are satisfied.

Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is

treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation,

and any expense not yet recognised for the award is

recognised immediately.

However, if a new award is substituted for the

cancelled award, and designated as a replacement

award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and

new awards are treated as if they were a modification

of the original award.

The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as

additional share dilution in the computation of diluted

earnings per share.

For cash-settled transactions, a liability equal to the

portion of the goods or services received is recognised

at the current fair value determined at each reporting

period.

Where there are any vested share options which have

not been exercised by the employees and have

expired, the cumulative expense recognised in the

share-based payment reserve is reclassified to retained

earnings.

1.19 Employee benefits

Defined contribution plans

Under defined contribution plans the Group’s legal or

constructive obligation is limited to the amount that it

agrees to contribute to the fund. Consequently, the

actuarial risk that benefits will be less than expected

and the investment risk that assets invested will be

insufficient to meet expected benefits, is borne by the

employee. Such plans include multi-employer or state

plans.

Employee and employer contributions to defined

contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the

year in which incurred.

Defined benefit plans

Under defined benefit plans, the Group has an

obligation to provide the agreed benefits to current and

former employees. The actuarial and investment risks

are borne by the Group. A multi-employer or state plan

that is classified as a defined benefit plan, but for

which sufficient information is not available to enable

defined benefit accounting, is accounted for as a

defined contribution plan.

For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits

is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Methods,

with actuarial valuations being carried out at each

reporting period date.

The current service cost as well as net interest

expense in respect of defined benefit plans is

recognised as an expense in the year to which it

relates. Past service costs are recognised immediately

in profit or loss. Experience adjustments, effects of

changes in actuarial assumptions and plan:

INFORMATION

Related party transactions are those where a transfer

of resources or obligations between related parties

occur, regardless of whether or not a price is charged.

1.22 Revenue

The Group applies IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts

with Customers.

IFRS 15.56 states that variable consideration should

only be included in the transaction price, when

recognising revenue, to the extent that it is highly

probable that a significant reversal will not occur when

the uncertainty associated with the variable

consideration is subsequently resolved.

IFRS 5 defines “highly probable” as “significantly more

likely than probable”, where “probable” means “more

likely than not” (IFRS 5: Appendix A).

Due to the higher threshold required for recognition

and measurement purposes, the application of IFRS

15 has resulted in the delayed recognition of variable

consideration until such time that it is highly probable

that the revenue will not be reversed when the

uncertainty is resolved.

The Group principally recognises revenue from

construction contracts and rendering of engineering

services to the natural resource market sectors.

The Group applies the 5 step approach contained in

IFRS 15 for determining when to recognise revenue,

the amount that should be recognised and when

revenue should be recognised.

a) Construction contracts

Step 1: Identify contracts with customers

The Group’s customer base, in terms of revenue

contribution, consists mostly of construction contracts

with large local and international firms.

Step 2: Identify separate performance

obligations

Under IFRS 15, the Group recognises revenue when

(or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when

“control” of the goods or services underlying the

particular performance obligation is transferred to the

customer.

A performance obligation represents a good or service

(or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct or a

series of distinct goods or services that are

substantially the same.

If a construction contract has multiple sub-level

performance obligations that are highly integrated with

each other, the construction contract is considered a

significant integrated service with one performance

obligation. This requires judgement and each contract

is assessed individually.

Step 3: Determine the transaction price

The transaction price is the amount of consideration to

which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for

transferring promised goods or services to a customer,

excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

Variations in contract work, claims and incentive

payments are included to the extent that collection is

highly probable and the amounts can be reliably

measured. IFRS 5 defines “highly probable” as

“significantly more likely than probable”, where

“probable” means “more likely than not” (IFRS 5:

Appendix A). The assessment as to whether the

recoverability of claims are highly probable requires

significant judgement. Each claim is assessed

individually to confirm entitlement and to conclude on

the strength of the claim. The Group utilises legal

experts, engineers and quantity surveyors to assess

probabilities in determining the amount to be

recognised relating to uncertified revenue and that the

recoverability of amounts recognised are considered

highly probable. The cumulative balance of uncertified

revenue taken to book is disclosed as “Uncertified

claims and variations less payments received on

account” under note 8, and “Amounts due to contract

customers” on the statement of financial position.

Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the

performance obligation in the contract

Where the output method (refer to step 5) is used to

recognise revenue over time, the transaction price of

the contracts are that as per the agreed bill of

quantities (“BOQ”) finalised during the tender stage.

The quantities of the variable components included in

the BOQ are updated (measured) during the

implementation stage of the contracts.

Where the contract is considered to have one

performance obligation and the transaction price as

determined in step 3 is allocated to it, the input

method (refer to step 5) is used to recognise revenue

over time.

Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the

entity satisfies a performance obligation

Control is transferred over time and revenue is

recognised over time by reference to the progress

towards complete satisfaction of the relevant

performance obligation if one of the following criteria

is met:

■ the customer simultaneously receives and consumes

the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as

the Group performs;

■ the Group’s performance creates and enhances an

asset that the customer controls as the Group

performs; or

■ the Group’s performance does not create an asset

with an alternative use to the Group and the Group

has an enforceable right to payment for performance

completed to date.:

are disclosed as “Contracts-in-progress” and

“Uncertified claims and variations less payments

received on account” under note 8, and “Amounts due

to contract customers” on the statement of financial

position.

For contracts where progress billings exceed contract

costs incurred to date plus recognised profits less

recognised losses, the surplus is shown as contract

liabilities. Amounts received before the related work is

performed are included in the consolidated statement

of financial position, as a liability, as amounts received

in excess of work completed. Contract liabilities are

disclosed as “Amounts received in excess of work

completed” under note 8, and “Amounts due to

contract customers” on the statement of financial

position.

Amounts billed for work performed but not yet paid by

the customer are included in the consolidated

statement of financial position under amounts due to

contract customers, as “Amounts receivable on

contracts” and “Retentions receivable”.

In limited circumstances, contracts may be materially

impacted by a client’s actions such that the Group is

unable to complete the contracted works at all or in

the manner originally forecast. This may include

dispute resolution procedures under the relevant

contract and/or litigation. In these circumstances the

assessment of the project outcome, whilst following

the basic principles becomes more judgmental. Refer

to note 43 (Critical accounting estimates and

judgements) regarding revenue recognition and

contract accounting.

b) Rendering of engineering services

Revenue from the rendering of services is recognised

over time. The progress towards complete satisfaction

of a performance obligation is measured based on the

output method, which is to recognise revenue on the

basis of direct measurements of the value of the goods

or services transferred to the customer to date relative

to the remaining goods or services promised under the

contract, that best depict the Group’s performance in

transferring control of goods or services.

c) Sale of goods

The Group recognises revenue when the performance

obligation is satisfied, i.e. when “control” of the goods

underlying the particular performance obligation is

transferred to the customer when the goods are

delivered.

d) Other revenue

Other revenue includes the provision of labour,

information technology and other services to joint

operations.

Revenue is recognised over time as the services are

provided as the customers simultaneously receive and

consume the benefits provided by the Group’s

performance as the Group performs.

The progress towards complete satisfaction of a

performance obligation is measured based on the

output method, which is to recognise revenue on the

contract, that best depict the Group’s performance in

transferring control of goods or services.

1.23 Dividends

Dividends are accounted for on the date of declaration

and are not accrued as a liability in the financial

statements until declared.

1.24 Segmental reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner

consistent with the internal reporting provided to the

chief operating decision makers. The chief operating

decision makers, who are responsible for allocating

resources and assessing performance of the operating

segments, have been identified as the Executive

Committee who make strategic decisions. The basis of

segmental reporting is set out in Annexure 3.

Inter-segment transfers

Segment revenue, segment expenses and segment

results include transfers between operating segments

and between geographical segments. Such transfers

are accounted for at arm’s length prices. These

transfers are eliminated on consolidation.

Segmental revenue and expenses

All segment revenue and expenses are directly

attributable to the segments.

Segmental assets

All operating assets used by a segment principally

include property, plant and equipment, investments,

inventories, contracts-in-progress and receivables, net

of allowances. Cash balances and taxation are

excluded.

Segmental liabilities

All operating liabilities of a segment principally include

accounts payable, subcontractor liabilities and external

interest bearing borrowings. Bank overdrafts and

taxation are excluded.:

The Group considered the impact on property, plant and equipment mainly where project delays were experienced and

operations were brought to a halt. Property, plant and equipment was assessed for deterioration as a result of idle time and

reduced use. The annual reassessment of useful lives and residual values was performed with no significant amounts

recognised. Impairment of property, plant and equipment in the current year reflected an amount of R10 million.

The Group has pledged certain assets as security for certain interest bearing borrowings, refer to note 16.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill might be impaired.

The recoverable amount of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow

projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period. The cash flow projections are

based on multi-year project awards currently secured as well as incorporating a probability weighting with respect to near

orders that management expects to be awarded going forward. Management has included potential delays in projects

secured, downward adjusted probability weighting of near orders and category 1 opportunities to be secured, and revised

commencement timelines for new projects to reflect the current expectations going forward where applicable.

Based on impairment tests performed in the current year, prior to deconsolidation of the MRPL Group (Murray & Roberts

Pty Limited (“MRPL”), Clough Limited Group (“Clough”) and RUC Cementation Mining Group (“RUC”) businesses), an

impairment of R126,2 million relating to the Clough USA CGU was recognised. Upon placing the MRPL Group into voluntary

administration, the Goodwill relating to the Mining Australia, Clough Limited, e2o Pty Ltd, Booth Welsh Pty Ltd and JJ White

Inc., totalling R868,3 million were derecognised.

The growth rates used depend on management’s assessment of the sector in which the CGU operates. Factors such as the

industry, market conditions and geographical area are also considered when determining the growth rate. These growth

rates do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the relevant market. Cash flows beyond the three year period are

extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of between 1,5% and 4,5% (FY2022: 1,5% and 4,5%).

In line with market practice, the Group applied a post-tax discount rate of between 13% and 21% (FY2022: between 10%

and 21%) to post-tax cash flows for impairment testing. The discount rate applied is dependent on factors such as the

weighted average cost of capital, industry, market conditions and geographical area of the relevant CGU. Post-tax rates were

applied as returns observable in the capital market on equity investments usually include tax effects.

Goodwill was tested for impairment using a sensitivity analysis by increasing the applicable post-tax discount rate of the

CGU by 1%-3% (FY2022: 1%-3%) and decreasing the growth rate by 1%-3% (FY2022: 1%-3%). Further sensitivity analysis

was performed by varying the base assumptions which included removing synergies which relate to cross-selling

opportunities and cost-savings through reallocation of resources. No changes in key assumptions for the CGUs above that

would cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount were noted.

The only intangible asset with an indefinite useful life relates to a trade name acquired as part of the TNT acquisition

(included in the Cementation USA Inc. CGU). The trade name was tested as part of the CGU and no impairment was

deemed necessary based on tests performed.:

the sale agreement amounted to R1,4 billion. The Group completed the transaction relating to the disposal of its Investment in the BCC on

03 April 2023. The proceeds received were R1,2 billion (net of dividend distribution of R130 million and transaction costs of R44 million). As a

consequence of the transaction having been concluded at fair value, no profit or loss on disposal was recognised in the Consolidated

statement of financial performance, for the disposal of the shares.:

^ This relates to shares vested whereby the tax due is paid by the participant and the shares are transferred to the personal broker account of

said participant.

Notes:

1. A compulsory automatic deferral scheme of part of the STI into forfeitable share awards as a LTI was introduced in September 2013 for

selected employees. The LTI allocation has a three year vesting period (1/3 each year) and is not subject to performance conditions, but is

subject to continued employment.

2. For the September 2019 scheme, the forfeitable shares cliff vested after three years, in September 2022, subject to satisfying certain

performance conditions.

3. For the October 2020 scheme, the forfeitable shares will cliff vest after three years, in October 2023, subject to satisfying certain

performance conditions. The weighted average remaining contractual life is 3 months.

4. For the September 2022 scheme, the forfeitable shares will cliff vest after three years, in September 2025, subject to satisfying certain

performance conditions. The weighted average remaining contractual life is 26 months.

The September 2021 award was not made under the forfeitable share plan due to the overall limit having been reached. Instead a

cash-settled conditional rights award was made. The weighted average remaining contractual life is 14 months.

The sub-optimal exercise assumption is not applicable to the FSP since the exercise is assumed to occur on vesting date.

The Group recognised total expenses of R7,9 million (FY2022: R26,7 million) relating to these share options during the year.

On 1 October 2020, 2 103 500 cash-settled conditional awards were granted to Mr. HJ Laas.

On 1 September 2021, 8 637 500 Group cash-settled conditional awards were granted (including the award to Mr. HJ Laas

of 1 477 500 awards).

The cash-settled liability balance as at 30 June 2023 is R3,2 million.:

17 Long term loans continued

The Group previously had a short term overdraft facility of R1,675 million in South Africa held at four South African Banks

(Standard Bank, Nedbank, RMB and ABSA). Due to increasing liquidity pressure, the Group concluded a debt refinancing

and restructuring process with the banks in November 2022. The restructuring of the facility resulted in an overdraft facility

of R650 million, which was partially drawn, and a fully drawn term loan of R1,350 million.

In April 2023, R1 billion of the proceeds on the disposal of the investment in the Bombela Concession Company was used

to partially settle the term loan. In terms of the agreement with the banks, a remaining R50 million settlement is required by

September 2023 and R300 million by August 2024.

At 30 June 2023, the banks had granted a waiver of the covenant measurement at that date. The Group would have been

in breach of covenants should measurement have been required. The banks have also requested Group to implement the

following:

■ Appointment of financial advisors by 31 July 2023

■ Renegotiation of covenants by 28 September 2023

■ Developing a deleveraging plan by 31 October 2023

■ Completing a due diligence exercise by 31 July 2023 in assessing whether any parties have first ranking security interests

over certain Canadian subsidiaries.

The Group’s current interest bearing unsecured loans are payable on demand whilst the long term secured loans and leases

are regulated by contractual repayment terms in excess of 365 days and are supported by cross guarantees per region.

With respect to the above loans, the fair value of these loans are considered to approximate their carrying amounts.

Details of the repayment terms of loans and the related interest rates are set out in Annexure 2. The assets encumbered to

secure the loans are detailed in note 16. Details of the Group’s interest rate risk management policies are set out in note 38.

Details of loan movements are set out in note 34.

18 Retirement benefits

The retirement funds operated by the Group in the Republic of South Africa are registered as provident or pension funds and

are accordingly governed by the Pension Fund Act No. 24 of 1956 (as amended).

18.1 Defined contribution plan – pension fund

The Group is a participating employer of the Sanlam Umbrella Pension Fund.

The total cost to the Group in respect of the above fund for the year ended 30 June 2023 was R29,8 million (FY2022:

R28,8 million).

18.2 Defined benefit plan – pension scheme

The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks:

Investment risk: The scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as corporate bonds, which have volatile market

values and, while these assets are expected to provide the real returns over the long term, the short term volatility can cause

additional funding to be required if a deficit emerges.

Interest rate risk: The Scheme’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the

liabilities. As the scheme does not wholly invest in high quality corporate bonds, the value of the assets and liabilities may

not move in the same way.

Inflation risk: A significant proportion of the benefits under the scheme are linked to inflation. Although the Scheme’s assets

are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short term could lead to

deficits emerging.

Mortality risk: In the event that members live longer than assumed, a deficit will emerge in the scheme.

Concentration risk: A significant proportion of the plan’s liabilities are in respect of a single pensioner member. The

development of the liabilities over time will therefore depend heavily on the actual experience in respect of this member.

20 Deferred taxation continued

20.5 Unused taxation losses

The Group’s results include a number of legal statutory entities which fall under a range of taxation jurisdictions. The deferred

taxation assets cannot be offset against the deferred taxation liabilities as the Group will not be able to settle on a net basis.

At 30 June 2023, the Group has estimated unused taxation losses of R3,086 million (FY2022: R4,250 million) available

for offset against future profits. Deferred taxation assets have been recognised in respect of R550 million (FY2022:

R1,945 million) of such losses. No deferred taxation assets have been recognised in respect of the remaining

R2,536 million (FY2022: R2,305 million) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.

The Group performed an assessment based on the current operations and developments including a three year forecast for

the financial years 2024 to 2026 which supports the recognition of deferred taxation assets in the statutory entities. Tax

losses in South Africa of R2,144 million (FY2022: R2,608 million) have no expiry date so long as the statutory entities

continue to trade. In addition to the unused income tax losses, the Group has circa R6 billion capital losses available for

future asset sales.

20.6 Withholding tax on dividends

The Group has available retained earnings in foreign subsidiary companies. Should such earnings be distributed to holding

companies within the Group, the Group shall be liable for foreign withholding tax levied on dividends at the rate between

0% and 15%. Should the subsidiaries declare all their retained earnings as dividends, the withholding tax payable is

estimated to be R185 million (FY2022: R191 million).

32 Discontinued operations, assets and liabilities classified as held

for sale

32.1 (Loss)/profit for the year from discontinued operations

The discontinued operations comprise Mining Australia (RUC Cementation Mining Group (“RUC”) and Insig Technologies

(“Insig”)), the Energy, Resources & Infrastructure Platform (Clough Limited Group (“Clough”)), Murray & Roberts Pty Limited

(“MRPL”), together referred to as “MRPL Group and Insig”, the Middle East Operations, the Southern Africa Infrastructure &

Buildings Platform and Genrec.

MRPL Group and Insig

On 5 December 2022 Clough Limited and MRPL were placed in voluntary administration. As a result of this, the Group lost

control of MRPL and its subsidiaries, RUC and Clough, and the MRPL Group was deconsolidated on 5 December 2022.

Subsequent to this, on 16 June 2023, Insig, which predominantly serviced RUC, was placed in voluntary liquidation, as a

result of the Group being unable to provide the necessary investment required to support Insig’s growth trajectory.

Clough formed the entire Energy, Resources and Infrastructure Platform within the Group which was seen as a separate

major line of business. RUC and Insig, formed the entire Mining Australia business and together was seen as a separate

major line of business. The voluntary administration process of the MRPL Group has effectively resulted in the entire

Australasian geographical area of operations being disposed of. As the MRPL Group and Insig formed separate major lines

of businesses and a separate geographical area of operations that was disposed of in the year, these businesses met the

criteria in terms of IFRS 5 – Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations (IFRS 5), to be classified as

discontinued operations.

The financial results of the MRPL Group are reported under discontinued operations in the statement of financial

performance from the start of the financial period until 5 December 2022. The financial results of Insig are reported under

discontinued operations in the statement of financial performance from the start of the financial period until 16 June 2023.

The loss of control of the MRPL Group and Insig resulted in a loss of R2,4 billion on deconsolidation of the net asset value

and a reclassification of foreign currency translation reserve (“FCTR”) profit of R1,2 billion. This has been disclosed as a loss

on loss of control of MRPL Group and Insig of R1,2 billion below. Refer to note 31 for further detail. The operating losses,

disclosed as “loss from discontinued operations” of R1,6 billion includes a Clough trading loss of R1,3 billion and a RUC and

Insig trading profit of R45 million. Related costs as a result of the voluntary administration are a further expense attributable

to discontinued operations of R155 million.

Middle East Operations

The Middle East Operations were classified as a discontinued operation in the 2020 financial year as a result of being

abandoned, as defined in terms of IFRS 5. By 30 June 2021, the discussions to dispose of the Middle East Operations had

progressed to an advanced stage of negotiations and as a result thereof these companies met the criteria, in terms of IFRS

5, to be classified as a disposal group held for sale. The sale and purchase agreement to dispose of the operations was

subsequently executed on 30 August 2021. At 30 June 2023, the sale and purchase transaction had not concluded, as it is

pending conclusion of ongoing litigation and regulatory approval. The long stop date has therefore been extended to

15 September 2023. The Middle East Operations continue to meet the criteria to be classified as a disposal group held for

sale in terms of IFRS 5, even though the one-year period has been exceeded as the delay in sale is due to circumstances

beyond the Group’s control.

Subsequent to year-end, a claim has been lodged by a UAE-based bank (“the bank”), and a summons has been issued in

South Africa against Murray & Roberts Limited (a subsidiary in the Group), in relation to the parent company guarantee it

issued in favour of the bank. The bank had issued a bond on the Al Mafraq Hospital project, on behalf of the Middle East

Operations, which was called on by the client. As a result of the bank paying out on the call of the bond, the overdraft

account of the Middle East Operations was drawn down on. The claim lodged by the bank in relation to the parent company

guarantee, is to recover the pay out on the call of the bond made by the client. Refer to note 42 for further details.

Included in the current year loss from discontinued operations are operating costs of R28 million incurred mainly on legal

fees and an impairment of a joint operation partner receivable of R170 million relating to the Middle East Operations.

Southern Africa Infrastructure & Buildings Platform and Genrec

During the 2017 financial year, the Group disposed of its South African construction businesses held within the Southern

Africa Infrastructure & Buildings Platform and Genrec. These businesses formed a separate major line of business that was

disposed of and constituted a discontinued operation in terms of IFRS 5. As part of the disposal, certain assets and liabilities

of the business, relating to ongoing litigation matters were retained in the Group. These items continue to be reported under

discontinued operations until the matters are closed out.:

37 Contingent liabilities

As a contracting Group, Murray & Roberts is in the ordinary course of its business involved in various disputes, a number of

which arise when operations and projects are closed out and finalised. Depending on the merits, disputes can translate into

claims and legal proceedings, which Murray & Roberts always rigorously defends. Where Murray & Roberts, in consultation

with its legal advisors and counsel, believes the claims are predicated on weak and/or spurious grounds, and Murray &

Roberts has sound and strong defences, no provision is made for any such claim, and they are aggregated and disclosed as

contingent liabilities. In relation to contingent liabilities, the reduction noted is due to a resolution of certain claims. The Board

does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending proceeding or claims against the Group will have a material adverse

effect on the financial condition or future of the Group. The Group does not account for any potential contingent liabilities

where a back-to-back arrangement exists with the clients or subcontractors and there is a legal right to offset (R1,6 billion).

The decrease in financial institution guarantees is mainly attributable to the Group placing the MRPL Group into voluntary

administration as well as a reduction in local facilities.

Tribunal has been established and it is the Group’s expectation that the matter should be resolved in its favour. No amount is included above

due to the unlikelihood of any such claim and no Tribunal being established to determine any such amount.:

38.2 Financial instruments

The Group does not trade in financial instruments but, in the normal course of operations, is exposed to currency, credit,

interest and liquidity risk.

In order to manage these risks, the Group may enter into transactions that make use of financial instruments. The Group’s

financial instruments consist mainly of deposits with banks, short term investments, accounts receivable and payable and

interest bearing borrowings.

Level 1 – quoted prices for similar instruments

Level 3 – inputs not based on observable market data

38.3 Market risk

The Group operates in various countries and is exposed to the market risk evident in each specific country. The primary

market risks identified relate to foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate fluctuations. The sensitivities relating to these

market risks are detailed in notes 38.4 and 38.5.

38.4 Foreign currency and translation risk management

The Group has major operating entities in Canada and America and hence has an exposure to fluctuations in exchange

rates. The Group does not have operating entities in Australia as at 30 June 2023 due to the voluntary administration of

MRPL and its subsidiaries and Insig. The Group may, from time-to-time, hedge its foreign currency exposure for either

purchase or sale transactions through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts although no such significant

transactions occurred in the current financial year.

Foreign currency and translation sensitivity

The Group is mainly exposed to the currencies of Canada and the United States of America. The following table details the

Group’s major foreign currencies and the sensitivity of a 1% decrease in the Rand against the relevant currencies. A 1%

increase in the Rand would have an inverse, proportionate impact. The sensitivity includes only foreign currency denominated

monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a change in foreign currency rates. A positive number

indicates an increase in profit and equity where the Rand weakens against the relevant currencies.

38.6 Credit risk management

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the

Group. Potential areas of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables (net of provisions)

and contract receivables (net of provisions).

Credit quality

Cash and cash equivalents: The Group only deposits its money with large reputable financial institutions. Below are the

credit ratings in relation to the financial institutions the Group holds cash and cash equivalents with:

Trade and other receivables: Trade and other receivables subject to credit risk consist mostly of amounts owing by joint

operations and partners and other receivables.

Amounts owing by joint arrangements and partners: These receivables are governed by joint arrangement agreements

that set out the rights and obligations of each partner. Joint arrangement partners are subject to financial reviews before a

partnership is entered into and the risk relating to the partner is constantly monitored to assess any risks as they arise. The

current financial year amount decreased significantly due to the loss of control of MRPL and its subsidiaries. The ECL

assessment has been performed (evaluating all factors as outlined under contract receivables) resulting in an insignificant

credit loss. All amounts have been evaluated on an entity specific basis and the credit risk has been deemed low based on

the assessment performed.

Other receivables: Relates mostly to the rendering of services to the same customer base as described under contract

receivables. Other receivables is assessed with the contract receivables when assessing credit risk. The ECL allowance

assessment performed in the current financial year resulted in an insignificant credit loss.

Amounts due from contract customers: Over the last five financial years the impairment and/or write-off of contract and

trade receivables from continuing operations has been below R35 million per year on an average revenue of R16,8 billion

and contract and trade receivables balance of R2,8 billion.

The Group’s client base across the Group are mainly entities with a large market capitalisation and US parastatals.

Each operating platform assesses the project risk (including credit risk) before a decision is made to tender. Higher risk

projects are presented to the Group Audit & Risk Committee and the Group’s Board to obtain approval to tender. Often

approval will be granted subject to reducing the identified risk to an acceptable level. For clients where the credit risk is

considered higher than normal, payment guarantees and/or property liens (Americas) would be obtained.

Certain projects (specifically in the mining sector) are lender financed and are indirectly controlled by such lenders. Lenders

may, for example, include a requirement that a reputable contractor be used to execute the project or certain sections

thereof. Lender financed projects reduce the overall credit risk on a project as the client would have been required to

illustrate the financial viability of the project as well as the ability to repay the debt to the relevant financial institution, whilst

being subject to debt covenants over the repayment period of the debt.

During the execution of projects, the work performed is certified and is therefore liquid and executable, which enables the

Group to use the necessary commercial rights to its disposal to recover amounts receivable once they become due.

Receivables relating to uncertified claims and variations (i.e. uncertified revenue) are assessed in terms of IFRS 15. The

Group utilises experts to assess probabilities (of revenue not reversing) in determining the amount to be recognised as

uncertified revenue. An ECL allowance assessment was thereafter performed on uncertified claims and revenue balances

and was noted to be insignificant. The factors outlined below (both macroeconomic and forward-looking information) were

taken into account by adjusting the loss given default rate in arriving at this conclusion. The ECL allowance for uncertified

claims and variations was performed on a customer specific basis for all customers (the client base mainly reflecting large

listed customers with a large capitalisation and strong balance sheets). Factors outlined below indicated that there no

significant increase in credit risk compared to the prior financial year.

ECLs are assessed on a customer specific basis, taking into account macroeconomic factors and forward-looking

information impacting the customer.:

41 Prior period restatement

During the current year, the Group reassessed the classification of bank overdrafts as a component of cash and cash

equivalents and identified that a portion of the bank overdraft did not fluctuate in the current and prior financial year from

being overdrawn to a positive balance. It has therefore been concluded that the bank overdraft should not have formed an

integral part of the Group’s cash management, and instead represents a form of financing and the related cash flow

movements should be presented as cash flows from financing activities.

The errors noted above resulted in the Statement of Cash Flows, Note 10 and Note 34 being restated as per below:

43 Critical accounting estimates and judgements

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition,

seldom equal the related actual results. The most significant estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of these

consolidated financial statements are discussed below.

Revenue recognition and contract accounting

Other information

The Group uses certain assumptions and key factors in the management of and reporting for its contracting arrangements.

These assumptions are material and relate to:

■ The determination of performance obligations;

■ The estimation of costs to completion and the determination of the percentage of completion;

■ The estimation of contract profit margin;

■ The estimation of onerous contract provisions;

■ The recognition of penalties and claims on contracts;

■ The recoverability of under claims (contracts-in-progress) and uncertified revenue balances; and

■ The recognition of contract incentives.

Performance obligations

IFRS 15 provides guidance as to whether a construction contract or engineering service should be treated as one

performance obligation or multiple performance obligations. If a construction contract had multiple sub-level performance

obligations which are highly integrated with each other, the construction contract is considered a significant integrated

service with one performance obligation. This requires judgement and each contract is assessed individually. In applying the

IFRS 15 guidance most contracts are seen as single performance obligations for group purposes.

The estimation of costs to completion and the determination of the percentage of completion

The use of the input method (percentage of completion) requires the Group to estimate the cost of construction and

engineering services provided to date as a proportion of the total estimated cost of these services to be performed.

The use of the output method requires progress to be measured on a contract through direct measurement. The Group’s

engineers and quantity surveyors exercise their judgement in estimating progress based on performance on the contract or

achievement of milestones.

Contract profit margin and onerous contract provisions

The total expected contract profit margin is dependent on the total estimated revenue and the total estimated cost. Where

total estimated cost exceeds total estimated revenue, the unavoidable expected loss is provided for as an onerous contract

provision.

The recognition of penalties and claims on contracts

The recognition of penalties and claims on contracts requires significant estimation and judgement. The Group uses experts

to assess the merits of claims for and against the Group, and to determine their quantum. Claims in favour of the Group are

only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that the revenue will not reverse.:

45 Going concern continued

Overdraft and term debt facilities

The Group previously had a short term overdraft facility in South Africa, and due to increasing liquidity pressure, concluded a

debt refinancing and restructuring process with four South African banks in November 2022. The R1,675 million overdraft

facility was restructured into an overdraft facility of R0,65 billion and a Term Loan of R1,35 billion resulting in a term loan

facility of R1,35 billion and a short term overdraft facility of R0,65 billion – totalling a combined facility of R2 billion.

The sale of the Group’s investment in BCC closed on 03 April 2023, and R1 billion of the proceeds were applied to

significantly deleverage the Group by reducing the term debt to R350 million. This remaining balance of the term debt is

repayable in two tranches, R50 million in September 2023 and R300 million in August 2024. The overdraft facility terms were

unchanged.

The deconsolidation of MRPL, Clough and RUC negatively impacted the Group’s ability to meet the covenants that were

agreed with the four South African banks for its South African operations. If financial covenants were assessed at

30 June 2023, covenants would not have been met and a covenant measurement waiver was thus obtained on

30 June 2023. It was also agreed with the banks that the covenants would be renegotiated, considering the current Group

structure. Based on the covenant waiver obtained, the Group did not breach its covenants at 30 June 2023.

The Group performed a going concern assessment at year end, taking the above developments into consideration.

Cash flow forecasts

The Group is dependent on the utilisation of the overdraft facility to meet its liquidity requirements. Cash flow forecasts for

each of the two remaining platforms to the end of the 2024 financial year have been prepared and subsequently stress-

tested for key judgements and assumptions relating to forecast revenue and project margins, the secured and unsecured

order book and the timing of cash flows. Based on these cash flow forecasts, the Group has considered the following in

assessing its liquidity needs and ongoing working capital requirements, its ability to repay the term debt as it falls due, and

its ability to continue as a going concern:

■ Term Debt Repayment: To settle the term debt, the Group requires dividend payments from its international mining

subsidiaries, to Murray & Roberts Limited in South Africa. Based on forecasts, these international mining subsidiaries are

performing well, and it is expected that they will generate enough cash inflows to be able to declare sufficient dividends

going forward, thereby assisting in the repayment of the South African term debt. The Group is currently renegotiating

covenants with the banks of these international mining subsidiaries to enable such dividend payments to be made.

■ Banking Facilities: As at 30 June 2023, the Group had the following facilities in place (disclosed in note 38.7):

» Direct banking facilities in South Africa in place of R1,5 billion, with R0,3 billion of unutilised facilities available.

» Direct foreign banking facilities in place were R1,3 billion with R1,0 billion of unutilised facilities available.

» Indirect local banking facilities in place were R1,9 billion with R0,0 billion of unutilised facilities available. Currently, the

four South African lending banks are permitting drawdowns against the overdraft facilities. However, the remaining

facilities which are currently fully drawn are not available for utilisation as they reduce, and the Group is exploring

alternative facility providers.

» Indirect foreign banking facilities in place were R1,2 billion with R0,5 billion of unutilised facilities available.

Some of these facilities have limited availability for Group-wide use due to dividend distribution and intra-group

limitations.

■ Order Book: The Group has a healthy secured order book which includes high-profile, multi-year projects.

■ Outstanding Claims: There are several unresolved and long outstanding claims, some of which are expected to be settled

within the next 12 months.

■ Working Capital Management: The Group is constantly reviewing working capital utilisation on projects and seeking ways

to improve working capital management, which include the conversion of certain contracts to new, less onerous

commercial arrangements.

■ Deleveraging Requirements: The Group is working closely with the four South African lenders to meet their deleveraging

expectations and is assisted by Deloitte as advisors in this regard together with the development of a sustainable capital

structure. The implementation of the deleveraging plan is expected to be complete within a 12 to 18 month time period

following South African lender approval.

Conclusion

The Group is confident that it would be able to implement the actions outlined above, and any potential financial

restructuring that may be required, for it to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As

at the date of the financial statements, should these actions not achieve the desired outcome, especially as it relates to the

inflow of sufficient dividends from its international mining subsidiaries to repay the term debt, or the South African banks

rejecting the deleveraging plan, these conditions give rise to a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the

Group and the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore may be unable to realise its assets and

discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.:

The amount due from subsidiary company (being Murray & Roberts Investments) is unsecured, interest free and does not

have any fixed repayment terms (Annexure 1). The intention is to not call this loan in the next 12 months. The Company

monitors its credit exposure to loans advanced to the subsidiary on an ongoing basis by assessing the subsidiary’s financial

position at reporting date. Credit risk for loans to related parties has increased in the current year mainly as a result of the

loss of various subsidiaries within the Group (refer to note 38 for further details). The ECL assessment has been performed

by management by evaluating the liquidity position, future projected cash flows taking into account macro-economic factors

and forward looking information as included in note 38.6. The ECL allowance was raised based on the assessment

performed. The remaining value of the loan is deemed to be recoverable based on the cash flow forecast assessments

performed.

(North Bay-based); Cementation USA (Salt Lake City-based) and Cementation Sudamérica (Santiago-based). Its geographic footprint

is one of the largest in its industry, with a service offering that spans the project value chain including specialist engineering, shaft

construction, mine development, raise drilling and contract mining.

During the current financial year, the Group’s Australian operations were placed into voluntary administration and consequently

deconsolidated. This resulted in the Energy, Resources & Infrastructure segment as well as the Australian component of the Mining

segment being classified as discontinued operations.

Inter-segmental transfers

Segmental revenue, segmental expenses and segmental results include transfers between operating segments and between

geographical segments. Such transfers are accounted for at arm’s length prices. These transfers are eliminated on consolidation.

Segmental revenue and expenses

Segmental revenue and expenses are directly attributable to the segments.

Segmental assets

All operating assets of segments principally comprise property, plant and equipment, investments, inventories, intangible assets,

contracts-in-progress and receivables, net of allowances. Cash and taxation balances are excluded. Segment assets are allocated to

the geographic segments based on where the assets are located.

Segmental liabilities

All operating liabilities of segments principally comprise accounts payable, amounts due to contract customers, subcontractor

liabilities and external interest bearing borrowings. Bank overdrafts and taxation balances are excluded.

Discontinued operations

Discontinued operations in the current year comprise the Murray & Roberts Pty Ltd and its subsidiaries Clough Limited (“Clough”)

and RUC Cementation Mining Contractors (“RUC”), Insig, Middle East Operations, businesses included within the previous Southern

Africa Infrastructure & Buildings Platform and the Genrec Operations.:
