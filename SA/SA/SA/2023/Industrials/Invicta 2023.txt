GENERAL

It is common cause that South Africa’s economy is facing

mounting economic and social challenges. One can easily

be disheartened by reports, such as the IMF Press Release of

23/198, highlighting that growth moderated from 4.9% in 2021 to

2% in 2022 as our country, still recovering from the impact of the

Covid-Pandemic, was severely impacted by Russia’s war in the

Ukraine, global monetary policy tightening, severe floods, social

unrest and an unprecedented energy crisis. The rest of the world

was, however, also confronted with severe economic challenges

and geopolitical headwinds which impacted our country and our

businesses.

I am therefore extremely proud of the resilience that our

people and the Invicta business showed in the face of all these

challenges and of the excellent financial results that the Group

delivered.

PERFORMANCE

The Group delivered a strong performance during FY 2023,

despite the extremely difficult global trading environment. Given

the restructuring of the Group’s operations over the last two

years, I believe that earnings per share (EPS) is a good measure

of the financial performance of the business during this period.

I am proud to report that Invicta’s basic EPS grew by 18%, from

408 to 481 cents. The Group also generated R642m of cash from

operations.

The strong financial position of the group, and a scarcity of

appropriately priced acquisition opportunities, have prompted

us to use available capital to repurchase R165 million worth of

ordinary and R36 million worth of preference shares, to increase

the dividend per share by 11% from 90 to 100 cents, and to

maintain appropriate inventory levels to serve our customers

particularly given global supply chain problems.

The persisting macro and geopolitical global challenges resulted

in rising global inflation and increases in borrowing costs. We will

therefore, as in previous periods, continue to focus on reducing

the Group’s net debt position. Conservative debt levels will

enable management to strategically respond to market and

macro-economic developments, whilst allowing for flexibility to

execute on the Group’s acquisition strategy for value enhancing

opportunities.

On the investment front, the Group invested an initial

USD2.5 million for a 40% share in a trading platform in a Chinese

industrial consumable parts business.

OUTLOOK

Our objective is to grow a diversified sustainable replacements

parts group, which provides above market returns to our

shareholders. Our objective over the next three years, is to

have established a geographical and sectorial diverse group,

with 50% of the Group’s income from abroad. This objective

requires management to continuously review, and if required,

restructure our existing businesses to ensure that we achieve

the desired returns, whilst remaining alert to possible acquisition

opportunities. The Group remains focused on execution,

managing what we can control and delivering to our customers

at all times.

The Group’s replacement parts businesses have proven to

be very resilient within the sectors that we operate and has

generated strong operational cash. We have positioned the

Group for growth, to run efficiently and to generate good

cashflow. We are accordingly cautiously optimistic about the

2024 year for our Group.

LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS Cont.

CLOSE

On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our gratitude to

the management of our businesses for their commitment in

managing the business operations in very challenging times.

The same applies to our loyal and hard-working employees for

their efforts during the year.

We also thank Steven and his executive team for navigating the

business during the unprecedented challenges of the last few

years, which included the impact of Covid-19, the Russian war,

severe supply chain disruptions, floods, social unrest, a power

crisis and a generally unfavourable economic environment.

I would like to thank my fellow directors for their contribution,

energy and commitment to oversight and governance at

Invicta. Gavin Pelser retired as an executive director with effect

from 31 March 2023. Gavin has been with the Group for many

years and has been an integral part of its growth. I would like to

acknowledge the immense contribution that he has made to

Invicta, but am delighted to confirm that Gavin will continue to

assist Invicta as a consultant responsible for specific projects.

As I remarked previously, the key to any business’s success is

dependent on the quality, efforts and loyalty of the people in the

organisation and its partners.

Lastly, to our suppliers, shareholders and customers thank you

for your support.

I wish you all a successful and prosperous year ahead.

Dr Christo Wiese
