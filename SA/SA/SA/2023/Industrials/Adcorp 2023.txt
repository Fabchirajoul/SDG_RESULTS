Managing Director: Training

Appointed: Managing

letter terms,

audit plan, including the materiality levels proposed, and

budgeted audit fees for the year under review. There is

a formal procedure and policy that governs the process

whereby the auditor is considered for non-audit services.

The committee continuously assesses the impact of

the overall audit professional environment and current

challenges. The external auditor shared their significant

risk and focus areas and responses thereto. The committee

thus satisfied itself of the continued independence and

competence of the auditor.

Financial statements and accounting policies

The committee has assessed the Group accounting

policies and the consolidated financial statements for

the year ended 28 February 2023 and is satisfied that

they are appropriate and comply in all respects with the

Companies Act, IFRS and the JSE Listings Requirements

together with consideration of the findings from the JSE

proactive monitoring of financial statements in 2022.

The committee confirmed that no reportable irregularities

were identified and reported by the external auditors

in terms of the Auditing Profession Act 26 of 2005. The

committee did not receive any complaints relating to

the accounting practices, internal audit, the content

or auditing of the group’s audited consolidated annual

financial statements, the internal financial controls of the

Group or any related matters.

The committee supports the opinion of the Board and the

external auditor with regard to the consolidated financial

statements, which have been approved by the Board

and will be presented to shareholders at the AGM to be

held on 27 July 2023.

Based on the information and explanations given

by directors, the internal and external auditors, the

committee believes that the accounting and internal

controls, including the internal financial controls, are

adequate and that the financial records may be relied

upon for preparing the consolidated financial statements

in accordance with IFRS and maintaining accountability

for the Group assets and liabilities.

Governance of risk

The

committee

is

responsible

for

overseeing

the

governance of risk across the group. During the year,

the committee revisited the risk management framework

and determined how to ensure effective cascading

of integrated assurance across the various Board

committees.

Nothing has come to the committee’s attention to

indicate that any material breakdown in the functioning

of internal controls resulting in a material loss to the Group

has occurred during the year and up to the date of this

report.

Internal audit

The internal audit function outsourced to Ernst & Young

reviews and provides assurance on the adequacy and

effectiveness of internal controls and internal financial

controls.

During the year under review, the committee:

● Reviewed and approved the annual internal audit

coverage plan;

● Evaluated the independence, effectiveness and

performance of the internal audit function in terms of its

scope, execution of its plan, coverage, independence,

skills, resourcing, overall performance and position

within the organisation and found it to be satisfactory;

● Considered the internal audit reports on the group’s

systems of internal controls, including financial controls

and accounting records;

● Reviewed significant issues raised by the internal audit

processes and the adequacy of corrective action in

response to internal audit findings and considered

management’s responses to adverse internal audit

findings;

● Met

with

the

internal

audit

independently

of

management; and

● Assessed the adequacy of the performance of the

internal audit function and found it to be satisfactory.

CEO and CFO responsibility statement

The

committee

evaluated

the

CEO

and

CFO’s

responsibility statement on the consolidated financial

statements and internal financial controls as required by

the JSE Listings Requirements as set out in the consolidated

financial statements.

The CEO and CFO reviewed the controls over financial

reporting and presented the findings to the committee.

Based

on

this

evaluation

management

identified

certain deficiencies, including the tax accounting for

the African operation, which were largely mitigated by

compensating controls and did not lead to any material

concerns with the financial reporting process.

A remediation plan has been developed by management

to address control deficiencies as part of the group’s

ongoing journey towards strengthening the internal

controls related to financial reporting, especially as it

relates to control improvements associated with control

disciplines and the implementation of a new universal

ERP system.

The

committee

received

an

update

on

the

implementation of the risk and control matrices and

discussed managements conclusion and believe the

internal controls can be relied upon as a reasonable basis

for the preparation of the financial statements.:
