In 2023, scheduled Remco meetings were held on 17 March and 10 November, with two additional special meetings on 6 July and 12 October. The special

meetings were all called for the approval of the wage negotiations mandate.

Key managers and executives are invited to attend Remco meetings, on an “as and when appropriate” basis. Management who are invited to attend Remco

meetings do not participate in meeting votes as invitees, and are recused when their remuneration is discussed.

Remco responsibilities and focus areas

The Remco is a sub-committee of the Board of the Company (the “Board”)

with delegated authority. Hulamin’s remuneration policy is reviewed

annually by the Remco and submitted for approval by the Board. The

Remco responsibilities and actions are set out and governed in its terms

of reference, read together with Hulamin’s remuneration policy and other

applicable documents.

The Remco meets at least three times per annum.

The Remco members and their meeting attendance record for FY23 is
