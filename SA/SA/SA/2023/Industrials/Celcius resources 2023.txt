LETTER

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

It has been a challenging year for us as Celsius Resources Limited underwent major changes at the Board level to ensure the

Company’s sustainability. The passing of our colleague and former Chairman, Martin Buckingham, was a game changer. Peter and I

have taken on the reins of the Company to continue what Martin has started and to transform our shared vision into reality.

The addition of Paul Dudley and Attilenore Manero, whose deep experience, expertise, and diverse perspectives have complemented

the existing Board skill sets as we strive to come up with the most appropriate strategies and deliver results for the Company and our

shareholders.

We have listed on AIM, a market operated by the London Stock Exchange in January 2023, to encourage more institutional investors

to support current and future developments for the Company’s portfolio of assets into operating mines. In parallel, we have launched

direct marketing and communications campaigns to prospective institutions for this purpose. As a result, we have received strong

interest from several institutions to develop the MCB, Sagay, and Opuwo projects. We were also able to raise A$14,193,361 as

working capital to finance the development of our flagship Maalinao-Caigutan-Biyog Project in the Philippines as well as the Opuwo

Project in Namibia.

For this period, we have achieved several milestones in advancing our copper-gold assets in the Philippines through the concerted

efforts and perseverance of our in-country teams.

Foremost is the signing of the agreement with the Balatoc Indigenous Cultural Community through a free, prior and informed consent

process as a demonstration of our commitment to abide by and respect the customary laws and traditions of the community in all

aspects of our engagements.

Another milestone is the issuance of the Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) signifying that we have complied with all the

national government requirements in accordance with an approved environmental plan and that the MCB Project will not cause

significant negative environmental impact. We are the first mining company in the Philippines with a voluntary supplemental

agreement for sustainable mining development and management over and above the standard ECC requirements which is focused

on four key result areas: 1) Water and Environment; 2) Noise Pollution and Waste Management; 3) Power Management and Carbon

Sequestration Program; and 4) Social Development and Community Resilience.

Most recently, our MCB Project received the approval for its Declaration of Mining Project Feasibility (DMPF) from the national

government proclaiming the feasibility of commercial utilisation of the minerals in the tenement area by internationally accepted

sound mining practices, socially acceptable, environmentally safe, and economically sound methods as specified in the Mining Project

Feasibility Study and supported by other requirements as prescribed in the Philippine mining laws, rules and regulations.

We have been working closely with the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Mines and Geosciences

Bureau to fast-track the approval of the Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA), the final outstanding mining permit for the

MCB Project which we envisaged to receive within the coming months. This will pave the way for the development of MCB Project

which will bring about transformative change in the communities we work with as partners.

Our Sagay Copper-Gold and Opuwo Cobalt-Copper Projects have also progressed to capitalise on the surging investor interest in

battery metals and the clean energy transition.

I personally want to recognise the contribution of our dedicated colleagues for their commitment and hard work in pushing our

projects forward. I also want to thank our stakeholders in the national and local governments for their guidance and support as we

affirm our commitment to go ‘beyond regulatory compliance’. Our gratitude also to our host communities, particularly, the Balatoc

Indigenous Cultural Community for their trust and confidence that we can bring these projects to fruition.

Lastly, we thank you, our fellow shareholders, for your trust, patience, support, and candid feedback as we navigate the challenges

and overcome hurdles of the past year. We will continue to seek opportunities to drive the Company forward as we do our best to

come up with a strong Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) performance to enhance shareholder value and investor

confidence.

We remain confident and committed to developing these projects into responsible operating mines that would create significant

value for both our shareholders and stakeholders alike.

Yours faithfully,

Atty. Julito ‘Sarge’ R. Sarmiento
