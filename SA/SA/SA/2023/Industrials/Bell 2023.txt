Dear shareholders,

I am pleased to present the committee report for the year ended 31 December 2023.

The committee’s terms of reference detail its composition, functioning and duties in terms of the Companies Act, the JSE

Listings Requirements and King IV, as well as responsibilities allocated to it by the board. The board approved terms of

reference are annually reviewed for relevance.

This report should be read together with the corporate governance report on page 71, the stakeholder engagement report on

page 60 and the sustainability report on page 44 which reports will provide stakeholders with a comprehensive review of how

the group creates sustainable value.

The group is committed to endorsing the 10 principles set out in the United Nations Global Compact Principles (‘UN Compact’),

advocated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labour Organisation.:

letter of representation to participate in the AGM, in the manner

stipulated in their custody agreement. These instructions must be provided to the CSDP or

broker by the cut off time and date advised by the CSDP or broker, to accommodate such

requests.

Each Participant, who has delivered the Form duly completed together with the relevant

documentation referred to in that Form, will be verified by TMS (in correspondence with the

company and, in particular, the transfer secretaries, JSE Investor Services Proprietary Limited

(‘JIS’) to validate each such Participant’s entitlement to participate in and/or vote at the

AGM, before providing it with the necessary means to access the AGM and/or the associated

voting platform.

JIS will also act as the scrutineer to vet all proxy forms submitted and to advise the chairman of

the AGM as to any proxies to reject.

If any of the documents referred to in the Form are not delivered to TMS, or if the Form has

not been duly completed, then it will not be possible for TMS to complete the verification and

accordingly the Participant in question will not be furnished with the unique link to participate

at the AGM, unless and until the Form is duly completed and the requisite documentation has

been delivered. TMS will contact any shareholder if the Form which is delivered is not properly

completed or the requisite documentation has not been delivered with the Form.

Participants, once verified, will be contacted by TMS between Monday, 27 May 2024 and

Thursday, 30 May 2024 via the email/cell number provided on the Form, with a unique link to

allow them to participate in the AGM. Once the Participant has received the unique link, the

onus to safeguard this information rests with the Participant. The Participant is not permitted

to make this unique link available to anyone else. Only the Participant as verified is permitted

to use the unique link.

Aside from the costs incurred by the company as a result of retaining the services of TMS

including making the interactive platform available, shareholders will be liable for their own

charges in relation to electronic Participation at the AGM. Any such charges will not be for the

account of the JSE, Bell Equipment, JIS and/or TMS.

None of the JSE, Bell Equipment, JIS or TMS can be held accountable in the case of loss of

network connectivity or other network failure due to insufficient airtime, internet connectivity,

internet bandwidth and/or power outages which prevents any shareholder from participating

in and/or voting at the AGM.

Participants are strongly encouraged to have a stable internet connection with sufficient

bandwidth capabilities to participate in the AGM. Participants are strongly encouraged

to submit their proxies beforehand, even if they intend to attend the AGM, to ensure that

their votes are counted in the event of any delays or disruptions to the Participant’s network

connectivity and/or loss of network connectivity by such Participant during any part of the

AGM.

Verification

In accordance with Section 63(1) of the Companies Act, before any person may attend

or participate in any meeting (including the AGM), that person must present reasonably

satisfactory identification. Without limiting the generality hereof, the company will accept a

valid South African identity document, a valid driver’s licence or a valid passport which reflects

the name of the shareholder as it appears on the register, as satisfactory identification. In the

case of a proxy, the company will accept a valid South African identity document, a valid

driver’s licence or a valid passport which reflects the name of the proxy as it appears on the

form of proxy, as satisfactory identification.
