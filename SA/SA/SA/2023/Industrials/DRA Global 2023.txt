Managing Director. Mr

Charles Pettit was appointed as Non-Executive Director in

July 2023, while Ms Lindiwe Mthimunye and Mr Valentine

Coetzee were appointed Non-Executive Directors in

October 2023. Mr Darren Naylor was appointed Executive

Director in October 2023. Mr Coetzee has since transitioned

to Executive Director to head up the Group’s process and

technology activities.

Ms Mthimunye was also appointed as Chair of the Audit and

Risk Committee, bringing extensive experience and skills in

governance, finance and business to the role.

I was appointed a Non-Executive Director and Chairman

in October 2023. My first encounter with DRA was in the

mid 1990’s at which time it was a relatively small scale

but impressive organisation servicing the mining sector in

South Africa. It has since grown to be a highly regarded

international service provider with over 4,200 employees

operating worldwide. I’m now privileged to be part of

a dynamic, global organisation, backed by 40 years of

operational excellence, and very much look forward to

leading DRA as Chairman.

CHAIR’S REVIEW

On behalf of DRA Global Limited (DRA) Directors, I am

pleased to present the Company’s Annual Report for the

year ended 31 December 2023.

I would like to acknowledge and commend the leadership

team and the many thousand employees worldwide for

their dedication and efforts in achieving impressive financial

results and strong operating outcomes for the year ended

31 December 2023.

Despite ongoing uncertainties in the global economy, DRA

has successfully demonstrated its ongoing commitment

towards creating sustainable long-term value, with a

continued focus on financial discipline.

DRA recorded a net profit after tax of $21.8 million in FY23

versus a loss of $21.4 million in the previous year. After

several years of no dividend returns for shareholders, your

Directors are delighted to declare a dividend of 11 cents per

share which represents 30 per cent of the 2023 full year net

profit after tax.

My first encounter with DRA was in the

mid 1990’s at which time it was a relatively

small scale but impressive organisation

servicing the mining sector in South Africa.

It has since grown to be a highly regarded

international service provider with over

4,200 employees operating worldwide.

I’m now privileged to be part of a dynamic,

global organisation, backed by 40 years of

operational excellence, and very much look

forward to leading DRA as Chairman.

I would like to acknowledge Mr Peter Mansell, Mr Jonathan

Velloza, Mr Paul Lombard, Mr Les Guthrie and Mrs Sandra

Bell, who resigned from their respective positions on

the Board in October 2023, for their contribution to the

Company during their tenure.

LOOKING AHEAD

In the near term, DRA faces market fluidity due to anticipated

commodity price volatility, especially in nickel, lithium, and

PGM markets. Challenges include possible slowdown in

Chinese demand for minerals and global geopolitical tensions.

However, investments in critical minerals, driven by initiatives

such as the US Inflation Reduction Act and EU Critical

Minerals Act, should positively impact capital expenditure

within the minerals sector providing a flow on affect for

demand of DRA services.

Australia and America are rich with critical minerals and

the business units located in those regions are expected to

drive the majority of growth in revenue and business activity

for the Group.

Competition for skilled talent remains high into 2024 and the

Group remains committed to being an employer of choice

within all its business units.

In 2024, DRA will continue to pursue profitable growth across

all operations and business units, with initiatives targeting

improved employee retention, broader regional growth

opportunities, investment in innovation and ensuring the

ongoing delivery of high-quality services to our clients.

Once again, I want to thank our leadership team and all

employees worldwide for their hard work and commitment

throughout 2023. I would also like to extend my thanks to all

clients, partners and suppliers for entrusting us to be their

global partner.

On behalf of your Board of Directors, I express appreciation

to our shareholders for their continued support, and I look

forward to connecting with you at the Annual General

Meeting in May 2024.

Finally, I must also thank my fellow Directors for their ongoing

support, cooperation and diligent uptake of all matters DRA

without which the seamless transition of Board changes could

not have occurred.

Managing Director and CEO of DRA, served on DRA and other

defendants an Originating Application for proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia. The proceedings are against the Company,

the then current Board of Directors, some members of management and another respondent. The total value of the claims have

not yet been fully quantified but, among other claims in respect of contraventions of the Fair Work Act, Australian Consumer Law

and the Corporations Act, includes claims for breaches of Mr Naudé’s contract of employment causing a loss of present and

future income under that contract.

If the proceedings commenced by Mr Naudé continue to trial then, depending upon the findings in the judgements after trial

(and any appeals), a final award in favour of Mr Naudé may adversely impact DRA’s financial and operational performance.

On 20 September 2023, DRA commenced separate proceedings against Mr Naudé. The proceedings brought by DRA concerns

alleged conduct by Mr Naudé stretching back several years and includes events occurring in the United Kingdom and South Africa.

DRA has incurred, and is likely to incur additional, significant legal costs in these proceedings (whether or not DRA is

ultimately successful).

Listed shares

Fair value was calculated using the quoted closing share price as at the reporting date (level 1 in fair value hierarchy).

Upside Participation Rights (UPRs)

The fair value was calculated using an option pricing model with reference to the Company’s share price. The model took into

consideration that the holder of the UPRs had the right to the upside between the strike price ($3.10) and the cap ($6.50), such

that the payoff to the holder was capped at $3.40 (level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). The UPRs expired at 31 December 2023

with the share price below the strike price.

There were no transfers between levels during the financial year ended 31 December 2023.

NOTE 28. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Group has commitments and contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. These include performance guarantees

and letters of credit in respect of contractual performance obligations, litigation and claims in relation to projects.

These types of matters could result in various forms of cash outflows, including compensation by way of awards of damages or

cost reimbursement, as well as tax expenses, fines, penalties and other forms of cash outflows.

The Directors consider that it is not probable that the outcome of any individual matter will have a material adverse effect on the

net earnings or cash flows in any particular reporting period, other than where expressly stipulated below.

In performing this assessment, the Directors considered the nature of existing litigation or claims, the progress of matters,

existing law and precedent, the opinions and views of legal counsel and other advisors, the Group’s experience in similar cases

(where applicable), the experience of other companies, and other facts available to the Group at the time of assessment. The

Directors’ assessment of these factors may change over time as individual litigation or claims progress. Where it is considered

disclosure could prejudice the Group’s position in a dispute, as per the accounting standards, only the general nature of the

dispute has been disclosed below.

(I) GUARANTEES

The Group is, in the normal course of business, required to provide guarantees and letters of credit on behalf of controlled

entities, associates and related parties in respect of their contractual performance obligations. These guarantees and letters of

credit only give rise to a liability where the entity concerned fails to perform its contractual obligation. The bank guarantees

outstanding at balance date in respect of contractual performance was $12,882K (FY22: $9,661K).
