About this

report:

letter

30 April 2024

There remains a heightened demand for private

education in South Africa and in the rest of Africa,

and we were encouraged by the exceptional

enrolment figures experienced during the year.

This demand, coupled with our value proposition,

prudent financial management and strategic

investments, has resulted in ADvTECH maintaining

a strong financial position as discussed in the chief

executive officer’s and group commercial director’s

reports on page 31.

Having considered the group’s sound balance sheet,

strong cash generation and excellent enrolments for

2024, the board has declared a final dividend of 57.0

cents per share. Together with the interim dividend

of 30 cents per share, the full year’s dividend is

87 cents per share (2022: 60 cents per share).

Recognising the importance of technology in

modern education, ADvTECH continued to make

strategic investments in cutting-edge technological

solutions, such as ADvLEARN, our unique digital

learning platform, across grades 7 to12 (page 53),

that has enhanced the overall learning experience for

our students. Following ADvLEARN’s success in

South Africa, we look forward to rolling out this

innovative platform to ADvTECH Schools across

the rest of Africa during 2024. Our commitment

to staying at the forefront of educational technology

positions ADvTECH as a leader in the digital

evolution of education.

ADvTECH remains committed to sustainability,

not only with regard to the financial sustainability

of the group but across all facets of our operations

as our ESG journey evolves. As part of our ESG

journey, we have published a separate sustainability

report (www.advtech.co.za) that focuses on specific

themes: academic excellence, research, campuses,

stakeholder engagement and feedback. Our

sustainability report also demonstrates, to all

stakeholders, how our activities impact

broader society.

While our most significant sustainability impact is

from a social perspective through our academic

offering, where we incorporate various sustainability

elements within our curricula, we continue to take

steps to minimise our operational environmental

impact, and to promote sustainable practices within

our campuses. Our sustainability initiatives align

with our broader mission of preparing students not

only for academic success but also for responsible

citizenship in a rapidly changing world.

ADvTECH has also intensified efforts to foster

inclusivity and diversity within our educational

communities. We believe that a diverse and

inclusive learning environment enriches the

educational experience and prepares our students

for the complexities of a globalised society. Our

respect, diversity and inclusion programme, which

commenced in 2020, continues to gain traction at

our schools and we will also be implementing this

programme in our early childhood development

(ECD) curriculum.

Effective and ethical corporate governance

continues to underpin our group. While there were

no changes to the board during 2023, there will be

changes to our leadership in 2024. Our CEO, Roy

Douglas, retired as CEO at the end of February 2024.

Roy remained with the group for a suitable period

of time after he stepped down from the board to

ensure a seamless handover. Roy has successfully

led the group in its expansion strategy during his

tenure, resulting in ADvTECH becoming the leading

private education and recruitment group across the

continent. He has refocused the educational division

brand portfolios into well-positioned brands with

distinct value offerings. This, together with a focus

on effectiveness and efficiencies, resulted in a solid

competitive advantage, and an agile and adaptive

business model. Also noteworthy is his leadership

through the COVID-19 pandemic during which the

group remained responsive to a dynamic

environment, where more than 70 000 students

were seamlessly transitioned to an online

environment. He leaves ADvTECH in a strong

position to continue its growth trajectory. The board

thanks Roy for his invaluable contribution during his

tenure as CEO of the ADvTECH group and wishes

him well in his retirement.

The board was excited to announce the

appointment of Geoff Whyte as Group CEO and

Executive Director with effect from 1 March 2024.

Geoff holds a master’s degree in economics from

the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, and has more

than 30 years’ experience across various industries.

He is a commercially focused business leader with

executive experience in global organisations

including Unilever, PepsiCo, Cadbury Schweppes,

SABMiller and Nando’s. He has a record of success in

a wide variety of geographies including South Africa,

the UK, the USA, the Netherlands, the rest of Africa,

the Middle East and sub-continental India. He is also

an active member of the South African business

community. We are confident that Geoff’s track

record and experience will enable him to build on the

group’s successes.

I will be stepping down as ADvTECH’s chairman at

the upcoming annual general meeting on 5 June

2024 and I will be passing the chairmanship baton

over to Professor Alex Watson, who joined the group

in 2022. During my tenure, I have been inspired by

the group’s profound impact on the lives of our

students and by its visionary leadership, innovation,

inclusivity and academic excellence as well as its

significant growth and expansion in the rest of Africa.

Thanks to my fellow board members for their support

and guidance during my chairmanship and I wish

Professor Alex Watson all the best in her new

leadership role.

I would also like to express my gratitude to our

dedicated educators, employees and leadership team

for their exceptional efforts through the past year and

during my tenure. Their resilience and commitment

have been instrumental in navigating challenges and

ensuring ADvTECH’s continued success. Thank you to

all our stakeholders for their continued support and

engagement.

ADvTECH remains at the forefront of shaping the

future of education. As the group embarks on its next

chapter, I am confident that ADvTECH will continue to

thrive and leave a lasting impact on the education

landscape.

Sincerely,: Dear shareholders

Welcome to our annual integrated report for the year

ended 31 December 2023.

As I reflect on the past year, it is clear to me that

ADvTECH has continued to make significant strides in

the education sector, demonstrating resilience,

innovation, and a steadfast commitment to academic

excellence and delivering value to our customers.

Despite constrained growth in South Africa the

Resourcing Division’s strategy to expand into the rest

of Africa continues to bear fruit.

The macro-economic environment continued to pose

challenges as global GDP growth remains sluggish and

we experienced escalating interest rates and elevated

unemployment levels in South Africa, all of which persist

in exerting financial strain on our customers. Continuing

corruption and the challenges faced by state-owned

enterprises, notably Eskom and Transnet, in ensuring a

reliable electricity supply and the efficient import and

export of goods, further impede economic expansion.

The projected GDP growth in certain parts of the

rest of Africa is more encouraging and ADvTECH looks

forward to expanding in these markets in line with our

growth strategy into the rest of Africa.

VALUES

The group’s values encapsulate our work ethic and are

communicated to all employees during induction and are

emphasised regularly.

Board gender and diversity

ADvTECH’s board has adopted a diversity policy which

focuses on broader diversity attributes at board level and

which policy sets voluntary targets of 50% black and 50%

female representation.

At present, three of the 10 directors are female (30%) and

three of the 10 directors are persons of colour (30%). The

board, with the assistance of NomCom, regularly reviews

its gender and diversity targets and remains committed

towards striving to achieve these targets.

Independence

An evaluation of the independence of the board is

conducted on an annual basis. MM Nkosi and DL Smith,

his alternate director, are not classified as independent

due to their employment as executives at a shareholder

of the company. The board is satisfied that the majority

of non-executive directors are independent and

exercise objective, unfettered judgement and

independence of mind.
