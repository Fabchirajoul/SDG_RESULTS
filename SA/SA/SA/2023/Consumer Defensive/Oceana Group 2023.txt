DEAR SHAREHOLDERS

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Oceana Group Limited’s 2023 Remuneration Report.

During the year under review, we have continued our journey to ensure a “fit-for-purpose” remuneration structure to drive

and achieve the Group’s short-to-long-term objectives. In FY2022, we introduced a new Long-term Incentive (LTI) plan whereby

Deferred Bonus Shares and Performance Shares are awarded to Executives, replacing the previous LTI 2013 plan. On the Short-

Term Incentive (STI) plan, Bowmans conducted a detailed review of the performance measures to ensure alignment with the

Group’s strategic objectives. Minor amendments were recommended to the REMCOM and were subsequently approved for

implementation in FY2024. Further details of the review and approval outcomes are noted in Section B of the Remuneration report.

The Group delivered a strong financial performance in a tough and volatile environment which is a testament to the resilience

of our people. Group turnover increased by 22.6%, with operating profit having increased by 19.8% and dividends per share by

25.7%. Against this backdrop, we have managed to achieve our STI targets and will therefore be paying an STI to participants

of the plan. See below an overview of the financial performance at Group level that relates to the STI plan for FY2023:

LTI awards made under the LTI 2013 plan with no performance conditions (i.e restricted shares) have vested. LTI awards with

performance conditions, namely performance shares, vested during the year under review in line with the Total Shareholder

Return (TSR) outcomes. The 1st tranche of the transition replacement performance shares (RPS) marginally met the performance

condition which resulted in a 10% vesting achievement. The remaining portion of the 1st tranche of the award was lapsed

and conditionally forfeited. Further details of the share awards that vested during FY2023 are disclosed in Section C of the

Remuneration Report.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE (REMCOM) GOVERNANCE

In line with best practice standards, the REMCOM is appointed by the Board and has delegated authority, in accordance with its

Terms of Reference. Refer to page 33 for REMCOM members and review our charter at https://www.oceana.co.za/governance-

board-and-committee-charters. The Terms of Reference sets out an appropriate remuneration policy, upon which implementation

is aligned with the principles of fair, transparent and responsible remuneration, legislative and regulatory requirements, as

well as the needs of the Group. The remuneration policy includes remuneration at all levels, including Executive Directors.

In line with the Group’s three-year transitionary succession plan, Thoko Mokgosi-Mwantembe was appointed

as the REMCOM Chairperson, replacing Peter De Beyer on 6 April 2023. Peter de Beyer will stay on as a member

of the Remuneration Committee until such time as he steps down as a non-executive director of the Board.

To assist REMCOM with the execution of its mandate, the CEO, Company Secretary, Deputy Company Secretary,

Chief People Officer (“CPO”) and Group Reward Executive attend meetings of REMCOM by invitation. They are

not present when their remuneration is discussed and hold no voting powers. Similarly, the REMCOM do not

decide on their own remuneration. As the REMCOM, it is our responsibility to ensure that responsible governance

practices have been implemented and to provide a clear understanding of our Remuneration Policy. We have

carefully reviewed the Group’s Remuneration Policy and ensured that the remuneration practices are aligned

with the policy objectives.

The Committee is satisfied that our current Remuneration Policy is still relevant and has thus agreed that the

reward framework will remain in place.

OVERVIEW OF VOTING OUTCOMES AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

At the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) held on 6 April 2023, the Remuneration Policy and Implementation

Report received support, with 80.72% and 83.09% of shareholders voting in favour respectively.

Below is an overview of the voting outcomes at the AGMs for the past three years. We have gained support

from our shareholders and met the required 75% threshold.

No material concerns were raised by our shareholders at the previous AGM. The Group will endeavour to address

any concerns raised should they arise in future.

In line with King IV™ and the JSE Listings Requirements, the remuneration policy together with the implementation

report (Section C) will be tabled for two separate non-binding advisory votes by shareholders present or

represented by proxy at the AGM. If the Remuneration Policy or the Implementation Report of the Company is voted

against by 25% or more of the voting rights exercised on the resolutions by shareholders present or represented

by proxy at the AGM, the Company will in its voting results announcement pursuant to paragraph 3.91 of the

JSE Listings Requirements extend an invitation to dissenting shareholders to engage with the Company to

discuss their reasons for their dissenting votes; and the manner and timing of such engagement will be specified

in the SENS announcement following the AGM.
