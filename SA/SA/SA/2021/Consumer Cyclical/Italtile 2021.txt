Supply chain

Supply chain business (Cedar Point, ITD and DC) sales

were 42% higher than the prior year. The sales increases

of the different businesses during the period were as

follows:

• ITD: 33%

• Cedar Point: 42%

• DC: 47%

Sales grew by 37.5% on those recorded in the 2019

increased shipping costs (particularly Rand weakness

were staggered throughout the period having a mixed

impact on margins from a timing perspective.

Full sales growth potential was not realised during the

inventory due to foreign supply and port delays (the

business critical in-stock positions of ITD and Cedar

Point in particular being negatively impacted). Delayed

shipments were received from the third quarter and

as a result, sales growth accelerated from that point

(particularly for DC). An improvement in global supply

chains is not expected for some time, and the Group

has accordingly increased import volumes to cater for

such (see inventory section on page 62), and where

possible local supply is being actively pursued.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing sales (aggregation of Ceramic Industries,

Ezee Tile and PiViCal Panels) for the period increased

by 35% compared to the prior year. As detailed above,

this increase in sales has been driven by a surge in

retail demand (both by the Group’s stores and industry

competitors), but certain of the factories have also
