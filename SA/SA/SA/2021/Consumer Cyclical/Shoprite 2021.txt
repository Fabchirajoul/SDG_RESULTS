SHOPRITE HOLDINGS LTD Integrated Annual Report 2021:

letter or early

tested over the shortened performance period in the event

of death and an employer company ceasing to be part of the

Group. Where the performance condition has to be reviewed

before the end of the performance period, the RemCo will

have regard to the results of the previous financial year.

4)

The definition of “control” has been redrafted to align with

International Financial Reporting Standard 10.

5)

Awards made in terms of the new rules will be subject to

malus and clawback based on the Company’s malus and

clawback policy. Malus is now incorporated into the Rules.

Clawback, as it refers to awards that have already been

settled and have vested in terms of the new rules, will be

regulated by the malus and clawback policy, not within the

new rules.

6)

The new rules specify that no shares intended for use in the

settlement of awards in terms of the ESP may be purchased

during a prohibited period unless a purchase programme

is in place. The new rules also provide that, in the event

where shares are purchased during a prohibited period in

accordance with the provisions of a purchase programme, an

announcement must be made pursuant to paragraphs 3.63–

3.74 of the Listing Requirements.

Termination of employment 14.1(h)

Resignation, dismissal, dismissal based on operational

requirements, early retirement and abscondment

Participants terminating employment owing to resignation, lawful

dismissal from the employ of the Company in compliance with

the provisions of the Labour Relations Act (including operational

requirements), early retirement or the employee absconding will

forfeit all unvested awards.

Death

Upon the termination of a participant’s employment owing to

the participant’s death, all of the participant’s unvested retention

shares and co-investment shares will vest in full, subject to (in the

instance of co-investment shares) the fulfilment of the additional

vesting condition until the date of termination of employment.

Upon the termination of a participant’s employment owing to

the participant’s death, a pro-rated portion of the participant’s

performance shares will vest. This portion will be determined

according to the extent to which the performance conditions have

been met and the number of months in employment from the

award date to the date of termination of employment, relative to

the total number of months in the vesting period.

Employer company ceasing to be a member of the Group

Where a participant’s employment terminates owing to the

employer company ceasing to be a member of the Group,

a portion of the participant’s unvested awards will vest.

For unvested awards at the time of termination of employment,

the vesting of the unvested awards will be on the date of

termination of employment or on a date as soon as practical

after the date of termination of employment. The portion of the

retention shares and co-investment shares which will vest on

date of termination of employment will be determined based on

the number of complete months served since the award date to

the date of termination of employment, over the total number of

months in the vesting period. The vesting of the relevant portion of

the co-investment shares will in addition be subject to the fulfilment

of the additional vesting condition until the date of termination of

employment.

The extent to which the performance conditions have been

met will determine the number of performance shares to vest.

Such number will further be pro-rated to reflect the number

of months in employment from the award date to the date of

termination of employment, relative to the total number of months

in the vesting period.

Ill health, injury or disability

Where a participant’s employment terminates due to ill health,

injury or disability, there will be no early vesting of retention shares,

co-investment shares or performance shares, and participants

will continue to participate in the plan until the vesting date.

For performance shares, performance will be tested at the end

of the performance period. The extent to which the performance

conditions have been met will determine the number of

performance shares to vest.

On vesting, the RemCo will take into account the number of

months served from the award date to the vesting date and will

accordingly pro-rate the awards.

Retirement

Where a participant’s employment terminates owing to retirement,

the participant’s unvested co-investment shares and retention shares

will vest on the date of termination of employment or on a date as

soon as practical after the date of termination of employment.

With regard to performance shares, there will be no early

vesting and participants will continue to participate in the plan

until the vesting date. Performance will be tested at the end of

the performance period. The extent to which the performance

conditions have been met will determine the number of

performance shares to vest.

The RemCo will take into account the number of months to

be served from the award date to the date of termination of

employment (retirement date) when the award is made and will

accordingly pro-rate the award. As such, no further pro-ration will

occur on vesting.

Mutual separation

Participants terminating employment owing to a mutual separation

agreement will forfeit all unvested awards.

The RemCo may, in its sole discretion, determine that a portion

of the unvested awards may vest based upon the number of

complete months served since the award date to the date of

termination of employment over the total number of months

in the vesting period and adjusted for the extent to which the

performance conditions have been met at the immediately

preceding financial year end.

Performance conditions

The vesting of an award of performance shares will in all instances

be subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions over

the performance period. In the event where the performance

condition has to be reviewed before the end of the performance

period (i.e. termination of employment or on a change of control),

the RemCo will review the performance condition with reference to

the preceding financial year’s results.

Control 14.1(g)

“Control” now means circumstances, as contemplated in

International Financial Reporting Standard 10 and as validated

by the auditors as and when required, where an investor has all

three of the following elements:

a)

Power over the Company

b)

Exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement

with the Company

c)

The ability to use its power over the Company to affect the

amount of the investor’s returns.

Malus and trigger events

In terms of the new rules, malus will apply up to the vesting date.

Clawback will apply subsequent to the vesting date and will be

regulated in terms of the Company’s existing policy in this regard.

The trigger events that could result in malus and clawback being

invoked are contained in the remuneration report.
