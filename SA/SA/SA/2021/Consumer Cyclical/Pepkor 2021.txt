Performance in unusual times

This year, much like 2020, has not been an easy period for

business or our country. As we were recovering from the

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were confronted with

the unfortunate events that transpired during the week of

12 July 2021, when local civil unrest put lives, businesses,

and our economy at risk.

It is always challenging for businesses to navigate their

way through such unforeseen events. Although we secured

as many of our operations as possible, 549 stores were

damaged during the unrest. Our preventative measures

ensured that none of our employees were seriously injured.

We closed more than 1 000 stores on 13 July, to mitigate

damage and losses, and we enhanced our security to protect

our distribution centres (DCs), specifically in Hammarsdale.

Although the event affected our performance negatively,

we are comprehensively insured against material damage

and business interruption. More importantly, our group’s

strong and resilient culture came to our rescue. We retained

2 000 employees while stores were closed, and provided

more than 5 000 food parcels to those whose access to

shops was cut off. Employees across all our brands and

Group Support Services assisted each other, and immediately

commenced with a recover and rebuild operation.

Collectively, we managed to reopen 75% of our looted or

damaged stores by the end of October 2021.

Pepkor’s strategy, and our retail brands’ equity and customer

loyalty have consistently enabled us to gain market share.

Collectively, as a discount and value retail business, we

remain a strong brand of choice.

Our executive management and their operational teams

successfully restored the group to a performance position

similar and better to that of the 2019 financial year.

To support this goal and position the group for future growth,

the board has approved a three-year plan set out against

eight growth drivers. These are discussed in detail in the

Our material matters section of this report. We acknowledge

that it will require considerable effort to achieve our goals,

especially in a market where unemployment, consumer

health and pressure on customer spending add additional

challenges.
