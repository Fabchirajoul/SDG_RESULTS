managing director’s conference, MDs

report their progress on the prior year’s KPIs and set short-term

targets for the year ahead.

The Metair board started a strategy review process in December

2019 with the goal of potentially enhancing shareholder value.

The review concluded that Metair’s two business verticals are in

different strategic positions and that a managed separation of the

two verticals would unlock value for stakeholders. With the arrival

of the COVID-19 pandemic, the strategy review was deferred

to design and implement the COVID-19 response strategy and

to incorporate the views of the new executive and independent

non-executive directors appointed in 2020 and 2021. The strong

performance and quick recovery in the Energy Storage business

during the pandemic, combined with growth opportunities ahead

for the Automotive Components Vertical, provided further impetus

for Metair to refresh its strategic approach around the Energy

Storage Vertical.

Strategic positioning – Automotive Components

Vertical

The outlook for long-term growth in the South African automotive

industry is positive, supported by the Automotive Production and

Development Programme (APDP), global trade dynamics and

OEM manufacturing decisions. Phase II of the APDP came into

effect from July 2021 and provides support and certainty to OEM

manufacturers to 2035. It incentivises B-BBEE and localisation

(sourcing of components made in-country), which favour Metair’s

position. The disruptions since the start of COVID-19 have also

increased OEMs’ focus on simplifying supply chains by sourcing

components close to their manufacturing bases.

All of Metair’s major South African OEM customers are

introducing new models in the next two to five years with some

limited introduction of their NEV technology. The increasing

complexity required in components also increases the technology

requirements and their unit value.

More than 60% of motor vehicle production in South Africa is

exported globally, largely to Europe and the UK. As OEMs focus on

The board reviews and approves all committee charters and terms of reference annually. All charters were updated and approved during the

year. Refer to the specific committee disclosures for more information.

Committees

All committees function according to their board-approved terms of reference or charters which are available on the company’s website at

www.metair.co.za. The terms of reference or charters are reviewed annually and effectively delegated in respect of certain of the board’s

responsibilities. The board monitors these responsibilities to ensure effective oversight and control of the group’s operations.

All committees confirmed that they are satisfied that they appropriately fulfilled their responsibilities in line with their terms of reference or

charters during 2021. The chairpersons of all committees reported to the board after each meeting.

The committees are appropriately constituted to promote independent judgement and to assist with the balance of power. The board appoints

the members of the committees and ensures the correct composition except for the audit and risk committee members who are nominated

by the board and elected by shareholders. Executive directors, management and external advisors attend committee meetings by invitation

except for the social and ethics committee where the CEO is a member and the investment committee where the CFO is a member. The IT

steering committee reports into the audit and risk committee and members are appointed by the chairman of the IT steering committee in his

capacity as executive director of Metair.

Investment committee

Audit and risk committee

The investment committee analyses investment opportunities presented

by executive management. Once the opportunities are approved by the

committee, they are submitted to the board for final approval.

The committee aims to optimise capital allocation in a manner which

sustainably creates and optimises stakeholder value. The committee

weighs and evaluates capital proposals required for operational

capital, strategic capital and shareholder capital, and includes the

review of overall capital levels, individual capital projects, investment

and divestment opportunities, as well as financing proposals by

applying specific, detailed investment criteria.

The committee will also be focusing on post investment review

documents to track performance on previously approved

investments going forward.

The committee does not assume the functions of management,

which remain the responsibility of the executive directors and other

members of senior management. In the execution of their duties,

committee members must apply the standards of conduct of

directors as set out in section 76 of the Companies Act, No. 71 of

2008, as amended (Companies Act) and directors’ personal financial

interests as set out in section 75 of the Act.

The committee is constituted as a statutory committee of Metair

in respect of its statutory duties in terms of section 94(7) of the

Companies Act, the JSE Listings Requirements and in line with the

recommendations of King IV as a committee of the board in respect

of all other duties assigned to it by the board including those normally

performed by an audit and risk committee.

The committee has an independent role and is accountable to the

board and shareholders. The primary objective of the committee is to

assist the board to fulfil its oversight responsibilities for the financial

reporting process, the system of internal control, the audit process,

the risk management process, combined assurance and the group’s

process for monitoring compliance with laws, regulations and the

code of conduct. The committee also sets the policy for the provision

of non-audit services. Non-audit services are reviewed and approved

at each audit and risk committee meeting.

During the year, the committee updated and approved various policies

which were recommended to the board for final approval. These policy

changes were all based on refinements and continuous improvements

as well as new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

The committee does not assume the functions of management, which

remain the responsibility of the executive directors, officers and other

members of senior management.

Disclosure of Metair’s risk management is available on page 74. The

audit and risk committee report, as required in terms of section 94(7)(f)

of the Companies Act, is set out on pages 82 - 83.

The committee comprises three independent non-executive directors

and one executive director.

Although the group owns 74.9% of the majority voting rights in Hesto, the Shareholder’s Agreement stipulates that unanimous

consent is required for all decisions relating to the relevant activities of Hesto. In addition, the minority shareholder also has the

ability, via a currently exercisable and substantive call option, to call the majority shareholding. Therefore, the group accounts for

Hesto under the equity accounting method. Hesto’s results are included within the group’s automotive business vertical (segment

report).

Hesto manufactures and sells automotive wiring harnesses and related components in South Africa. Hesto is a specialist

automotive component manufacturer which provides the group with additional OE product offerings as well being a local product

differentiator. Hesto incurred a R78 million (2020: R21 million) loss after tax mainly due to the impact of global supply chain

disruptions on the business, including significant air-freight and shipping charges to support customers, as well as project costs

incurred on planned new customer models for the future. The investment carrying value (R250 million) was assessed and no

impairments were necessary. The investment is supported by the underlying 5-year business plans, including South Africa OEM

customer volume outlook.

The group’s 35% investment in Romanian Li-ion battery maker, Prime, establishes an incubation, research and development

centre for Li-ion development to accelerate production of Li-ion batteries for the European market.

In the previous year, the group fully impaired the investment in the MOLL group amounting to R108 million.

ABM owns the Chloride and Exide brands for the Kenyan as well as Tanzanian and Ugandan markets. The ABM group is purely

aftermarket and represents significant potential for synergies and technology transfer in maintenance free batteries for

automotive and lithium batteries for solar.:

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates that affect the

application of the group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results

may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.

The judgements, estimates and assumptions that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying

amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

A. Judgements

Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts

recognised in the financial statements include the following:

Revenue recognition

-

Timing of revenue recognition – Whether revenue from the supply of automotive components is recognised over time or at a

point in time; and

-

Whether tooling supply arrangements result in separate performance obligations and should therefore be included within

revenue, on a principal, rather than agent, basis.

Refer to notes 1.2 and accounting policies on revenue for further details.

IFRS 16 – Incremental borrowing rates

The determination of incremental borrowing rates, as set out in the accounting policy note on leases, required management

judgement. Incremental borrowing rates (IBR's) are based on the cost of borrowing from third parties. Borrowing rates readily

observable in the market or available through recent financing are used by group entities as a starting point and adjusted by

margins of between 0.25 to 1 basis points (bps) depending on the size, duration and country of lease. Security provided as well

as the nature of the asset leased is also considered.

B. Assumptions and estimation uncertainties

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at 31 December 2021 that have a risk of resulting in a material

adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year is included in the following notes:

Asset useful lives and residual values (refer to note 7)

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over its useful life taking into account residual values where appropriate. The

actual useful lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors. In

reassessing asset useful lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles/project life and maintenance

programmes are taken into account. Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the

remaining life of the asset and projected disposal values.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (Continued)

Goodwill impairment testing (refer to note 8)

The group tests annually whether goodwill (including indefinite life intangibles) has suffered any impairment, in accordance with

the accounting policy. The recoverable amounts of CGUs have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These

calculations require the use of estimates. Key estimates include growth and discount rates (WACC) applied. Future cash flows

(earnings) expected to be generated by Mutlu and Rombat (CGUs) are projected, taking into account factors such as market

conditions and earnings growth. Sensitivity analyses are also performed.

IFRS 2 - Equity-settled schemes (refer to note 26.1)

IFRS 2 charges, determined by reference to the fair value of options granted, are calculated in terms of the group’s accounting

policy and based on option pricing models for the share option scheme in operation. The charge is based on assumptions applied

at grant date to the valuation models. These include, among others, the risk-free interest rate, Metair share price volatility and

dividend yields.

Fair value determination at grant date includes market performance conditions (such as share price), excludes the impact of any

service and non-market performance vesting conditions (such as employment period conditions and profitability) and includes the

impact of any non-vesting conditions.

At the end of each reporting period, the group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on

the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in

the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

Measurement of expected credit loss (‘ECL’) allowance for trade receivables, contract assets and intercompany loans

(refer to notes 12 and 19.2 B. Credit risk)

IFRS 9 allows a ‘simplified approach’ (one of the three approaches) to determine loss allowances and adopts a ‘life-time’ ECL for

trade receivables (without significant financing components). Essentially IFRS 9 tells us how to create bad debt provisions for

trade receivables using a ‘provision matrix’.

Basically, the calculation of an impairment loss is based on a default rate percentage applied over the life of a group of financial

assets or receivables, from the moment of its origination or acquisition. The definition of ‘default’ should also be consistent with

that used for internal credit risk management.

In using the simplified approach, certain assumptions in determining the weighted-average loss rate was applied. The group also

‘disaggregated’ its debtor’s book into common credit characteristics as well as payment and risk profiles. Some of the

assumptions applied included defining a default base, analysing historical credit losses and the practicalities of applying forward

looking estimates.

The company applied the general approach to estimate ECL for intercompany loans.

Revenue measurement in battery aftermarket arrangements – estimate of variable consideration (refer to note 1.2)

An entity shall include in revenue some or all of an amount of variable consideration, estimated only to the extent that it is highly

probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur, when the uncertainty

associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

In one of the group’s businesses, a supply arrangement exists whereby some independent aftermarket franchises are requested

to supply batteries to other customers. A credit-note (refund) is issued to the specific distributor or franchise for their stock that is

utilised from their inventory holding.

Since the group has an option to redirect the batteries, initially sold to the distributor, a variable consideration constraint exists.

Therefore, the amount of revenue recognised is adjusted for the expected credit notes to be issued, usually indicated by historical

trends and sales forecasts.:

letter of support to Metair Management Services (Pty) Ltd and has subordinated claims against

Automould (Pty) Ltd (refer to note 23). The company also guaranteed funding provided to Hesto (refer to note 10). The RCF

facilities available to SA subsidiaries (refer to note 14) is guaranteed by certain group subsidiaries (‘cross-guarantees’).
