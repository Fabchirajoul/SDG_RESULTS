letter

of appointment setting out the terms of their engagement.

Directors are appointed by the shareholders at the annual

general meeting (AGM) and interim board appointments are

allowed between AGMs. One-third of the longest serving,

non-executive directors are required to retire at each AGM and

may offer themselves for re-election. If recommended by the

directors and supported by the board, the board then proposes

their re-election to shareholders.

Fees

The remuneration of board members is reviewed by the board of

directors and approved and ratified at the AGM. Non-executive

directors receive fixed fees for service on boards and board

committees. This includes a retainer that has been calculated in

line with market practices. There are no contractual

arrangements for compensation for loss of office. Non-executive

directors do not receive short-term incentives, nor do they

participate in any long-term incentive schemes. The fees for

non-executive directors are reviewed on an annual basis to

ensure that such fees at all times remain market-related.

Details of non-executive directors

fees can be found in Annexure C.
