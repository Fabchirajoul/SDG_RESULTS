At Discovery, we think like founders and we seek

disruption as we lead a global transformation in

financial services. Our businesses are built to

disrupt the industries in which we operate, and we

aim to deliver a personalised and integrated

experience to our clients. In doing so, we explore

new ways to connect stakeholders through our

Vitality platform to generate sustainable value.

COVID-19 has accelerated the link between health,

wellness, resilience and mortality through

underlying behavioural drivers of risk. As these

coalesce with the rising trends of technology

adoption, supported by the emerging rise of

insurtech and health ecosystems, the opportunity

for growth is profound.

As a business, we continue to strive for excellence

in everything we do and, as such, adopt and align

with global best practice. Accordingly, we support

and report under the International Integrated

Reporting Council’s (IIRC) International <IR>

Framework. We appreciate the principle-based

approach of the framework, which allows

organisations such as ourselves to report in a

congruent and authentic manner that reflects our

unique approach to value creation.

With this in mind, this year we restructured our

Integrated Annual Report to better capture our

value creation story. Our Group overview explains

the essence of WHO we are, WHAT we do across

our primary and partner markets, WHY we are in

business, and HOW we operate. In our value

creation chapter, our Group Chief Executive gives

an overview of our performance before we delve

into our short, medium and long-term strategies,

followed by risks and opportunities, our operating

environment, our trade-offs and stakeholders.

Following this, we unpack our performance in our

COVID-19 response, our Group Chief Financial

Officer’s review and our business reviews. Finally,

we include an overview of our corporate

governance and remuneration practices.

We appreciate the time it takes to read this report,

and strive to ensure the content included provides

you – our stakeholder – with an insight into how we

are delivering on our core purpose in the markets

where we operate. To help with understanding how

we applied the content elements and guiding

principles of the International <IR> Framework, we

included an application register at the end of this

report.
