ANNUAL REPORT 2021

PURPLE GROUP LIMITED

INNOVATION CONTINUES TO DRIVE FINANCIAL ACCESS FOR ALL

Over recent years, our theme was one of building a strong foundation and delivering, daily, on our promise of making

investing easy for everyone. At the start of that singular purpose, we had many detractors who believed that retail

investors were not smart enough, were too few and ultimately that the business model would not succeed. That

was then.

Covid and the ensuing challenges that this global pandemic and tragedy brought, challenged all of us. These financial

results show that, thanks to our solid foundation, those challenges were met and a positive tipping point has been

reached in many of our metrics. EasyEquities client registrations, for example, increased by 129% now totalling over

+1.1 million and growing at around 60 000 new registrants a month. Perhaps most notable about this client acquisition

rate is that it’s being achieved at a cost of acquisition of around R50 (marketing spend per EasyEquities direct active client

acquired) or around 2.5% of the financial services industry average.

The foundation has been built and the growth achieved via an incredible team and loyal shareholders (+25% of whom

are Easy INVSTRs on the platform). It has been made possible by our clients and community referring and educating

their friends and families and our phenomenal partners bringing their powerful brands and excellent relationship skills

to the table. Satrix, Capitec Bank, Discovery Bank, Bidvest Bank and Telkom are just a few of our partners who deserve

special mention.

Our South African focus is simple and clear – to leverage our strong base and to continue to scale our products and

distribution opportunities. While celebrating over 1 million registered clients, we are at the start of our journey and

we know that millions more can and will benefit from what we have to offer. Our research confirms that the largest

friction point preventing more clients taking up investing remains education, we will invest heavily in education in the

years ahead. The success achieved in scaling EasyCrypto and EasyProperties over the last 12 months, coupled with our

confirmed clients' desire for new products and services will see us place more effort and investment behind ensuring we

roll these new products out faster and more deliberately than ever before.

The Purple Group culture remains one of innovation and finding new growth opportunities. And so, we are most grateful

to all our shareholders, clients, and our committed team for helping us achieve the milestones detailed in this report

and know that they, like us, are determined to achieve this scaling. Together, we are excited about the multitude of

opportunities that lie ahead.

In just two short years we have scaled EasyCrypto to over 100 000 customers, collectively owning over half a billion rand

of Crypto assets. The partnership is a great example of what we can achieve when we marry shared purpose and culture

across two superb teams. The year ahead will see extensive platform and product launches building on the success of

EasyCrypto 10 Bundle and more recently the launch of the first helium token in partnership with Renergen and Argonon.

EasyProperties launched in the middle of the Covid crisis. Looking back, many may find it incredible that over 35000

EasyProperties retail investors have now invested in nearly 20 property developments accounting for more than 120

individual units. The portfolio is approaching R200 million in value, and the team is targeting growth of 100% year on

year through a focus on acquisition, conversion, improved investor education and experiences, and broadening the

investment offering to include international and commercial property opportunities. The team have done a wonderful

job in a very short and demanding time frame and the business looks set to emulate EasyEquities' success in a

shorter timeframe.

The Group’s 50/50 JV with NBC Fund Administration Services, called RISE (Retirement Investments and Savings for

Everyone) is an integrated institutional administration and investment fund management business. Not only does RISE

provide members with real-time online access to view their retirement savings, they also have access to various other

EasyEquities wallets such as USD. With increasing focus on this business from our leadership team coupled with an

expanding investment in growing the RISE Executive team and platform capability, this business is an early stage

development business operating in a huge market. The retirement fund administration and investment management

industry is ripe for disruption and presents an incredible opportunity for RISE and in turn, the Purple Group.:

Alignment of the Purple Group, its respective subsidiaries, shareholders and staff around a common brand and single­

minded purpose is central to our future growth strategy. In this regard more focus will be placed on the rebranding,

repositioning and strategic overhaul of GT247.com and Emperor Asset Management to meet the confirmed needs of

our customers.

The brand equity, trust and reach of EasyEquities is a growing asset of the group and makes the "Easy" brand and culture

the obvious choice in terms of driving group wide alignment. The incredible distribution already secured must now be

leveraged to deliver to more of our clients' needs and wants, locking in additional revenue opportunities whilst delighting

our customers and widening our competitive moat.

The case studies and lessons learnt in scaling EasyCrypto and more recently EasyProperties, through the EasyEquities

platform, demonstrates our ability to rapidly scale fintechs that meet our customers' needs, whilst delivering on our

purpose and promise to democratise all things investing.

In this regard we have extensively sought to understand our client needs and where we can deliver access, through

our platforms, to additional products that assist them in creating or protecting wealth. These product opportunities will

include EasyLending, EasyInsure, EasyTrader, EasyRetire and EasyAssetManagement, the names speak for themselves.

Our international aspirations, headed by our Australian business, were greatly impacted by Covid conditions in that we

were unable to travel and dedicate the required team and resources to ensuring our success. That said, the time has

been well spent researching the market and exploring additional partnerships and destinations to expand into. We have

already identified key market entry points in Asia, East Africa and Europe and are already working to launch in these

regions over the next 12 to 18 months.

In order to unlock these new product opportunities and our global ambitions we will need to scale the team, operations

and capital base of the group. The time to accelerate these plans is now and every effort will be made to ensure our best

team and efforts are put towards building out our products and success abroad.

The Purple Group, at its core, is a collection of extraordinary people. Our team and our shareholders deserve much credit

for their daily passion and commitment. All of them are part of our over one million clients. It is to those millions of

pioneers, INVSTRs – our community – that we say the biggest thank you. It is our privilege to work with and for you as we

all continue on our journey towards delivering on our dream to democratise investing and empower financial dignity for

all, by focusing on technical excellence, beautiful design and inspiring story telling that engages all dreamers and makes

investing easy, educational and fun for everyone.:

• GT247.com's revenue is down (56.0)%, compared to the prior comparative period. This result was largely driven by

a decrease in trading activity during the current year. The Trading Revenue generated during the current year of

R24.3 million is 53% below the average trading revenue of R51.6 million generated during the prior 5 years.

• Costs are (9.0)% lower than the prior year.

• The business generated a loss before tax of R(8.7) million for the current year, compared to a profit of R22.5 million in

the prior year, a swing of R31.2 million. The current years loss should be seen in context of the average profit before

• Operating expenses have increased by 10.9% primarily due to an increase in audit fees expensed during the current

year, due to part of the FY 2021 audit fee being incurred prior to year end, for the first time, as interim audit work

was performed.

• The lower interest cost is primarily due to the decrease in the debt owing to the IDC and the drop in the REPO rate.

• The fair value adjustment of R4.4 million relates to a write-up in Purple Groups investment in Real People Investment

Holdings, which was required due to the improvement in the performance of the business over the last 18 months.:

Materiality

In terms of the JSE Listings Requirements (“the Requirements”) financial information must be prepared in accordance with

IFRS. The application of materiality is an important concept dealt with by IFRS. The reference to materiality in paragraph

(1) of the CEO and FD sign off must be interpreted in the context of IFRS.

The second obligation under the CEO and FD sign off rule (as detailed in (2)) must be read in the context of paragraph

(1). The term ‘no’ does not mean a one hundred percent factual correctness but rather that after due, careful and proper

consideration the directors agree that no facts have been omitted or untrue statements made that would make the

Annual Financial Statements (“AFS”) materially false or materially misleading in terms of IFRS.:
