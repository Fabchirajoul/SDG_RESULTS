letter to stakeholders

Roy Andersen CA(SA), CD(SA)

“The evolution of the Sasfin Board

into an increasingly diverse,

experienced, skilled, independent

and strong leadership body has

been one of the most gratifying

aspects of my time at the Group.

I leave in the knowledge that Sasfin

is in good hands and well-

positioned for growth.”

IMPROVING BOARD PERFORMANCE

There is an ongoing focus on improving the performance

and effectiveness of the Board. While last year’s

independent external Board effectiveness review was

generally positive, it identified several areas where we could

continuously strengthen our governance processes. The

resulting refinements, which included improved decision-

making, reduced overlap between committees and

restructured Board packs to make sure we are focusing on

the most effective areas, are proving beneficial.

This financial year, we conducted an online self-

assessment review providing insight into the Board’s

effectiveness, identifying areas for further improvement

and providing assurance that the Board is fulfilling its

responsibilities in terms of its charter and the results

were again positive. The Group Company Secretary

continues to be a source of high-quality, professional

corporate governance support for the Board.

A BROADER RESPONSIBILITY FOR ESG

The Board is mindful of the importance of ESG

considerations to the long-term sustainability of the

Group and society, and this is reflected in our strategy

and brand promise. Our direct environmental footprint is

small. However, we are committed to minimising any

negative impacts we may have on the world around us.

We are also proud of the positive social impacts of the

initiatives supported through our corporate social

responsibility programme.

The Group has more scope to drive positive change in its

day-to-day activities through environmentally and socially

responsible lending practices, and Sasfin Wealth has made

significant progress in embedding ESG considerations into

investment and institutional advice processes and culture.

As mentioned previously, there are industries that we have

chosen not to invest in or fund.

Good relationships with our key stakeholder groups are

an essential aspect of sustainability and provide a

broader context for ESG deliberations. At a Board-level,

our most significant direct engagements are with our

regulators and shareholders. While we are unable to be in

the office with our employees daily due to lockdown

restrictions, their health, morale and mental wellbeing

are key for the Board and these are monitored by

management on an ongoing basis.

It is with pleasure and sadness that I present my

final: letter to stakeholders as Chair of the Sasfin

Board in a year of improved performance. I

have served on the Board since 2011 and, in

that time, I have had the honour of playing a

role in overseeing and supporting the

transformation of the Company from what was

a fantastic founder-led family business into its

current form as a fully capacitated, delegated

corporate structure headed by the next

generation of the family. The most rewarding

aspect of the process was witnessing the

successful and seamless transfer of leadership

from Roland to Michael, which left me full of

admiration for both.
