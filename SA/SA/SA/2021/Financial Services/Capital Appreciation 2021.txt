“During the past year,

Covid-19 placed South Africa

on an irreversible path. Many of

our and other new technology

applications presented welcome

solutions, functional convenience

and meaningful advantage into

our daily lives – surely there can

be no turning back.”

In our areas of endeavour, more and more

organisations impacted by the consequences

of Covid-19 suddenly recognised the strategic

importance of new and improved technology,

architecture and applications as a critical and

necessary component of their business. There can

be little doubt, therefore, that the challenges of

Covid-19 placed South Africa on an irreversible path

of realisation, and that the benefits of technology

offered welcome solutions, functional convenience

and meaningful advantage into our daily lives –

surely there can be no turning back.

I am particularly proud to record that, notwith-

standing increased client demands during these

uncommonly onerous times, our development and

services teams, consistent with their reputation for

delivery and dependability, were able to ensure that

clients sustain efficient and beneficial services to

their own customers.

Given these unusual circumstances and the adverse

impact and disruption the pandemic brought

to bear on the economy as a whole, the Group

results for the year under review can be regarded

as highly satisfactory. The comprehensive and

detailed financial performance of the Group and

its subsidiaries are set out later in this Report.

However, for a better appreciation and more relevant

measurement of the year’s trading performance,

one must have regard to “like-for-like” 2020 income

comparisons. In short, if one excludes the premium

interest earned in 2020, (even on lower average

cash resources), the net unrealised mark-to-market

foreign exchange gains and the “one-off” capital

gain on the sale of the Group’s interest in Australia,

the difference in EBITDA and EPS for the year would

have been approximately negative 4%.

Capital Appreciation, nevertheless, was able to

consistently improve its working capital resources,

substantially through robust cash generation

Dear Capital Appreciation Investors and

Stakeholders,

Company and business

activities

I write to you at the end of an extremely

demanding year, commencing in April 2020 with

a palpable sense of economic caution, but

thereafter, even more adversely impacted by the

calamitous effects of a growing Covid-19 virus

infection rate in South Africa, with a similar

pattern in countries all around the world.

Severe lockdown regulations were imposed

by Government on business and citizens in

an attempt to limit the transmission of the

contagion, with strict limitations on people’s

movement and engagement, including

compliance with other severe protective

measures.

This past year, therefore, has not been easy for

any business, organisation and/or individual.

Regretfully, it became common practice during

the year to have to share one’s sympathies

and condolences with clients, colleagues,

staff and friends who lost either personnel,

family members and/or associates due to the

Covid-19 contagion.

The negative effect on operational and financial

performances forced a review and refocus

of many business models and procedures.

Many businesses regarded as “non-essential

services” were forced to close. Where possible,

working from home became the order of

the day. In circumstances where this was not

practical, protective structures for social and

staff distancing needed to be introduced. In

our case, I need to extend my sincere thanks

and appreciation to our divisional management

who coordinated and sustained the necessary

measures for the safe presence of critical staff,

who willingly attended to their duties at our

Group premises.

Managing Director: Donn Engelbrecht (53),

International Marketing and Management

(IMM), Executive Development Programme

(EDP) (Wits Business School)

Donn joined the African Resonance team

five years ago, after 23 years of experience

in banking in South Africa. Donn has an

in-depth knowledge, experience and

understanding of the card and payments

industry. He has over 10 years’ executive

leadership experience in both card

acceptance and Issuance.

Donn was the Chairperson of the Card

Acquirers forum in South Africa and served

on executive committees such as the Group

Payments Working Committee and Steering

Committee for two of the banks for which he

worked.

African Resonance is a leading direct and indirect

provider of payment infrastructure, technical support

and related technology solutions, as well as bespoke

software solutions to established financial institutions,

emerging payment service providers and corporate

customers in the retail, fuel, restaurant, hospitality

and healthcare sectors. African Resonance generates

a predictable and progressive revenue stream and

annuity income with contracts that have an average

life of approximately three to five years.

The team designs, develops and implements turnkey

cradle-to-grave terminal estate management

solutions. Customer-centricity is core to the African

Resonance DNA. The company maintains strong client

relationships with all the major banks in South Africa

and other countries.

In a highly competitive market, African Resonance will

continue to nurture client relationships.

A new operating model has been introduced, in

addition to enhancing business processes in an

attempt to accommodate the changes in market

conditions. Business intelligence is another key focus

area to help customers to better understand the

activities associated with their terminal estate and

merchant behaviours. African Resonance has also

upgraded its terminal repair centre to accommodate

Linux as well as Android-based terminals.

Development Program (EDP) GIBS, Strategic

Leadership Development Program (SLDP)

GIBS

Benjamin joined Dashpay in September 2018.

He has more than 20 years’ experience in

payment technology, of which 14 years was

with Nedbank where he held various senior

positions in CIB Transactional Banking, as

well as the Card and Payments Division.

Dashpay provides superior, secure payment solutions

and products. Its multi-product, multi-party

universal platform provides innovative transaction

processing services, solutions and products focused

on business-to-business commercial and payment

activity. Dashpay’s technology platforms are

adaptable and compatible with electronic point

of sales devices and state of the art switching and

processing capabilities.

Dashpay imports, sells and rents payment devices,

as well, as develops customised software solutions to

clients’ unique needs. Value added services, such as

gift cards and loyalty programmes, a merchant cash

advance and company insurance, are also provided.

The Dashpay solution set is intended to complement

and integrate into existing payment services

provided by the Group’s established banking and

institutional client base. Dashpay provides significant

blue sky growth and future annuity stream

opportunities.

The move away from cash payments, accelerated

by the Covid-19 pandemic, has provided new

opportunities for smaller merchants to adopt

card payment options. Dashpay’s solutions and

its recently established exclusive agency for

Newland Payment Technology (NPT) point of

sale devices positions it well to take advantage

of these opportunities. NPT is the second-largest

manufacturer of payment terminals globally and a

leader in Android technology. These terminals offer

new functionality at an attractive price and superior

quality which can be offered directly to SMME

retailers and their suppliers to expand this presently

underserviced market. Accepting electronic

payments is the first step in allowing these SMMEs

to participate in the formal economy.

The past year was characterised by its successful

financial turnaround, operational re-engineering

and further investment in expertise, software and

hardware in its business divisions to position it for

further growth in the future.

Dashpay further developed its process which

dynamically routes payment transactions between

multiple banks and payment service providers,

laying the groundwork for further innovation such

as eCommerce platforms and multi-lane retail

environments. A combined project with Synthesis

was a closed loop, proprietary gift card solution with

a loyalty programme for a leading listed property

company. The solution is currently live in its largest

mall and will be rolled out to further malls over time.

A loyalty solution for pet products was developed

for a global healthcare company across multiple

distribution channels.

Compliance and reliability are essential elements

of the client proposition and, despite the lockdown

challenges, all customers’ systems were fully

operational throughout the period. Further

improvements on hosting and redundancy of

service and backup were also implemented this year.

Capital Appreciation Group long

term share incentive schemes

The share incentive scheme (SIS)

The SIS allows executives and senior managers

to participate in the appreciation of Capital

Appreciation’s share price over time, subject to

predefined performance criteria.

The SIS is an option-type plan (at no cost to the

participant), with share options awarded being

equity-settled subsequent to the exercise thereof.

The SIS awards a conditional right for a participant

to receive a number of shares, the value of which is

equal to the difference between the market value of

Capital Appreciation’s share on the date of exercise

and the date of grant. In other words, the participant

is able to enjoy any increase in Capital Appreciation’s

share price from the date of grant until the date

on which the conditional rights are vested and

thereafter exercised.

The share price growth over the SIS period is settled

in Capital Appreciation ordinary shares, with the

gain subject to income tax. To the extent that the

SIS grant price exceeds Capital Appreciation’s

share price at the time of exercise, no gain or cost is

realised by participants.

The SIS plan has been a successful retention

mechanism since listing. This is in line with

international trends towards less volatile and lower

geared LTIs, which have proved to provide good

alignment with shareholder interests and are likely

to avoid extreme pay-outs. The nominations and

remuneration committee will assess the future use

of share options on a periodic basis, as required.
