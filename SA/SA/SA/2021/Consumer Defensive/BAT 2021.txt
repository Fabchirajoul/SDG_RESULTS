Dear Stakeholders,

2021 was a pivotal year in BAT’s

transformation. Our commitment to change,

while delivering value to stakeholders,

can be seen in the progress that has been

made on our strategic priorities.

We @increased New Category revenue by

over 40% (or over 50% excluding foreign

exchange)@, reached a total of 18.3 million

(up 4.8 million) consumers of our non-

combustible products, New Categories

losses^ reduced for the first time,

contributing to earnings growth @and we

brought Group leverage down to c.3x@.

Foreign exchange has been a significant

headwind on our reported results, with

revenue down 0.4%. However, at constant

rates of exchange, we have delivered

strong financial results, with revenue up

6.9% @and with operating cash conversion

ahead of our target of at least 90%@.

As part of a new longer-term active capital

allocation framework, we have announced

a £2 billion share repurchase programme for

2022, in addition to maintaining a growing

dividend. This reflects our commitment to

enhance shareholder returns.

I would like to thank all our people and

our partners for their continued focus

and commitment in delivering our

strong results throughout this difficult

COVID-19 period.

With strong foundations in place, we

now embark on the next phase of our

journey – Faster Transformation – towards

A Better TomorrowTM: £5 billion of revenue

and profitability from New Categories by

2025 and development of opportunities

Beyond Nicotine, leveraging our knowledge

and capabilities from New Categories.

Building A Better TomorrowTM

Our purpose of building A Better TomorrowTM

by reducing the health impact of our

business means that we are committed

to our business transformation.

During 2021, our focus has been on

developing and delivering consumer-

focused products and brands:

– The growth, from 13.5 million to

18.3 million, in consumers of non-

combustible products was our strongest

to date;

– Non-combustible products now account

for 12% of Group revenue, up from 4%

in 2017;

– Revenue from our vapour products was

up 52%, with our global brand, Vuse,

now the leading global vapour brand by

value share;

– Following volume share gains in ENA and

Japan, revenue from our THP, glo, was up

34%; and

– Revenue in the Modern Oral category,

largely through Velo, was up 39%.

As consumer preferences and technology

rapidly evolve, the availability of

scientifically-substantiated, less risky*†

products is crucial to effective tobacco

harm reduction and we are determined to

transform our business.

ESG Front and Centre

Sustainability has been central to our

business and ethos for more than

two decades.

In 2001, we established our first group-wide

environment, health and safety systems,

the BAT Biodiversity Partnership and a

programme of independently facilitated

social dialogue. This year, we published

our 20th ESG Report.

2021 was a pivotal year in BAT’s

transformation. Our commitment

to change, while delivering value to

stakeholders, can be seen in the

progress that has been made on

our strategic priorities.

As part of a new longer-

term active capital allocation

framework, we have announced

a £2 billion share repurchase

programme for 2022, to enhance

shareholder returns, in addition

to growing our dividend.

With strong foundations

in place, we now embark on

the next phase of our journey

– Faster Transformation –

towards A Better TomorrowTM.

letter and spirit, is mandatory for all

our people worldwide.

Our SoBC holds everyone responsible for compliance, and every

line manager across our business must act as a role model for

high standards of behaviour. The SoBC includes our Speak Up

policy, reflecting the range of Speak Up channels for raising any

concerns in confidence (anonymously if preferred) and without fear

of reprisal. The SoBC also includes our Lobbying and Engagement

policy, reinforcing the requirement for all our engagement activities

with governments, regulators and other external stakeholders to be

conducted with transparency, openness and integrity.

Our SoBC is regularly reviewed and updated. A revised version of

our SoBC was introduced in January 2022 (discussed on page 110).

The Audit Committee is kept updated on SoBC allegations, and

reports to the Board to enable Board oversight of behaviour falling

short of our standards and the corrective action taken.

letter and the scope of audit

services is agreed by the Committee with the external auditors.

Subject to the restrictions specified in the AIP, the external auditors

may also provide certain non-audit services with the prior approval

of the Committee. The requirement for the Committee’s pre-

approval of non-audit services may be waived only if the aggregate

amount of all non-audit services provided is less than 5% of the

total amount paid to the external auditors during the reporting

year, where those services were not recognised to be non-audit

services at the time of engagement, and provided those services

are promptly brought to the attention of the Committee and their

provision is approved prior to completion of the audit in the relevant

reporting year.

The provision of permitted non-audit services must be put to

tender if expected spend exceeds limits specified in the AIP, unless

a waiver of this requirement, in accordance with the terms of the

AIP, is agreed by the Finance and Transformation Director and

notified to the Committee.

The AIP:

– requires Committee pre-approval for all audit, audit-related and

other non-audit services, except in respect of non-audit services

falling within the exceptions described above;

– prohibits the provision of certain types of services by the external

auditors, including those with contingent fee arrangements,

expert services unrelated to audit and other services prohibited

by US securities laws and the Public Company Accounting

Oversight Board;

– prohibits the Chief Executive, Finance and Transformation

Director, Group Financial Controller and Group Chief Accountant

from having been employed by the external auditors in any

capacity in connection with the Group audit for two years

before initiation of an audit;

– specifies requirements in respect of audit partner rotation,

including for both the lead and the concurring external audit

partners to rotate off the Group audit engagement at least

every five years, and not to recommence provision of audit or

audit-related services to the Group for a further five years; and

– provides authority for the Committee to oversee any allegations

of improper influence, coercion, manipulation or purposeful

misleading in connection with any external audit, and to review

any issues arising in the course of engagement with the

external auditors.:

Chairman's fee and the fees for Non-Executive Directors will be maintained at their current levels, with no increases to apply in

May 2022.
