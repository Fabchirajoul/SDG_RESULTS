information purposes:

Materiality

In terms of the JSE Listings Requirements (“the Requirements”) financial information must be prepared in accordance

with IFRS. The application of materiality is an important concept dealt with by IFRS. The reference to materiality in

paragraph (a) of the CEO and FD sign off must be interpreted in the context of IFRS.

The second obligation under the CEO and FD sign off rule (as detailed in (b)) must be read in the context of

paragraph (a). The term ‘no’ does not mean a one hundred percent factual correctness but rather that after due,

careful and proper consideration the directors agree that no facts have been omitted or untrue statements made

that would make the Annual Financial Statements (“AFS”) materially false or materially misleading in terms of IFRS.:
