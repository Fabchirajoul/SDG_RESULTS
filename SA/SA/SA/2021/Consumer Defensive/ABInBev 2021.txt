Letter to our shareholders

To a future with more cheers

2021 was an important step in our journey to create a future with more cheers.

After successfully transitioning our CEO leadership, we introduced our new global

purpose and evolved our strategy. Our people dream big and continued to meet

the moment to deliver strong results in a challenging operating environment.

Energized by our new purpose and guided by our strategy, we are transforming our

company from being the category leader to leading category growth.

Continued momentum

We grew top-line by 15.6% in FY21, comprised of

a mix of 9.6% volume and 5.5% revenue per hl

growth, driven by premiumization and revenue

management initiatives. EBITDA grew by 11.8%, at

the top end of our 2021 outlook, as top-line growth

was partially offset by anticipated transactional

FX and commodity headwinds, higher SG&A

due primarily to higher variable compensation

accruals and elevated supply chain costs. We

delivered another year of strong cash flow

generation, resulting in almost 10 billion USD of

gross debt reduction.

Compared to pre-pandemic levels, we grew top-

line by more than 10% and nearly recovered EBITDA

on an organic basis.

Our Purpose

This year was a unique opportunity to reimagine

what a beer company can be and our path ahead.

We Dream Big to Create a Future with More

Cheers. Our renewed purpose represents what

we can make possible with our unique global

ecosystem. It enables us to unlock and harness

our existing infrastructure and assets to deliver

more innovation, more sustainability, more

occasions and more value for all our stakeholders.

We are energized by the momentum we

built in 2021 and the journey ahead. Our

performance and progress demonstrate

our team’s commitment to lead category

growth. We delivered strong results while

supporting our colleagues, partners

and communities through the ongoing

challenging environment. The Board of

Directors and management team will

remain focused on delivering on our

purpose and strategy to drive long-term

value creation.

Mr. Santo Domingo is a representative of the Restricted Shareholders. Born in 1977, he is a Colombian citizen and obtained

City. He was a member of the Board of SABMiller Plc until 2016, where he was also Vice-

Letter dated 27 October 2015 (the "Original Facilities Agreement" and, as

amended and restated by the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, the "Restated Facilities Agreement").

The Original Facilities Agreement was originally entered into by the old Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, and was transferred

to the company as a result of the merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev (formerly “Newbelco”) and the old Anheuser-

Busch InBev SA/NV, that took place on 10 October 2016 in the framework of the combination with SAB.

The total commitments of the Original Facilities Agreement were, immediately prior to the effective date of the Amendment

and Restatement Agreement, USD 9,000,000,000 and, following the effective date of the Amendment and Restatement

Agreement, USD 10,100,000,000. Pursuant to the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, the maturity of the Original

Facilities Agreement was extended from August 2022 under the Original Facilities Agreement to February 2026 under the

Restated Facilities Agreement.

The Restated Facilities Agreement contains a clause 17 (Mandatory Prepayment) that grants, in essence, to any lender

under the Restated Facilities Agreement, upon a Change of Control over the Company, the right (i) not to fund any loan or: letter of credit (other than a rollover loan meeting certain conditions) and (ii) (by not less than 30 days written notice) to

cancel its undrawn commitments and require repayment of its participations in the loans or letters of credit, together with

accrued interest thereon, and all other amounts owed to such lender under the Restated Facilities Agreement (and certain

related documents). Pursuant to the Restated Facilities Agreement (a) “Change of Control” means “any person or group of

persons acting in concert (in each case other than Stichting InBev or any existing direct or indirect certificate holder or

certificate holders of Stichting InBev or any person or group of persons acting in concert with any such persons) gaining

Control of the Company, (b) “acting in concert” means “a group of persons who, pursuant to an agreement or understanding

(whether formal or informal), actively co-operate, through the acquisition directly or indirectly of shares in the Company by

any of them, either directly or indirectly, to obtain Control of the Company” and (c) “Control” means, in respect of the

Company, (a) “the direct or indirect ownership of more than 50 per cent of the share capital or similar rights of ownership

of the Company or the power to direct the management and the policies of the Company whether through the ownership of

share capital, contract or otherwise or (b) the power (whether by way of ownership of shares, proxy, contract, agency or

otherwise) to: (i) cast, or control the casting of, more than 50 per cent. of the maximum number of votes that might be cast

at a general meeting; or (ii) appoint or remove all, or the majority, of the directors or other equivalent officers; or (iii) give

directions to management with respect to the operating and financial policies of the entity with which the directors or other

equivalent officers of the Company are obliged to comply”.

In accordance with article 7:151 of the Belgian Companies Code, clause 17 (Mandatory Prepayment) of the Restated

Facilities Agreement was approved by the annual shareholders’ meeting of the Company held on 28 April 2021. Similar

clauses were, in respect of the Original Facilities Agreement, approved by the shareholders meeting of old Anheuser-Busch

InBev SA/NV on 27 April 2010 and 27 April 2016 in accordance with the then Article 556 of the 2009 Belgian Companies

Code.

As of 31 December 2021, no drawdowns were outstanding under the Original Facilities Agreement.

2. EMTN PROGRAM

In accordance with article 556 of the 2009 Belgian Companies Code, the shareholders’ meeting of the old Anheuser-Busch

InBev approved on 24 April 2013 (i) Condition 7.5. of the Terms & Conditions (Redemption at the Option of the Noteholders

(Change of Control Put)) of the 15,000,000,000 Euro updated Euro Medium Term Note Program dated 16 May 2012 of

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV and Brandbrew SA (the “Issuers”) and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, acting as

Arranger, which may be applicable in the case of Notes issued under the Program (the “EMTN Program”), (ii) any other

provision in the EMTN Program granting rights to third parties which could affect the company’s assets or could impose an

obligation on the company where in each case the exercise of those rights is dependent on the occurrence of a “Change of

Control” (as defined in the Terms & Conditions of the EMTN Program). Pursuant to the EMTN Program, (a) “Change of

Control” means “any person or group of persons acting in concert (in each case other than Stichting Anheuser-Busch InBev

or any existing direct or indirect certificate holder or certificate holders of Stichting Anheuser-Busch InBev) gaining Control
