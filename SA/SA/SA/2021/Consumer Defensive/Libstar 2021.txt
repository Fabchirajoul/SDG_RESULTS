APPRECIATION

I express my sincere appreciation to Sibongile Masinga for the solid foundation laid

before handing over to me as audit and risk committee chairman on 7 June 2021, as

well as for her continued insights and input. I also thank my fellow committee members,

invited board members and the executive management team of Libstar for their
