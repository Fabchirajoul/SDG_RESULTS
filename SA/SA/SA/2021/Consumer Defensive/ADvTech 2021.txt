letter of acceptance and are not required to serve notice

periods. In terms of the group’s policy, all non-executive

directors who have served on the board for nine years or longer

or who are 70 years of age or over are required to stand for

re-election on an annual basis. A non-executive director may

management are employed on standard employment

agreements.

SECTION 2 Remuneration policy continued

Malus and clawback policy

During 2020, ADvTECH adopted a malus and clawback policy with the

intention of aligning shareholder interests and the remuneration

outcomes of employees. It allows the group to reduce or recoup the

incentive remuneration in defined circumstances and is applicable to all

ADvTECH employees who participate in the variable incentive

remuneration programme.

Trigger events where the malus and clawback policy would be

implemented include, but are not limited to:

• Where a material misstatement resulted in an adjustment in the audited

consolidated accounts of the company or the audited accounts of any

member of the group; and/or

• Where any information used to determine the quantum of an incentive

remuneration amount was based on an error, or inaccurate or

misleading information; and/or

• Where any action or conduct of a participant which, in the reasonable

opinion of the board, amounts to serious misconduct; and/or

• Where any events or behaviour of a participant or the existence of

events attributable to a participant, which led to the censure of the

company or a member of the group by a regulatory authority, or have

had a significant detrimental impact on the reputation of the company;

and/or

• The board or RemCom, in their discretion, deems it necessary to apply

malus or clawback.

Minimum shareholder requirements policy

ADvTECH has adopted a MSR policy with the intention to align

shareholder interests with executive objectives and to drive an increased

level of executive accountability for the longer-term sustainability of the

organisation.

The policy is based on the following principles:

• Each executive’s MSR target is determined using the individual

guaranteed annual remuneration;

• The target must be achieved within five years from approval of this

policy (March 2021) or from the start date in the case of new

appointees, unless otherwise determined by the RemCom

considering market conditions and related factors;

• The scheme is not intended to compel executives to incur debt to

acquire ADvTECH shares, but rather that executives should retain

shares acquired through the operation of share incentive schemes;

• At least 50% of the executives’ vested retention share awards and at

least 30% of vested performance share awards must be retained

until the MSR target has been achieved;

• Compliance to the MSR target will be measured annually and

executives will have to declare the extent of their personal

shareholdings in the company at each year-end; and

• RemCom will assess compliance with the MSR before making

future discretionary LTI awards.

The MSR targets are set as follows:

Guaranteed

annual

remuneration

at year end

CEO

GCD

Prescribed

officers

1 x

0.8 x

0.6 x

If the executive or senior manager fails to reach the MSR within the

specified period, the non-compliance will be flagged to RemCom, who

will be required to determine appropriate action and steps required

for the executive to meet the MSR based on the circumstances for

non-compliance.

Non-binding advisory vote on the

remuneration policy

The shareholders of ADvTECH will be requested to cast a non-binding

advisory vote on the remuneration policy at the AGM on Thursday,

26 May 2022. Our remuneration policy sets out the principles used to

ensure competitive remuneration while complying with all applicable

laws and codes. This policy applies to the payments, accruals and

awards made to executive directors, non-executive directors,

senior executives and prescribed officers for the year ended

31 December 2022.

Employment contracts for executive management do not provide for

termination payments arising from incapacity, dismissal, voluntary

resignation, retirement, retrenchment or redundancy. In addition, no

contracted balloon payments are due to executives upon termination.
