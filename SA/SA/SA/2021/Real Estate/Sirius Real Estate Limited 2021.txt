Sirius Real Estate Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2021:

letter there is a short summary of:

» how the Committee operated during the year;

» our approach to setting pay and market reference points

and peer groups considered by the Committee;

» how the proposed new Remuneration Policy is aligned with

the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and

» wider workforce remuneration and employee engagement.

There then follows the two principal sections of the report:

» the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the “Remuneration

Policy”) – this sets out our forward-looking Remuneration

Policy for Directors, which is subject to shareholder approval

at the 2021 AGM. If approved, the Remuneration Policy will

take effect from the conclusion of that meeting; and

» the Annual Report on Remuneration – this provides details of

the amounts earned by the Directors in respect of the year

ended 31 March 2021.

Our current Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the “2018 Policy”)

was adopted at the general meeting held on 5 December 2018

and reapproved on an advisory basis at the 2019 and 2020 AGMs.

In line with typical UK practice, following the end of the three year

period for which the 2018 Policy applied, the Committee has

approved the Remuneration Policy for which shareholder approval

on an advisory basis will be sought at the 2021 AGM. Our approach

to the new Remuneration Policy is summarised below. In connection

with the approval of the new Remuneration Policy, shareholders

will also be asked to approve at the 2021 AGM the new Sirius

Real Estate 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan.

The Committee has had a busy year consulting and preparing

for the new policy, as well as establishing new remuneration

packages and contractual terms for our three promoted C Suite

Directors and ensuring that a consistent and sensible approach

to remuneration during the pandemic has been taken throughout

the year. As such I would like to thank my colleagues on the

Committee for their insight and support.

The primary functions of the Committee are to:

» design and determine the remuneration and associated

benefits of the Executive Directors of the Company and

the senior management of the Group; and

» review workforce remuneration and related policies

for their alignment with the Group’s values and culture,

and take these into account when setting the policy for

Executive Director and senior management remuneration.

The Committee’s Terms of Reference are available at

www.sirius-real-estate.com.

“ We believe that our proposed

new Remuneration Policy will

help support our strategy and

provide a clear, consistent and

cohesive approach to reward

for a FTSE 250 company.”

Total Shareholder Return performance graph and CEO remuneration

The graph below shows the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance for the Company’s shares in comparison to the FTSE 250

for the period 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2021. The Company is a constituent of this index and, as such, it has been selected as an

appropriate comparator group. For the purposes of this graph, TSR has been calculated as the percentage change during the period

in the market price of the shares, assuming that dividends are reinvested. The graph shows the value by 31 March 2021 of €100

invested in the Group over the period compared with €100 invested in the FTSE 250.

The total remuneration of the CEO over the past five(1) financial years is shown below. The annual bonus pay-out and LTIP vesting

level as a percentage of the maximum opportunity are also shown.
