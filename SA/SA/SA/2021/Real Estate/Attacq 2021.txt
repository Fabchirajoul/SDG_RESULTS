letter of appointment. The

transition of Jackie van Niekerk from COO to CEO was

seamless, with a handover period of three months.

In terms of the company’s MOI, one-third of

directors retire by rotation each year and are

eligible for re-election by shareholders at the AGM.

After due consideration by Remco, the board has

recommended the re-election of Stewart Shaw-Taylor,

Hellen El Haimer and Johan van der Merwe who

retire by rotation in line with the provisions contained

in the MOI.

The retirement age for NEDs is 70. The MOI provides

that directors who have reached retirement age may

remain on the board, subject to annual performance

reviews. The period in office of directors is reviewed

individually by the board on the recommendation

of Remco.

Board and committee

evaluations

Independent board and committee evaluations are

conducted by an independent service provider every

three years while every other year, self-evaluations

assessments are conducted internally.

Self-evaluation board and committee assessments

were conducted in September 2021. The results

indicated the board and each of its committees were

functioning effectively.

The key insight from the board effectiveness review

indicated the following salient points:

• The board (and the board sub-committees)

effectively discharge its fiduciary responsibilities and

work cohesively

• The board and management work cohesively to

achieve the company’s strategic goals

• The board agenda strikes the right balance

between strategic, business, risk and governance

matters including ESG

• The recent board appointments were positive and

the board will continue to monitor the succession

plan in line with business requirements and diversity

policy

• Opportunity for enhanced focus on the future

strategic direction of the group including innovation

and technology

• Opportunity for enhanced discipline in capital

allocation will further support risk/return decision

making. The board will revisit the principles around

risk and return considering current economic

climate and emerging risk

• Opportunity for enhanced focus on articulating

how performance indicators are aligned to

refocused strategic objectives and plans

• Opportunity for enhanced focus on the future

strategic direction of the group including innovation

and technology

Jackie van Niekerk, Allen Swiegers and Thabo Leeuw.

What we

achieved in

FY21:

Dear shareholders

Remco is responsible for setting the group’s

remuneration policy and principles and

ensuring remuneration practices are fair,

responsible and transparent while making

certain we fulfil our strategy to deliver

sustainable value for all our stakeholders in

the short, medium and long term. The aim of

Remco is to position Attacq in the market to

attract, motivate reward and retain key and

critical talent within the business. Accordingly,

Remco is required to maintain the company’s

status quo as a responsible corporate

citizen, overseeing that remuneration

trends, benchmarking and remuneration

matters are addressed and/or considered

when discharging its duties. In addition to its

remuneration responsibilities, Remco has been

tasked with certain nomination responsibilities,

which include leading the process of board

appointments by identifying and nominating

suitable candidates for the approval of

the board.

As disclosed in the corporate governance

review, there was adequate focus on the

board succession plan during the year under

review. Brett Nagle retired on 27 November

2020 as a director, IC and ARC member. The

committee followed a robust recruitment

process with the assistance of an external

independent service provider to appoint

appropriate directors to the board. On

recommendation by Remco, the board

made the following appointments:

• Allen Swiegers as director and member

of ARC and TSE

• Thabo Leeuw as director and member

of IC

It is important for the board to collectively

possess the required skills and expertise

to discharge their fiduciary duties while

maintaining independence. Thabo Leeuw

and Allen Swiegers bring a wealth of

knowledge and have already contributed

meaningfully to the board.

In addition, Jackie van Niekerk – who was the

previous COO – was appointed as the CEO

to replace Melt Hamman who resigned end

April 2021. The appointment of Jackie was

in line with the existing succession plan. The

board resolved that the COO position will not

be filled, and the executive management

structure was reconfigured by the CEO to

optimise and enhance the executive team,

in alignment with the business strategy.

Part 1: Introduction and background statement

In recognition of Melt’s contribution and

commitment to Attacq since its listing

and more recently the leadership he

demonstrated in managing the impact of

COVID-19, the committee resolved to settle

his outstanding share options in line with

the provisions of the LTIP for good leavers.

Similarly, the company settled his STI for the

year (in line with set KPIs) on a pro rata basis

up to the date of his resignation. Full details

are contained on

page 129, Part 3:

Remuneration implementation report.

Remco members considered the tactical

implementation plan taken to manage

the continued impact of COVID-19 to the

business, particularly in the context of the

company's actual performance and the

KPIs linked to the performance for both STI

and LTI. Remco remains committed to its

guiding principles to remunerate fairly and

responsibly while making sure the key and

critical skills required to manage the business

are retained.

Refer to the Corporate governance report,

page 106, for a summary of the Remco's

mandate and composition as well as FY21

key matters considered, resolved or approved

during the year under review. Remco’s meeting

attendance is disclosed on

page 111.
