Corporate governance report

Governance framework

The Board ensures that Capco operates responsibly as we deliver the

Company’s strategy, and that the way we do business reflects our culture

and values. This report, and the Committee reports which follow, explain

the ways in which the Board, its Committees and our broader govern-

ance framework work together to achieve our purpose of investing in

and creating world-class places, focusing on central London, and using

our vision, long-term approach and responsible stewardship, to deliver

economic and social value and generate benefits for our stakeholders.

Culture and values

The Board monitors corporate culture and values throughout the year to

ensure that they are aligned with Company purpose and the delivery

of corporate strategy, and are embodied across the business. This year

the Company launched its first employee engagement survey, and the

Board was very pleased to see the results, which showed that our

employees are proud to work for Capco and are engaged with our

business, understanding our strategy and valuing our inclusive culture.

This commitment is reflected in the professionalism and enthusiasm that

I and my fellow Directors see around the business. You can read more

about our culture and values on pages 3, 19, 82 and 94.

The Board’s year

During 2021, as the challenges of COVID-19 continued, the Executive

Directors ensured that the Board was kept fully updated on action taken

by the business to ensure that an attractive, vibrant estate was main-

tained for when visitors were able to return to central London. We were

particularly impressed with the direct engagement undertaken with our

tenants and the programme of estate events and digital marketing which

kept our visitors in touch with Covent Garden.

The main areas of focus for the Board during the year were oversight

of the Group’s operations, consideration of strategic matters, ensuring

that the Company maintained a strong balance sheet, the approval of

our Net Zero Carbon Pathway and consideration of Board composition

and succession planning.

The Board

During 2021, the Board continued to consider succession planning to

ensure that the Board has the appropriate mix of skills, independence

and experience to deliver Capco’s strategy as a prime central London

focused REIT.

As reported last year, a search for the Company’s next Chair is ongoing.

It is currently anticipated that a successor will be in place to allow me

to step down during the coming year, having served on the Capco

Board since 2010. The ongoing search is described in the Nomination

Committee report on page 98. The 2021 Board evaluation proposed

that the Board be expanded from its current compact size, and so the

appointment of one or more additional independent Directors is also

being considered. In considering such appointments the Board is mindful

of its commitment to increase its diversity over time.

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2021 Corporate governance report.

Capco’s proactive approach, commitment and creativity have positioned

the business strongly for recovery ensuring the Company is well-placed

financially and Covent Garden is the West End’s most vibrant district with

a world-class customer line-up. The effective execution of strategy has

been reflected in the resilience of the business and the Company’s returns

for the year. We look ahead with confidence in the long-term prospects

of the Covent Garden estate and London’s West End.

Performance and dividend

Capco delivered total shareholder return for the year of 16.5 per cent,

which comprises share price performance and the dividend paid in the

year following the resumption of the Company’s dividend programme.

Total return for the year was 0.4 per cent, driven by a decline in prop-

erty valuations in the first half of the year, offset by a 4.6 per cent like-

for-like increase in the valuation of the Covent Garden estate to £1.7

billion in the second half of the year. The Board is recommending a

final dividend of 1.0 pence per share, bringing the total dividend for

the year to 1.5 pence per share, and intends to grow the Company’s

dividend over time.

“The Board ensures that we deliver the

Company’s strategy in a responsible

manner and the way we do business

reflects Capco’s culture and values.”

Henry Staunton, Chairman

Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2021

Governance

During 2021 Charlotte Boyle stepped down as Chair of the

Remuneration Committee in order to Chair the newly established Board

ESC Committee which oversees the management of Capco’s ESC strat-

egy, and Jonathan Lane took over as Chairman of the Remuneration

Committee. The Chief Executive and all the independent Non-executive

Directors are also members of the Board ESC Committee. There were

no other changes to the Board during the year.

Sustainability

Reflecting our commitment to responsible stewardship, and the Company’s

commitment to becoming Net Zero Carbon as a business by 2030, a

key priority for the Board was the approval of the Company’s Net Zero

Carbon Pathway. This Pathway sets out five key activities on which the

Company’s approach will focus, ensuring that we reduce embodied

and operational carbon over time, and prioritise innovation and use of

renewable energy, enhance climate adaptations and improve building

resilience, with residual emissions being offset via responsible certified

schemes. The Board and the Board ESC Committee will closely monitor

implementation of the Pathway over the coming years.

Our stakeholders

Engagement with the business’s stakeholders is part of being a respon-

sible business and is fundamental to the delivery of our Group strategy.

The Board receives regular updates on the wide variety of engagement

undertaken and the views of our stakeholders, and gives careful consid-

eration to the likely impact of any recommended proposal on a range

of stakeholders, to ensure that the decision aligns with Group strategy

and values. You can read more about our engagement with our stake-

holders on page 33.

Risk management

The Board has overall responsibility for risk management across the

Group and consideration of risk and assessment of the effectiveness

of the Group’s risk management structure is embedded into the Board’s

processes. The Board receives thorough updates from the Executive

Risk Committee (which assesses risk at management level) and Audit

Committee throughout the year which ensures that the Board takes its

decisions and considers the Group’s principal risks from an informed

position. In assessing the Group’s principal risks, the Board considers

those risks identified that were not realised, the effectiveness of miti-

gations, and whether there were any significant matters that had not

previously been captured in the Group’s risk register. Last year the Board

added climate change as a new principal risk, reflecting the potential

impact of climate change on the business. The Board will continue to

monitor the Group’s principal and emerging risks over the coming year.

You can read more about our approach to risk management on pages

22 to 30 and 104.

Diversity

Diversity continues to be a focus for Capco and is high on the Board’s

agenda as we consider the appointment of new Directors. We hugely

value the benefits of a diverse workforce and the Board has continued

to support the Company’s diversity initiatives during the year.

Voting on AGM resolutions

At Capco’s 2021 Annual General Meeting, although the resolution was

passed with the requisite majority, the Company received a significant

shareholder vote against the resolution seeking a general authority for

the Board to allot shares in the capital of the Company. Capco has its

primary listing on the London Stock Exchange with a secondary listing

on the JSE, and a proportion of the Company’s shares are held by South

African investors who sometimes have different market expectations to UK

investors, particularly regarding the level of authority to issue new shares

that shareholders expect to grant to boards. The Board engages regularly

with our South African shareholders on this topic, and has noted their

concerns. However, the Board continues to feel that, to preserve flexibility

and competitive positioning, it is appropriate to seek the higher levels of

authority expected by UK shareholders where possible.

Looking ahead

Whilst challenges remain, the Company enters 2022 strongly positioned

to benefit from a recovery and take advantage of growth opportunities.

The Covent Garden estate remains a world-class destination and the

Board will continue to oversee our responsible stewardship of this land-

mark estate. We look ahead with confidence in the long-term prospects

of the Covent Garden estate and London’s West End.

Thanks

Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders and stakeholders for their

continued support, and our Executive Directors and employees for their

tremendous efforts during 2021.

It has been a privilege serving as your Chairman and I am confident of

the Company’s future success.

What the Committee did

Valuations

As in previous years, the independent external valuers presented the year end and half year valuations to the Committee.

The Committee reviewed the valuation process and component parts of the valuations, discussed the valuations with the

external auditors and challenged the valuers on the assumptions used. The Committee also advised the Board on the

independence of the valuers and obtained confirmation that management had provided all requested information. The

Committee was satisfied that the approach taken by the valuers was appropriate. Further information can be found in note

16 on pages 158 to 160 of the notes to the financial statements.

Recoverability

of rental

receivables,

deferrals and

tenant lease

incentives

The Committee received updates from the Group Financial Controller on the accounting treatment for rental income

support provided to tenants as a result of the impact of COVID-19, which has included rent deferrals, rent free periods and

other arrangements, depending on the position of each tenant. Due to the support provided, and overall implications of

COVID-19 on tenants, the methodology adopted and rationale for judgements made in assessing the expected credit loss

on recoverability of rent receivables, deferrals and tenant lease incentives at the balance sheet reporting date were also

reported by the Group Financial Controller. The Committee also reviewed and assessed the assumptions used in calculating

the expected credit loss for rents receivable and tenant lease incentives and the overall levels of impairment provision.

The Committee also discussed the approach with the external auditors and is satisfied that the approach taken has been

appropriate.

External auditors

Committee responsibilities

The Committee oversees the relationship with PricewaterhouseCoopers

LLP (“PwC”), the external auditors, and is responsible for developing,

implementing and monitoring the Company’s policy on external audit,

and for monitoring the auditors’ independence, objectivity and compli-

ance with ethical, professional and regulatory requirements. PwC were

first appointed as external auditors of the Company in 2010, and were

reappointed in 2020 following a tender process.

The external auditors are not permitted to perform any work that they

may subsequently need to audit or which might either create a conflict

of interest or affect the auditors’ objectivity and independence.

Access to Committee

The external auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee

letter on page 106, 40 per cent of the whole amount of

any bonus awarded will be deferred into shares for three years.

Performance conditions

In common with previous years, the financial performance targets for the year ending 31 December 2022 will be based on growth in EPRA

Net Tangible Assets per share (“NTA”), Total Property Return relative to the MSCI Total Return All Property Index, and underlying EPS.

The weightings of each measure, which are unchanged from 2021, are shown in the table below. The relative weighting of financial and individual

performance measures will also remain unchanged. Individual non-financial targets are set for each Executive Director.

Performance targets

The TPR target is included in the Company’s KPIs on page 20. The KPIs are in part dependent upon the occurrence of certain discrete events. Therefore,

whilst the outperformance targets that apply to the long-term incentives are disclosed, the Board has decided that as the Group operates in specific

locations within the competitive central London property market, prospective disclosure of specific short-term NTA and EPS targets, or non-financial

performance targets, would provide a level of information to counterparties that could prejudice the Company’s commercial interests. The Committee

will publish the performance targets retrospectively once they have ceased to be commercially sensitive, which is expected to be when the bonus

amounts are determined. Further information on the Company’s KPIs can be found on pages 20 and 21.

Performance Share Plan (Audited)

PSP awards of 300 per cent of 2022 salary will be made to each Executive Director as awards or nil-cost options unless the Committee decides to

moderate the award level to reflect any significant reduction in the share price from the level at which the 2021 awards were made. The performance

conditions and comparator group that will apply to these awards, and apply to the awards made since 2019, are set out in the tables below.

TR and TSR comparator group for PSP awards

– For awards made since 2021, the comparator group is the REITS that are members of the FTSE 350

– For awards made prior to 2021, the comparator group is British Land, Capco, Derwent London, Great Portland Estates,

Hammerson, Intu Properties, Land Securities, Shaftesbury and Workspace

Use of market purchased shares

The rules of the Performance Share Plan provide the Board with flexibility on whether the shares awarded will ultimately be delivered by issuing new

equity, or purchasing shares on the stock market. In deciding whether to issue or purchase shares the Board will consider a number of factors with a

view to minimising dilution of shareholders’ interests; these include whether and by how much the shares are trading at a discount/premium to Net

Tangible Assets, Group liquidity and market outlook. If there is sufficient liquidity and shares are trading at a discount to Net Tangible Assets then

it is expected that shares would be purchased rather than issued. It is confirmed that the share awards made in 2022 will be settled using shares

purchased in the market.

Chairman and Non-executive Director remuneration

The Committee reviews the Chairman’s fee and the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is considered by the Chairman and the Chief Executive.

The fees paid to the Chairman and Non-executive Directors are reviewed annually, although fees may not be increased every year. No increase was

awarded for 2021, and following the 2021 reviews, it was agreed that no increase would be awarded for 2022. The Chairman’s annual base fee

for 2021 and 2022 is £284,000.

1. Appointed to Board on 26 February 2020. Change in salary reflects inclusion of full year’s service for 2021.

2. Changes to benefits primarily reflect increased costs of health insurance and reduced travel expenses resulting from virtual Board meetings. Due to the relatively small

values of these amounts, small absolute increases can result in large percentage changes.

3. The Executive Directors were not awarded bonuses in 2020 and so it is not possible to provide a percentage increase for 2021.
