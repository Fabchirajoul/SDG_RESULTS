Chairman's statement:

Managing Director

Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia and Managing

Director Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania for ECE

Projektmanagement. He was responsible for strategy,

business transformation, asset development, greenfield

projects, optimising operating assets, supporting mergers

and acquisitions and team leadership for country and

regional organisations.

Mrs Predoiu has over 14 years of finance and real estate

expertise, including seven years with the Group. She joined

NEPI Rockcastle in 2014 as Financial Controller and was

promoted to Deputy CFO in December 2018. She has

proven expertise in multi-million funding projects, complex

business transactions and integration processes of mergers,

systems and controls. Prior to joining the Company, Mrs

Predoiu was Deputy Manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers

(’PwC’), where she spent six years handling local and cross-

border audit assignments and advisory projects in the

Romanian and Cypriot offices.

The Board of Directors thank the former CEO and CFO,

Alex Morar and Mirela Covasa, for their hard work and

significant achievements, leading NEPI Rockcastle to

become the largest retail real estate group in the CEE

region and wish them success in their future endeavours.

Relocation of parent company

On 29 November 2021, NEPI Rockcastle announced that

its Board of Directors has approved the migration of the

Company’s seat of incorporation from the Isle of Man

to the Netherlands. As Dutch law does not currently

permit companies incorporated outside of the European

Union (‘EU’) to migrate directly to the Netherlands, it is

envisaged that the migration be performed in two inter-

conditional stages: an initial migration to Luxembourg (an

EU jurisdiction), followed by a subsequent migration to the

Netherlands. Structured in this way, the migration of the

Company to the Netherlands is not anticipated to impact

either the corporate continuity of NEPI Rockcastle or the

trading in Group shares, which would remain available to be

traded on the JSE, Euronext Amsterdam and A2X.

The migration is subject to shareholder approval and

is envisaged to be completed by the end of 2022, with

updates on the matter to be provided in due course.

refurbishments, extensions and re-tenanting), and, where

necessary, proposing the disposal of assets which no

those which exceed his mandate, to the Investment

Committee.

value for the Group; and

•

recommend the fees paid to non-Executive Directors.

When determining the Remuneration Policy and

practices, the Remuneration Committee is guided by the

following principles: clarity, simplicity, risk, predictability,

proportionality and alignment to Group culture.

whom must be Independent non-Executive Directors;

•

is chaired by an Independent non-Executive Director,

Director's KPIs have not been adjusted for the impact

of Covid-19: the structure and target KPIs have been maintained

at their level, pre-set before the commencement of Covid-19

pandemic.

Ensure Group's

remuneration is

aligned to the

relevant market

and provides

internal fairness

The Group frequently

consults international

independent remuneration

experts to ensure a

proper understanding

of the benchmarks and

determine actions to

be implemented during

the annual remuneration

review processes.

For specific roles, department, countries and pay levels, reward

reports and market data were inquired.

The decision was to use external benchmarks on the Polish

market and on those industries where the fluctuation of salaries

according to the market was higher, such as technology, project

management, digital, marketing, reporting and finance.

Ensure

transparency

of Group's

remuneration

policy, pay

structures, pay

levels, objectives

and link

between pay

and business

performance

The principles and details

of Group's remuneration

policies, including

any changes made or

anticipated are publicly

presented in the Annual

Report.

Meetings with

management teams are

held annually within

the remuneration and

performance review

process to outline, explain

and clarify aspects of the

Group's remuneration

review decisions and

rationale.

The 2021 Annual Report presents all details of remuneration

for both Executive and non-Executive Directors, as well as

principles of remuneration across the staff.

Allocation of reduced staff cost budgets was done at business

function level, allowing the top management team to take

a wider responsibility over managing the process of reward

review.

Individual discussions with team leaders were held by the HR

Director for budget allocation, as well as for the start of the

performance management process, to discuss principles of

remuneration, reward review and link to performance of teams

and individuals.

2. Alignment of ethics of pay

Ensure

alignment

of all staff

remuneration

principles and

pay structures

across all

countries in

which the Group

operates

The same remuneration

review process is

conducted at Group level

and in all countries where

NEPI Rockcastle is present.

The HR Director ensures

the roll out of the process

is aligned and the same

principles are applied

across all countries.

The Remuneration

Committee is informed of

and annually approves the

performance and reward

review approach.

The HR function is a centralised function which ensures

HR services across the Group. Determination of specific

remuneration at the level of a team is done upon consultation

with HR reward specialist who provides, for each position

within the Company, an analysis of the job level, benchmarking

against specific functions and geographies and makes

recommendations in respect of appropriate pay levels.

This process ensures that same principles of pay are

consistently applied across all grades, functions and countries.

Ensure

remuneration

is determined

without

discrimination

The HR Director, as

mandated by the

executive management

and Remuneration

Committee ensures

through detailed reviews

of the reward processes

that pay levels are set free

from any discriminating

considerations: gender,

age, race, religion or other.

Fixed remuneration is determined based on role,

responsibilities, level of competence and experience, while

variable remuneration is determined based on performance,

impact and contribution. There is no consideration given in the

hiring or reward review process to any other element that could

lead to discrimination, such as gender, age, race, religion or

other.

The Remuneration Committee is also reviewing the principles,

mechanisms and implementation of reward review, to ensure

that only role and performance elements are considered in

reward determining decisions.

The HR department monitors relative pay of staff to ensure

fairness and ethical pay principles are observed.

3. Shareholders' engagement and Corporate Governance

Ensure

shareholders'

feedback is

observed and

discussed

Regular meetings are held with shareholders upon presentation of financial results, where

questions received and addressed by Executive and non-Executive Directors cover the

entire range of topics, including remuneration.

The Remuneration Committee maintains contact with shareholders and discusses feedback

put forward to the Board upon voting at the AGM. All shareholders have been publicly

invited to provide their feedback as per the announcements issues on 18 August 2021 and 1

October 2021.

The Remuneration Committee Chairman has engaged in detailed discussions and

consultations on remuneration related matters with major shareholders during February

2022.

Comply

with King IV

requirements

and other

relevant

governance

frameworks
