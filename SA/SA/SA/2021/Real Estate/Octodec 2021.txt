Corporate information

Through its well-managed quality

spaces, Octodec creates multisector

community ecosystems where

tenants can thrive in the Tshwane and

Johannesburg CBDs and surrounding

urban areas.

Octodec Investments Limited (Octodec or the company), its

subsidiaries and associated company (the group) is a Real Estate

Investment Trust (REIT) listed on the JSE Ltd. We manage our

portfolio by maintaining sound property fundamentals in central

business district (CBD) nodes and urban areas where demand is

robust. Established in 1956, listed on the JSE in 1990 and converted

to a REIT in 2013, Octodec has unlocked value in urban spaces for

over 60 years.

Unlocking value in urban spaces

Our vision

To innovate in the property market and unlock long-term capital appreciation, through investment in a well-diversified multisector property

portfolio. We remain cognisant of our role as a responsible corporate citizen and aim to achieve our vision in a manner that takes the

interests of all our stakeholders into account.

Our purpose

To manage our properties cost effectively and provide our

shareholders with sustainable returns in the long term – without

compromising the integrity of our operations or sustainability of

our property portfolio.

Our values

i.

Honesty and integrity are our foundation

ii.

Quality is our cornerstone

iii. We dare to pave the way

iv. We paint our cities with passion, and

v.

We make it happen

Our ambition

To provide spaces that remain relevant and desirable to the markets they serve, with a special interest in re-imagining spaces, and to

become a landlord of choice in our operating nodes.

Our strategy

Create sustainable value for our stakeholders

Optimise our portfolio

Manage our balance sheet and funding structure

We believe that we will come out of the

pandemic not just changed but stronger.:

managing director’s review.

While our immediate priority is addressing the commercial pressures

we face, we have not lost sight of the increasing importance of

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues. At the core

of our purpose is affordable accommodation in well-managed and

maintained spaces and it is encouraging to see the meaningful

impact we’ve had on our immediate communities and broader

society. Sustainability will remain a key priority over the medium

to long term with the focus being on initiatives where we can

contribute and make the most impact.

See ESG reporting, page 68

Governance and leadership

As a board, we are committed to continuously entrenching leading

governance practices. I am pleased with the depth and breadth of

skills on the board and its committees, and the way in which leadership

comes together in enhancing the company’s governance processes.

The level of independent and experiential insight is sound, and we

remain committed to enhancing our diversity as opportunities arise.

Shareholders were advised in May that Anthony Stein would

emigrate with his family to Australia, and we regretfully accepted his

resignation as financial director of Octodec effective 31 August 2021.

His presence as an executive director over the past decade is much

appreciated and we wish him and his family all the best.

We are confident that our succession plan ensures a smooth

transition, with the appointment of Anabel Vieira as financial director

as of 1 September 2021 following Anthony’s departure.

As a Chartered Accountant (SA), Anabel has been employed by

City Property Administration (Octodec’s asset and property manager)

since January 2016. During this time, she has overseen the finance

department, which is responsible for the financial affairs of Octodec,

playing an integral part in financial reporting, and assisting the financial

director where necessary. Prior to joining City Property, Anabel was

a partner at Grant Thornton for 23 years. For 7 of those years she

was the audit partner of Premium Properties, which subsequently

merged with Octodec. The Board is encouraged by Anabel’s seamless

transition into her role as financial director, and is confident in her ability

to provide the necessary expertise and continuity at Octodec.

In order to bolster the finance and risk management skills and

further enhance the board, we also welcomed the appointment

of Richard Buchholz as an independent non-executive director

of Octodec with effect 4 October 2021. Richard will serve on the

group’s audit and risk committees.

Gerard Kemp has resigned from the risk and audit committees of

the group with effect from 9 March and 4 October 2021, respectively.

Gerard Kemp, who is eligible for re-election as a director, has indicated

that he will not make himself available for re-election. I would like

to extend my appreciation to Gerard for his contribution during the

past eight years and wish Gerard well in his future endeavours.

Focus areas and the way forward

The outlook remains uncertain and volatility locally and globally is likely

to persist. In the past few days South African scientists have detected

what has been called the Omicron variant. At this stage it is unknown

whether transmissibility, illness severity, or mortality will be substantially

different or how it will react to people’s immunity, both from prior

infection and vaccination.

World leaders, other than in South Africa, have reacted to this

uncertainty by re-imposing travel restrictions. Globally virus mitigation

measures have been tightened. Hopefully, this is just a temporary

concern rather than anything more serious. We will be monitoring

developments, keeping a watchful eye on the situation and continue

with all our COVID precautions, details of which have been provided

elsewhere in this report.

I am confident that our prudent approach during the hard times

has resulted in a resilient business, fit for the future. Drawing on the

resilience demonstrated by the country and its people this year, I

am optimistic of a recovery, albeit slow and steady. In addition, I

am confident in our tenants’ abilities and strategies to recover as

economic and commercial activity resumes. We will continue to deliver

on our purpose of providing clean, secure, family and youth friendly

accommodation.

Looking ahead, we aim to increase our focus on incremental growth

opportunities through joint ventures, releasing space efficiencies, and

enhancing our marketing efforts while considering alternative disposal

strategies for properties that no longer fit the portfolio. As indicated

above, we will place further emphasis on our ESG reporting and

measurements, with the aim of ensuring ongoing resource efficiencies

and social upliftment.

Appreciation

I commend management on their strong leadership and all employees

for their commitment to protecting our properties through the period

of unrest, as well as their ongoing motivation to see us through these

challenging times. Engagement is essential throughout difficult times and

I thank all our stakeholders for their willingness to engage and work with

us towards stability and a positive environment for the benefit of all - I

am grateful to our shareholders for understanding our need to balance

short-term cash preservation with long-term rewards and sustainability.

Our board oversight remains unwavering and I thank my board

colleagues for their support and wise counsel throughout this year.

Managing director of Octodec.

Q

Following the pandemic-induced slump of 2020 in which annual gross domestic product (GDP) fell to the lowest levels in over 50 years,

the South African economy demonstrated a slight rebound in the first quarter, before being hit by a third wave and civil unrest mid-year.

This uncertainty places business across the board in a difficult operating environment.

How is Octodec positioned in this context?: Managing director’s

review

I have witnessed the ability of Octodec

to bounce back and remain steadfast

through negative events without losing

sight of positive opportunities.”

A

Octodec’s management has extensive experience in property fundamentals through various cycles. This enables us to have a

long-term view over the current business uncertainty. While civil unrest is the worst-case scenario for any country, Octodec emerged

relatively stable, with no direct losses. This is testament to the resilience of our portfolio and our people, placing practicality and

humanity at the fore. All our buildings are maintained to meet the needs of tenants, with dedicated on-site building managers and 24-hour

security teams. Octodec spends a significant amount per annum on building security, which provides assurance to our tenants.

I am heartened by the fortitude of our people and teams, who stood firm through

the period of unrest.”

The ongoing pandemic-induced uncertainty is global, and not within our realm of control. However, we do maintain sound sanitisation

standards at all our buildings and encourage our employees to follow the national vaccination programme rollouts. Some of our business

tenants are harder hit by lockdown measures than others, so we monitor and provide assistance to those genuinely in need, with a view

to retaining our good quality tenant base. We provided a total of R30.8 million in rental relief based on careful consideration of tenants’

circumstances and ability to operate under normal conditions.

With 60% residential and 40% commercial tenants, our leasing performance is directly related to this external turbulence and related business

confidence, reflecting a bounce-back in the first quarter prior to the third wave of the pandemic. Our collections to June 2021 were particularly

good prior to the period of civil unrest, which resulted in a shortfall in July. Collections rebounded again in August and have remained stable.

Q

Octodec’s innovative approach to unlocking value in urban spaces saw the introduction of mixed-use spaces in 1998. There has been

a boom in South Africa’s property development over the past five years, with many new competitors entering the market.

How is Octodec placed to navigate the increased competition?

A

At this stage, we are not considering any significant developments or refurbishments to our portfolio, although we continuously

investigate opportunities as they arise and attract tenants to our existing properties by adding value to our offerings. Innovative

advancements include introducing cashless laundries for our student tenants and offering furnished apartments that offer practical

solutions for young people on the move. We are committed to selling our properties earmarked for disposal under favourable terms.

We have upgraded certain spaces for new retail tenants and ensure that our

buildings are in good condition.”

We are cognisant of the challenges that Councils face in service delivery and supplement the services to our buildings where possible.

This includes increasing the self-sufficiency of our buildings with generators, supplementing some buildings with solar power and

ensuring excellent maintenance standards to avoid water or power wastage. We maintain open channels of communication with

Councils and all inner city stakeholders to help uplift the precincts for the benefit of all.

Target: To let or dispose of at least one property with a vacancy

greater than 3 000m2 per year.

Performance: It has been challenging to reduce vacancies greater

than 3 000m2 in the current environment, but we have concluded

deals with Mr Price and OK Furniture at Inner Court totalling 2 950m2,

and have placed a school at Station Place occupying 4 199m2.

Future focus: In the current climate, with retail and office space

facing uncertainty, this objective has been combined with reduced

vacancies and disposal of properties.

Description

A greater dependence on technology, a sustained shift in new ways of working and continued attacks on information and communications

technology (ICT) infrastructure, domestically and globally, may impact our ability to cater for and deliver timeously on services required. This

Permanent shift in consumer and societal behaviour and preferences following

the pandemic

Description

As consumers re-assess their choices (spending less, reducing social interaction and limiting the use of certain goods or services) and as

Dear stakeholders

It is my pleasure to provide

you with an overview of

the activities of the SERT

committee for the year.

I also share with you

our remuneration

review presented on

pages 92 to 99.

Social, ethics and transformation focus

The committee operates in terms of section 72(4) of the Companies Act (read

together with Regulation 43 of the Companies regulations, 2011) and King IV

on behalf of all subsidiaries of Octodec and is governed by a board-approved

terms of reference, which is reviewed and approved annually by the board.

The SERT committee takes responsibility for monitoring the Group’s activities,

having regard to any relevant legislation, other legal requirements, or prevailing

codes of best practice, regarding matters relating to social and economic

development, good corporate citizenship, the environment, health and public

safety, consumer relations, and labour and employment. The committee is also

responsible for the oversight of organisational ethics, as recommended by King IV.

Guidelines for the SERT committee include the anti-corruption principles

of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),

the Employment Equity Act, No 55 of 1998, as well as elements of the JSE

Socially Responsible Index criteria and the Broad-Based Black Economic

Empowerment Act, No 53 of 2003.

The committee met three times during the period to review performance in the

following areas, as required in terms of its terms of reference:

• Consumer safety

• Employee welfare and relations

• Ethical business practice

• Transformation

• Legislative compliance

• Anti-corruption practices

• Social and environmental responsibility

• Stakeholder relationships

The committee monitored the Group’s activities with relevant policies, legislation

and regulation and best practice in corporate governance. In particular, the

committee advised on and monitored the Group’s response to the social and

economic impact of the lockdown occasioned by the pandemic. As lockdown

restrictions change over time, we continue to implement appropriate controls

and emphasise the protocols already in place, which include:

• Ongoing communication regarding the pandemic and

required controls and protocols, including any changes

to applicable regulations

• Reviewing and monitoring the preventive and social distancing measures

adopted in the group to ensure the safety of our employees and tenants

during the pandemic

• Reviewing, monitoring, and managing the impact of the pandemic

on the health and well-being of our employees

Among other issues, the meetings dealt with key topics such as:

• Monitoring the statutory duties performed in terms of section

72 of the Companies Act and regulation 43 of the Companies

Regulations, 2011 with specific reference to good corporate

citizenship (social and economic development, the environment,

health and safety, and consumer relationships)

• Monitoring the increase in social unrest and violent crime,

and taking measures to limit as far as possible any impact

on operations, employees, and tenants

• Reviewing the barriers to achievement of Employment Equity

and disability targets

• Providing oversight on B-BBEE progress by approving the

re-appointment of a B-BBEE verification agent and recommending

the 2022 B-BBEE budget to the board for approval

• Overseeing the group supplier and enterprise development

initiatives through an independent provider that offers sustainable

business incubation services and business development

programmes for seven enterprise development and five supplier

development entrepreneurs

• Monitoring the implementation of the newly introduced human

resources strategy

• Monitoring the Be-Heard whistleblowing facility and reviewed

the board-approved external whistleblowing policy

Inclusive stakeholder approach

Our stakeholder engagement process recognises the importance

of proactive engagement with our key stakeholders, and we are

committed to robust, consistent and transparent engagement.

We have focused on improving our understanding of our

stakeholders’ genuine needs, interests and expectations

and providing input into how we approach our business activities,

identify risks and opportunities, and adapt to social, technological,

and regulatory changes.

As we enter a new financial year amid a global pandemic, balancing

the needs and expectations of our stakeholders has never been

more important or challenging. The committee is committed

to a continual, open, and transparent dialogue with stakeholders

to maintain good relationships.

Further information on our stakeholder engagement and how we

address their key concerns can be found on pages 40 to 42.

Remuneration focus

Our remuneration review is included on pages 92 to 99.

2021 key focus areas

Beyond discharging its required duties as set out in its terms of

reference, the committee specifically focused on the following

matters:

• Reviewed the total remuneration philosophy, strategy and policy

and approved the revised HR strategy

• Although a newly introduced performance management policy

(entailing the re-introduction of a group-wide remuneration

linked performance strategy while managing morale levels) was

approved by the board, its implementation was placed on hold

• Finalised Octodec’s transformation strategy to improve Octodec’s

B-BBEE rating

Environmental, social and

governance reporting

SERT committee chairman’s

review 2021

• Improved awareness of the approved code of ethics and gift

register policy was communicated through various electronic

platforms and employee information sessions to encourage

reporting of unethical and/or inappropriate behaviour

• Considered and monitored the implementation of the findings of

the 2020 independent remuneration benchmarking exercise

Effectiveness of committee

The committee has reviewed and updated its annual work plan and

is satisfied that it complied with its responsibilities in terms of the

board adopted formal terms of reference during the financial year.

It is pleasing to note that as a committee, we are satisfied that

there has been no material non-compliance with legislation or

non-adherence to codes of best practice in terms of the areas

within the committee’s mandate.

2022 key focus areas

The committee has set the following key focus areas for the 2022

financial period which include continuing items from the year under

review:

• Oversee the implementation of the HR strategy and key policies

to ensure integration and effective management of employees

• Sharpen the focus on and enhance the maturity of the company’s

ethics and whistleblower programmes, and recognise the

increased pressure on employees

• Implement the approved transformation strategy to improve

Octodec’s B-BBEE rating, reputation and overall impact

• Manage the ongoing impact of the pandemic on employees and

their productivity and understand how technology is impacting

the company’s talent, efficiency and value add

• Continue to oversee the governance of stakeholder relationships

• Consider the implementation plan for agreed projects across

Octodec’s buildings after the pandemic

In closing

The committee is satisfied that Octodec continues to meet its

environmental and societal commitments and that the company’s

remuneration practices are fair and market related. We are

comfortable that Octodec’s policies and frameworks remain relevant

and sustain the company’s commitment to social and economic

development, fair labour practices and environmental responsibility.

I would like to thank the board, my fellow committee members

and executive directors for their support and commitment. I further

extend my gratitude to our shareholders for their continued support

during what has been an unprecedented year.

Due to the pandemic, the AGM on 4 February 2022 is accessible

only through electronic participation. The notice of the AGM,

together with explanatory notes and guidance on how to access the

meeting and vote electronically, can be found on pages 157 to 164.

I will be available to answer any questions about this committee

report at the AGM.

board, board committee, executive and management levels. The board covers

routine business from operational reports, significant acquisitions and disposal of

properties, project approvals, to matters of strategy, finance, capital expenditure,

significant group-wide policies and frameworks, and other special items.

Reports from board committee chairmen on statutory duties and board-

assigned responsibilities are also considered at each quarterly meeting. The

role of non-executive directors, who are independent of management, is

to protect shareholders’ interests, including those of minority shareholders.

Furthermore, they ensure that individual directors or groups of directors are

subject to appropriate scrutiny in their decision-making.

The roles of Chairman of the board and: managing director are kept separate

and distinct. During the year, non-executive director Sharon Wapnick was

managing director and financial director of Octodec and the senior finance manager of City Property

Dear shareholders,

The SERT committee is tasked by the board to establish and independently oversee the implementation of our total remuneration philosophy

and policy. This will support the achievement of the group’s strategy and grow stakeholder value on a sustainable basis.

The board recognises total remuneration as a critical tool to ensure that employees enable the business to create value in a sustainable

manner. The board oversees remuneration practices and procedures, as administered by City Property through the management agreement.

City Property uses total remuneration to ensure the attraction and retention of talented high-calibre, high-performing employees. Octodec

only employs building staff (building managers, cleaners and handymen) and the group company secretary and assistant company secretary.

Therefore, the remuneration review only deals with Octodec employees. (See Reporting Boundary page 2)

In light of the 2021 financial period, the following is to be noted:

Voting results at the previous AGM

In terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, shareholders are required to endorse, by way of a non-binding advisory vote, the remuneration policy

and implementation report as presented in this report. Voting results on Octodec’s remuneration policy at the FY2020, FY2019 and FY2018

AGMs were as follows:

Remuneration review

Voting results at the previous AGM (continued)

Octodec is committed to developing and sustaining quality, long-term

relationships with all key stakeholders, including its shareholders.

Our philosophy is to engage openly and inclusively to benefit from

the insights, concerns and priorities of stakeholders. Constructive

feedback is shared with our board and relevant board committees and

contributes significantly to Octodec’s positioning, supported with the

adequate structures, to deliver long-term value for all its stakeholders.

We are aware of our competitive and challenging operating

environment and continuously examine any relevant issues raised

by our stakeholders to further develop and strengthen Octodec.

Engagement with shareholders preceded the AGM in January 2021

to understand shareholders’ concerns and potential areas for

improvement in terms of remuneration.

The following aspects were raised:

Concerns

The lack of disclosure regarding the extent to which performance

targets were achieved and how actual achievement is linked to the

variable remuneration earned by executive directors.

Our response

Octodec entered into a property and asset management

agreement with City Property for a period of five years, effective

from 1 September 2018, which was approved by the requisite

number of shareholders who voted in respect thereof. In line

with this agreement, City Property is responsible for setting the

remuneration structures and incentives for its employees, including

the two executive directors, and executing the agreed remuneration.

Octodec does not pay the executive directors.

Internal and external factors that influenced

remuneration

There were several factors that influenced remuneration decisions

during the year. From an external perspective, among others, we

considered factors such as the pandemic’s impact on the economy

in general and the company in particular, inflation, forecast salary

adjustments for our category of employees in our sector and the

competitiveness of the cost of employment. Internally, we considered

Octodec’s financial performance for the year, our internal minimum

wage, pay parity, employee turnover rates and the attractiveness of

our total remuneration offering.

The pandemic had a negative impact on the company performance.

Consequently, the company suspended annual salary increases for

the period 2020/21. No increases in directors’ remuneration for the

period 1 September 2022 to 31 August 2023 will be presented to

shareholders for voting. The board is of the opinion that any increase

in directors’ remuneration would be inappropriate in the light of the

pandemic’s impact on the company performance.

Key areas of focus, decisions and substantial

changes

During the year, the SERT committee, in addition to the key focus areas

disclosed in the SERT committee chairman’s review on page 68,

recommended to the board the following remuneration-related resolutions,

in compliance with regulatory and good governance requirements to be

tabled at the AGM for our shareholders’ consideration:

• The approval of the directors’ remuneration for the period

1 September 2022 to 31 August 2023, by way of a special

resolution

• Endorsement of the remuneration policy by way of a non-binding

advisory vote

• Endorsement of the remuneration implementation report by way

of a non-binding advisory vote

Use of consultants and their independence

Octodec uses the services of an external independent advisor,

Reward Partners (Pty) Ltd, to assist in the:

• Review of the total remuneration philosophy, strategy and policy,

and making of recommendations to the SERT committee. The

review highlighted that the philosophy, strategy and policy are

aligned to best practice and should remain unchanged, except

for the following proposed amendments:

–

Refinement and clarification of the constituency addressed in

the policy, resulting in all references to executive directors and

prescribed officers being removed.

–

Refinement of the principles and conditions governing annual

non-guaranteed remuneration (i.e. short-term incentives),

mainly economic and operational conditions.

• Market benchmarking and guaranteed salary alignment

recommendations to the SERT committee. In 2021 Octodec

conducted bespoke market benchmarking, seeking to ensure

an appropriate peer comparison. This bespoke survey confirmed

that Octodec’s employees’ remuneration is aligned to the market.

• Review and provision of technical advice on the performance

management policy. This resulted in the board approval of the

company’s performance management policy.

Effectiveness of the remuneration policy

The SERT committee is confident that the remuneration policy

achieved its objectives during the year in that there were no material

problems encountered with the attraction and retention of key skills.

2022 key focus areas

The remuneration-related focus areas for the next reporting period are:

• The continued review and refinement of our total remuneration

philosophy, strategy, policy and practices to ensure

competitiveness in terms of our EVP and encouragement of

sustained performance excellence

• Oversee the implementation of a group-wide remuneration-linked

performance management strategy

• The consistent application of the remuneration policy to ensure

that remuneration for general employees remains competitive, fair

and appropriate

93

The committee takes a keen interest in all pay arrangements

to ensure fairness and appropriateness of pay principles

across the group, thereby securing the long-term future of

the business and protecting the resources we depend on.”

information:

managing director and the financial director of Octodec, who

are prescribed officers as defined in terms of the Companies Act,

are employed and remunerated by City Property and only receive

directors’ fees from Octodec as set out below.

Directors’ remuneration in terms of section 66(9) of the

Companies Act

The remuneration of Octodec’s directors for their services (as

directors) is governed in terms of a separate directors’ remuneration

policy, which recognises their responsibilities and skills to provide

input on an ongoing basis throughout the year and not only through

their attendance at board and board committee meetings.

Our approach is based on the key principles that:

• The remuneration of our directors should be consistent with best

practice and sufficient to attract and retain talent to our board

• The quantum and structure of our directors’ remuneration is

reviewed annually by the SERT committee, in consultation with its

independent remuneration advisor, who makes recommendations

to the board on any changes deemed appropriate

All directors receive an annual retainer for services they render,

paid quarterly in arrears, in four equal instalments. In addition to

the retainer, directors are entitled to a fee for attendance of the

AGM, board meetings and board committee meetings on which the

director serves or attends by invitation.

Both the annual retainer and meeting fees payable to directors are

subject to the approval of the company’s shareholders at the AGM.

Refer to the proposed directors’ remuneration on page 159 of the

notice of AGM, which remain the same as the previously approved

remuneration for the 12 months ending 31 August 2022.

Malus and clawback provisions are not applicable, as the executive

directors are employed and remunerated by City Property.

Electronic link to policy documents

The total remuneration philosophy, strategy and policy, and directors’

remuneration policy are available on our website at www.octodec.co.za.

Non-binding advisory vote

Shareholders are requested to endorse part 2 of this report by way

of a non-binding advisory vote. Refer to the non-binding advisory

note 1 of the notice of the AGM on page 163. The board will initiate

engagement with the relevant shareholders should 25% (twenty-

five percent) or more of the votes cast be recorded against the

remuneration policy and the outcome thereof will be disclosed

in the 2022 integrated report.

Implementation of the remuneration policy

for the financial year

Remuneration linked to strategy and performance

The total remuneration philosophy, strategy and policy are continually

assessed to ensure that they remain aligned with and continue to

support the strategic objectives of Octodec.

Key performance measures and targets have been agreed to assess

the performance of City Property. The criteria have been established

in accordance with the provisions of the management agreement. City

Property and the Octodec executive directors are jointly and equally

responsible for the achievement of these measures and targets.

City Property and executive directors’

key performance measures and targets

As set out on page 155, Octodec sets the key performance

measures and targets for City Property. Its executive directors,

who are employed by City Property, are responsible for attaining

the performance measures and targets for City Property.

2021 has been a challenging year. The key performance

measures were set at a time when it was believed that the

worst was over and that the economy would bounce back.

These assumptions were incorrect. Nevertheless, we believe

that City Property has done well to achieve the results

that we have as we continue to work towards achieving

our strategic objectives, and navigate our way through a

fundamentally different post COVID-19 world.

City Property’s incentive remuneration is dependent on achieving

the above key performance measures, with a hurdle rate linked

to the growth in distributable income. Octodec’s distributable

income decreased and the asset management fee has therefore

remained at the minimum amount payable, subject only

to the inflationary increase.

Changes in shareholding

Between 3 November and 19 November 2021, AK Stein and his associates sold 39 192 shares at a weighted average price of R8.42 per share

and purchased 41 203 shares at an average weighted price of R8.28 per share.

Going concern

The current liabilities exceed the current assets by R2.3 billion (2020: R957.1 million), mainly due to the fact that unsecured notes and secured

loans will be maturing in the 2022 financial year. Subsequent to the financial year end, the group has refinanced and raised additional loans

to settle maturing loans, thereby extending the loan expiry profile to 2.0 years.

The group has R359.1 million (2020: R413.5 million) unutilised banking facilities available as at 31 August 2021 to fund its working capital

requirements and to refinance maturing debt, if required. The process to extend or refinance the remaining short-term borrowings has already

started with the respective banks.

The board has reviewed the cash flow projections to 28 February 2023, and based on the cash flow projections, and having considered

the solvency and liquidity tests taking the above into consideration, has concluded that the group has adequate resources to continue to

operate for the foreseeable future. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis.

Auditors

Deloitte & Touche were the independent auditors for the current year.

The Octodec board has decided to early adopt the mandatory audit firm rotation rule as issued by the Independent Regulatory Board for

Auditors and has appointed Ernst & Young Inc as the auditors for the 2022 financial year. The directors would like to thank Deloitte & Touche

for their services.

Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision-maker include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that

Further segment results cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis due to the “mixed use” of certain of the properties. It is the group’s policy to

• A loan for an amount of R495 million maturing in December 2021 has been refinanced for a further three years

• A DMTN note for an amount of R81 million was settled on 8 October 2021 and a new note was issued for an amount of R50 million

for a period of two years

• A loan for an amount of R250 million was raised, R125 million for a period of three years and R125 million for a period of four years,

and the proceeds used to reduce a loan of R400 million which is maturing in May 2022

• Interest rate derivatives with a notional value of R1 billion were unwound at a cost of R16.4 million, reducing the hedged position

of the group to 77%

• The sale and transfer of properties for a total consideration of R105.1 million, the proceeds of which have been used to repay debt

39. Going concern

The current liabilities exceed the current assets by R2.3 billion (2020: R957 million), mainly due to the fact that unsecured notes and secured

loans will be maturing in the 2022 financial year. Subsequent to the financial year end, the group has refinanced and raised additional loans
