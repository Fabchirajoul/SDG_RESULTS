#SUSTAINABLEACTIONS

This section will provide the reader with an oversight of strategy, events and rationale for actions taken that impacted the Group and

our financial performance during the past year.

The Group faced immense challenges in the financial years 2016 to 2018, hard decisions were made and executed upon across the

following two years of 2019 to 2020. This led to the reduction of debt and fixed costs, the sale of non-core projects and residential

rental units, and ultimately the improvement of liquidity. The reaction to the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic was swift

and now Calgro M3 has in excess of 4 500 residential opportunities under construction, while the Memorial Parks business continues

to grow, albeit from a low base, it is supporting the Group with good cash flow.

We will continue driving balance sheet strength by reducing debt in the medium-term but will retain sufficient facilities to support

operations and to ensure sufficient cash flow and liquidity during challenging times.

The markets in which we operate, continues to present huge opportunity for Calgro M3 and we must ensure that we reap the benefits

of these glaring gaps. Our theme for this ever-changing environment is #sustainableactions, where we endeavour to ensure

decisions and actions are taken so that we remain sustainable while supporting Building legacies, Changing lives.

Fourways Memorial Park:

letter, the first and second waves of Covid-19

infections have passed, a third wave is seemingly on its way, but

the vaccine roll-out is gaining momentum. Although many

statisticians and economists are running numbers and making

forecasts and predictions, it is very difficult to predict what the

long-lasting effect of Covid-19 or a similar pandemic might be on

South Africa. The challenges are not only Covid-19 related but

extend to the downgrades to sub-investment grade by rating

agencies paving the way for an almost certain prolonged

recessionary or even digressionary period and all this underpinned

by massive unemployment in our country.

Considering this uncertainty, we will continue to demonstrate

that the business is resilient and able to withstand the challenges

of a suppressed economy, policy uncertainty, international health

Balance end-user sales with bulk monthly progress payment-based sales where cash flow

is less lumpy

Allocate working capital to increase top structure construction of sold units with profit to

follow on transfer to clients across 12 to 18 months

Continue to drive Memorial Park growth and possible locational expansion

Ongoing management of unit numbers under construction to preserve cash flow and liquidity

Retain higher cash levels despite lazy balance sheet in the short-term

Both the Residential Property Development and Memorial Park businesses will be

carefully managed to ensure liquidity is sufficient to weather more Covid-19 woes and

the current depressed economic climate

Calgro M3 Integrated Annual Report 2021:

letter provides clarity and comfort in the business’ ability to carry itself through difficult times,

without having to lean on shareholders for assistance or having to resort to “fire-sale” processes.

Lastly, we would like to thank the family members of all Calgro M3 employees for their support and understanding, without which the

continued progress that the Group is making would not have been possible.

We as the Calgro M3 team will survive and thrive again – “Building legacies. Changing lives”.
