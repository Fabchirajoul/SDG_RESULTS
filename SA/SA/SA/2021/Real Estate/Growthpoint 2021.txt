Income streams for Growthpoint

• Property investment returns

• Management company distributions.

This year, Growthpoint Investec Africa Properties rebranded as

Lango Real Estate and continued to emerge as a leading landlord

in the African real estate market.

It gained ground on numerous fronts and built on its

demonstrated track record of growth, with three minority-stake

acquisitions during its fi nancial year and a fourth in April 2021.

These accretive acquisitions have substantially offset the adverse

fi nancial impact, in part due to the pandemic, on asset valuations.

Lango has complete management control of a portfolio of

11 underlying assets, which includes prime offi ce and retail

properties across four countries. It has now reached a degree of

critical mass and, with a high-quality asset portfolio and strong

stakeholder base, is well-positioned for a potentially exciting

period of growth.

Lango has established a reputation as a credible

player in the African real estate market and has

strategically positioned itself as a platform for

attracting sophisticated international investor

capital into the asset class. It also strives to act as

a catalyst for impact across the continent, with

associated long-term socio-economic benefi ts.

One of the company’s primary strategies during the year was

to refi ne its capital structure, and these efforts resulted in a

portfolio refi nancing transaction worth more than USD300m

that fully restructured its underlying property debt.

Governance:

letter of undertaking

in this regard. This policy also applies to certain other members

of senior management who are from time-to-time privy to

price-sensitive information.

Closed periods are imposed on Directors and staff prior to

publishing interim and annual financial results and as and

when required in respect of specific corporate actions.

Each share entitles the shareholder to one vote. There are no

non-voting shares.

Attendance at meetings

The Board meets quarterly and on an ad hoc basis if required.

The quorum requirements of Growthpoint’s MOI are always

considered when scheduled or special meetings are convened.

Due regard is given to recusal of Directors where conﬂicts of

interest or related-party situations exist or could arise.

Details of attendance at Board and committee meetings in

FY21 are set out below. Board members are encouraged to serve

on at least two Board committees.

Four scheduled and four special Board meetings were held during

FY21. Two of the special meetings were dedicated to strategy

(held over three days in total). In all cases where Directors or

committee members were unable to attend a meeting, the Board

or respective committee granted their leave of absence.
