Managing Director (MD), divisional and

personal scorecards. This will be determined by an appropriate weighting of the scorecards for different roles, aligning them

with the performance of the relevant entity while retaining a minimum level of exposure to Group outcomes for all participants

to avoid ‘silo’ behaviour.

The balanced scorecard split is as follows:

CEO

►

Group scorecard 100%

CFO

►

Group scorecard 80% and divisional scorecard 20%

Executives

►

Group scorecard 60% and divisional scorecard 40%

In line with rules governing the existing balanced scorecard management tool, a score of 60% is required at divisional and/or

personal and business unit levels to qualify for an incentive.
