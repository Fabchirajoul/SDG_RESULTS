not dematerialised their shares or who have dematerialised their shares with own-name registration and who are entitled to attend and

accordance with the instructions therein with the Chairman of the AGM.

Each shareholder is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who need not be shareholders of AfroCentric) to attend, speak and vote

in his/her stead. On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote, and, on a poll, every

shareholder present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for each share held by him/her.
