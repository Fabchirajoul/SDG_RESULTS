awards. In addition to the non-executive director fees being

paid, reasonable travel expenses to attend meetings are

reimbursed.

To align with shareholder recommendations, the Committee

approved a weighted average increase of 4.1% to the

non-executive director fees effective 1 January 2021, with

current fees lag market rates, our approach will be to correct

these anomalies over several years subject to obtaining the

necessary shareholder approval. The fees paid to non-

executive directors during the reporting period are included in

the implementation report below, while the proposed fees for

2022 can be found on

page 99.
