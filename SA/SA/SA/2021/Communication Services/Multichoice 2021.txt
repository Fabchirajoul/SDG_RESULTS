LETTER FROM THE PHUTHUMA NATHI CHAIR

Dear shareholder

On behalf of the Phuthuma Nathi board, it is my

pleasure to present our integrated annual report to you,

the shareholders of the Phuthuma Nathi share scheme.

Phuthuma Nathi owns a 25% direct investment in

MultiChoice SA. Therefore, Phuthuma Nathi

shareholders have an indirect interest in MultiChoice

SA through the Phuthuma Nathi share scheme.

As South Africans, I know we are all familiar with the

leading brands of MultiChoice SA and have been

entertained by its local, sporting and international

content for many years.

Phuthuma Nathi is proud to have 80 229 black

shareholders as at year-end (FY20: 81 479),

comprising individuals, stokvels and black-owned

companies. We have heard many heart-warming

stories about how this share scheme positively

impacts our shareholders’ lives. We are thrilled that

your investment in Phuthuma Nathi has continued to

deliver value, with ZAR1.5bn in dividends paid to

shareholders in FY21. This brought the total dividends

paid to Phuthuma Nathi by MultiChoice SA since

inception to ZAR13.4bn. Various Phuthuma Nathi

shareholders have not as yet claimed their annual

dividends, which have been paid out since the share

scheme started in 2006. A media campaign was

launched to find these shareholders to give them the

money that is rightfully theirs. To date, more than

ZAR48m of unclaimed dividends were paid.

During a challenging period in our shareholders’ lives,

I am grateful that MultiChoice SA continues to

support a broad base of empowered shareholders

through the Phuthuma Nathi share scheme.

The year in review

Following an eventful FY20 for Phuthuma Nathi

shareholders, FY21 delivered a lot less activity from

a shareholding perspective. You may recall that

Phuthuma Nathi shareholders were offered the

opportunity to exchange a portion of their Phuthuma

Nathi shares for MultiChoice Group shares, which are

“During a challenging period

in our shareholders’ lives, I am

grateful that MultiChoice SA

continues to support a broad

base of empowered shareholders

through the Phuthuma Nathi

share scheme.”

Letter from the remuneration committee

Dear shareholder,

Jabu Mabuza sadly passed away on 16 June 2021. As chair of the MultiChoice Group remuneration

committee, he was instrumental in the implementation of key and strategic decisions taken during FY21

as detailed in this report. He also ensured that we as the committee delivered on our required

responsibilities to the board and shareholders. This report was approved by Jabu prior to his passing and

therefore is presented by all committee members. He will be missed.

Regards

The MultiChoice Group remuneration committee

Shareholder alignment

We are committed to maintaining a strong relationship with our shareholders, built on

trust and a clear understanding of our remuneration policy and the practices we have

implemented. Our report details the progress we have made in engaging with you, our

shareholders, and steps are taken to incorporate your feedback, where practical to do so.

Strategic objectives

In line with our commitment to fair and responsible remuneration, we continuously

review our remuneration policies and practices to ensure they remain fit for purpose

and align with our strategic objectives. We are satisfied that our total reward offerings

balance shareholder interests with the need to reward and retain key and critical skills.

Independent remuneration adviser

We appointed Bowman Gilfillan as independent adviser to the remuneration committee,

and we are satisfied that their advice is objective and independent.
