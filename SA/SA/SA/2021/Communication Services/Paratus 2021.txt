Managing director’s report, the corporate responsibility and remuneration report.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

This financial year ended 30 June 2021 was a year marked by a number of events.

The investment in capital infrastructure the previous years came to stand the Group in good stead during the pandemic when the need for data by individuals and

business alike increased significantly.

Paratus continued to deliver on its infrastructure expansion strategy and continued with its fiber deployment during the year and commenced the building of the

Equiano Cable Landing Station and the construction of the Tier 3 equivalent data center.

You can read more about the investment strategy in the: Managing director’s report.

Projects thus far have mainly been funded by shareholder capital but during the year Paratus Namibia Holdings Limited successfully established a N$1 billion

Domestic Medium Term Note Programme on the NSX. This was well received by the market and the first tranche of N$200 million was oversubscribed. The

proceeds were utilised to settle the Development Bank of Namibia loan and the remainder will be directed to the above-mentioned projects and future infrastructure

roll outs.

The Group’s revenue increased from N$173.4 million for the prior 16 months to N$340.6 million (12 months). The recurring revenue of the group makes up 89.6%

of total revenue (2020: 83.9%). The Group’s EBITDA amounts to N$94.4 million for the year compared to N$55.1 million in 2020. Refer the Chief Financial Officer’s

report for a 12 month like-for-like representation of the figures of the main subsidiary, Paratus.

For the year ended 30 June 2021, the net profit before taxation amounts to N$42.2 million (2020: N$31.2 million, 16 months). This represents a growth of 35.6%.

The main contributor to the growth is the change in the financial year as well as improvement in the GP % and the containment of operating expenditure. Again,

we refer you to the Chief Financial Officer’s report for a 12 month like-for-like representation of the figures of the main subsidiary, Paratus.

The growth in the gross profit margin (“GP%”) of Paratus, on a 12 month like-for-like basis, from 49.4% (2020) to 52.3% (2021) stems from the increased utilisation

of Paratus-owned infrastructure replacing third-party infrastructure as well as the continued increase of customers on the existing infrastructure. The GP% is also

influenced by the extend of non-recurring revenue. For the financial year ending 30 June 2021, Paratus realised recurring revenue of N$305 million (2020: N$283

million) which represents a growth of 7.8% on a 12 months like-for-like basis.

On the back of the good performance of the Group, the Group declared dividends of 20 cents per ordinary share during the year, providing investors with a total

return of 10.91% for the year and bring the total return to investors since inception to 22%.

GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT

During the year under review, the Board and its sub-committees continued to function well. The Board, the Audit, Risk and Compliance, Remuneration and

Nomination Committees as well as the Investment Committee executed their functions in terms of their mandates, the NamCode and the Companies Act of

Namibia.

ECONOMIC OVERVIEW

Namibia’s economic recovery is expected to be slow. The country reported a record 8.5% contraction for 2020, creating a low base for growth going forward.

Despite this, growth projections for 2021 have been revised downwards by various institutions, ranging between 1.4% to 2.1%. This low growth is attributable to

a slow recovery in mining output, as Namibia’s mineral exposure has not been as favourable as those of other nations. Additionally, the lockdown restrictions in

response to rising cases in the third wave – the worst Namibia has yet faced – will have further subdued economic activity this year. The recovery for tourism is

also likely to take materially longer than many had hoped for, which may lead to consolidation within the sector.

After the collapse in household incomes last year, recovery will be slow in the relatively weak growth environment. The dangers lie particularly around the latent

internal demand shock, as reduced consumption in the economy and consolidation in sectors such as tourism may further reduce household incomes. At the

same time, Namibia has not seen the necessary reforms to improve her business climate and investment environment. Without the substantial and urgent

reforms, growth over the medium term will remain low – driven largely by improved mineral output off the back of diamond mining.

The consensus is that Namibia’s growth will hover around the 3.0% level over the medium term. Even with this growth, the 10.2% deterioration in real GDP per

capita in 2020 (after several years of decline) will take over a decade to return to the 2015 peak. With such a slow growth recovery, and much of the recovery being

driven by the base effect and mining output, the risk is that the average Namibian may well feel left behind.

OUTLOOK AND PROSPECTS

Despite the severity of current circumstances, there are glimmers of opportunity. The impetus

behind remote working and digitalisation are a boon for the ICT space, not just in the developed

economies but across Africa as well. Individuals increasingly demand more and faster data

connectivity, while many businesses need to provide for secure remote access and improved

systems to facilitate the growth in ‘work-from-home’ policies.

Growth in the ICT sector is expected to remain relatively high, although this rate of growth is

anticipated to slow given the large base from 2020 and 2021. Nonetheless, it is expected to

remain one of the fastest-growing sectors in the Namibian economy over the medium term.

The drive towards digitalization and online services will see the ICT sector as a keystone for

growth across much of the Namibian economy, helping unlock much of its potential. With that, it

brings not only opportunity the sector to continue growing, but for the sector to play a key role

in the country’s economic recovery.

We look forward to the Equiano cable being landed during April/ May 2022 and

connected during the third quarter 2022 whilst the Tier 3 equivalent data center is

expected to be operational by August 2022.

APPRECIATION

I would like to extend my sincere appreciation and gratitude to my fellow

Board members and our highly committed executive team, managers and

employees, as well as to our customers and service providers, for their

co-operation, dedication, valued efforts and participation during the year.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2021

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED)

Andrew Hall: Managing

Managing Director (“MD”), Group Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Group Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Group Chief Operations Officer (“COO”) are ex officio

members of the Board.

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the executive responsibility for the running of the business and the leadership of the Board, such that no one

individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee (“REMCO”) of the Board will assist with the identification of suitable candidates for appointment to the Board

and to board committees. Directors appointed by the Board based on the recommendation of the REMCO will stand down at the first annual general meeting of

shareholders following such appointment and may offer themselves for re-election.

The Board will on an annual basis consider its size, diversity, demographics and skills requirements as part of the assessment of the Board and directors’

performance.

At least one third of the non-executive directors will retire by rotation on an annual basis.

The independence of all independent non-executive directors will be assessed on an annual basis with a specific focus on the independence of independent non-

executive directors who have served for more than six (6) years and the outcome of such assessments will be reported on in the integrated report.

During the previous financial period the Board composition was reviewed and the directors of PNH and Paratus were aligned to create mirror boards.

letter of appointment. Inexperienced directors will be assisted,

with the guidance of the chairperson, to participate in mentoring programmes where available. The need for continuing professional development programmes

will be identified as part of the annual assessment of the performance of the directors.

Directors will be provided with regular briefings on changes in risks, laws and the environment but will also be expected to keep abreast of developments in the

business environment and markets that may have a material impact on the business.

As part of the succession policy of the Board, suitably qualified candidates can be appointed as members of board committees as to ensure that such candidates

obtain sufficient exposure and experience.

BOARD PROCEDURES AND POLICIES

The Board adopted the below policies and procedures to ensure proper governance in the management of its affairs:

Conflicts of interest: The Board adopted a formal Code of Conduct and Conflicts of Interest Policy in terms of which conflicts are defined and appropriate

procedures for dealing with conflicts are prescribed. Directors are at liberty to accept other board appointments so long as the appointment does not conflict with

the business of the Company and/or Group and does not detrimentally affect the director’s performance as a director on the Board of PNH.

Trading in company equities: The Board adopted and approved a formal procedure to regulate the trading by directors, officers and senior management in the

Company’s equities.

Dissemination of company information: The Board approved a policy in respect of the dissemination of Company and/or Group information in order to regulate

the circulation of price sensitive information and to ensure equal treatment of all shareholders

BOARD COMMITTEES

The Board has delegated certain of its functions to well-structured committees but without abdicating its own responsibilities.

As a minimum, the Board has established an Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (“ARC”), Investment Committee (“IC”) and a REMCO.

Each board committee, as established by the Board, has a committee charter approved by the Board and is reviewed annually. The committees are appropriately

constituted with due regard to the skills required by each committee.

Each of these committees are chaired by an independent non-executive director or by a suitably qualified non-executive committee member and the majority of

committee members are independent non-executive directors.

Refer to separate committee reports on pages 62 to 75 for more information on each of the committees.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF BOARD AND COMMITTEES

A regular assessment of the performance of the Board, chairperson, individual directors and board committees will be done.

COMPANY SECRETARY

Cronjé Secretarial Services (Pty) Ltd is the company secretary, represented by Mr. Christiaan Cronjé and Ms. Katherine Amakali, duly appointed by the Board in

accordance with the Companies Act of Namibia. The Board considered and is satisfied that the individuals who perform the company secretary role, are properly

qualified and have the requisite knowledge, skills and experience to competently fulfil the function of company secretary.

The representatives of the company secretary are not directors of the Company and/or Group.

The Board empowers the company secretary to enable it to properly fulfil its duties.:

•

recommend letters of representation and other documentation for Board approval;

•

recommend approval of annual reports and interim results to Board;

•

recommend approval of annual budgets to Board;

•

•

•

reporting to Board on proceedings of the committee;

•

•

°

financial risks;

°

internal financial controls;

°

fraud risk as they relate to financial reporting;

°

IT risk as they relate to financial reporting; and

•

reporting to the NSX in the annual NSX compliance, that the committee has monitored compliance during the year concerned;

•

consider problems identified in the going concern assumption;

•

consider the appropriateness and disclosure of related party transactions;

•

the committee oversees integrated reporting;

°

have reasonable regard to all material factors and risks that may impact on the integrity of the Integrated Annual Report;

°

review the financial statements, interim reports, preliminary or provisional results announcement, summarised integrated information, any other

intended release of price-sensitive information and prospectuses, trading statements and similar documents;

•

the committee ensures that a combined assurance model is applied to provide a coordinated approach to all assurance activities;

•

the committee satisfies itself of the expertise, resources and experience of the finance function of the Company and Group; and

•

the committee shall be responsible for overseeing any internal audit function, once such function is in place.

EXTERNAL AUDIT

As regards External Audit, the committee:

•

is satisfied with their independence especially where non-audit services are performed;

•

agreed the principles with the external auditors without limiting their statutory obligations;

•

decided on the extent of external verification of non-financial information;

•

decided on the external review of interim results; and

•

recommends that PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PWC”) be re-appointed for the financial year ending 30 June 2022 and has overseen the external audit process;

and

•

recommended the proposed audit fees by the external auditors to the Board during June 2021.

The external auditor attended the majority of committee meetings and has unfettered access to the ARC chairperson and the Board.

INTERNAL AUDIT

The committee deemed the appointment of a dedicated internal audit function in the Group as unfeasible, taking into consideration the size of the Group. The

committee deliberated to outsource this function to address specified risk areas and concluded to outsource the function to the Capricorn Group.

INTERNAL CONTROLS

These financial statements support the viability, accountability and effective internal control processes of PNH.

The system of internal financial and operational controls are the responsibility of the board. Management ensure that assets are protected, systems operate

effectively, and all valid transactions are recorded properly.

Risks and controls are reviewed and monitored regularly for relevance and effectiveness. Internal controls are designed to mitigate and not to eliminate significant

risks faced. Such a system provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against error, omission, misstatement or loss. This is achieved through a combination of

risk identification, evaluation and monitoring processes, appropriate decision-making, assurance and control functions such as risk management and compliance.

Based on reviews, information and explanations given by management and discussions with the external auditors on the results of their audit, the committee is

satisfied that the system of internal controls of PNH operated effectively in the year under review. Nothing has come to the committee’s attention that causes it to

believe that the system of internal financial controls is not effective.

FINANCE FUNCTION

The committee has reviewed the financial statements of the Company and Group and is satisfied that they comply with IFRS.

The external auditor has expressed an opinion on the financial statements for the year ended June 2021, refer to page 80.

The committee is satisfied that Stefan de Bruin, the CFO for the financial year ended 30 June 2021, has the appropriate expertise and experience to meet his

responsibilities in the position. The expertise, experience and adequacy of the resources making up the finance function were also considered, and the committee

is satisfied that these are appropriate.

GOING CONCERN

The committee has reviewed a documented assessment, including key assumptions prepared by Management. The Group has adequate access to borrowing

facilities and investments to meet foreseeable cash requirements; no non-compliance with statutory or regulatory requirements; no pending changes to litigation

which may affect the Group; no pending legal action or litigation against the companies in the Group; all key management positions have been filled; the forecasted

cash flows and operational budgets indicate that the Group has sufficient operating profit and cash flows to service its financial obligations and no breach of loan/

bond covenants.

The committee, reported to the board that it supports management’s view that the Company and Group will continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future.

The going-concern basis has been adopted in preparing the financial statements.

COMPLIANCE GOVERNANCE

The committee is responsible for the compliance with applicable laws, rules, codes and standards. All of the laws, codes and standards applicable to PNH have

been identified and the responsibility for implementing compliance has been delegated to management.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Board affirms its responsibility towards upholding risk management, including the governance of technology and information. The governance model reflects

both business and IT requirements, focusing on strategic alignment, value delivery, risk management (including information security, resilience, as well as legislative,

health and safety compliance), resource management and performance management. The committee assists the Board in carrying out its responsibilities for risk

management, including risk appetite and IT risk.

The committees and the management team promote a culture of risk governance and awareness throughout the organisation.

Management is accountable to the Board, through the committee, for:

•

the implementation of the risk frameworks and methodologies and the recommendation for approval thereof to the Board;

•

embedding the risk management process in the business;

•

regularly provide the committee with a register of the Company and Group’s key risks and potential material risk exposures; and

•

reports to the Board any material changes and/or divergence to the risk profile of the Company and Group.
