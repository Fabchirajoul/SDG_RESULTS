Committee

Datatec 2021 Annual Report 03

Corporate governance reports:

letter of

assurance twice a year from each of its subsidiary divisions

(supported by similar representations from the divisions’

own subsidiaries) which provides the Board with assurance

over the operation of the risk management processes

described above, including the operation of internal

controls over financial and IT risks, compliance with

legislation, and the ethical and sustainable management

of the business.

• Internal assurance: Risk management (adopting an effective

enterprise risk management framework), legal, compliance,

health and safety, and quality assurance departments are

included. They are responsible for maintaining policies,

minimum standards, oversight and risk management

performance and reporting.

• Independent assurance: Independent and objective

assurance of the overall adequacy and effectiveness of

risk management, governance and internal control within

the organisation is predominantly the role of internal audit,

external audit and other expert assurance providers required

from time to time.

• Oversight committees: Appropriate assurance providers

under each of the above categories have been identified:

– The ARCC

– The Social and Ethics Committee with regard to oversight

of the Group’s controls in the sphere of ethics, corporate

social responsibility and sustainability

– The Remuneration Committee with regard to controls

in the remuneration sphere

– The Nominations Committee in relation to Board diversity

and corporate governance structures

• Management has used this model to conclude on

the completeness and appropriateness of the current

assurance activities for each risk identified and that the

level of assurance provision is satisfactory. It continues

to maintain the framework as part of the ongoing risk

management process.

• The ARCC has reviewed the combined assurance

frameworks for the Group and the three divisions to

satisfy itself with management’s conclusions and will

continue to review them as part of its role in oversight of

risk management.

• In light of its review of the combined assurance framework,

the ARCC has recommended to the Board that appropriate

assurance activities are in place in relation to the controls

operating over each risk identified in the risk management

process.

The governance of ICT

The Board has the responsibility to govern technology and

information in a way that supports the organisation in setting

and achieving its strategic objectives (King IV Principle 12).

To achieve this, the governance of ICT is firmly embedded in

the Group’s risk management framework. ICT risk is managed

across all operations with controls and assurance provision to

be maintained and reviewed in the same way as for other risks.

The Board has adopted an ICT governance policy setting out

the Group’s approach to ICT governance. Within this policy, an

ICT Governance Committee has been established comprising

divisional ICT risk management and ICT executives with

the aim of reinforcing the integration of IT risk issues into

the Group’s risk management framework.

The Board includes a review of ICT governance procedures

operated by the Group’s major divisions in its annual timetable

to assist in its ICT governance role.

There are documented and tested procedures in the major

subsidiaries which will allow them to continue their critical

business processes in the event of a disastrous incident
