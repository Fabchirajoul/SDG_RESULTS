BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND GROUP RESULTS

Financial results highlights

Revenue increased by 17% to R789.0 million (2020:

R672.5 million).

EBITDA increased by 35% to R98.3 million (2020:

R72.8 million).

Profit after taxation for the period increased by 42% to

R65.3 million (2020: R46.0 million).

Cash generated from operations decreased by 10% to

R92.1 million (2020: R102.1 million).

Headline earnings increased by 49% to R44.3 million

(2020: R29.7 million).

Normalised headline earnings increased by 47% to

R45.3 million (2020: R30.9 million).

Earnings per share increased by 66% to 50.57 cents per

share (2020: 30.65 cents per share).

Headline earnings per share increased by 64% to

50.59 cents per share (2020: 30.79 cents per share).

Normalised headline earnings per share* increased by 58%

to 45.62 cents per share (2020: 28.92 cents per share).

*

Normalised headline earnings per share is calculated as follows:

• The numerator, being the headline earnings attributable to ordinary

shareholders, is adjusted by including the preference dividend earned on the

preference share investment in Spalding Investment 10 Proprietary Limited

(Spalding) and eliminated on consolidation (refer to the explanation below in

“Share-based payment transactions”).

• The denominator, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares,

is adjusted to include the weighted treasury shares held by Spalding.

PBT Group’s financial performance was driven by:

•

Organic revenue growth due to continued demand for

PBT Group’s services.

•

PBT Group operating expenses being contained, resulting in

profit margin expansion.

•

PBT Group continuing to convert a large portion of its

earnings to cash.

PBT Group, for the first time, is reporting a normalised earnings

figure. This figure reverses the accounting effect of IFRS 2 Share-

based Payments. The Board of Directors is of the view that this is

a more accurate reflection of after-tax earnings per share.

As a Group we are humbled by the success

over the past financial year, amidst challenging

circumstances. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic,

the resilience of our business development teams,

professionalism of our consultants and exceptional

work ethic of our support staff resulted in a very

pleasing set of results.

A highlight during the past financial year was the

achievement of a Level 1 B-BBEE rating for both

PBT Group as well as CyberPro (56%-held subsidiary).

This positions us well in terms of the transformation

goals we have set for the Company, with a view on

growth, diversity and sustainability.

Our focus is now on becoming a majority black-

owned company, which we believe will give us a

further competitive advantage in the market.

LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

Going concern

PBT Group evaluated its business operations as at 31 March 2021

and also prepared cash flow forecasts for the next five years.

These cash flow forecasts have been prepared based on historic

financial performance and growth expectations for PBT Group

and the South African economy. The cash flow forecasts included

adjustments for the potential impact of COVID-19 on the business.

The Group has a high tangible net asset value and has generated

a significant profit for the 2021 financial year. PBT Group’s highly

skilled consultants were able to continue providing services

remotely throughout the various stages of lockdown. Cash

flow in the Group remains strong, mainly due to the Group’s

ability to collect timeous payments from its high-quality clients.

All indications are that the business can continue as a going

concern for the foreseeable future.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS

Upon reflection of the past financial period, the performance

of PBT Group remains positive, despite the ongoing COVID-19

pandemic and the constant threat of its potential impact

on the business. Our ability to adjust and realign in order to

accommodate our clients, made this a fulfilling year, as our

business development strategies survived a very difficult period.

As most organisations have taken a downward spiral in profit,

PBT Group recovered in a way that did not just equal the previous

year’s performance, but in certain business units exceeded

expectations.

Client relationships, innovation and keeping to the basics of the

PBT Group core competencies have enabled us to get through

difficult times and to position ourselves for the demand awaiting

the data industry. The quest for businesses to speed up their

digitalisation strategies has increased the demand for data to the

extent that it cannot only be serviced by the constant increase

of the number of people allocated to projects and solutions.

Technology by itself will not be the answer to the problem, but it

is the execution approach supported by the enabling technology,

that will allow for acceleration.

In previous reports we stated that we are working with key clients

to build accelerators to address this conundrum. We do not

refer to these accelerators as products, as it is merely a facility

to accelerate client data solutions and projects, supplemented

by PBT Group’s core competencies of data specialisation and

practices. Within our Innovation Centre new techniques and

delivery methods are constantly being tested and deployed

via our consultant and client base. Using data vault modelling

PBT Group has

maintained a

sound business strategy

that is based on a solutions

approach in adding value

to our clients.

is just an example, also underpinned by an agile approach to

analysis, modelling, data engineering and implementation. These

accelerators have matured substantially over the last 12 months,

to the extent that it can soon be demonstrated and offered to a

broader client base.

Whilst the accelerators were initially only focused on enablement

for Microsoft Azure (Azure), Amazon Web Services (AWS) and

Google Cloud Platform (GCP), it is also being extended to other

cloud offerings entering the market. A further enhancement in

progress is the ability to configure these accelerators to facilitate

the integration with complementary software, deemed to be very

popular in the market, such as Snowflake, Informatica and existing

cloud utilities available in Azure, AWS and GCP. The accelerators

are complementary to our existing professional services offering

and will be applicable and available in all regional segments of

the business, including South Africa, Europe, United Kingdom,

Ireland and Australia. Training, which is well established within our

organisation and remains a key focus to support this enablement,

is often extended to key clients. Strategic value-add, combined

with constantly finding ways of improving data solutions and

implementations – taking cost efficiency into consideration –

remains the PBT Group motto.

As organisations continue with large-scale initiatives to migrate

to the cloud, it is reconfirmed that PBT Group’s core competency,

data engineering, remains a key enabler for most data projects

and solutions. Whether in cloud or on premise, the three

components of most big data architectures remain to be the data

lake, where most raw data resides, the traditional data warehouse
