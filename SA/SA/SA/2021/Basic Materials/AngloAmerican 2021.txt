Anglo American Platinum Limited

Integrated annual report 2021:

letter of the

law, including aligning tax treatment with commercial reality. We

seek certainty on tax matters where possible. In all our dealings

with tax authorities, including where we seek certainty, our

relationships are centred on transparency. Where tax authorities

have adopted cooperative compliance arrangements, we will

therefore favourably consider participation.

As set out in our tax strategy, we allocate value by reference to

where it is created and managed within the normal course of

commercial activity, and we pay tax on that basis. We do not use

tax haven jurisdictions to manage taxes and we commit to not

transfer value created to low tax jurisdictions.

Tax transparency

We are committed to providing tax transparency to our

stakeholders. We see the benefits of this transparency with

all our stakeholders, including:

– Shareholders: the knowledge that we are deeply committed to

good tax governance and responsible tax practices, thereby

mitigating tax risk

– Tax authorities: the development and maintenance of long-

term, open and constructive relationships

– Communities: understanding the economic benefits attributable

to mining activities in their regions

– Others: making a meaningful contribution to ongoing tax and

transparency debates. We proactively engage with industry

bodies, business forums and civil society.

Public disclosure is essential to building trust in the mining industry.

Anglo American has voluntarily provided information about tax

payments in each of the business units for many years and the

first tax and economic contribution report was published in 2014

to provide details for all major operating jurisdictions of the taxes

and royalties they pay, taxes they collect and other key economic

contributions to local economies, such as wages/salaries, capital

investment and procurement spend. The current-year data also

includes an amended basis of preparation to align with reporting

improvements made centrally at Anglo American.
