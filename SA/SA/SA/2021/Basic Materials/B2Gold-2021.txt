Managing Director and Country Manager of B2Gold Namibia, I am pleased to present

this edition of the Namibian Responsible Mining Report. 2021 was a remarkable year for the

Otjikoto Mine, with record gold production, a strong health and safety performance (including

a 25% reduction in Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate), and the ongoing implementation

of our community investment initiatives.

2021 saw Otjikoto reach its highest level of gold production since its

inception and first commercial production in February 2015. The Otjikoto

Mine produced 197,573 ounces of gold in 2021, 4% above budget and

at the upper end of its 2021 guidance (of 190,000 to 200,000 ounces).

Q4 2021 also saw the highest recorded quarterly gold production, at

78,681 ounces. As the Otjikoto Mine enters its eighth year of production,

we foresee continued operational and production excellence. As we

reach the completion of the Wolfshag open pit in 2022, development

of the Wolfshag underground ramp system will lead to the extraction

of the first stope ores to be fed to the processing plant as a blend

with continuing ore production from the Otjikoto pit.

We are proud to share the success of our Company with our host

country. In March 2022, B2Gold Namibia was selected by the

Namibian Revenue Authority (NamRA) to receive the Taxpayer/Trader

Appreciation Award for the second “highest revenue contributor” in

the category NamRA Overall Top Contributors for 2021. Furthermore,

according to the Namibian Chamber of Mines 2020 Annual Review1,

B2Gold Namibia’s total non-obligatory community investment was

higher than any other mining company in Namibia. As a responsible

mining company, we understand that contributing to our host

communities is as important as producing gold efficiently.

B2Gold Namibia exemplifies the B2Gold Corporate commitment

of prioritizing local employment, training, and development. In

2021, we employed a workforce comprised of 98.6% Namibians.

We are also focused on increasing the percentage of Namibians in

management roles – in 2021 this value improved to 86.9% (up from

82% in 2020). Although the Wolfshag underground mining operation

is carried out by a contractor, the training and employment of local

Namibians has also been prioritized.

MESSAGE FROM THE: MANAGING DIRECTOR

AND COUNTRY MANAGER
