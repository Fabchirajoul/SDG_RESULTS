should they be served.

Operations at Montepuez Ruby Mining Limitada (“MRM”) saw a

phased resumption from March 2021, reaching normal capacity by

the end of May 2021, following the suspension in March 2020 of

principal operations due to Covid-19. Production in the premium

ruby category at MRM was 84,000 carats for the year (2020: 28,700

carats; 2019: 81,300 carats), with the second half of the year averaging

over 10,000 premium carats per month. Overall production at

MRM for the year was 3.3 million carats (2020: 1.3 million carats;

2019: 2.2 million carats) with 5.7 million tonnes of rock handled

(2020: 1.9 million tonnes; 2019: 7.2 million tonnes) notwithstanding

the reduced number of operating months during both 2021 and

2020. Total capital expenditure for the year was just USD4.6 million,

comprising USD3.7 million on replacement mining and ancillary

equipment and USD0.9 million spent on the ancillary aspects of

the resettlement village constructed near Namanhumbir, thereby

successfully completing the first stage of rehousing all 105 censused

families. MRM’s capital expenditure is expected to increase

significantly across 2022 and 2023 to facilitate a 200% capacity

upgrade to the processing plant facility, a transformational develop-

ment for MRM and its future revenue potential.

MRM’s independent operational grievance mechanism (“OGM”)

was officially launched in February 2021 following the conclusion

of a pilot phase and a local public awareness campaign. The OGM

letter of claim in respect of a case in the English High Court on behalf

of 11 individuals for personal injury and associated claims. None of the defendants have however, to date, been served. While it is impossible

to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse matters relating to potential claims and litigation,

the Group will give careful consideration to all such cases, whilst taking appropriate legal advice, in order to best protect the Group’s

position in all circumstances. The Group has made use of the exemption as provided by IAS 37: Provisions, contingent liabilities and

contingent assets, paragraph 92.

At the balance sheet date in the aggregate, and despite the quality of any defences available to the Group, it is possible that the Group’s

operational results or cash flows in particular annual reporting periods could be materially affected by potential claims and litigation, or by

the final outcome of any particular litigation. Having regard to all these matters, the Group (i) does not consider it appropriate to make any

provision in respect of any pending litigation unless it is probable that the likely outcome of the case would result in an outflow of resources

from the Group; and (ii) does not believe that the ultimate outcome of any ongoing litigation at the date of this report will significantly

impair the Group’s financial condition.

Announcement of Gemfields’ maiden dividend

Off the back of the strong 2021, results and the future prospects of the Group, the Board have approved the payment of Gemfields’ maiden

dividend of USD20 million, or approximately USDc1.7 per share. The dividend will be distributed to shareholders in the first half of 2022.

Consideration of the unfolding conflict in the Ukraine

Following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, instigated at the start of March 2022, management has considered whether the ongoing

conflict presents any immediate material risks to the Group that would prevent it from continuing to operate as a going concern.

Management however does not believe this to be a significant risk to operations and notes the following:

•

None of the Group’s rough gemstone customers are based in Russia, nor are of Russian origin.

•

To date, none of the Group’s customers have raised any concerns regarding the conflict, and the scheduled CQ auction commenced

on 15 March 2022.

•

With regard to Fabergé, the entity has no points of sale or business in Russia, and it is not anticipated that the entity will be

directly impacted by any sanctions. Overall, it is estimated that the conflict could have a 20%–40% impact on Fabergé’s sales

during the conflict period, however this would not materially impact the Group. To mitigate this, Fabergé could reduce inventory

purchases to maximise cash retention and it has already taken steps to lower its marketing and advertising spend.

•

To date, there have not been any significant increases in fuel costs directly related to the conflict in the local jurisdictions in which

the Group operates. However, there is a significant risk that the conflict will place upward pressure on the price of fuel and

machinery spare parts (two of the largest operating costs at the mines). Management believes that any such cost increases would

be manageable, with the Group able to absorb these. Additionally, recent pronouncements have demonstrated significant increases

in Africa’s main commodity prices, that, along with currency movements being realised, are likely to partially offset any cost

pressures.
