DEAR STAKEHOLDERS

This will be my last report as Gold

Fields’ Chairperson before I step

down at the Company’s Annual

General Meeting on 1 June 2022.

Therefore, I think it is appropriate

to use this opportunity to reflect on

my 13 years with the Group, the last

eight of which I had the privilege of

chairing the Board.

It certainly has been an eventful

journey, one that mirrored the

changing fortunes of the gold and

wider mining industry. It was also

a journey whose direction was

shaped by our many stakeholders,

along with the broader societal

expectations of sound corporate

citizenship.

But, above all, it was a journey of a

company that has set its own course

to embrace long-term value creation

and sustainability.

The Gold Fields of today is

almost unrecognisable from the

company I joined in 2009. Most

notably, it has expanded into a

more global and modern business

after fundamentally restructuring

the composition and geographic

distribution of its portfolio in 2013.

During that year we saw two

significant changes – the unbundling

of our non-mechanised South

African gold mines into Sibanye

Gold (now Sibanye-Stillwater) in

February, and the acquisition of the

Yilgarn South assets (Darlot, Granny

Smith and Lawlers) from Barrick Gold

in Western Australia in October.

Before this, our South African assets

accounted for well over 50% of our

total production. Now, our Australian

mines comprise just under half of

our portfolio, with the South Deep

mine – our remaining asset in

South Africa – contributing around

12%. However, with a life-of-mine

lasting until the end of this century,

our investment in South Deep will

ensure Gold Fields, now a truly

global company with operations on

three continents, looks set to retain

its presence in South Africa. This has

been given significant impetus with

the marked operational and financial

improvement shown by South Deep

over the past three years.

Our shareholders witnessed

long-term value accretion from the

Sibanye Gold unbundling, as well as

management’s subsequent focus on

continuous optimisation and growth

of our portfolio. The core focus of

this strategy is increasing the free

cash-flow (FCF) margin per ounce

of gold produced and sustainably

extending the average reserve life

of our mines.

We have largely succeeded on

both fronts. Over the past seven

years, Gold Fields has consistently

achieved its production and cost

guidance to the market – bar some

Covid-19-required adjustments –

and, in doing so, managed to

generate significant FCF even after

capital expenditure of US$2.28bn

over the past three years alone.

This has enabled Gold Fields to:

• Fund growth: Over the past four

years, we invested A$350m to

buy 50% of the Gruyere project in

Western Australia and A$329m to

build the mine, spent US$340m

to rebuild the Damang mine in

Ghana, and are about a year out

from commissioning the US$860m

Salares Norte mine in Chile

“In addition to its employees, Gold Fields seeks to ensure all

stakeholders accrue real value from our mining activities.”

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS

This is my first report as Gold

Fields’ CEO, and I can now look

back at a very challenging year

with the Company. The Covid-19

pandemic has entered its third

year, and continues to have a

significant impact on our personal

and professional lives. It certainly

continues to affect our people and

operations around the world.

While we were able to mitigate

much of the impact of Covid-19 on

our operational performance during

2021, the impact on our workforce

was devastating. During the year,

17 of our employees and contractors

at South Deep, Tarkwa and Cerro

Corona passed away as a result of

contracting the virus. This brings

the total number of Covid-19-related

deaths in the Company to 20. Our

sincere condolences again go out to

the families, friends and colleagues

of those we lost.

The pandemic also restricted my

engagements with colleagues

outside of South Africa to online

platforms – it was only in January

2022 that I was able to start visiting

our operations.

But even though most of my

interactions were virtual, I gained

respect and confidence in the

abilities of the leadership teams

at Gold Fields and the workforce

reporting to them. My predecessor,

Nick Holland, bequeathed me a

company in good financial and

operational health – one with

significant growth potential imbued

by the right values and a sound

corporate governance structure.

Gold Fields’ strategic shift over the

past decade to move away from

labour-intensive, conventional

mining to focus on mechanised

open-pit and underground

operations, with majority

international exposure, has served

the Company well.

Our 2021 financial and operational

performance is testament to the

appropriateness of this strategy to

current times. Gold production for

2021 was 2.34Moz, a 5% increase

from 2020 and at the upper end

of our guidance for the year. While

AISC were 9% higher than 2020

– mainly as a result of the higher

project capital and exchange rate

movements – positively, they were

at the lower end of market guidance.

Attributable profit improved to

US$789m in 2021 from US$723m

in 2020, while normalised earnings

attributable to our shareholders rose

6% to US$929m (2020: US$879m).

Despite higher capex of over

US$1bn, we still managed to

generate adjusted free cash-flow

of US$463m, pay a strong dividend

of R4.70/share (2020: R4.80/share)

and reduce our net debt to less

than US$1bn for the first time in over

a decade.

Furthermore, the reinvestment

programme over the past four years

has placed Gold Fields in a position

where it can build on its current

production profile to achieve annual

output of 2.7Moz by 2024, with the

addition of the Salares Norte mine

to the portfolio.

The question now is: how do we

build on this platform beyond

2024 and preserve the value we

create? Gold Fields’ executive

leadership team spent much of

“It has never been more important for companies to have a consistent

voice, clear purpose and coherent strategy tied to a long-term view.”
