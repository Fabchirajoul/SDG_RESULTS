Board and committee fees are benchmarked

against a comparator group comprising of

JSE-listed and international companies by

PwC, using the same comparator group used

for executive directors as disclosed on the

previous page.

The company’s non-executive directors and

board Chair are paid based on their roles

and the policy is applied using the following

principles:

• A board retainer fee is paid to board

members for all board meetings held during

the year.

• Committee retainer fees are paid to

committee members for all committee

meetings held during the year.

• No additional fees are payable for additional

meetings (in excess of scheduled meetings).

• Each director’s fee is paid in arrears.

• Fees are reviewed annually, and increases

are implemented following approval by

shareholders at the AGM. When fees are

reviewed, the company considers:

• level of effort required from the non-

executive directors

• affordability

• results from the annual benchmark

exercise.

• Non-executive directors are not eligible to

receive any short or long-term incentives.

• Fees are exclusive of any value added tax

(VAT) that might be applicable, depending

on the individual/personal registration

circumstances of a particular director.

• Non-executive directors are reimbursed for

travel expenses on official business, where

necessary, as well as other direct business-

related expenses.
