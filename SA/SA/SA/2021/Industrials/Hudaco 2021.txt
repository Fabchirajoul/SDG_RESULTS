Immediately prior to joining

WEG Group for 27 years, serving

as its group CEO from 2012. He

has extensive experience in the

engineering consumables industry.

will be a high priority, as will expanding capacity of the idler

manufacturing operation.

Joseph Grieveson is predominantly a jobbing foundry that

manufactures ferrous and non-ferrous castings. Sales were slightly

up on 2019 but 2021 was a very difficult year to maintain margins

due to fluctuating input costs, the two-week political unrest in KZN

(where this business is based), the metal industries strike, a week-

long electricity outage due to a substation problem and the ongoing

Eskom loadshedding. The focus in 2022 will be on stabilising and

improving the margin and exploring export markets to bolster sales.

The Dished End Company specialises in manufacturing various

dished ends, from 400mm to 5.5m in diameter and thicknesses

ranging from 4mm to 50mm. It also offers the pressing and flanging

of small conical sections and a range of single pressed weld caps.

Despite steel plate shortages and the other challenges in the industry,

the business maintained respectable growth compared to 2019.

Moreover, indicators in the market show significant promise of

growth for 2022.
