INVICTA HOLDINGS LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2021

1: LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

2020 will be remembered in time for the outbreak of the

COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa and the devastating

social and economic impacts that resulted. As with many

businesses, the COVID-19 global pandemic presented

significant challenges to our operations.

In my last letter to stakeholders, I commented on the

critical assessment of the Invicta business operations and

processes. Whilst the main objective was to ensure our

operations were stable and secure through the COVID-19

pandemic, the actions that we took significantly streamlined

our business.

During the year we completed the sale of certain

businesses in the Capital Equipment Group (Northmec, CSE,

NHSA and Landboupart) to CNH Industrial SA Proprietary

Limited (“CNH”). As was communicated at the time of

the announcement of the transaction, the proceeds from

the disposal were applied to reduce the Group’s most

expensive debt, thereby realigning our funding structure,

and enabling us to focus on other exciting strategic

initiatives and our core operations.

Sadly, certain of our valued staff members were directly

impacted by COVID-19. To date 204 staff members were

infected by COVID-19 and unfortunately, we had

five mortalities. We are saddened by each one of these

tragic deaths.

Last year we highlighted certain strategic objectives that

we wanted to achieve during the financial year. Apart from

the successful CNH transaction, the tool business INDUSTRI

was successfully restructured the BMG e-commerce

platform has been implemented and we are progressing

with the review of the KAG business model. Our renewed

and strategic focus on the business’ return on equity

resulted in an improvement in the returns of the different

business units and importantly, improved gross margins and

stock levels. We have significantly reduced the debt levels

in the business and will continue to seek ways to enhance

the Company’s balance sheet. The simplification of the

Group structure is progressing well. We are continuously

striving to improve our disclosure and communication with

stakeholders.

I am immensely proud of the progress we have made

operationally in achieving these strategic objectives. I am

confident that Invicta is now well positioned to accelerate

its growth trajectory and personally I am excited about the

new phase of the Company’s development.

I would like to thank Steven and the executive team for

steering the ship in such an assured fashion during an

extremely difficult year.

The contribution of our Board must also be noted. I thank

each director for their contribution to Invicta.

Lastly, and most importantly, I wish to thank the employees

of Invicta, our suppliers and our customers who have shown

both loyalty and support during a very challenging year.

I remain confident that they will continue to help us grow

our business in the years ahead.

I wish you all well and trust that you will stay safe.

Dr Christo Wiese

Overview of the Year

If you would have told me on the 1st of April 2020 that we would

have emerged in such a strong position on 31 March 2021, I

am not sure I would have believed you. This year for Invicta

was like no other before. A year of ups and downs and a year

I am very happy is behind us. We focused on doing what we

could in terms of managing the business during the COVID-19

pandemic, while at the same time acknowledging that there

was a lot that was out of our control. A year that started with a

lock down which resulted in us having to cut costs resulting in

us having no option but to rationalise our work force. A year of

working from home where possible, social distancing, mask

wearing, hand sanitizing and trying to do business online.

Notwithstanding all this I am tremendously proud of what Invicta

has achieved during the year.

Remarkably on the 11th of January 2021 we announced the

finalisation of our disposal of four of our businesses to CNH

Industrial (CNHI). They are:

> Landboupart – a distributor of agricultural spare parts

> Northmec – a distributor of Case agricultural equipment

> CSE - a distributor of Case earthmoving equipment

> NHSA - a distributor of spare parts and implements for the

agricultural sectors

This was a remarkable effort from all involved considering this

deal was finalised by our team and the CNHI team working from

home. The agricultural sector is having another very strong year

and we wish CNHI and all our former colleagues who transferred

with the business to CHNI all the best with their new venture.

As our business emerged from the low levels of turnover

because of the various lock downs, our profitability improved

having regard to our cost rationalisation measures that were

undertaken. This trend continued through the rest of the

year and we also continued to be focused on working capital

management and reducing net debt.

If ever there was a year when staff and management were

tested to their core, this was the year. It is occasions like this

when the quality of the management is shown as it navigates

a business through such a difficult year. I want to thank the

executive team namely Nazlee Rajmohamed, Tony Sinclair,

Gavin Pelser, Loy Soo-Chew, Craig Barnard and Lize Dubery for

helping to guide Invicta in such a skillful manner. We are lucky

to have such experience in our Group.

R5.18 billion to R4.52 billion, a decrease of 12.7%. With pressure

from opposition to survive and our drive to turn stock into cash,

increased pressure was placed on gross profits. The pressure on

gross profit margins was successfully countered by our strategy

to not only supply world class products, but also to provide

a value added solution, through our service of providing and

designing where appropriate solutions for our customers.

ESG businesses all focused on the collection of outstanding

debtors, with the longest overdue being top priority. This

resulted in an improvement in debtor days from 48.9 days

down to 40.1 days at year end.

Another focus was on inventory reduction and the sale of

obsolete and slow-moving inventory. ESG achieved inventory

reduction of R237 million and coupled with the lower sales have

managed to keep our inventory levels at 27.3 weeks of sales.

ESG continued with the implementation and execution of its

cost reduction programme. COVID-19 however accelerated this

process which resulted in a restructure of all the businesses

and with a S189A being implemented which sadly affected

479 staff at a cost of R26.4 million. The overall result of the

restructure lead to a 15% saving on expenses.

With ESG focused on driving the collection of outstanding

debtors, reduction of inventory and reduction of expenses,

ESG was able to pay off debt totalling R350 million and

strengthen the balance sheet.

Word of thanks

COVID-19 has created a tremendously difficult period for our

suppliers, our customers and other stakeholders. I thank you all

for your support and dedication to Invicta.

It is in times like these that the experience and depth of the

Chairman, the Board, management and particularly our staff

really matter. A heartfelt thank you to each member of the

Invicta team for the spectacular way you are dealing with the

pandemic and the myriad of challenges being faced during a

time when South Africa is in the midst of a deep recession.

Together we will emerge from this pandemic with a better

business that we can all be proud of.

Divisional Year in Review

Engineering Solutions Group (ESG)

ESG has over the past number of years focused on importing

and locally manufacturing products and solutions for all

industries in Africa and recently in Europe. ESG offers world

class solutions and products with the aim to improve the

efficiency of our customers and ensure they remain globally

competitive.

With COVID-19 reaching South Africa as we entered the financial

year, the ESG executive and management teams reacted with

speed to manage the immediate slow-down of the businesses.

There was also the ongoing business requirement to continuing

servicing customers who were part of essential services for not

only South Africa, but also the rest of Africa and Europe.

The engineering teams within ESG were very active in

researching and developing new products to assist our

businesses and customers during the pandemic.

The following new product developments were successfully

concluded:

> Hand sanitiser dispensers – hands free/foot operated

> Door openers – foot operated

> Perspex screens for trade counters and offices

> Oxygen ventilators – Virgin Orbit and BMG design

> Oxygen hoods/helmets – NASA design which was improved

by BMG

The extent of our engineering capabilities once again showed

that we are capable of designing and developing solutions

alongside world leading organisations.

The COVID-19 lockdown and the slow return to operation by the

majority of our customers, resulted in a decline of revenue from

Expenses were well managed achieving a 19.2% reduction

against the previous year, after ensuring all necessary provisions

were made, such as obsolescence on spare parts, older

new equipment and used equipment, to ensure the holding

values were aligned with the market. Return on working capital

employed was 28.2% and a return on capital employed of 61.8%

was achieved.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by government

from end of March through to December, had a major impact on

the economy. All the companies in CEG were declared essential

services, therefore business could continue, albeit on a scaled

down basis. Management adapted rapidly and had staff working

from home within two days of the lock down being declared,

freeing up management and staff to continue supporting

customers and at the same time ensuring the safety of the staff.

April was a month of evolving and adapting to the changed

business environment and from then on business was between

60% to 70% of normal trading levels. Many cost reduction

objectives that were set were implemented and achieved,

resulting in overheads being reduced by 19.2% as stated

above. Sadly this included the retrenchment of 116 employees

(14% of the staff compliment), at a cost of R7.1 million. The

major emphasis was on ensuring aftermarket support, selling

off old inventory, improving inventory turns and generating

cash which was done successfully. CEG generated well over

R1 billion of cash which was allocated to pay off debt therefore

strengthening the balance sheet.

During the 12 months of trading, working capital was lowered

by over R720million (58%). This was achieved by managing

margins to stimulate sales and improve cash flow. The

demand for capital equipment reduced dramatically in the

trading year, owing to the lack of government spending on

infrastructure, big construction companies going into liquidation

or business rescue, however demand for hard commodities

from the international markets improved resulting in this sector

generating good exports and an increase in demand for big

capital equipment. The agricultural sector however did show

positive signs of recovery from the previous two years of

drought, after good rainfalls throughout the last nine months

of the financial year. Supporting this sector was the improved

soft commodity prices which continued to increase throughout

the year. The construction unit sales in the sectors in which

CEG operates, reduced by 18% off an already low base, with

some sectors seeing sales volumes decrease to levels last

seen 10 years ago. The agricultural market is split into three

major sectors, being tractors up 7.7%, combine harvesters up

25.5% and mobile spray units up 3.9%. The continuous increase

in demand in the agricultural sector had a positive impact on

market volumes with CEG increasing its market share. However,

with the pending sale of the agricultural business to CNHi there

was a drive to reduce inventory levels to generate cash.

Due to the reluctance of the banks to provide asset-based

finance, CEG has continued to provide short- and long-term

finance to customers, building on its existing asset finance

book to stimulate sales and assist customers, without taking

undue risk. Spare parts sales have shown remarkable growth in

both the original equipment and aftermarket markets and still

continues to do so. Spare parts contributed 67% of the annual

gross profit resulting in an absorption rate of 104% . Commercial

Car Components Logistics (CCC), our United Kingdom

company, which trades in agricultural wholesale aftermarket

spare parts for competitive brands, albeit a small component

of the business, has shown good signs of recovery and has

established a strong e-commerce base, which bodes well for an

economic recovery in the medium term.

The inventory turns for equipment and spare parts have

increased due to improved inventory management and a focus

on disposing of slow-moving inventory, this in turn has resulted

in improved cash flows. Having disposed of the agricultural

divisions to CNHi a concerted effort is being made to identify

potential businesses to buy which also presents an opportunity

to diversify more into spare parts and other related sectors in

the local and overseas markets. In the latter part of the trading

year the resurgence of the world markets has created many

challenges such as inventory availability, soaring freight costs,

increased lead times, price increases and unreliable delivery

via sea and air. Despite this, the CEG business is in a very strong

position to take advantage of growth opportunities and to

weather challenges in the future.:

Board Composition

As at 31 March 2021, Invicta’s Board comprised of twelve

directors, with five executive directors and seven non-

executive directors, of whom three were independent. Despite

the ratio of independent non-executive remaining in the

minority, the Board is of the view that there was a balance of

power and authority on the Board reflected in its discussions.

Mpho Makwana and Frank Davidson joined the Board on the

31st July 2020 as independent non-executive directors, and

Iaan van Heerden joined on the same date as non-executive

director.

Byron Nichles resigned from the board effective 1 May 2020

to pursue other interests, and David Samuels retired on

the 31st July 2020 following the release of the 2020 annual

financial statements.

Per the requirements of the Company’s MOI, a third of

non-executives will retire by rotation and offer themselves for

re-election. The directors retiring by rotation at this year’s AGM

are Lance Sherrell, Iaan van Heerden and Mpho Makwana. The

Board has confirmed its support of each of these resolutions in

respect of the reappointments.

The non-executive chairman, Dr Christo Wiese, is not

considered to be independent as he is also a major

shareholder. Mpho Makwana is appointed as the lead

independent non-executive director to take up the role of the

chairman should there be a conflict.

The Audit and Risk Committee, the boards of subsidiary

companies, executive committees and management

at operational level assist the Board in discharging its

responsibility for the governance of risk by identifying,

monitoring, and managing risks on an ongoing basis.

Risk management specifically includes the consideration of:

> the risk profile and management of strategic and operational

risk within the Group;

> the risk profile and risk management of major projects and

acquisitions;

> the impact of environmental, economic and geopolitical

factors;

> the adequacy of self-insurance and external insurance

programs; and

> the risk profile and management of information technology.

Risk management is driven bottom-up, with each division

conducting a detailed analysis of its external and internal

environments. The results are reviewed and approved at

divisional audit committees for submission to the Group Audit

Committee. This information is then re-assessed at Group level

in terms of impact and probability. Material risks and any lapses

in compliance are reported to the Board.

the Group by reviewing and maintaining compensation

policies and plans, to enable the Company and Group to

attract and retain employees, managers and executive

directors and maintain an effective Board.

The Committee is responsible for assisting the Board

to ensure that the remuneration philosophy is applied

consistently throughout the Group, that the Company

remunerates its directors and executives fairly and

responsibly and for ensuring that the disclosure of such

remuneration is accurate, complete and transparent.

The Committee may request information from

management or external consultants, but no director

may take part in a decision on his or her own

remuneration. The Committee is satisfied that it fulfilled

its mandate during the reporting period.

Focus areas for 2021 included the monitoring of the

impact of COVID-19 on staff salaries and benefits, and

reviewing the structure of the short-term and long-

term incentives for executives.

Please also refer to the Remuneration Policy and the

Remuneration Implementation Report.

The Nominations Committee, consisting of the same

members as the Remuneration Committee, but

chaired by Dr Christo Wiese, which meets as and when

required to discuss the composition of the board.

Mandate

Invicta’s Social and Ethics Committee is

mandated to monitor the Group’s activities

in terms of Regulation 43 of the Companies

Act (2008). The Committee further guides

the Board as to ways to build and sustain an

ethical corporate culture within the Group.

The Committee’s mandate is documented

in a charter and includes, inter alia, Group

ethics; the 10 UN Global Compact Principles;

good corporate citizenship; environmental

protection, labour and empowerment.

During FY2021 the Committee commenced

development of a new monitoring and

implementation framework which will be

implemented in FY2022 and reported on

thereafter.

The Committee is satisfied that it fulfilled

its mandate during the period and confirms

that there are no instances of material non-

compliance to disclose.

Mandate

The Investment Committee is mandated

by the Board to engage with the

executives to evaluate potential

transactions which the executives are

looking to propose to the Board for

approval.

The Investment Committee will also

advise the Board on criteria and hurdle

rates for both acquisitions and disposals

during the financial year.:

letter of the law and

voluntarily imposes additional restrictions on trading as

required.

Directors disclose their other business interests in terms of

the Companies Act and Invicta’s conflict of interest disclosure

policy. The Group Company Secretary maintains a register

Invicta has ensured black economic empowerment occurs in

its South African operations and can report that Invicta South

Africa Holding (Pty) Ltd has achieved a level 6 B-BBEE status

which will be valid for its underlying subsidiaries. Further to this

we are pleased to report that the Engineering Solutions Group

has achieved a level 4 B-BBEE status in its own right.

As mentioned earlier in the report, ESG is in the process of

rolling out its AME empowerment model into the mining

regions, which involves black owned and managed localised

operations supplying to the customers in these various

regions.

Our businesses comply with the applicable environmental

standards and are regularly monitored with a view to reducing

any negative impact they may have on the environment.

As the Group is primarily engaged in supply and distribution of

products, we have a relatively low direct environmental impact.

We are nevertheless mindful of ways to minimise the effect our

operations have on the environment and continually monitor

elements such as the carbon footprint of products sourced

from different suppliers and the efficiency of the distribution

methods.

Waste recycling occurs as a matter of course and measures

are implemented to ensure no oils and chemicals are allowed

to contaminate the water table and soil. Our businesses are

increasingly moving to solar energy as the costs decrease.

A supply chain social and environmental responsibility code of

conduct is in place.

of their interests and directors disclose at each meeting any

interests they may have regarding agenda items, and recuse

themselves as necessary.

The executive directors ensure that the focus on ethics and

governance is lived operationally at every opportunity. There

is no tolerance for unethical behaviour at any level in the

Group and every instance is investigated and dealt with in a

consistent manner. A code of ethics is in place for staff and

the messages are reiterated on an ongoing basis through

electronic platforms.

The Audit Committee and divisional audit committees receives

quarterly reports of calls to the independent whistleblowing

hotline, and reports of any fraudulent activities in the

businesses. The Social and Ethics Committee monitors the

Group’s activities and initiatives on a broader level.

Occupational health clinics are available to our staff at some of

our facilities to conduct screenings and provide basic medical

assistance. Free flu vaccines are made available at certain

facilities.

The steps adopted in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, with

staff education, temperature screening, sanitising and social

distancing are being maintained. Warehouses implemented

shifts with a view to isolating smaller teams from each other

and administrative staff were assisted to enable remote

working wherever possible.

We are committed to continually maintaining the relevant ISO

standards (including 9001, 14001 and 45001) and the OHSAS

18001 Health and Safety Management System as appropriate

across our operations. Dedicated SHEQ officers in our divisions

ensure that our staff’s working environment remains safe.

CSI BURSARY INITIATIVES BY INVICTA

As a Group we aim to direct our CSI funds, influence, resources, and employees towards

initiatives that will achieve positive ongoing economic development in South Africa.

We consider education a fundamental stepping stone to creating opportunities for all

individuals. Our CSI project for YE2021 aimed to address educational needs. To this end our

CSI initiatives were directed at supporting the children of our employees in both primary

and high school. As a group we awarded 144 bursaries which in turn assisted 108 families

with financial support for school fees.:

HISTORY OF THE GROUP

THROUGH THE DECADES

60’S TO 80’S

West Rand Organ Company (Pty) Ltd, the company that

would become Invicta, was incorporated in 1966 and was

listed on the JSE in 1987 under the name Skirtskip Clothing

Limited. The Company disposed of its interest in clothing

manufacturing in 1989 and acquired companies involved in

the engineering, textile and leisure industries. The Company’s

name was changed to Nova Constantia Limited and it

acquired an interest in Invicta Bearing Company (Pty) Ltd.

90’S

In 1990 the Company divested of its textile interest and

in 1991 the retail bearing and transmission businesses of

Invicta Bearing Company was acquired. At that time the

Company’s divisions included industrial consumables,

engineering, sports goods and telecommunications, but

bearings soon became the core business. In late 1991,

the Company changed its name to Invicta Holdings

Limited. Over the next few years Invicta acquired

Autobax, CSE Equipment Company and Engineparts.

2000’S

During the 2000’s, BMG became a part of Invicta and

de-listed from the JSE. During this decade BMG acquired

OST and established its hydraulic business and fastener

division, while CEG acquired New Holland SA, Doosan

Construction Equipment and TCM Forklifts

Invicta created a 25% BEE shareholding for its South

African operations and acquired a 60% stake in Tiletoria.

2010’S

In 2012, Invicta purchased MacNeil Distributors and

created the Building Supply Group, which was sold in 2017.

Invicta acquired Kian Ann in 2013 and delisted it from

the Singapore Stock Exchange. Kian Ann established

subsidiaries in Thailand and acquired stakes in Steve

Woods Ltd. in the UK, North American Tractor and

Excavator Parts in Canada, Kunshan Kensetsu Buhin Co

Ltd in China, and entered into a joint venture with SKL

Equipment in India.

Meanwhile CEG established Landbou Agriculture

After-Market Spare Parts and acquired ESP Construction

After-Market Spares, HPE Hyundai Construction

Equipment and Shamrock Handling Concepts.

The ESG Group took form with acquisitions of

Man-Dirk, Hansen and Hyflo, .Rustenburg Engineering

Forge Industrial Group; Driveshaft Parts and Europe

Driveshafts.

2020’S

Invicta disposed of certain of its Capital Equipment businesses

to CNH Industrial SA Proprietary Limited:

The Audit and Risk Committee, the boards of subsidiary

companies, executive committees and management

at operational level assist the Board in discharging its

responsibility for the governance of risk by identifying,

monitoring, and managing risks on an ongoing basis.

Risk management specifically includes the consideration of:

> the risk profile and management of strategic and operational

risk within the Group;

> the risk profile and risk management of major projects and

acquisitions;

> the impact of environmental, economic and geopolitical

factors;

> the adequacy of self-insurance and external insurance

programs; and

> the risk profile and management of information technology.

Risk management is driven bottom-up, with each division

conducting a detailed analysis of its external and internal

environments. The results are reviewed and approved at

divisional audit committees for submission to the Group Audit

Committee. This information is then re-assessed at Group

level in terms of impact and probability. Material risks and any

lapses in compliance are reported to the Board.

GOVERNANCE OF RISK

Internal Audit

The Internal Audit department is an independent, objective

body providing assurance to the Group’s governance, risk and

control activities, and information to assist in the establishment

and maintenance of an effective system of internal control to

manage the risks associated with the various businesses within

the Group.

To ensure independence, Internal Audit reports functionally

to the Group Audit Committee and administratively to the

Group Commercial Director. Internal Audit is responsible for

undertaking reviews across the Group, examining the internal

controls and management of risks relating to the financial and

operational performance and compliance activities of the Group.

Internal Audit has unrestricted access to all information across

the Group to assist with its determination of the types and levels

of governance, risk and control that exist across the Group.

The Internal Audit function for the Asian operations of the

Kian Ann Group is currently outsourced to an external service

provider, RSM.

Internal Audit formally reports any material findings and matters

of significance to the Audit Committees on a quarterly basis.

These reports highlight whether actual or potential risks to the

business are being appropriately managed and controlled. The

progress in addressing previous unsatisfactory audit findings or

results is monitored until the relevant operational management

reports the proper resolution of the problematic areas.

The Group’s benchmark for an acceptable audit rating is 80%,

with the Group achieving an overall average audit rating of 85%

for the past financial year, thereby indicating that the Group has

an adequate and effective system of internal control.

Internal Audit may also assist in the investigation of call reports

received from the Group’s anti-corruption whistleblowing

service which is made available to all employees, customers,

suppliers and stakeholders.

Key Focus Areas for 2022 will include (in addition to the above)

continually revising the audit process in line with the COVID-19

pandemic national lockdown restrictions, identifying wasteful

expenditure or abuse, continuing to review and assess the

adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls within the Group

and aiding in automating and simplifying business processes to

operate more efficiently.

Internal Audit will also be assisting senior management to

attest to an adequate internal financial control environment in

compliance with the mandatory JSE listings requirement.

A full quality assurance review is planned for 2022, which will

also provide recommendations as to how the Internal Audit

function can further improve its effectiveness and add more

value to the Group.:

INVICTA TOP RISKS

Risk

Explanation

Mitigation

Residual risk Associated opportunity

South African

electricity supply and

stability

The lack of (consistent) supply is a constraint on GDP, and

impacts the activities of key customer industries such as

mining. There is also a higher operating cost for all parties.

Rollout of alternative power independent of the

national grid to key sites.

A Likely

Protect our business with move to alternative power

supply at key sites; grow our business by moving

into the supply of solar products.

Steel shortage

World wide shortage of steel exacerbated by covid led

shipping delays.

Anticipate and place early orders with secured

shipping.

A Likely

Possibility of benefitting from higher prices on old

inventory

De-industrialisation of

South Africa

Lack of competitiveness/Low productivity could lead to a

decline in industrial South Africa, with flat or declining impact

on group revenue and profitability.

Diversification of South African products and

markets; diversification geographically to

growing industrial markets

B Neutral

This could spur greater exploration of new offshore

opportunities and/or expansion of existing activities.

Political and labour

instability

Sustained labour unrest in the mining or manufacturing

sectors, especially given high level of unemployment in the

wake of pandemic related retrenchments

Geographical diversification to more stable

regions. Strict management of overheads to

create resilience to short term upheavels.

B Neutral

This could spur greater exploration of new offshore

opportunities and/or expansion of existing activities.

Reputational risk

The group may suffer reputational damage as a consequence

of product or governance failure, or failure to meet regulatory

requirements.

A strong governance framework and code of

ethics.

B Neutral

The group will be a preferred partner for companies

that value ethical business practices creating a

business that is sustainable in the long term.

Loss of key

management skills

There is a small pool of well skilled and experienced talent at

management and technical levels in the country.

Restraints of trade, retention plans, salary

benchmarking and succession plans in place.

B Neutral

This could create opportunities for the next tier of

management, and/or allow the introduction of fresh

blood into the organistaion.

Financial risk

The group is exposed to exchange rate risk, credit risk and

interest rate risk. There is also the impact of the lack of

financing for capital equipment customers.

Credit risks are managed on an individual

basis and closely monitored. Financial risks are

mitigated where appropriate through a prudent

policy of hedging exposures.

B Neutral

Managing these elements allows us to manage

our business and product pricing better than

competitors.

IT risk

There could be loss of critical information and business

interruption through failures during system changes, or due to

firewall breaches or natural disasters

Disaster recovery plans and back up plans are

tested routinely. Firewalls are tested and there

are strict security controls.

B Neutral

Provide better uptime reliability than competitors.

Business model to

adapt and evolve to

meet world market

changes

The speed of market changes and business process changes

could make current business models redundant with negative

impact on customer demand. This is evident currently in

global production & supply lead times and shipping container

shortages. There is also the ever present potential for

manufactures to establish their own distribution channels.

Focus on service,and superior logistics to retain

customer base. Close engagement with market

participants supports proactive action to develop

new business processes and models, including

the development of digital platforms within

appropriate business operations.

C Unlikely

Differentiate ourselves from competitors and

the rest of the market by providing products

and services that meet the changing customer

requirements.

Acquisition strategy

Acquisitions perform below expectations or expose the group

to unexpected risks.

Well established processes and experienced

management teams evaluate and implement

transactions.

C Unlikely

Good acquisitions are earnings accelerative.

Natural disaster or

pandemic at supplier(s)

site, customer(s) site or

own premises

An event at a supplier site or own premises could disrupt our

supply chain to an extent that severely impacts our business.

Customer(s) forced to cease operation or seek alternative

supply will impact our ongoing business.

We carry adequate stock to allow us sufficient

time to react, with some suppliers able to shift

manufacture to different cities and/or countries.

The Group is not reliant on any one customer or

supplier.

C Unlikely

The correct disaster management plans and

inventory levels will allow us to capture additional

business opportunities. With Covid-19 the group

was able to move quickly into oxygen mask

production.

Litigation risk

The group may be required to either defend or assert its

commercial rights. There is risk of loss if the group is the

defendant, and of costs if the group is the plaintiff.

Use of top advisors and legal firms, with support

at group management level.

D Highly unlikely

Thoroughly investigating all cases could increase

the level of knowledge and result in formalising

rules to avoid repeat events.

Insurance risk

There could be a major loss if a claim is not met due to a

defective policy or if the insurer fails.

Use of reputable well-established brokers

and insurers.

D highly unlikely Provide better uptime reliability than competitors.:

2. Remuneration policy

Remuneration philosophy

The underlying philosophy is to ensure that Invicta can attract,

retain and reward high-quality staff in order that the Group

can grow its business, meet and exceed the business strategy

objectives and grow value for its shareholders. This philosophy

will be carried through in a responsible manner and with due

concern to all stakeholders, which include employees and the

social environment in which the Group operates.

The Group rewards for value created, contribution and

performance. The concept of equal pay for work of equal value

is recognised and driven within the organisation. Invicta’s reward

philosophy strives to enable maximum flexibility in terms of

the utilisation and reward of the workforce, and to provide

maximum choice for individuals in respect of the structuring of

their rewards.

The remuneration philosophy is intended to create an

environment conducive to performance through the reward

structure by enabling growth and development; and by

differentiating appropriately between people through the

various reward methods provided and through the reward

process, on the basis of their contribution.

The remuneration philosophy further tries to establish

accountability and ownership of the reward process with line

management by enabling them to link the total reward process

to their business unit objectives and manage it in a fair and

equitable way, ensuring a balance between remuneration and

quality of life for employees.

Reward strategy

The business strategy defines the objectives that need to be

met in the short, medium and long term. These are reviewed

on an annual basis. The reward strategy is designed to be

aligned with the Group’s business strategy and the execution

of that strategy. The implementation of the strategy will in turn

maximise the performance and effectiveness of the Group.

Invicta’s approach to remuneration is one in which all benefits, guaranteed remuneration, allowances and variable pay are

paid considering several factors such as the performance of Invicta and the individual employee, as well as market forces and

the economic environment. This approach recognises that the ability to attract, retain and motivate not only executives but all

employees, is not wholly dependent upon remuneration but also considers the overall employee satisfaction and engagement. The

remuneration strategy of Invicta shall be guided by the following four forces:

> Group needs and values

> Individual needs and values

> Internal relativities (parity and equity)

> External relativities (salary surveys and benchmarking)

Elements of remuneration

The Group seeks to accomplish various objectives through the different elements of remuneration.

critical skills can be remunerated at the 75th

percentile and above.

Ensure fair remuneration is

paid to all employees.

Short term

incentives

NATURAL CAPITAL

Our businesses comply with the applicable environmental

standards and are regularly monitored with a view to reducing

any negative impact they may have on the environment.

As the Group is primarily engaged in the supply and distribution

of products, we have a relatively low direct environmental

impact. We are nevertheless mindful of ways to minimise the

effect our operations have on the environment and continually

monitor elements such as the carbon footprint of products

sourced from different suppliers and the efficiency of the

distribution methods. Waste recycling occurs as a matter of

course and measures are implemented to ensure no oils and

chemicals are allowed to contaminate the water table and

soil. Our businesses are increasingly moving to solar energy as

the costs decrease. A supply chain social and environmental

responsibility code of conduct was adopted during the previous

financial year.

At ESG, there has been a renewed focus on environmental

issues with a move to recycling and minimising the use of

toxic substances, as well as investigating the use of alternative

energy.

We are committed to continually maintaining the relevant

environmental and quality ISO standards (ISO 14001 and ISO

9001) as appropriate across our operations.

At ESG an audit programme is developed on an annual basis for

planning scheduled internal audits, and annual ISO surveillance

audits by certification bodies.

CEG has appointed an independent consultant to perform

internal audits at all CEG sites on an annual basis, to ensure that

the company complies with the mandatory legal and applicable

ISO standards.

Energy and carbon management

The Group recognises the importance of energy efficiency

in a carbon-constrained world and acknowledges that our

operations produce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG emissions).

The main sources of energy consumption include electricity

consumed by our operations as well as various fuels, such as

diesel and petrol for stationary equipment, mobile machinery,

and vehicles. Energy consumption is currently tracked on a

periodic basis at the ESG operations.

Renewable energy has become an economically attractive

power alternative globally and in South Africa. This is as a result

of the price of renewable technologies steadily declining over

the years. In response to this, ESG is focussing on the roll-out of

solar power installations at BMG World central warehouse and

logistics hub. Which should significantly reduce the amount of

electricity consumed.

From a fuel usage perspective CRM digital technology has

been implemented to limit unnecessary travel. Going forward,

ESG aims to establish measurable objectives for significant

environmental aspects, such as fuel usage.

The Rustenburg Engineering foundry currently monitors stack

emissions, dust from melting, fettling, and from floor moulding.

During the financial year, KAG replaced high bay lightings at the

main warehouse in Singapore with LED lights.

Water management

While we do not undertake water-intensive activities, our

businesses pursue the efficient use of water, particularly in water

stressed areas.

ESG monitors each business’s water withdrawal by source in

order to avoid any negative impact on the local water balance.

Currently, only municipal water is consumed at operations,

alternative sources water supply, such as water from boreholes,

are being investigated. 68 319 cubic meters of municipal water

was consumed by ESG in the year under review.

Waste management

In addition to cutting our carbon emissions and water usage,

the divisions also looked at other ways to reduce our wider

environmental impact including the impact of waste generated.

Waste generation and disposal is currently only formally

measured at the BMG operations in ESG. General waste sent

to landfill in 2021 (15 370 tonnes) decreased by 49% from the

previous financial year (30 287 tonnes). Further a 4 tonnes of

used oil was recycled by BMG in 2021

ESG has introduced a number of waste management initiatives

including the reduction of plastic bottle usage on site, a oil

recycling program, and replacing the usage of toxic substances

with organic substances wherever possible.

KAG has introduced electronic invoicing and statement of

accounts as well as a paperless project in its purchasing

department in order to reduce the amount of waste produced.
