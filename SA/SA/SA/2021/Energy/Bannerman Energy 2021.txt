ABOUT BANNERMAN ENERGY LTD

About Bannerman - Bannerman Energy Ltd is an ASX, OTCQB and NSX listed exploration and development company

with uranium interests in Namibia, a southern African country which is a premier uranium mining

jurisdiction. Bannerman’s principal asset is its 95%-owned Etango Project situated near the Rössing uranium mine,

Paladin’s Langer Heinrich uranium mine and CGNPC’s Husab uranium mine. A definitive feasibility study and an

optimisation study has confirmed the viability of a large open pit and heap leach operation at one of the world’s largest

undeveloped uranium deposits.

From 2015 to 2017, Bannerman conducted a large scale heap leach demonstration program to provide further

assurance to financing parties, generate process information for the detailed engineering design phase and build and

enhance internal capability.

In August 2021, Bannerman completed a Pre-Feasibility Study on an 8Mtpa development of Etango (Etango-8 Project).

The Study has demonstrated that this accelerated, streamlined project is strongly amenable to development – both

technically and economically. A Definitive-Feasibility Study on the Etango-8 Project is underway with targeted

completion scheduled for 3Q CY2022.

More information is available on Bannerman’s website at www.bannermanenergy.com.:

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

BANNERMAN ENERGY LTD

2021 ANNUAL REPORT

1

Dear Fellow Shareholder

I am delighted to share that your company is in a strong position at a time when the uranium sector is poised to

benefit from fundamental tail winds that are propelling the prospects of nuclear power. These prospects have been

recognised early by equity investors, as they often are. Accordingly, uranium equities have benefitted from a re-

rating that has seen the value of your company increase several-fold since our last annual general meeting,

outperforming most of the uranium sector in that period. The uranium spot price has also increased, initially as a

result of investors recognising that uranium’s decade-long trading range is economically unsustainable. This

recognition has taken several forms, notably the rapid capitalisation of uranium-focused ETFs (all of which include

Bannerman Energy) and the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust.

Bannerman’s outperformance is a gratifying endorsement of a well-formulated strategy that has been disciplined,

focused and superbly executed by your management. This strategy has generated additional value to our flagship

Etango project, continued our stewardship of shareholder funds and a yielded a nuanced view of the uranium

market via your CEO, Brandon Munro.

In August we further progressed our advanced Etango Uranium Project with the publication of the Etango-8 Pre-

Feasibility Study (PFS). Etango-8 is a streamlined development approach to the world-class scale resource

endowment that we are blessed with in Namibia. The Etango-8 PFS further demonstrated the credibility of this

approach and the quality of the technical work, with economics that improved on the August 2020 Scoping Study.

We are now busy with the Etango-8 Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS), which will benefit from the fact that a DFS has

already been completed at Etango, albeit as a much larger development proposition.

The Etango-8 PFS confirmed the viability of a mine with an initial average production of 3.5 million pounds per

annum over an initial life of 15 years1. Once the mine is operational, there is realistic potential for expanding

production, extending mine life or both, given the scale of Etango’s total mineral resource and that the

mineralisation continues beneath the currently modelled resources.

We conducted a carefully planned capital raising in February 2021, which maintained Bannerman’s strong balance

sheet and ensured the company was capitalised for completion of the Etango-8 DFS and beyond. At 30 June 2021

we held $12.5 million in cash and had no debt. Funds were raised at a share price more than twice the 12-month

volume weighted average price of BMN shares on ASX and a 120% premium to our last raising price in 2018. This

pleasing result confirms the value of our sophisticated understanding of the uranium market and the benefits of

financial prudence.

Our strong balance sheet and share price presented an opportunity to buy-back and extinguish the only third-party

royalty over the Etango project. Extinguishment of this 1.5% royalty was highly value accretive and has increased

shareholder leverage to recovering uranium prices whilst simplifying future financing of the project.

Whilst COVID-19 has had a pronounced effect on Namibia and our host community, the various restrictions,

including international travel bans, did not unduly affect our business. This is partly the good fortune of being in a

feasibility phase of our development and partly due to the effectiveness of our senior management in Namibia.

We continue to recognise the benefits of Etango’s domicile in Namibia, which has a 45-year history of uranium

mining and currently ranks third in the world by production volume. Namibia boasts political stability and security,

excellent infrastructure in proximity to our project, effective environmental regulations and social and government

support for uranium mining. Our strong in-country presence and engagement has characterised Bannerman’s

approach since 2006, enabling us to fully embrace such advantages, including community and government support

for developing Etango.

I am particularly proud to say that Bannerman is internationally recognised for its good corporate citizenship, having

consistently demonstrated outstanding environmental, social and governance credentials that are consistent with

best practice ESG principles. We earned a reputation as a leader in community engagement, social development

and environmental stewardship – and built that foundation long before ESG became a talking point.:

2021 ANNUAL REPORT

We continued our focus on the health and safety of our employees, with Bannerman approaching its 12th

consecutive year without a lost time injury.

On your behalf, I would like to recognise the effectiveness and dedication of the Bannerman team in Namibia and

Australia. I am grateful to all Bannerman stakeholders, including the Namibian government, our host community

and the One Economy Foundation (which holds a 5% ownership of the Etango Project) for their continued support of

our pathway to development.

Your Board remains excited about Etango-8 and our position within the uranium sector. The Etango-8 development

pathway enables us to get into production to benefit from the current uranium cycle, whilst having the option of

increasing our production rate in the future to take advantage of deepening forecasted deficits in the uranium

market over the course of this decade.

Yours sincerely,

Ronnie Beevor

Chairman
