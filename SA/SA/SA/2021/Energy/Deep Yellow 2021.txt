Summary Information

2

Managing Director in October 2016, the Company set a new direction

built around a unique, counter-cyclical strategy focused on organic and inorganic growth to deliver a 5-10Mlb annually with a

low cost, multi-project global uranium platform.

Organic growth will be delivered through exploration and development of the Company’s Namibian project portfolio. Since

2016, exploration success has nearly quadrupled the resource base at the Reptile Project, at an extremely low discovery cost

of 9.4c/lb.

The Company’s “inorganic” growth plan is based on a targeted merger and acquisition program to establish a diversified

portfolio of uranium operations for development from 2023 onwards. Effective execution of this unique strategy requires a

leadership team with a proven track record, extensive industry knowledge and capability to deliver.

To service the Company’s growth strategy, Deep Yellow has assembled a highly credible, proven uranium team that brings

strong project development, operational and corporate capabilities. The majority of this team successfully worked together

at Paladin Energy, which grew from a $2M explorer into a $4B high-quality uranium producer pre-Fukushima.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 2021 FINANCIAL YEAR

•

Tumas DFS focussed on evaluation of a 20+ year LOM commenced in March after a successful PFS completed in

February 2021, evaluating viability of palaeochannel-related Langer Heinrich-style deposits.

•

Tumas PFS incorporated uranium resources from only a portion of the available Inferred Resources on Tumas 1, 2

and 3 ore bodies producing positive economics for a 11.5-year LOM.

•

Infill resource upgrade drilling in support of the expanded DFS completed at Tumas 1 East (Tumas 1E) and Tumas 3

deposits with impressive conversion from Inferred to Indicated Resource JORC 2012 category giving confidence that

this will achieve sufficient Ore Reserves to satisfy a 20+ year LOM at a production rate of circa 3Mlb pa.

•

JOGMEC completed A$4.5M earn-in obligation in September 2020 with drilling identifying a prospect of significance

at Barking Gecko, a basement alaskite associated Husab/Rössing-style target. All Nova JV partners are now

contributing, and follow-up drilling continues to return positive results.

•

Completion of a successful capital raising program in July 2021, involving both a placement and Share Purchase Plan.

This raised A$42M to support advancement of the feasibility studies on the Reptile Project and M&A activities.

•

The Company successfully carried out its activities despite the uncertainties and volatility caused by the COVID-19

pandemic. The adoption of a strict regimen of health and hygiene practices and social distancing enabled workstreams

to be undertaken to safeguard the Company’s key assets while protecting the wellbeing of staff.:

Dear Shareholder

Despite the challenges of Covid and the uranium price remaining at a low level, Deep Yellow has

made excellent progress on creating value, and remains focused on its long-term strategy.

Starting first with Health and Safety. Despite the pandemic continuing to disrupt society and

business globally, I am pleased to report that the company continued to make progress. Our

employees, especially those based in Namibia, applied strict health controls to all aspects of their

work, protecting their health whilst ensuring all business activities progressed, on the whole, to

schedule. Electronic communication replaced face to face engagement between Australia and

Namibia, which again allowed normal business progression.

On safety, I was also pleased to see that all on the ground exploration and other project activities

were achieved with no recordable injuries. This is attributable to our health and safety systems

and the strong safety culture of our extended teams.

Deep Yellow’s credentials in Environment Social and Governance (ESG) were recognised

externally in September 2021, when the Company was awarded Emerging ESG Leader by the

Australia Africa Minerals and Energy Group (AAMEG).

Your Company remained focused on the three strategic levers for value creation

•

further exploration of the Namibian mineral leases

•

progressing engineering studies on the Tumas Project

•

inorganic growth through merger and acquisition

Excellent results were achieved in exploration. Infill resource drilling at Tumas 1E and Tumas 3 deposits exceeded

expectations, which will ensure sufficient reserves will be available to support a twenty-year plus mine life. The joint venture

with JOGMEC at Barking Gecko was also very positive with initial drilling identifying a prospect of significance.

The DFS on the Tumas Project commenced following the earlier PFS study completed in February 2021. The study work,

along with environmental and other work, is all progressing to schedule.

Finally, on merger and acquisitions, a dedicated senior executive has been recruited to the role of business development and

a strategy refresh has been completed. This strategic lever will be a major focus in FY2022.

The long-term outlook remains very positive - the ramping of clean energy targets globally will mean that nuclear power will

play an even more important part in meeting the worlds future energy demand.

I was pleased to be asked to Chair the Board of your Company and I want to ensure all shareholders that the board and

management team remain focused on continuing to grow shareholder value in the years ahead. On behalf of the Board, I

would like to acknowledge Rudolf’s contribution in his role as Chair and thank him for his service in that role.

Finally, I would like to thank John Borshoff for his leadership and the efforts of the team he is building in anticipation of the

growth of the Company.

Overview of Executive Remuneration

(a)

Executive Remuneration Policies, Processes and Practices

Four principles guide the Group’s decisions about executive remuneration:

∗

Reasonable and fair: provide a fair level of reward to all employees, taking into account the Group’s legal and

industrial obligations, labour market conditions, relativity to the scale of the business and peer group comparison;

∗

Value adding: build a culture of achievement by attracting, motivating and retaining high performing individuals who

will add value to the Group;

∗

Alignment: promote mutually beneficial outcomes by aligning the interests of Executives with shareholder objectives;

and

∗

Group culture: drive leadership performance and behaviours that create a culture that promotes safety, diversity and

stakeholder satisfaction.

The key objectives of the Group’s award framework therefore ensure that remuneration practices are based on the above

principles, in compliance with the Corporations Act, the ASX Listing Rules and are also in accordance with principles of good

corporate governance.:

Managing Director and Executive

Director in FY21:: Managing

Managing Director

Executive Director

How is it paid?

Following

the

assessment

of annual

performance, approximately 32% of STI is

delivered as cash and 68% as previously

issued Loan Plan Shares of which a third

vest

immediately

and

the

remainder

continue with a two-year deferral period

over which it vests equally.

100% of STI deferred into Loan Plan

Shares vesting equally over two years

The Loan Plan Shares rewards and incentivises the participants through an arrangement

where shares are offered subject to the achievement of annual objectives and time-based

vesting conditions.

The purchase price payable by the participant for the ordinary shares is lent to the

participant under an interest free limited recourse loan, with the loan secured against the

shares. The loan can be repaid at any time, however, to avoid compulsory divestment of

Loan Plan Shares, the loan must be repaid on the earlier of 5 years after the issuance of

the shares and the occurrence of:

(a)

in the case of vested shares, the date being 12 months after cessation of

employment or service contract for any reason; or

(b)

pre-determined occurrences as per the Loan Share Plan including but not limited

to a Control Event or material breach by the Participant.

Loan Plan Shares were deliberately chosen because they provide an appropriate level of

incentive in a competitive environment and are cost effective in that there is no cash outlay

for the Group which is appropriate given the Group’s exploration status.

The deferred component was introduced in FY19 to align with Australian market practice.

How much can be earned?

A maximum STI opportunity of 77% of

annual service fee can be earned as

follows:

∗

25% Cash

∗

52% Deferred into Loan Plan Shares

A maximum STI opportunity of 30% of

annual service fee can be earned as

Deferred Loan Plan Shares vesting equally

over two years.

Payment of any STI is entirely discretionary and the mix of cash and Loan Plan Shares

can be adjusted as per Board discretion. The governance process and principles adopted

by the Board in making the executive pay decisions, specifically during the COVID-19

pandemic, are based on but not limited to:

∗

Proactively considering whether discretion needs to be exercised due to the

continued change in operating environment arising from the COVID-19 pandemic

∗

Receiving structured and broader insights and independent information from control

functions such as finance, risk and human resources;

∗

The Remuneration Committee maintaining an independent role in overseeing the

function of proposing remuneration decisions to the Board; and

∗

Transparently record and communicate the inputs received that led to discretion

being applied.:

Managing Director

Executive Director

How is performance

measured?

The STI performance measures were

chosen as they provide a framework for

delivering short term success and long-term

value to the Group and its shareholders.

They reflect the core drivers of short-term

performance and recognise and reward the: Managing

Managing Director and Executive Director to reward them for their

contribution to the creation of shareholder value over the long term and is therefore linked partly to shareholder returns and

reflects “pay for results” opposed to “pay for performance” as is the case with short term incentives. The incentives are

summarised below.: Managing

Managing Director

Executive Director

What happens if there is a

change of control?

In the event of a change of control of the Group, the Board may determine, in its absolute

discretion, that some or all of the unvested Loan Plan Shares will automatically vest in a

manner that allows the Executive to participate in and/or benefit from any transaction from

or in connection with the Change of Control Event.

Are executives eligible for

dividends?

The Executive is entitled to receive dividends on unvested Loan Plan Shares. For so long

as there is an outstanding loan balance in relation to the Loan Plan Shares, the Executive

irrevocably and unconditionally directs the Company to withhold all after-tax dividends in

respect of the participants Loan Plan Shares and apply all amounts so withheld in

repayment of the outstanding loan balance.

Sign-on Payments

In addition to fixed remuneration, STI and LTI, the Board may determine, from time to time, to award sign-on payments to

new executives. There were no sign-on payments made in FY21.

The maximum STI was awarded to the: Managing

Managing Director and executive management team.

The Group has identified its operating segments based on internal reports that are used by the Group: Managing

Managing Director, Executive Director, employees and contractors and

subject to long term performance conditions and repayment of limited recourse loan made to the participant to purchase

the shares. The shares may not be traded until the shares have vested, any imposed dealing restrictions have ended

and the limited recourse loan in respect to those shares has been paid in full.

(ii)

Ordinary shares previously issued under the Loan Share Plan were cancelled as relevant vesting criteria were not met.:

Managing Director, Executive Director, employees and contractors

under the Deep Yellow Limited Loan Share Plan (Loan Share Plan). The Loan Share Plan rewards and incentivises

employees (including Directors who are employees of the Company) and contractors (Participant), where shareholder

approval has been granted (if required), through an arrangement where Participants are offered shares subject to long term

performance conditions. The shares are offered at market value such that the incentive is linked to the increase in value over

and above the purchase price and so aligns the Participants to the risks and rewards of a shareholder. The purchase price

payable by the Participant for the ordinary shares is lent to the Participant under an interest free limited recourse loan, with

the loan secured against the shares. A Participant may not trade shares acquired under the Loan Share Plan until the shares

have vested, any imposed dealing restrictions have ended and the limited recourse loan in respect to those shares has been

paid in full. For so long as there is an outstanding loan balance, the Participant irrevocably and unconditionally directs the

Company to withhold all after tax dividends in respect of the Participants Loan Plans Shares and apply all amounts so withheld

in repayment of the outstanding loan balance. The loan can be repaid at any time, however, to avoid compulsory divestment

of Loan Plan Shares, the loan must be repaid on the earlier of periods ranging between 5-10 years (determined with each

issue) after the issuance of the shares and the occurrence of:

(a)

in the case of vested shares, the date being 12 months after cessation of employment or service contract for any

reason; or

(b)

pre-determined occurrences as per the Loan Share Plan including but not limited to a Control Event or material breach

by the Participant.

The shares vest if certain Company share price targets and clearly defined business goals (where applicable) covering non-

financial performance measures are met and the holder of the awards remains employed with the Company during the

measurement period. If these conditions are not met the shares are forfeited and the forfeited shares are treated as full

consideration for the repayment of the loan. The fair value at grant date is estimated using a Black Scholes option pricing

model for shares with non-market based vesting conditions and a Monte-Carlo model for those with market based vesting

conditions.
