UPDATE

IN CONCLUSION

As the 2021 financial year commences, we continue

to take every precaution to ensure the safety of

our employees, contractors and the community

in which we operate. Expenditure has not

exceeded the projected Use of Funds from the

Offer document for the listing on the ASX in June

2019. Renergen remains committed to delivering

the greatest possible returns to investors and

stakeholders on all these fronts.

At the time of going to print with our IAR (after

reporting period), Renergen is pleased to announce

the successful placement of 2,453,328 CDIs at A$1.78

per security on the Australian Securities Exchange

and 3,178,459 shares at R19.10 (representing a

9.5% discount to the Renergen VWAP for the 30

days prior to the issue price being agreed) on the

Johannesburg Securities Exchange, raising a total

equivalent of approximately A$10 million through

the issue of a total of 5,631,787 new shares (the

placement).

The placement was oversubscribed by a

combination of existing as well as new domestic

and international institutions and investors. I would

like to take this opportunity to welcome the new

investors to our Company and thank the existing

investors for their continued support. We look

forward to unlocking future value together.:

audit plan and the audit fees payable to Mazars.

The Audit Committee further satisfactorily

monitored the External Auditors’ progress

against the approved audit plan and assessed

the quality and effectiveness of the external audit

function, including receiving confirmation that

there was no scope limitation or restriction to

access to management. Following the statutory

audit, the External Auditors’ report provided the

Audit Committee with the necessary assurance

on Renergen’s risk management processes,

internal control environment and IT systems.

It also provided assurance that no reportable

irregularities had been identified and that there

are no unresolved issues that impact the annual

financial statements presented.

The Committee has recommended the re-

appointment of Mazars as the independent External

Auditors and Mr Shaun Vorster as the designated,

JSE approved audit partner, for the financial year

ending 28 February 2022, for consideration by

shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

The approved Group audit fee for the year under

review is R0.735 million (2020: R0.7 million). A formal

procedure has been adopted to govern the process

where the External Auditors may be considered for:

letter of representation to enable them to attend the AGM, or, alternatively,

should the dematerialised shareholder not wish to attend the AGM, they should provide their CSDP or broker

with their voting instructions.

Forms of proxy must reach the Company’s transfer secretaries, Computershare Investor Services Proprietary

Limited, at Rosebank Towers, 15 Biermann Avenue, Rosebank 2196, to be received by them by no later than

12:00 on Wednesday, 28 July 2021 (or 48 (forty-eight) hours before any adjournments of the AGM which date, if

necessary, will be notified on SENS). Thereafter, forms of proxy may be delivered to the chairperson of the AGM,

at the AGM, before voting on a particular resolution commences.

AGM participants may be required to provide identification to the reasonable satisfaction of the chairperson

of the AGM. An official identification document issued by the South African Department of Home Affairs, a

driving license or a valid passport will be accepted as sufficient identification.

Shareholders who have any doubt as to what action they are required to take in respect of the following

resolutions, should consult their CSDP, broker, banker, attorney, accountant or other professional adviser

immediately.

On a poll, ordinary shareholders will have one vote in respect of each share held.
