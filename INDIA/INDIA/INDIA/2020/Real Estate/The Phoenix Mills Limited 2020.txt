34:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to present to you the

Annual Report for FY2020. This was mostly a year of

anticipated progress for The Phoenix Mills Limited

(PML) as we continued to be on track to meet most

of our set goals, but for the pause imposed on all of

us by the COVID-19 pandemic in the last month of

the financial year. Despite this sudden disruption,

FY2020 was largely a great year for your Company.

Our Journey

Through an exciting journey of innovation, capital

raising and the successful build-up of a formidable

portfolio of prized assets over the last many years,

we have today emerged as the undisputed leader in

Indian Mall space. Our purpose and vision are based

on our ardent allegiance to India’s strong consumption

story, and it is this undeterred focus that has brought

your Company to such great heights of success. Our

relatively young and iconic retail assets have matured

into landmark destinations in the key gateway cities

of India. Supported by profitable complementary

projects commercial and hospitality assets, strategic

prime residential developments; we have developed

our own unique and successful approach to sustained

value creation. Over the last seven years of our

operations, we have recorded 15% compounded

growth in consumption and 14% of compounded

growth in rentals. These numbers are indicative

of an outlier performance by any comparison.

The COVID-19 pandemic and our response

Under the cloud of the COVID-19 pandemic, we

realise that as a responsible company, our destinations

need to be havens of trust and safety. Our people,

retailers and consumers must feel secure in our

environments, so that they can go about living their

lives as normally as possible. Therefore, our prime

objective is to ensure that the wellbeing of all our

CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS:

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT: Dear Shareholders,

FY2020 was a year of significant achievements for The

Phoenix Mills Limited, as we expanded our business,

enhanced our asset portfolio, strengthened our balance

sheet, and remain committed to our vision of doubling

our asset base by FY2024. We have now reached at a

remarkable juncture in our journey, where we enjoy

a whole new level of operational scale, capital speed

and management bandwidth to grow from. Overall,

FY2020 was a good year until the sudden outbreak of

the COVID-19 pandemic challenged human lives and

economies around the globe. With several measures

taken by the Government of India to contain the virus,

the nationwide lockdown imposed a temporary pause

on our business operations. However, we expect that

the pandemic and its surrounding impact will persist

in the short to medium term for PML. In the long run,

we are confident that our mindful business strategies

will place us advantageously to bounce back from this

crisis and emerge as a stronger company. Our resilient

balance sheet and adequate liquidity positions will

further provide us with the strength to explore new

opportunities while continuing to meet our previously

set targets.

WE LAUNCHED OUR MOST

AWAITED MALL, PHOENIX

PALASSIO IN LUCKNOW,

DURING THE LOCKDOWN

PERIOD. OUR PURPOSE IS TO

MAKE THE MALL AN ICONIC

LANDMARK NOT ONLY IN

LUCKNOW BUT IN THE ENTIRE

STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH.

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT

the environment, our employees, and the community

large. We are challenging ourselves every day to create

a positive influence on underprivileged communities

by supporting a myriad of initiatives. Our philosophy

of giving back to society motivates us to contribute

towards the overall development of the country. With

our thoughtful CSR initiatives, we are taking steps

towards making the world a better place to live. We

incurred the CSR related expenditure in the areas

of conservation of the environment; promotion of

education, especially among underprivileged children;

and livelihood enhancement projects for women.

Our extensive work on water conservation with Aakar

Charitable Trust is detailed further in this report.

Sustainability, for PML, is more than just a corporate

responsibility. It is an integral part of our organisation,

and we are fully committed to operate and grow a

business that puts social responsibility at the forefront of

everything we do. We aim to consistently deliver value

to the communities that surround as in whichever way

possible.

Read more about our sustainability efforts on page 68

Outlook – Our roadmap for the future

At PML, our focus is directed towards becoming a true

proxy to the Indian wallet. We want to be at the forefront

of driving the consumption story of India. We aim to

do this by making our assets the undisputed leaders

in the industry and across different markets in India.

While the next phase of growth will be determined

by extending presence across the country, we are also

equally excited about our growth promise derived

from our densification strategy of our existing assets, as

many of them harbour substantial potential for further

development.

The unprecedented pandemic has presented

considerable challenges to the economy, businesses

and individuals. It has also affected the consumption

behaviour of people to a large extent. It is difficult to

estimate the length and severity of the reduction in

demand due to COVID-19. However, even with these

current challenges, I am confident that PML will be able

to generate quality growth as India possesses all the

underlying drivers ensuring that our consumption story

stays intact. We believe that our business model will

continue to be relevant in the times to come. As cities

expand and urbanise, they provide opportunities for

retail destinations to rise and become the ‘go-to-places’

in the town. We are in the business of building such

town-centric locations across key cities of India where:
