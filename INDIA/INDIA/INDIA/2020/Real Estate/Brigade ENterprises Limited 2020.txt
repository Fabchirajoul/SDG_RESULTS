Dear Shareholders,

It has been an eventful year for

us as we went through cycles of

hope, despair and desolation. With

an unprecedented victory in the

general elections by a single party,

we were hopeful that infrastructure

and real estate development will

see a huge upswing in activities and

get the industry out of its cyclical

10-year business slowdown. We are

no strangers to economic slowdown

/ recession, particularly for the real

estate sector and had seen similar

trends in the years 1988-1991, 1998-

2001, 2008-2011 and now. Our current

slowdown cycle for the industry

started quite early in 2016-2017 due

to demonetisation, the introduction

of RERA and Goods and Service Tax.

However, the hope set into despair as

the liquidity crisis plagued the country

furthering the negative consumer

sentiment across the country. While

we did see some green shoots by

the third quarter of the financial year

2019-20, the year ended on a desolate

note with the outbreak of the COVID-19

across the globe.

CMD's

Communiqué

It was certainly a tough, uncertain

and challenging financial year. In the

past and even during the current

slowdown, we did what we do best

– treat challenges as opportunities.

Brigade with its diverse portfolio, and

more importantly due to following

its core values, is managing not only

to survive but also grow during the

financial year.

We

launched

multiple

projects

across residential and commercial

and ensured that we are on track to

complete our projects. During the

year, we saw a sale of 4.3 million

square foot (msf), an increase of 44%

over FY19 of which 3.9 msf was for

residential including three projects

in the affordable housing segment

and 0.4 million msf of commercial

projects. Further, we launched Real

Estate projects of 5.28 msf during

the financial year 2019-20 even as

we added 151 keys to our hospitality

portfolio taking our total keys to

1345 keys for financial year 2019-20.

This was Brigade’s best operational

performance in a financial year, where

we have sold an area of 4.3 million sft

and cash collections at ` 2,539 crores.

All our business segments- Residential,

Lease Rental and Hospitality, have

performed strongly in FY20 and the

same is reflected in the numbers.

Brigade Group has posted revenue

of ` 2,682 crores with Earnings

before Depreciation, Interest, Tax &

Amortization (EBDITA) margin of 27%

at ` 713 crores and a Net Profit after

Tax & Minority Interest of ` 131 crores

for the financial year 2019-20.

The unprecedented crisis due to

COVID-19

pandemic

resulting

in

the nationwide lockdown has had a

negative impact on all sectors. However,

we expect business to gradually pick

up from the third quarter of the financial

year 2020-21. We had undertaken

COVID-19 relief efforts and initiatives

during the lockdown period for around

10,000 migrant workers at our various

project sites. The details of the same

are listed out in this Annual Report as

The Group is also subject to certain legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of

either through joint development arrangements or through outright purchases, the impact of which is not quantifiable.

These cases are pending with various courts and are scheduled for hearings. After considering the circumstances

and legal evaluation thereon, the management believes that these cases will not have an adverse effect on the

Consolidated Ind AS financial statements.

The Group has received a legal notice from a vendor demanding payment of compensation of `1,214 lakhs for

procuring maximum permissible Floor Space Index for development of land parcels procured from such vendor.

The Group does not expect any payment in respect of the aforesaid obligation/ claim and it is not probable that an

outflow of resources will be required to settle the same and hence, no provision has been made in the Consolidated

Ind AS financial statements in this regard.

In November 2017, a search under Section 132(1) of Income Tax Act, 1961, was conducted at various premises of the

Group. The management has complied with / responded to the notices received in this regard. During the year,
