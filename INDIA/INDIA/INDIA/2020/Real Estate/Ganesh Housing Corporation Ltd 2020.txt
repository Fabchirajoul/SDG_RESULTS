Dear Shareholders,

Even as I write this, the world is facing

the brunt of the social distancing,

lockdown,

and

economic

disruption.

The outbreak of Covid-19 has brought

the world to an unthinkable crossroad.

These unprecedented times are not just

changing the way we live our lives right

now but also the future. I am hoping for

your and your family’s safety right now and

in the times to come.

On the economy front, the sluggish

global economy of 2019 rubbed off its

effect in India along with the homegrown

cyclical economic issues. The country’s

GDP growth sharply skimmed down from

6.8% in FY19 to below 5% in FY20. The last

quarter of the financial year was disrupted

by the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic.

The complete lockdown, as enforced by

the Government to contain the spread

of the virus,dragged down economic

activities across India in March 2020. This

impacted our demand severely as we

felt the recessionary aftermath. With the

extended lockdown significantly plaguing

the overall growth in the next fiscal across

sectors, the first quarter is expected to

be gravely weighed down. There is also

an anticipation of a gradual easing of

the impact during the second quarter.

However, normalcy may not fully restore

before the second half of 2020-21. We are

anticipating recovery during this same

period, largely be driven by our presence

and offerings in the affordability segment.

Financial highlights

During the year under review total income

on

consolidated

basis

increased

to

Rs.27733.11 lakhs from Rs. 26720.57 lakhs

in the Previous Year. Total expenditure

increased from 19011.92 lakh in the Previous

Year to Rs.32773.40 lakhs on consolidated

basis. After providing for finance cost and

depreciation the consolidated loss before

tax stood at Rs.13236.12 lakhs and loss after

tax was Rs.11962.63 lakhs.

Highlights for the year

While we are pleased with the year gone

by, the current year is sure to throw in

new challenges along with opportunities.

Our resilience and agility will critically

help us emerge stronger from this crisis.

FY21 is likely to be the first financial year

in the recent times where India’s GDP

growth is anticipated to be negative.

With the crisis leading to significant job

cuts and salary reductions already, it is

sure to have demand ramifications on

high value purchases such as residential

real estate. However, our biggest strength

lies in Affordable Housing Segment and

with the current scenario, we are hoping

this to prove as a boon for the Company

in

the

post-Covidworld.

Additionally,

various norms relating to redevelopment

of existing societies,as declared by the

authorities, are also expected to work in

our favour.

Opportunities

As on March 31, 2020, our group land bank

stood at 27.83 mn sq. ft. (639.13 acres)

We hold around 60 acres of land near the

Nirma University at Chharodi and Tragad.

The Government recently announced the

preliminary town planning scheme no. 36

and 64 for Chharodi – Tragad and Tragad

Land respectively.

In the new emerging market, driven by the

Chairman’s Message

While we are pleased with the year gone by, the current year

is sure to throw in new challenges along with opportunities.

Our resilience and agility will critically help us emerge stronger

from this crisis.

Note : Effective April 1, 2017, the Company adopted the amendment to Ind AS 7, which require the entities to provide disclosures that enable

users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows

and non-cash changes, suggesting inclusion of a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the Balance Sheet for liabilities

arising from financing activities, to meet the disclosure requirement. The adoption of the amendment did not have any material impact on

the financial statements.

Considered the adequacy of the disclosures in note 22 to the

consolidated financial statements in respect of recognising

Advance paid for purchase of Investments - refer note 4 to the consolidated financial statements

Assessment of advance paid for purchase of Investments represents

a significant portion of the Group total assets.

The carrying value of advance for purchase of Investments are

tested for executing agreement by the Company by comparing the

valuation of investments in the same area for which advances have

been given. Considering the quantum of the amount of carrying

value of advances to total assets of the Group and significant

estimates and judgements involved in assessing execute of

agreement of advances for purchase of investments, this has been

considered as a key audit matter

Our audit procedures to assess the recoverability of advance paid for

purchase of Investments included the following:

•

Enquiry with the Group personnel on the process of providing

advance for purchase of Investments and test of key controls

over such advances paid during earlier year;

•

Enquiry with the Group personnel also covered obtaining

reasons on the long-standing advance for purchase of

Investments and understanding Group plan for conversion of

the advance for purchase of Investments to Investments;

•

For our samples, verified the underlying agreements or

Memorandum of understanding in possession of the Group,

based on which advance for purchase of Investments were

given, to assess the Company’s rights over the investments in

subject;

Inventories - refer note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

Assessment of net realisable value (NRV) of inventories:

Inventories on construction of residential units comprising ongoing

and completed projects, initiated but unlaunched projects and land

stock, represents a significant portion of the Group total assets.

The Group recognises profit on the sale of each commercial

& residential unit with reference to the overall profit margin

depending upon the total cost incurred on the project. A project

comprises multiple units, the construction of which is carried out

over a number of year. The recognition of profit for sale of a unit,

is therefore dependent on the estimate of future selling prices and

construction costs. Further, estimation uncertainty and exposure to

cyclicality exists within long- term projects.

Forecasts of future sales are dependent on market conditions,

which can be difficult to predict and be influenced by political and

economic factors.

Considering the significance of the amount of carrying value of

inventories and the involvement of significant estimation and

judgement in assessment of NRV, this is considered as a key audit

matter.

Our audit procedures to assess the net realisable value (NRV) of

inventories included the following:

•

Enquiry with the Group personnel to understand the basis of

computation and justification for the estimated recoverable

amounts of the unsold units (“the NRV assessment”);

•

Assessing the Group valuation methodology for the key

estimates, data inputs and assumptions adopted in the

valuation. This involved comparing expected average selling

prices with published data such as recently transacted prices

for similar properties located in nearby vicinity of each project

and the sales budget maintained by the Company;

•

While analyzing the expected average selling price, we have

performed a sensitivity analysis on the selling price and

compared this to the budgeted cost;

•

For our samples, obtained the fair valuation reports of such

land parcels for assessing the valuation methodology, key

estimates and assumptions adopted in the valuation; and

•

Verifying the NRV assessment and comparing the estimated

construction costs to complete each development with the

Group updated budgets;
