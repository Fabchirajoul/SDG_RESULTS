Chairman's

Message: Dear Shareholders,

With the blessings of Lala Anant Ram Sarin and

Smt. Raj Kumari Sarin, We are pleased to present our annual

report for FY 2019-20. While we are happy to report several

positive developments at your Company, it is disheartening

that these come at a time when the world is passing

through an unprecedented crisis due to the COVID-19

pandemic. Millions of people and businesses globally have

been impacted because of it and the global economy has

officially entered recession with two consequent quarters

of GDP de-growth.

These external disturbances have impacted the industry in

which we operate i.e. real estate. The industry was already

facing strong macro headwinds in the form of RERA, GST,

demonetisation and stock overhand; the COVID-19 crisis

has created newer challenges. However, as they say, every

dark cloud has a silver lining. As you read this, there are at

least four vaccines that are in the final stages of approval.

This has sparked a wave of positivity and optimism across

the globe. Business are now ramping up plans in preparation

for the quick recovery and rebound expected to come in

early 2021.

Performance Review FY 2019-20

Our total income grew 23% to ` 417.60 Crore driven

by healthy sales of residential properties and sustained

rental incomes from our commercial and retail properties.

Profitability, however, was under pressure due to surge in

costs. EBITDA declined 14.57% to ` 66.73 Crore and

PAT declined 15.81% to ` 27.33 Crore.

Coming to the operational performance: in the residential

business, our JV – Avarna Projects LLP – with Birla

Estates Private Limited has successfully completed and

launched the Phase I of the independent floors project at

our flagship Anant Raj Estate Township located on the

Our strong

foundation of land

bank, assets and proven

execution excellence combined

with the strong potential

of significant growth from

JV deals, data centres and

warehousing rentals points to

a stronger future ahead
