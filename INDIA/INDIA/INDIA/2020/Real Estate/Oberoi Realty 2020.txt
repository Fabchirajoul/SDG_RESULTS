letter of allotment and when control of

the goods or services are transferred to the customer, at an amount that reflects the consideration (i.e.

the transaction price) to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or

services excluding any amount received on behalf of third party (such as indirect taxes). An asset created

by the Group’s performance does not have an alternate use and as per the terms of the contract, the

Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed till date. Hence the Group

transfers control of a good or service over time and, therefore, satisfies a performance obligation

and recognises revenue over time. The Group recognises revenue at the transaction price which is

determined on the basis of agreement or: letter of allotment entered into with the customer. The Group

recognises revenue for performance obligation satisfied over time only if it can reasonably measure its

progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. The Group would not be able

to reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation if it lacks

reliable information that would be required to apply an appropriate method of measuring progress.

In those circumstances, the Group recognises revenue only to the extent of cost incurred until it can

reasonably measure outcome of the performance obligation.

The Group uses cost based input method for measuring progress for performance obligation satisfied

over time. Under this method, the Group recognises revenue in proportion to the actual project cost

incurred (excluding land cost) as against the total estimated project cost (excluding land cost).

The management reviews and revises its measure of progress periodically and are considered as

change in estimates and accordingly, the effect of such changes in estimates is recognised prospectively

in the period in which such changes are determined.

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the

customer. If the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer

pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration

that is conditional.

A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group

has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer

pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is

recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities

are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.

A receivable represents the Group’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e.,

only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting

policies of financial assets in note 1.2.11 Financial instruments - initial recognition and subsequent

measurement.

(ii) Revenue from hospitality

Revenue comprises sale of rooms, food and beverages and allied services relating to hotel operations.

Revenue is recognised upon rendering of the service, provided pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists,

tariff/rates are fixed or are determinable and collectability is reasonably certain. Revenue from sales of goods

or rendering of services is net of indirect taxes, returns and discounts.
