GODREJ PROPERTIES LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20:

Dear Shareholders,

I hope that you, your families, and loved ones are safe and doing

well. I write to you amidst uncertain times. The global spread

of COVID 19 and India’s lockdown have created an economic

environment filled with uncertainty and risk. Our first priority

has been to ensure that our workforce is safe. Thousands of

laborers remained at our construction sites throughout the

lockdown, and we provided them meals and sanitized living

conditions. For our employees, we’ve maintained salary levels

and bonuses, and avoided any layoffs. The Godrej Group

has committed an initial fund of INR 50 crore to address the

impact of the pandemic.

Our earlier stated medium-term goals – to consistently be

among the leading developers by value of residential real estate

sales in our core markets, and to consistently deliver a Return on

Equity (ROE) in excess of 20% -- remain the key financial focus

areas for your company. Despite the continued disruptions the

real estate sector has faced including the current pandemic, we

believe we are on track to achieve these goals.

While the end of the year saw significant disruption due to the

lockdown at the end of Q4 FY20, I’m happy to share that on

the whole, FY20 was another strong year for your company.

Godrej Properties had its best ever year measured by the

value and volume of real estate sold. Our bookings for the year

grew by 11%, to INR 5,915 crore, and resulted from the sale

of 7,415 homes with a total area of 8.8 million square feet.

This averages to over 20 homes per day. The fourth quarter

was particularly strong, contributing approximately 40%

of annual sales. We sold more than 1.1 million square feet

with a booking value of over INR 1,000 crore in each of our

four focus markets of MMR, Pune, NCR and Bangalore. We

achieved this through a combination of strong new launches

-- with sales of INR 2,795 crore -- and sustained momentum

in sales from existing inventory, which grew by 38% to INR

3,120 crore in FY20. Strong sales from existing inventory led

to greater percentage of cash collection from each sale, which

in turn ensured our collections from residential sales were

the highest they have ever been at INR 3,638 crore. It was

especially heartening to see the outstanding commitment and

agility our team demonstrated by selling more than 500 homes

in the second half of March, as the company focused on digital

sales tools to sustain operations during the lockdown. This

sales performance in a challenging year for the sector was

heartening and ensured we remained India’s largest publicly

listed developer by value of real estate sold.

The progress in market share gains has been encouraging,

and combined with sustained momentum in new project

Pirojsha Godrej

Executive Chairman,

Godrej Properties

Resilience and agility will be

critical to ensure we emerge

stronger from this crisis
