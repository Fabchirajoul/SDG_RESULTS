Dear Shareholders,

Hope that you are doing well, and keeping safe and healthy. As the country is reeling under pandemic Covid-19,

it has disrupted our collective sense of the ‘normal’, but we are sure that we will emerge out of this crisis stronger,

more resilient and wiser. Before we deliberate on other aspects, we must take this opportunity to pay our sincere

gratitude to each and every one working at the frontline -combating the pandemic in order to make the world

safer and more convenient for all of us – the medical community, sanitation workers, essential service providers

and the law enforcement agencies.

We are indeed living through a difficult time for society and our economies. The crisis around the COVID-19

pandemic has left no one untouched. While some countries have been able to bend the curve, sporadic

outbreaks have driven home the message that in an interconnected world, no one recovers till everyone does.

The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 has globally disrupted people’s lives, interrupted businesses and jeopardized

decades of development progress. According to The World Economic Outlook (WEO) update, global economic

growth has been downgraded by 3% in 2019, which is its slowest pace since the global financial crisis of 2008.

The decline in growth is the outcome of rising trade tensions between large economies, rising uncertainty

surrounding trade and geopolitical issues; along with individual macroeconomic problems such as low

productivity, growth in emerging economies and aging population in advanced economies. We are certain that

these challenges only reinforce our resolve to emerge as a stronger and more resilient organisation. While there

is gloom in the near term with the unprecedented situation led by the outbreak, domestic demand will rebound

strongly once the pandemic passes and full economic activity resumes. RBI has been taking steps to support the

financial solidity of the nation and to counter the impact of COVID-19. The reduction in repo rates, historical

corporate tax cuts would encourage domestic and foreign private investments in the long run.

In the current situation where businesses have been affected due to the pandemic and consequent lockdowns,

every organization has to adapt to the new realities and rationalize costs. While this is challenging period, we

would like to re-emphasize that we remain focused on generating a steady and sustainable business including

possible joint ventures or inviting development partners for various projects that unlocks value for all

stakeholders.

through the Firm, Rs. 20,000 Lacs /- is paid as illegal gratification to M/s Kalaignar TV Private Limited (Kalaignar) through Kusegaon

transaction of Rs. 20,000 Lacs - is accepted as genuine business transaction, the said loans obtained by Kalaignar for a consideration

which being known as inadequate, constitutes commission of offence. The Firm is not an accused in the 2G Spectrum Case. The CBI
