Letter from our Chairman

DEAR VALUED SHAREHOLDERS::

Letter from our Chairman

Meeting the needs of the market

with confidence, agility and

responsibility

A key advantage of being in the

real estate development business

is that it allows us to feel the

pulse of the economy. Such an

advantage expands our ability to

align our product launches and

our propositions with market

trends, needs and requirements.

As an outcome of extensively

engaging with our customers

and potential property buyers,

while also closely observing

purchase patterns, behaviours

and other economic indicators,

we had rightly assessed that the

most significant demand would

emerge from affordably-priced

value-driven properties. Hence,

we focused on this segment

through our now well-established

Provident brand that has had a

market presence of over a decade.

Today, Provident has emerged

as our primary growth engine,

accounting for almost 46% of our

ongoing projects and 74% of our

launch pipeline.

A number of our new offerings

conceived during the early part

of 2020 and launched in the first

quarter of the current financial

year were substantially taken

up on the day of or during the

weekend of their launches. Thus,

our sales momentum not only

demonstrated the synchronisation

of our offering with market

demand, but also showcased our

relentless focus in maintaining our

quality standards, which reinforced

the bonds of trust that people have

in our developments.

Further, in marketing our

Puravankara-branded properties,

we intensified our efforts in

reaching out to the extended

Indian Diaspora, where we saw

the opportunity of catering to the

demand for asset investment and

home ownership among these

large and prosperous communities

who we sensed desired to deepen

their links with their home country.

Navigating the changing

landscape through heightened

customer-centricity

With the Indian real estate

consumer becoming more tech-

savvy and globally-aware, we are

witnessing a perceptible shift in

their definition of luxury. Luxury

today for them is about having

time in their hands, having good

health and having a variety of

conveniences at their fingertips.

Thus, we determined the need

for living spaces that would

complement these ‘new’

aspirations and launched

Puravankara WorldHome

Collection (WHC) comprising large,

sustainable and ultra-luxurious

urban spaces that would represent

the future of smart and feature-

rich developments in India. We

launched our first project Purva

Atmosphere in Bengaluru under

WHC that comes with a whole

host of BluNex-powered smart

features that enable residents to

control various smart appliances,

even upholstery, at the touch of a

button. Going forward, WHC will

be location-specific projects in

large metropolitan centres that

display distinct appetite for such

evolved developments.

To my mind, raising awareness

on important topics around real

estate, like urban planning and

decongesting/de-densifying

cities etc., is not just the need

of the hour, but also important

to facilitate improved decision-

making for state authorities,

real estate developers and even

consumers. I’m proud to say

that we attempted to do this in

a unique way with our curated

collection of short appealing videos

under ‘UrbaNext: The Future of

Living’ platform, in association with

BloombergQuint Brand Studio.

The objective of this series was

to decode and discuss pressing

issues in real estate by inviting

technology, urban planning and

real estate specialists, while also

highlighting the path-breaking

innovations spearheaded by

Puravankara. The initiative enabled

us to garner substantial social

media traction, including 3 mn+

on-site display impressions and

10,000+ clicks onsite.

Similarly, with a view to reinforce

our ability to reach out to

customers for Provident, we

launched an exclusive digital

marketing and sales platform

under BookMyHome.com. With

digital adoption accelerated by the

pandemic, we wanted to initiate

the ultimate test – would the real

estate buyer book in our projects

without even visiting the site once?

As BookMyHome.com showed,

they did! I extend credit to our

digital and marketing teams for

developing a world-class virtual

platform that has emerged as an

exciting new sales channel.

WE DETERMINED THE NEED FOR LIVING

SPACES THAT WOULD COMPLEMENT

‘NEW’ ASPIRATIONS AND LAUNCHED

PURAVANKARA WORLDHOME COLLECTION

COMPRISING LARGE, SUSTAINABLE AND

ULTRA-LUXURIOUS URBAN SPACES THAT

WOULD REPRESENT THE FUTURE OF SMART

AND FEATURE-RICH DEVELOPMENTS IN

INDIA.:

Letter from our Chairman

Thank you for being an intrinsic

part of our journey

It is my greatest honour to serve

the Company, and I would like

to thank every single one of

our colleagues for their tireless

contribution, excellent teamwork

and inherent spirit of not giving up.

With such a team, I am confident

that Puravankara will continue to

grow and adapt to any situation

and environment.

I would like to express my

gratitude to my fellow Board

members for their wise counsel

and instructive guidance, as well

as the leadership team whose

commitment and dedication have

helped us to achieve our goal of

creating a robust organisation

that is quick to adjust to evolving

realities.

I would also like to take this

opportunity to thank our

shareholders for their continued

support. With a proven resilient

track record and a comprehensive

strategic plan in place,

Puravankara is well-positioned to

generate long-term value.

Stay well!

RAVI PURAVANKARA – Chairman

Purva Atmosphere:

Managing Director

DEAR STAKEHOLDER::

Managing Director

This already played out during the

first quarter of the current fiscal

year when we e-launched three

projects to a resounding market

response. What this demonstrated

was a) our ability to synchronise

customer expectations around

our products b) our success

in capturing intrinsic demand

through accurate product

positioning and pricing and

c) our achievement in quickly

assembling our digital marketing

plans for smooth and glitch-free

customer relay. These e-launches

also spoke of our success in

accepting the changed reality,

analysing how we could make

best use of these and embracing

bold action, which is testament of

our resourcefulness, resilience and

agility.

Reinforcing sustenance

It is a known fact that companies

that are able to sustainably

navigate through the challenges

are the ones that create the

most value for their stakeholders.

At Puravankara, we have a

demonstrated track record of over

45 years and our experience itself is

our biggest competitive driver.

Responsible and preemptive

stewardship has enabled us to

counter the challenges of the

past, and one of the challenges

that has exacerbated over the

years comprises the imbalances

in our sector. There exists a large

unorganised market that has built

up over the years and RERA and

demonetisation were far-reaching

measures designed to limit the

influence of this sector. I believe

the pandemic has enlarged the

scope for reforms and we as the

organised part of the industry have

an unprecedented opportunity in

our hands to rebrand the sector to

make it more transparent, more

accessible and more welcoming to

our buyers.

At Puravankara, we identified

potential and promise in

affordable properties with such

developments becoming the

first point of contact between

aspirational buyers and the

organised real estate industry.

Our Provident brand has built a

wealth of experience in managing

the demands and expectations of

this large and growing customer

community and today, we are

furthering our value propositions in

this segment. We are accelerating

tech deployment to engage in

better visualisation and space

optimisation in project planning,

improving our UI/UX in online

sales to enrich the customer

experience and are using cutting-

edge pre-cast and formwork

technology to achieve time and

cost savings, while ensuring

quality standardisation across our

products.

AUDITORS & AUDITOR'S REPORT

Statutory Auditors

M/s. S R Batliboi & Associates LLP, Chartered

Accountants,

FRN

101049W/

E300004,

were

appointed by the members as Statutory Auditors

of the Company for a period of five years from the

conclusion of the 31st AGM held on August 29, 2017

till the conclusion of the 36th AGM.

The Company has received confirmation from M/s. S

R Batliboi & Associates LLP, Chartered Accountants,

stating that, continuation as Statutory Auditors of

the Company, would be within the prescribed limits

under Section 141(3) (g) of the Companies Act, 2013.

The Statutory Auditors have expressed an unmodified

opinion in their Consolidated Auditors Report and

the Standalone Auditors Report in respect of the

audited financial statements for the financial year

ended March 31, 2020.

With regard to the Emphasis of Matter stated in the

Statutory Report, as part of the notes to the financial

statements, the Board of Directors state that with

regard to:

A. Covid-19 pandemic:

World Health Organisation (WHO) declared outbreak

of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic

on March 11, 2020. Consequent to this, Government

of India declared lockdown with effect from March

25, 2020 and the Group suspended the operations

in all ongoing projects in compliance with the

lockdown instructions issued by the Central and

State Governments. COVID-19 has impacted the

normal business operations of the Group by way

of interruption in project execution, supply chain

disruption, unavailability of personnel during the

lock-down period.

The Group has considered the possible effects that

may result from the Covid-19 pandemic on the

carrying value of assets including property, plant

and equipment, investment property, investments,

inventories,

loans,

land

advance/deposits

and

receivables. In developing the assumptions relating

to the possible future uncertainties in the economic

conditions because of this pandemic, the Group, as

at the date of approval of these financial results has

used internal and external sources of information

to assess the expected future performance of the

Group. The Group has performed sensitivity analysis

on the assumptions used and based on the current

estimates, the Group expects that the carrying

amount of these assets, as reflected in the balance

sheet as at March 31, 2020, are fully recoverable. the

Group has also estimated the future cash flows with

the possible effects that may result from the COVID-19

pandemic and does not foresee any adverse impact

on realising its assets and in meeting its liabilities

as and when they fall due. The actual impact of the

COVID-19 pandemic may be different from that

estimated as at the date of approval of these financial

results.

The Central and State Governments have initiated

steps to lift the lockdown and the Group will adhere

to the same as it resumes its activities. Construction at

sites has restarted. The Group will continue to closely:

Managing Director nor the

Whole-time

Directors

of

the

Company

receive any remuneration or commission

from any of its subsidiaries.

2.

No significant or material orders were passed

by the Regulators or Courts or Tribunals

which impact the going concern status and

Companys operations in future.

b) In

compliance

with

the

requirements

of

Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal of Sexual

Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013,

introduced by the Government of India, which

came into effect from December 9, 2013, the

Company has adopted a Policy to provide

Protection Against Sexual Harassment of Women

in Workplace, which has been displayed on

the website of the Company and an Internal

Complaints Committee has been constituted

and functions duly. The status of complaints is as

follows:.

Company and accordingly such accounts and

records are made and maintained.
