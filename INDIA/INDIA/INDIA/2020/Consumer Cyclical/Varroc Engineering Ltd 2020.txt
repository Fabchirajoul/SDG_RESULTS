Dear Shareholders,

It is a pleasure to share our Annual Report

for FY20. The automotive industry is at the

cusp of rapid transformation, led by the need

for greener modes of transport along with

shared and autonomous mobility deÔ¨Åning

the technology imperative. At Varroc, we

enable the world‚Äôs leading OEMs to deliver

on these expectations.

The world moves in a smarter, smoother,

faster and greener way when we

Perform@Change.

Industry Performance

The global automotive market was on a downtrend during

FY20. Europe, North America and China showed a decline

of 7.9%, 5.6% and 16.1% Y-o-Y, respectively. EU emission

regulations and impact of US ‚Äì China trade war continued

to weigh on the industry performance. The COVID-19

outbreak and its rapid spread dampened the industry

recovery. The impact of COVID-19 is likely to be felt

mainly on the performance of the Ô¨Årst quarter of FY21

and also on the rest of the Ô¨Ånancial year to some extent.

The Indian automobile industry saw consumer sentiment

weaken across segments through the year with the 2W

industry registering a 14.1% Y-o-Y decline in volumes as

compared to a 5.8% growth in FY19. The 3W segment

reported a 10.6% decline in the overall production

volume during FY20.

In India, GDP growth for FY21 is estimated to remain in

negative territory, with some pick-up in growth impulses

from second half of FY21. The Government of India in May

rolled out a substantial package of relief measures aimed

at helping the country‚Äôs small and medium enterprises,

which is likely to beneÔ¨Åt the economy.
