Soumitra Bhattacharya: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

It is a great honor, and a matter of immense pride,

to write to you as the newly appointed Chairman of

Bosch Limited. Across the globe, we are living through

an extraordinary crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic does

demonstrate our limitations, but it also establishes

what is important – your health and safety.

The Financial Year 2019-20 has been full of turmoil;

while we saw some clarity on Brexit, the world’s two

largest economies – the US and China – are still locked

in a bitter trade battle. The state of perplexity does

not end there. While China was celebrating 70 years of

Communist Party rule, Hong Kong experienced one of

its most violent and chaotic days due to the protests.

It was one of the most challenging times across the

globe when COVID-19 hit us. For the first time in

history, we experienced a complete standstill that has

now affected the socio-economic situation.

In India the scenario was no different. While the

country re-elected the existing government with a

massive majority, the economic situation eroded with

each passing month. The GDP of India declined by

1.9 percent as compared to FY 2018-19, falling to

4.2 percent this financial year. The industries that we

operate in underwent a paradigm shift even before the

COVID-19 outbreak. The automobile sector in India

underwent massive structural and cyclical changes.

The eventual slowdown impacted Bosch India in a

large way, as we draw 80 percent of our revenues from

the business.

Amidst these crises, India went ahead with its decision

to adopt the BS VI standards as planned on April 1,

2020. In the current times, this indeed was a sizable

challenge. The pandemic, and the lockdown that

followed, disrupted the supply chains to make the

task tougher. The difficulties are expected to increase

in the coming time and it will take a few years for the

industry to recover completely. It is inevitable that the

current situation will have a less than favorable effect

on our production and growth.

At Bosch Limited, this called for a strong need to

restructure. In the financial year that concluded, the

company saw the last quarter affected adversely

due to the pandemic. We optimized our product

cost by implementing various measures in logistics,

purchasing, and productivity. While our overall

business went down by 18.1 percent, we saw a 24.4

percent reduction in the auto segment and a 14.4

percent reduction in others.

We cannot overlook the slowdown brought in by

the pandemic, but beyond that, the industry is

at the threshold of major technological changes.

Technologies affecting electrical and renewable

fuel-based mobility solutions are all set to usher in

sweeping changes across the industry. The Internet

of Things, in the coming years, is going to change

automotive experience like never before. This not only

means new products and solutions, but new ways of

partnerships and new ways of doing business. The

global business strategy of Bosch has already started

its transformation to development, production, and

marketing with an increased focus on localization.

India being home to Bosch’s largest R&D facility

outside Germany, clearly expresses this outlook

of the company.

With traveling and social contact restrictions to

continue for months to come, the relevance of digital

platforms to connect – for business to business,

business to customer, and customer to product – is

now all the more important. During the last year, Bosch

Limited has rolled out multiple solutions, to reach, to

connect, and to integrate digitally. This radical shift

from the traditional way of operating is one of the

many signs to demonstrate the future-readiness

of your company.

In addition, we have to be responsible in combating

adverse climate change. It is not too late to achieve the

climate action targets – but only if major enterprises

such as Bosch bring their weight to bear. This will cost

money, but it will also create new business and we are

determined to make our over 400 locations worldwide,

carbon-neutral by end of 2020.

It is time for us to relook at the way we operate

and reflect on it. We are optimistic of our approach

because we have in-depth experience in a wide range

of areas varying from advanced mobility solutions to

IOT implementations in consumer business. The need

of the hour is to overcome the mountainous challenges

ahead of us by exhibiting our future-preparedness.

We may have to shift our gears down to tackle rough

roads, but our engines of growth and our clear vision

of the future will take us steadily forward. Ahead in the

future, leading the way.

Be safe and best regards,

Bernhard Straub

Chairman

6 |: Message from the

Dear Shareholders,

I have been working at Bosch for the past 25 years

and the last financial year, 2019-20, has easily been

by far one of the most challenging years that I have

experienced in my professional career. As I write to

you, I sincerely hope that you and your family are safe

and healthy in these turbulent times. Needless to

say, COVID–19 cases are on the rise and we need to

practice the highest standards of health and hygiene to

combat the pandemic.

In the light of the COVID–19 pandemic, the

International Monetary Fund has projected that the

world economy is to contract sharply by a negative

3 percent, the sharpest downturn in almost a century.

Further reports suggest that India’s GDP for FY 2020-

21 will be -5% to -7% with the current socio-economic

situation. At Bosch Limited, 80 percent of our revenue

is driven from Mobility and the current downward

trend has made the road ahead for us tougher. We

believe that it will take at least four to five years for

the auto industry in India to be back to normal. Thus,

securing the future was never more relevant than today

and at Bosch, we had embarked on this transformation

journey much in advance. In this year’s Annual Report

we emphasize on - ‘The Future is Now’.

In the forthcoming pages, you will witness how Bosch

Limited has been preparing for the new normal and

future-proofing itself by investing in growth-oriented

strategic choices with various initiatives across

business units. Our long-term mobility strategy is to

create new opportunities in the field of mobility. We

aim to develop technology, which is adjacent to our

current core business, e.g. the electrification domain,

and solve current and future problems through the

platform approach to create digital business in the

mobility domain. This has opened significant market

opportunities in new areas of growth. The strategy is

to grow both organically in our core business as well as

inorganically to build the right portfolio.

The automobile industry was already facing a

structural and cyclical transformation in FY 2019–20.

The COVID-19 outbreak further crippled the auto

industry in the last financial quarter. Amidst such

tough times, we created history by leapfrogging to

BS VI starting from April 1st, 2020. This accelerated

change, and demanded significant improvements and

innovation. We at Bosch stepped up to the challenge,

working closely with our partners to provide solutions

that make conventional products more efficient and

intelligent. Our Increased focus on technology is

enabling our customers to tackle future challenges.

Since 2017, 127 BS VI projects have been executed in

the Two-Wheelers, Passenger Cars and Commercial

Vehicles segments with major OEMs. While reducing

the emissions of Internal Combustion Engines (ICE)

significantly, we also invested heavily in developing

near-zero-emission, and sustainable & energy-efficient

electro mobility solutions. As a technology-agnostic

company, we expect that by 2030, 80 percent of

vehicles in India will still run on ICE and 20 percent

will be hybrid or electric. We strongly believe that the

electrification of vehicles in India will start with

Two- and Three-Wheelers, & fleets, and gradually move

Managing Director, reviews the

effectiveness of the process at regular intervals.

Following are the major risks and mitigation measures:

1. Economy/Industry: The automotive industry is going

through turbulent times, not seen in the recent past.

To add to the worries of general economic slowdown,

lower demand, tight liquidity crunch, the impact

of COVID-19 pandemic, completely took everyone

off-guard. Even though most of these are likely to be

temporary, considering the widespread impact of

the nation-wide lockdown, economic revival is

expected to be prolonged and coming back to

normalcy will take time. It may be even longer in

automotive sector. This will have a deep impact on:
