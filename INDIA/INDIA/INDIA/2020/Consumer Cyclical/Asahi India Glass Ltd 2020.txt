Dear Shareholders,

We are living in extremely uncertain times. There are

uncertainties abound – the trade war, geopolitics, COVID-19

induced disruptions and most importantly, an economic

slowdown which could take much longer to recover.

First and foremost, I hope that each one of you and your family

members are safe and continues to adhere to prescribed

guidelines while taking all necessary precautions. This is the

only way to protect ourselves against the COVID-19 pandemic.

The global economy reeled under a multitude of challenges

in the year gone by. Protracted trade disputes, weakened

investment

and

manufacturing

activities,

decelerating

international trade amid rising tariffs have subdued business:

letter

and spirit. We continue to remain extremely vigilant to contain

the spread of this virus any further, by strict adherence to all

SOPs in a most humane manner, while ramping up operations

smoothly.

4)

How is the debt situation at AIS and what is your plan to

reduce the same?

AIS’s total debt as on 31st March, 2020 is ` 1762 crores, compared

to ` 1644 crores last year. Though higher than last year, a few

extenuating circumstances need explanation:

•

March is the highest sales month historically. Therefore,

in preparation for such a sale, everything is at a high –

inventory, manufacturing, manpower, SGA etc. The sudden

stop in March caught us on both ends : diminished sales

and high inventory. This double whammy obviously

impacted our liquidity, cash flow, and our debt.

•

Once the lockdown started we drew on additional funds

as a precaution. This increased our cash in hand which is

evident.

•

Our debt would have been similar over last year after

normalisation for these factors.

•

Also, we continued our capex for Gujarat which also

impacted our debt.

Importantly, we are at the end of our capex cycle of the last

3-4 years. Now onwards capex will be much more muted and,

hopefully, our company will harvest the fruit of the many

investments made.

Our industry is capital heavy and lumpy. Investment quantums

are large for capturing the competitive advantages of scale,

technology, locational and logistics benefits, minimum

economic size, and operational excellence. It is very typical to

have alternating periods of high and low capex. Clearly our high

capex period is fully accomplished. We hope our free cash flow

will now be more than adequate to meet our requirements of

financial costs, lower capex, dividends and lowering of debt.

5)

How do you see AIS’s future outlook? What are your strategic

plans to drive future growth?

In the Middle of Difficulty Lies Opportunity – Albert Einstein.

The last 6 months have been more Grey Swan rather than its

Black cousin. Fateful warnings by Bill Gates, Dr Fauci, Hollywood

and Bollywood movies, should have prepared us for this

‘potentially very significant event that is considered unlikely to

happen but still possible’. Unfortunately, it was not anticipated,

and the world is now paying a heavy price. The most severe pain

is on the many, and counting, deaths, the stricken, the hardships

from loss of income and jobs. But, except for a few sectors like

technology / pharma / essentials, most other productive parts of

the economy have suffered a serious setback. At -23.9% India has

had the worst quarterly GDP number ever.

Yet, in this gloom there is hope. The stellar, selfless work by the

medical community, the government, countless NGO’s and

caregivers has at least contained the epidemic and its pernicious

impact. At the individual’s level, people are responding with

tenacity and resilience. Society is adopting to learn and work in

New ways to be more efficient and productive and yet safe.

As the restrictions are gradually and measurably lifted, green

shoots are visible in many areas : agricultural, rural, auto,

cement. We hope these early trends only build on this shift of

momentum, and as each month passes, more and more of the

economy and society gets back to normal. Within this period

of suffering there is a lot we have learnt. All of us have looked

to each other and deep within to find better solutions to old

and new problems. I am sure we will emerge more efficient,

more productive, more agile, and significantly more capable to

profitably take advantage of markets as they recover.

I am also happy to update that the Director General of

Trade Remedies (DGTR), Government of India has recently

recommended a “reference price” anti-dumping duty on

dumped imports of clear float glass from Malaysia. We are very

grateful to the central government, its ministers and officers

for their timely acknowledgement of industry’s woes and then

having worked through the difficult period of lockdown to

protect the genuine interests of the Domestic Industry. Their

timely action shall have an extremely positive impact on all

glass companies in India.

Sometimes a person, a Company, a Country, the whole world

has a serious setback. How that entity responds to that setback

determines the future. It could range from collapse to an orbit

change. Today every person, company and country are deeply

impacted. After a cataclysmic few months, India is recovering.

So are our customers. So are we. We will strive, persevere, and

relentlessly apply PDCA to delight our customers. We will use

the pain of the immediate past to emerge stringer, swifter,

nimbler.:

Provisions and Contingent Liabilities

A provision is recognized if as a result of a past

event, the Group has a present obligation (legal or

constructive) that can be estimated reliably and it is

probable that an outflow of economic benefits will

be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are

recognized at the best estimate of the expenditure

required to settle the present obligation at the Balance

Sheet date. If the effect of time value of money is

material, provisions are discounted using a current

pre tax rate that reflects, when appropriate the risks

specific to the liability.

A contingent liability exists when there is a possible

but not probable obligation, or a present obligation

that may, but probably will not, require an outflow

of resources, or a present obligation whose amount

cannot be estimated reliably. Contingent liabilities

do not warrant provisions but are disclosed unless

the possibility of outflow of resources is remote.
