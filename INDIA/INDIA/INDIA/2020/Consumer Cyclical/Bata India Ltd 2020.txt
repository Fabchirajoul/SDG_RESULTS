Dear Shareholders,

First and foremost, I express my gratitude to the Board of Directors, the Bata Group and the shareholders for

giving me the privilege of being the Chairman of this marquee company with a remarkable lineage and legacy of

over one hundred years! I am simply humbled and delighted to address you for the ﬁrst time.

Yet I begin with my deep feelings for those precious lives lost due to the ongoing pandemic. I pray and hope for

its early end and for your safety and good health in these unprecedented times.

Bata India was incorporated as Bata Shoe Company Limited in 1931. In the years that followed, the operations grew

and the Company went public in 1973 and became Bata India Limited. Today, Bata India has established itself as

India’s largest footwear retailer and caters to millions of customers every year.

At its core, Bata India has the same ethos as that of its founders and its parent, Bata Shoe Organization (BSO).

The Passion, Philosophy and Values of BSO are an essential guide for everything Bata India does as an

organization. The value systems of BSO have always stood the test of time and continue to provide strength to the

team at Bata India during all business cycles.

Ranging from “Serve with Passion” to “Exceed Customer Expectations”, from “Be Bold” to “Count on Me” and

“Improving Lives”, BSO Values ﬁnd complete relevance in today’s time and inspire us as leaders in business and

positive contributors to society.

As a responsible corporate citizen, Bata India respects the National mandate during the current pandemic in its

true: letter and spirit, keeping the safety, hygiene and health of its customers and employees as its utmost priority.

As its corporate social responsibility, Bata India is also committed through various initiatives in these times,

including donation of 2 lakh pairs of footwear to assist the healthcare workers, volunteers and the frontline ﬁghters

who have been helping India recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. This is also part of one million pairs committed

by BSO worldwide, making India a signiﬁcant contributor.

As you would have observed, Bata India registered a healthy growth during the year 2019-20 till the Covid-19

pandemic forced a nationwide lockdown. During the year, Bata launched several campaigns to attract shoppers

and maintained its leadership position by serving more than 1.20 lakh customers every day. Bata also continued

to engage more deeply with millennials to remain a contemporary footwear brand in India.

While its overall thrust remained in the Retail sector, Digital platforms have become the primary channels during

the lockdown period. The digital transformation journey that started four years ago, has taken a big leap forward

in terms of the scale and width of products offered online. Bata India is constantly expanding its E-commerce

footprint by ramping up its presence in online marketplaces allowing delivery in over 1,300 cities, rolling out home

delivery from across 900+ stores and giving customers option to shop from the comfort of their homes via

WhatsApp Chat with their neighbourhood stores. Your company remains committed to bring you the best online

customer experience.

Dear Shareholders,

At Bata India, we have had a fascinating year, with a whole new wave of candid campaigns and a fresh round of

transformation. We have not just grown sales and net revenues, but clocked rapid success on the annual

predetermined agenda too – continuing our momentum as a contemporary brand and augmenting the focus on

consumer-centricity and innovation.

Notwithstanding the overarching impact of COVID-19, we have lived up to our reputation of weathering the worst

storms and held our ground amidst the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic. As we hold our heads high during

the crisis, we have motivated our customers, employees, stakeholders and society at large through campaigns

such as #ParkYourShoes and #StayActiveWithPower. We have maintained a humane approach of placing

customers ﬁrst. In testimony to Bata’s proactive approach, we became cognizant of the crisis even before it struck

India, thanks to our insights from the global markets. Consequently, we have maintained the highest standards of

hygiene and preventive steps across all our stores and manufacturing units in the country.

Learning quickly from the events in Europe and South-East Asia, we began preparations in advance, ensuring the

systems were in place for facilitating a seamless transition to a Work-from-Home scenario. As a result, our

corporate employees are cohesively working from home. Meanwhile, we put great focus in understanding the

anticipated change in consumer behavior and trends after the lockdown.

At Bata, the safety of our customers, store teams and allied stakeholders is paramount. Based on various directives

from the regulatory authorities as well as learning from the best global practices of retailers during the present

pandemic, your company has framed the modalities for store re-opening with immense care and caution and

curated an elaborate store re-opening manual. This guidebook has been translated into 11 regional languages and

taken online on Bata’s e-learning platform on which over 6,000 retail staff have been trained already.

With resumption in store operations based on the clearance received from local authorities, we are ensuring that

all stores complete the entire drill of deep cleaning and sanitization. To make the shopping experience safer and

instill conﬁdence, all stores now follow a 20+ point safety check list which includes deployment of sanitizers,

gloves, masks, dispensers, quarantine boxes for tried shoes, self-trial of shoes by customers, contactless payments,

e-invoices, social distancing and reduced staff strength. While traditional stores are being readied for reopening,

our online store www.bata.in is offering customers essential collections ranging from Work from Home, Fitness,

Easy Wash and other essential range of shoes.

(iv) Average percentage increase made in the salaries of employees other than the managerial personnel in the previous

competitiveness as against similar companies.

The remuneration paid to the managerial personnel is in accordance with the Nomination and Remuneration Policy of the

Company and is based on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and as approved by the

Board and the Members of the Company. Since the percentage increase in remuneration of the managerial personnel is

in the Corporate Governance Report. The ratio of remuneration and percentage increase for the Independent Directors’

Remuneration is, therefore, not considered for the purpose above. Further, Performance linked incentive / Bonus has

not been considered for the calculation of remuneration of Executive Directors, as the same is paid in accordance with

the Nomination and Remuneration Policy of the Company and is based on the recommendation of the Nomination and

Remuneration Committee and approval of the Board and the Members of the Company.

b)

Employees for the above purpose does not include employees governed under collective bargaining process.

c)

Percentage increase in remuneration is based on the Annualised Remuneration.
