Director's report, but does not include the consolidated financial

statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report

thereon.

•

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not

cover the other information and we do not express any form of

assurance conclusion thereon

•

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial

statements, our responsibility is to read the other information

and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is

materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements

or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or

otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

•

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there

is a material misstatement of this other information, we are

required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this

regard.

Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial

Statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated

in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these

standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the

financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive

income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance

with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in

India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate

accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for

safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and

detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of

appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that

are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and

maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating

effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the

accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the

standalone financial statement that give a true and fair view and are free

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is

responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going

concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and

using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either

intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no

realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the

Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone

Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the

standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s

report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of

assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance

with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered

material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be

expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the

basis of these standalone financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional

judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

We also:

•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the

standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,

design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,

and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to

provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a

material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one

resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,

intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of

internal control.

•

Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to

the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate

in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are

also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the

Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place

and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the

reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures

made by the management.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the

going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit

statements for not accelerating the payment of these loans within one year from the balance sheet date subject to regularisation of the breach by

end of March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the management has considered the classification of loan based upon the original repayment schedule.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the current period.

World Health Organisation (WHO) declared outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Consequent to

this,Government of India declared lockdown on March 23, 2020 and the Group temporarily suspended the operations in all the units of the Group

in compliance with the lockdown instructions issued by the Central and State Governments. COVID-19 has substantially impacted the normal

business operations of the Group by way of interruption in production, supply chain disruption, unavailability of personnel, closure/lock down of

production facilities etc. during the lock-down period which has been extended till May 17, 2020. Production and supply of goods has commenced

at various dates during the month of May 2020 and in a staggered manner at some of the manufacturing locations of the Group after obtaining

permissions from the appropriate government authorities. The Group has made detailed assessment of its liquidity position for the next year

including unutilised sanctioned credit limits and avenues to raise new funds / refinancing, recoverability of its assets comprising of property, plant

and equipment, intangible assets, right of use assets, investments, inventories and trade receivables. Based on current indicators of future

economic conditions and estimates made by the Management of the Group, the Group expects to recover the carrying amount of these assets. It

expects short term challenges in operating environment and has undertaken various cost containment initiatives which will yield results in

medium to long term. At this time, the Group expects demand to pick up in long term and attain pre-covid levels of performance. It has also

assessed the probability of occurrence of forecasted transactions under the hedging relationships and continues to evaluate them as highly

probable considering the orders in hand.

The situation is changing rapidly giving rise to inherent uncertainty around the extent and timing of the potential future impact of the COVID-19

on revenue from operations, profitability and account receivables. The outcome of the same may be different from that estimated as at the date

of approval of these Ind AS financial statements. The Group will continue to closely monitor any material changes arising of future economic

conditions and impact on its business.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 43 : Capital management:

For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity

holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains an efficient capital structure and

healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions or its business requirements to

optimise return to our shareholders through continuing growth. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend

payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The funding requirements are met through a mixture of equity,

internal fund generation and other non-current borrowings. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total

capital plus net debt. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and short-term deposits (including

other bank balance). The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
