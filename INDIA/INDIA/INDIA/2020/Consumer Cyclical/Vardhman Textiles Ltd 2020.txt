Dear Shareholders,

With great pride and privilege, I

present to you the annual report of

Vardhman Textiles for FY 2019-20.

The year was indeed a challenging

year in terms of business

volatilities caused by geopolitical

developments leading to lack of

confidence about global trade, its

direction and growing protectionism

among leading importing

countries. During the year, several

macroeconomic factors such as

an escalation of the trade war

between the U.S. and China,

uncertainties around BREXIT and

natural disasters in some countries

impacted business performance.

Your company continues

to have a strong market

foothold, both in India and

abroad. During the year,

we primarily focused on

expanding our operations

and increased the number

of manufacturing units.”

2.22 Leases

The Group as Lessee

The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases

for land and buildings. The Group assesses whether a

contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A

contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys

the right to control the use of an identified asset for a

period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess

whether a contract conveys the right to control the use

of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (i)

the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the

Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from

use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii)

the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the

Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a

corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in

which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve

months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases.

For these short-term and low value leases, the Group

recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense

on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Certain lease arrangements includes the options to

extend or terminate the lease before the end of the

lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes

these options when it is reasonably certain that they will

be exercised.

“The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost,

which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability

adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the

commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct

costs less any lease incentives and an estimate of costs

to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing

the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset

or site on which it is located. They are subsequently

measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and

impairment losses.

Right-of-use

assets

are

depreciated

from

the

commencement date on a straight-line basis over the

shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying

asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability

whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate

that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable

amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell

and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset

basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that

are largely independent of those from other assets. In

such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the

Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized

cost at the present value of the future lease payments.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest

rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable,

using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of

domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured

with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of

use asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether

it will exercise an extension or a termination option.

Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately

presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have

been classified as financing cash flows.

The Group as a lessor

Leases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a

finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease

transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership

to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All

other leases are classified as operating leases.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for

its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately.

The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease

by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the

head lease.

For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a

straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.:

managing director

and no significant business decisions relating to debts

restructuring and business restructuring in the above

said associate can be implemented without prior

approval of the Company.

2.24.2 Key sources of uncertainty

In the application of the Group accounting policies,

the management of the Group is required to make

judgements, estimates and assumptions about the

carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not

readily apparent from other sources. The estimates

and associated assumptions are based on historical

experience and other factors that are considered

to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these

estimates.

The

estimates

and

underlying

assumptions

are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to

accounting estimates are recognised in the period in

which the estimate is revised if the revision affects

only that period or in the period of the revision and

future periods if the revision affects both current and

future periods.

The following are the areas of estimation uncertainty

and critical judgements that the management

has made in the process of applying the Group’s

accounting policies and that have the most

significant effect on the amounts recognised in the

financial statements:

2.24.3 Defined benefit plans

The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-

employment benefits and the present value of such

obligation are determined using actuarial valuations.

An actuarial valuation involves making various

assumptions that may differ from actual developments

in the future. These include the determination of the

discount rate, future, salary increases, mortality rates

and future pension increases. Due to the complexities

involved in the valuation and its long-term nature,

a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to

changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are

reviewed at each reporting date.

2.24.4 Useful lives of depreciable tangible assets and

intangible assets

Management reviews the useful lives of depreciable/

amortisable assets at each reporting date.

As at March 31, 2020 management assessed that

the useful lives represent the expected utility of the

assets to the Group.:

The amounts shown above represents the best possible estimates arrived at on the basis of available information. The

uncertainties and possible reimbursements are dependent on the outcome of the different legal processes which have
