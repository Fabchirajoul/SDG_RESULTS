I am pleased to report a yet another successful year for KPR We

made a total revenue of? 3389.09 Crores, PBT of? 471.67 Crores

and a PAT of ? 376.68 Crores. The domestic market for yarn

recorded a steady growth, but exports stagnated. China was the

single largest Importer (about 23%) of cotton yam fiom India. But,

India's market share started declining gradually over the past few

years owing to tariff advantage enjoyed by other competing

Countries. This, coupled with the Trade war between China & USA

and economic slowdown across the globe, had adversely

impacted the Indian Spinning sector during the year. The strained

market conditions have led to significant decline in the price of

cotton. As we intended to hold a portion of its inventory as

component.
