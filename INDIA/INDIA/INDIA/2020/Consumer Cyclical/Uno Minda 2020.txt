Annual Report 2019-20

Minda Industries Limited:

Dear Stakeholders,

The financial year 2019-20 saw the Indian automobile

industry battered by an unprecedented growth. The

slowdown in the economy shadowed its effects on the

industry, resulting in the worst performance ever in last

20 years. The depressed demand over the last one year,

forced manufacturers to cut production output and offer

steep discounts. Moreover, the transition from BS IV to BS

VI also added to the fall. Overall, the sector saw a double-

digit decline of 15% in volume terms on y-o-y basis. Lastly,

towards the end of the financial year, Covid-19 struck India,

which resulted in the temporary shutdown of economic

activities. This further dampened the industry sentiments

and prodded production cuts.

Demonstrating the strength and robustness of our

business model, in these subdued market conditions,

we continued our pursuit of excellence. We continued

to perform better than the industry, while beating the

odds. Our relentless focus on innovation has continued

to differentiate MIL. This has helped us design products

with prime importance and relevance with respect to

the future. With the right capabilities and strategies, we

are fully aligned with the megatrends that will shape our

markets and drive the future growth.

Performance highlights

Despite significant decline across segments, we focused

on limiting the decline through our diversified product

portfolio, customer mix and cost control drive. Aligned

with our business principles, we are continuously

exploring opportunities to optimise overall revenue mix

while being focused on enhancing the kit value.

Highlights for the year

Our technology acquisitions and collaborations have

helped us find our strengths and attain technological

leadership in the industry. Over the years, they have

assisted in making good progress while contributing a

significant share to the revenues. To seize all the exciting

future opportunities through sustainable platforms, we

entered into a definitive agreement with shareholders

of the Germany-based automotive lamps engineering,

design and testing Company, Delvis Gmbh. The acquisition

is a part of our strategy to strengthen technological

capabilities in existing product lines. Navigating the

global lighting technology, this acquisition will help us

leverage extensive R&D capabilities of Delvis in the Indian

automotive space. Refer page 18

Harita Seating Systems is a quality-focused, system-

driven organisation, engaged in manufacturing, product

development and sales of driver seats and bus passenger

seats. Last year, the Company approved the merger

of HSSL with MIL. The matter has been delayed due to

Covid-19, but once we have approval in place it will take

around 3 months roughly to complete the entire process

thereafter.

I am glad to inform that during the year, the merger

process of 4 wholly-owned subsidiaries was completed.

This merger will help us realise synergies and economy

of scale benefits besides strengthening our standalone

balance sheet.

As part of our consolidation strategy, the Company

has planned acquisition and amalgamation of Minda I

Connect Private Limited into MIL at an equity valuation of

` 17 Crores. The merger process will be taken through SEBI

exchanges and it has been filed with the exchanges for

approval.

Innovation and more

We continued to invest in innovation to target the future

growth, in line with our strategy and purpose. In addition,

our recent technology acquisitions and investments are

delivering product development opportunities which could

generate meaningful sales over the next five to ten years.

Annual Report 2019-20

Minda Industries Limited:

Dear Stakeholders,

The automotive industry was already witnessing a downfall

due to prevailing economic conditions. Recording the

weakest demand in the past two decades, FY 2019-

20 recorded the worst sales ever. Various factors like

higher vehicle prices due to the state’s key emission

regulations, stricter lending rules due to the NBFC credit

squeeze, impact during central elections, and negative

sentiments in rural region, impacted the industry’s

growth. The industry also suffered while it was gearing

up for the transition from BS IV to BS VI. A sluggish but a

necessary revival of the industry was anticipated, but the

outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic sent all our projections

and expectations for a toss. The consequent lockdown

impacted economy adversely and blew the already-

bleeding automobile industry.

The Company had imported Capital goods under EPCG and saved duty to the tune of ` 9.90 crore (` 4.05 crores as

i.e. 6 times of duty saved on import of Capital goods on FOB basis within a period of 6 years. If the Company does not

(e) The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“SC”) by their order dated February 28, 2019, set out the principles based

computation of Provident Fund contribution. Subsequently, a review petition against this decision has been filed and is

pending before the SC for disposal. Further, there are interpretative challenges and considerable uncertainty, including

estimating the amount retrospectively.

Pending the outcome of the review petition and directions from the EPFO, the impact for past periods, if any, is not

ascertainable reliably and consequently no financial effect has been provided for in the standalone financial statements
