WHAT’S INSIDE...:

LETTER

TO SHAREHOLDERS: Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to write to you and present the Annual Report

for FY2020

I hope that each one of you and your family members are safe.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a disruption in each one

of our lives like never before. It is important to take all necessary

precautions and adhere to the Government’s guidelines

as this is the only way we can protect ourselves against the

Coronavirus.

As a keen watcher of the Indian automobile industry, you

are aware of the transformation the industry has been going

through over the last few years. We have seen government

led regulatory push like the shift to BSVI, changes in local

and global regulations around emission and of course the

unceasing customer push demanding a higher level of

electronics for a smarter driving experience. Even as the

transition has been underway, the COVID-19 pandemic further

pushed the boundaries of ‘change’ bringing in a new normal

and changing the way individuals, corporations, communities

and governments work and do business.

We are no stranger to the challenges such changes throw up.

In line with our Vision, we have created a roadmap based on

three core themes - Redefine, Recalibrate & Recreate. As you

leaf through the pages ahead, you will see how the Company

continues to be in proactive mode, ready to convert the

challenges into opportunities.

Along with the transformation, the automobile industry

continues to face challenges over the past two years. The

industry which has been one of the major contributors to the

The year ahead continues to be uncertain but

we think the worst is behind us. I can assure you

that Minda Corporation with its unique value

proposition, Research and Development driven

products, support from customer base and a

strong balance sheet is well placed to navigate

through this difficult times. In such trying times,

we will continue to Redefine, Recalibrate and

Recreate

Letter of Credit (SBLC) given by the Company to the

banks in respect of loans taken by Minda KTSN. The total charge

of ` 3666 Million has been presented as exceptional items in the

Statement of Audited Standalone Financial Results. Whereas,

the Company has recorded impairment charge of ` 2933 million

which has been presented as exceptional items in the Statement

of audited consolidated financial results in respect of goodwill

relating to MKTSN and reduction in carrying value of property,

plant and equipment and other assets of MKTSN.

The Operational Performance of the Company has been

extensively covered in the Management Discussion and

Analysis, which form part of this Directors’ Report.

AMALGAMATION OF FIVE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES

WITH MINDA CORPORATION LTD.

The Company had initiated a Scheme of Amalgamation (the

“Scheme”) involving merger of five wholly owned subsidiaries i.e.

Minda Management Services Limited, Minda SAI Limited, Minda

Automotive Solutions Limited, Minda Autoelektrik Limited and

Minda Telematics and Electric Mobility Solutions Private Limited

(“Transferor Companies”) into the Company. The Honourable

National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”), New Delhi Bench, has

approved the Scheme vide its order dated July 19, 2019. The

Scheme was operative from April 1, 2018 (“Appointed Date”). The

scheme was effective from September 01, 2019 i.e. upon filing

of the certified copy of the said order of Hon’ble NCLT with the

Registrar of Companies, Delhi.

Amalgamation of the Transferor Companies into and with the

Company resulted in consolidation of the businesses. The

Amalgamation is also beneficial as it created greater synergies

among the businesses and enabled them to have access to

wider financial resources, increase the managerial efficiencies,

lowering of cost structure and higher transparency.

The Transferor Companies are wholly owned subsidiary

companies of Company, therefore, no new equity shares

have been issued and entire share capital of the Transferor

Companies has been cancelled and extinguished.
