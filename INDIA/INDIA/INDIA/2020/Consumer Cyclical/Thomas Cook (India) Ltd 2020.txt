message from the Chairman

Dear Shareholders,

Starting with Annual Report FY19,

the Thomas Cook Group has been

enhancing its report content by

adding non-financial information

to the conventional financial

information, and attempting to link

the two elements organically. Our

objective towards transparency has

always ranked as a top priority for

the Group as we strive to create a

better business environment. This is

our second Integrated Annual report

and we have made an earnest effort

to produce an accessible report

that presents our Group’s values

and provides a holistic business

perspective. This also reflects

how we as a diversified group of

businesses spanning across the

globe are fully integrated in terms of

our values and philosophies. Going

forward, we will continue working to

enrich the content of the integrated

report, listening to stakeholders’

opinions in this process. At the

same time, by using the report as a

tool for constructive dialogue, we

will continue to create new value

aligned with the Group’s corporate

philosophies and ideas.

Moving on to the year and what it

represented 2019 has evidently

been underscored by many events

that have challenged us and the

momentum we have built over the

many years for the Thomas Cook

India Group. However, we have been

resilient across multiple business

cycles over the many decades that

we have been in operation. This

ability to deal with adversity has

been built on our fundamental

strengths which are a result of high

standards of corporate governance,

constant aim of value creating, agility

towards changing circumstances,

and always aligning our business

objectives with the broader picture.

Throughout all these years and

despite many changes outside the

organization we have remained

committed to our purpose of being

the best in class experience provider

for our customers. Infact, 2019 was

an extremely monumental year for us

given that we acquired the ownership

rights to the Thomas Cook brand

in India, Sri Lanka and Mauritius in

perpetuity.

Thomas Cook Brand acquisition

Your Company has operated

the Thomas Cook brand name

uninterrupted in India since 1881.

In 2012 when TCIL was acquired by

Fairfax Financial Holdings of Canada,

TCIL had entered into a Brand Licence

Agreement with Thomas Cook Group

UK for exclusive use of the brand

name until 2024 across India, Sri

Lanka and Mauritius. The brand

license agreement also gave TCIL the

right of first refusal to acquire the

brand in the event of the Thomas

Cook UK Group going into liquidation

before 2024. In December, 2019

Thomas Cook India acquired the

rights to the Thomas Cook brand

in India, Sri Lanka and Mauritius in

perpetuity. By way of this acquisition

and the exclusive ownership of the

Thomas Cook brand in these markets,

we can now use this iconic travel

services brand name for perpetuity

on a royalty-free basis, leveraging its

high recall and strong brand equity.

This milestone in the same move,

also ensures that no new entrant can

utilize this brand name in our key

markets.

Macroeconomic environment

Let me provide a background of the

macroeconomic environment we

faced during the period to put this

year-end review into perspective.

Global economic growth has been

slowing for the past three years,

coming down from 3.2% in 2017

to 3% in 2018 to 2.3% in 2019.

The International Monetary Fund

(IMF) has predicted that the global

economy will decline by 3% in 2020

with over $9 trillion in lost economic

output due to the COvID-19

pandemic.

Rising trade barriers along with

associated uncertainty, lower

investment, weak confidence and

high debt further weighed on

business sentiment and activity

globally.

The Indian economy even before

the pandemic was visibly mired in a

demand drought that is unlikely to

abate any time soon, as growth in the

gross domestic product (GDP) falling

to a 11-year low of 4.2 per cent in

2019-2020. The economy grew by

3.1 per cent in the January-March

quarter of 2019-2020, against 5.7

per cent at the same time a year ago,

the slowest growth in at least eight

years.

Overview of the travel and tourism

industry in 2019

As one of the world’s largest

economic sectors, Travel & Tourism

creates jobs, drives exports, and

generates prosperity across the

world. In 2019, even without a

pandemic, travel demand patterns

were vulnerable to a range of

external factors which weighed on

consumer and corporate confidence.

Creating an atmosphere of

uncertainty and volatility and

adversely impacting the sector were

factors such as economic downturn

in several regions, geo-political and

socio-economic factors, Brexit and

its lingering, political tensions in

Hong Kong and impact of natural

calamities such as the Australian

bushfires to name a few.:

(i)

Foreign currency risk

The Company enters into foreign currency transactions in the Foreign Exchange and Leisure Travel Outbound businesses. The

currency risk arising out of foreign currency transactions in the Foreign Exchange business is monitored by a central dealing

room, which then hedges the positions transactions entered into at individual locations across the country, through deals in

the interbank market, or through forward contracts, thereby ensuring that there are minimal open positions. In the Leisure

Travel Outbound business, package prices are denominated partly in the functional currency of the Company, Indian Rupees

(INR), and partly in foreign currencies. The portion of customer collection in foreign currencies, which is parked in Nostro bank

accounts, is used to pay off vendor liabilities, denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating a natural hedge. As a result,

the risk related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation is insignificant.:

units and support services’ units) has the overall responsibility for the risk management framework and its effectiveness, with the

respective heads of business units/ support services units, being responsible for its implementation and day-to- day monitoring.

(A) Credit Risk

The Group is exposed to credit risk, which is the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligation resulting in a financial

loss to the Group. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by its customer. To manage this, the company periodically

assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial conditions, current economic trends, analysis of historical

bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable as of different reporting periods.

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances and bank deposits is limited as the Group generally invests in deposits

with banks with high credit ratings assigned by domestic credit rating agencies. Investments comprises of investment in mutual funds

invested with mutual fund institutions having high credit ratings assigned by domestic credit rating agencies. The loan represents

security deposits given to suppliers, employees and others. The credit risk associated with such deposits is relatively low.

Trade receivables

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by its customers. However, the management also considers the factors that may

influence the credit risk of its customer base. The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed

individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s

review includes external ratings, if they are available, financial statements, credit agency information, industry information and in some

cases bank references.

Based on industry practices and the business environment in which the entity operates, the management considers that trade

receivables are in default (credit impaired) if the payments are due for more than specific number of days. Loss allowances are based

on actual credit loss experience over the past years. Refer note 8(c) for loss allowances provided.

(B) Market risk

(i)

Foreign currency risk (Exposure in different currencies converted to functional currency)

The Group is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, purchases and

borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of the Group companies. The functional currency for large

number of Group companies is Indian Rupees (“INR”). The currency risks of the respective group companies are managed by the local

management of these companies. The currency risk arising out of foreign currency transactions in the foreign exchange business is

monitored by a central dealing room, which then hedges the positions transactions entered into at individual locations across the

country, through deals in the interbank market, or through forward contracts, thereby ensuring that there are minimal open positions.

In the leisure travel outbound business, package prices are denominated partly in the functional currency of the Company and partly in

foreign currencies. The portion of customer collection in foreign currencies, which is parked in Nostro bank accounts, is used to pay off

vendor liabilities, denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating a natural hedge. As a result, the risk related to foreign currency

exchange rate fluctuation is insignificant. The exposure of the group companies to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting

period, are as follows -:

Transfer Pricing

The Company has established a comprehensive system of maintenance of information and documents as required by the transfer pricing

legislation under Sections 92-92F of the Income-tax Act. Since the law requires existence of such information and documentation to

be contemporaneous in nature, the Company is in the process of updating the documentation for the international as well as specified

domestic transactions (if applicable) entered into with the associated enterprise during the financial year and expects such records to

be in existence latest by the end of the stipulated timeline, as required by law. The Management is of the opinion that its international

as well as specified domestic transactions (if any) are at arm’s length so that the aforesaid legislation will not have any impact on the

financial statements, particularly on the amount of tax expenses and that of provision for taxation.

48

On September 20, 2019, vide the Taxation Laws (Amendments) Ordinance 2019, the Government of India inserted Section 115BAA in

the Income Tax Act, 1961 which provides domestic companies a non-reversible option to pay corporate tax at reduced rates effective

April 1, 2019 subject to certain conditions. Some of the subsidiary companies in the Group have opted for such reduced rate of tax and

have consequently recognised provision for income tax for the year ended March 31, 2020 and remeasured its deferred tax assets/

liability basis the reduced tax rate prescribed in the said section. Overall impact of such change is not material to the Group.
