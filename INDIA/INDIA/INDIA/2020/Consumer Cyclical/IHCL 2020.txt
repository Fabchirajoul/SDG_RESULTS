Dear Stakeholders,

For the travel and tourism sector, the end of the

decade saw greater emphasis on the industry

as a significant contributor to the overall

global economy and employment. A strong

economy, rising global consumer purchasing

power and digital disruption was paving the

way for a bright future, and FY 2019/2020 was,

in fact, a tipping point, presenting tremendous

potential for the sector.

However, this buoyant sentiment was upended by a

sudden outbreak of a pandemic that has had no parallels

in recent history in terms of scale and impact. The world

was placed under suspended animation, and the industry

was brought to a halt, with estimated losses at trillions

and millions of jobs at risk. With the very foundation of

the world altered, the need of the hour is to see our industry,

and IHCL, through the crisis with greater urgency, revised

strategy and more agility (stragility).

It also calls for a greater need for communities to unite and

support one another in this time of need. Guided by our

values as a Tata company, our priority besides ensuring the

safety and security of our guests and employees, was to help

the community in any manner we could. We are humbled to

have been given the opportunity to be of service to the nation

by providing over 2 Million meals to healthcare workers and

migrant labourers throughout the lockdown. Some of our

hotels were also offered to doctors and healthcare workers,

while some were converted into quarantine facilities.

A SILVER LINING – EVERY CRISIS ALSO PRESENTS AN

OPPORTUNITY

The travel and tourism industry accounts for 10% of the global

GDP and generates 1 out of 10 jobs. In India, it is a significant

contributor to GDP and also contributes 8.1% to the overall

workforce. Thus, given its significance, the industry will have

a crucial role to play in any economic revival and with tourism

likely to look inwards in the new normal, India is well placed

with its rich heritage and cultural diversity.

With a 116-year legacy honed by Tata values, our ability

to consistently deliver industry-leading growth while

maintaining profitability and balance sheet strength,

combined with our business sense and thrift, makes us

resilient to disruptive challenges.

Change breeds innovation and in light of the current global

scenario, at IHCL, we have detailed a comprehensive five-

point strategy – R.E.S.E.T 2020. This will not only cater to

the rapidly changing market conditions, shifting government

policies and dynamic customer needs, but will also focus

on re-imagining business models, implementing various

operational excellence interventions required for safety and

hygiene, revenue enhancement and creating alternative

sources of revenue through our well established hospitality

eco-system, cost optimisation and other measures through

utmost financial prudence.

SUSTAINABILITY LED BY PROFITABILITY

The relentless pursuit of our five-year strategy – Aspiration

2022 – has enabled us to deliver nine quarters of profitable

growth in a row. In FY 2019-20, we recorded the highest

full-year PAT at ₹354 Crore, up 24% Y-O-Y; the highest full-

year EBITDA at ₹1,100 Crore, up 20%; and a 406-basis-point

expansion in EBITDA margin. Our balance sheet was further

strengthened by lowering net debt-to-EBITDA to 1.74.

We have made significant inroads in meeting our defined

objectives within two years of outlining our aspirations. In

order to drive asset-light growth, we have restructured our

portfolio, with management contracts now accounting for

42%. We have signed over 50 new hotels in the past two years,

reaching a milestone of 200 hotels with 25,000+ rooms across

100+ locations (excluding amã Stays and Trails) – 29 hotels

were signed in the last fiscal alone.

STRONG BRAND VALUE

The overall positive outcome was further accelerated by

Taj being rated as India’s Strongest Brand in Brand Finance’s

Brand Value Report – ‘India 100 2020’ report recently.

With a brand strength index (BSI) score of 90.5 out of 100

and AAA+ brand strength rating, it is a matter of pride,

and has further reinforced the brand’s resonance and trust

among all our stakeholders.

RE-IMAGINING AND CONSOLIDATING OUR

HOSPITALITY ECOSYSTEM

Even as we adapt to the new normal, we will continue to

re-imagine our multi-product, multi-segment brandscape to

transform from a hotels business to a hospitality ecosystem.

Our new brand – SeleQtions – along with the expansion of

amã Stays & Trails across offbeat locations, offers distinct

value propositions across demographics. The repositioned

Ginger recorded the highest number of rooms signed under

any brand in India in FY 2019-20, and reached a milestone

with the opening of the 50th Ginger hotel in Surat.

Our ancillary service brands perfectly complement our

hospitality brands. The Chambers – Taj’s exclusive business club

– was relaunched with enhanced features and over 100 new

members. In order to capture diverse customer segments, we

launched our salon brand, niu&nau; and re-designed our F&B

offerings with the recent launch of Qmin, a repertoire of culinary

experiences. An exclusive partnership with AB InBev, for an

industry first on-site chain of microbreweries, will see the first

7 Rivers brewpub open at Taj MG Road in Bengaluru, shortly.

We also tied up with globally acclaimed Italian restaurant chain,

Paper Moon – its first restaurant in India is due to launch in Goa.

We opened 12 hotels including Taj Fateh Prakash Palace in

Udaipur; Taj Jumeirah Lakes Towers in Dubai; Taj Tirupati –

strengthening our presence in spiritual tourism; Taj Hotel &

Convention Centre Goa – the largest convention venue in the

state with Cidade De Goa – IHCL SeleQtions; Devi Ratn – IHCL

SeleQtions in Jaipur and Ginger Surat. We also augmented

our development portfolio with multiple signings in the North

East, Haridwar, Thiruvananthapuram and Bhubaneshwar, while

readying the launch of a Vivanta prototype in Bengaluru.

TAJNESS – A COMMITMENT RESTRENGTHENED

As we slowly but steadily embark on the path to recovery,

our hotels stand prepared to welcome guests back with an

enhanced focus on hygiene and safety through exacting

protocols delivered with a renewed and restrengthened

commitment to Tajness.

LOOKING AHEAD

Although the new decade has begun on a challenging note, history

is testament to the resilience our company has demonstrated

in the face of adversity. We are confident that we will emerge

stronger and more unified than ever. We will also have the

opportunity to create a more positive impact and reshape the

world together, making it a better place for all who inhabit it.

Sustainability will remain at the core of all that we do. We

will continue to give back to society by enabling livelihoods

through skilling, leverage our business value chain to support

traditional art and heritage, drive societal welfare through the

Taj Public Welfare Trust, and carry out responsible sourcing of

local products and materials.

Guided by our values of Trust, Awareness and Joy, we remain

committed to deepening our collaborations, and driving

business performance in a responsible manner. This will,

of course, be impossible without the continued support of

our patrons, investors, employees and other stakeholders.

I thank you all for being the strongest pillars of our success.

Best Regards,
