Managing Director

Dear Stakeholder,

it is a measure of how rapidly our world has changed, that when we look back at the year gone by, it

feels like a different era altogether. The corona virus crisis is the most disruptive event in modern

human history. The resultant economic crisis has only compounded the global community’s hardships.

in the current context, organizations have to be intensely future-oriented and we at Swan remain

focused on our long-term strategy.

Over the course of this past year, Swan LNG Private Limited (a subsidiary of Swan Energy) has moved a

step closer to commissioning india’s first ever FSRU based LNG terminal. With the vessel

manufacturing completed, the gas trials were concluded and the manufacturer, Hyundai Heavy

industries at South Korea is performing final checks before delivery of the vessel. The port

development works were on sail for the major part of FY2019-20, only to be halted by the Covid-19

crisis and the subsequent monsoons. However, your company is geared up to maneuver through the

tough times with renewed agility and its deep-rooted values of quality, determination and excellence.

The textile unit in Ahmedabad delivered on its commitment of value creation for the shareholders.

With the revamped business model and streamlined operations, the business posted an EBiTDA of Rs.

19.47 crore, up from Rs. 14.78 crore a year ago. Your company plans to modernize the plant and

increase capacity by 20% over the next fiscal year. We believe that unlike our global counterparts,

india is well positioned to emerge stronger than ever, if it seizes the opportunity to become the

preferred manufacturing destination.

in the real estate sector, delays are expected in the completion of the ongoing 3.22 lakh square feet

joint development residential project in Bangalore due to the global crisis. However, the two already

completed sites continued to provide rental in come to the tune of Rs. 31.89 crore. Your company is

looking to expand its realty division and intends on monetizing its 30000 sq. feet land parcel in

Bangalore in the near future.

The next few months will be challenging. However, with its deep relationships, diversified businesses

and resilient DNA, your company is well positioned to leverage the current downturn and take

advantage of new opportunities in the future.

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Swan Energy, i want to thank you for your continued trust,

confidence, and support.

Warm regards,

Nikhil V. Merchant:
