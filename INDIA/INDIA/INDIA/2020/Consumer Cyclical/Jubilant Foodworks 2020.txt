Place: Noida

Company Secretary:

Dear Shareholders,

The year had been witness to headwinds in the form of pronounced

inflationary costs on one hand and challenging external demand

environment on the other. The situation was made worse by the

COVID-19 pandemic during the final quarter.

In the face of all these challenges, the disciplined execution of our

five-pillared strategy enabled us to deliver a strong performance

for FY 2020. We reported a double-digit growth and strong

EBITDA, which stood at 22.6% of revenues. We also crossed a

new milestone by opening 123 restaurants during the year, our

highest in the last three years. We are focused on improving

customer experience through continuous innovation, brand

building activities, new restaurant design and more. We have

strategically grown our presence by having more split store and

enhancing our digital assets.

Impact of COVID-19

The global pandemic has brought upon the world an unprecedented

crisis that has overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructure and

brought businesses and economies to a standstill. The Indian

economy has suffered a huge impact, but our fundamentals remain

sound. Moreover, the government has announced a relief package

aimed at helping small and medium enterprises, which will go a

long way in helping the economy recover. Thus, we are confident of

a rebound in economic growth in the medium to long term.

While governments, health agencies and other frontline workers are

engaged in helping our societies deal with the crisis, we as a Group

are committed to providing support to the best possible extent.

At JFL, we have prioritised the health and safety of our employees

and our customers. We are witnessing a new normal emerge,

where customers prefer to order from trusted brands and delivery

is the key mode of accessing services.

As a food company driven by expertise in delivery, we have

mounted a rapid response in view of the changes in the market

scenario due to COVID-19. We were the first in the industry to

introduce effective safety and sanitisation protocols specific

to the virus. We have been resilient and have taken some

transformational steps. Acting with due foresight, we put in place

Zero Contact Delivery systems across all our 1,335 restaurants

in the country, even before the lockdown began on March 25.

This feature has been introduced as an additional precautionary

measure to ensure the safety of both customers and the

delivery staff. We extended these protocols later to cover our

Zero Contact Takeaways and Zero Contact Dine-in.

We have worked assiduously to provide a seamless customer

experience, thereby ensuring business continuity. We focused

on reopening restaurants and keeping commissaries operational.

Our technology strength has led us to stay ahead in the online

delivery segment. We also continued to gain market share on the

aggregator’s platform and revisited cost structures and identified

opportunities to improve efficiencies.

We have undertaken focused initiatives to communicate more

proactively with our customers on a regular basis to understand

their requirements. We have increased our digital marketing

initiatives and continued our media engagements. We revised our

offerings based on our core strengths for customer delight.

As deliveries opened up following the completion of the first phase

of total lockdown in mid-April, we partnered with FMCG majors to

deliver essential items. We conceptualised and rolled out Domino’s

Essentials such as atta, dal, rice, milk, sugar, buns, etc., which

were made available on our Domino’s Pizza app, delivered safely

and hygienically by our Safe Delivery Experts (riders). The crisis

brought us the opportunity to do more and better for our customers.

As the situation continues to ease, we expect to recover growth

over the near term, given the massive opportunity in the overall

QSR space. Specifically, for us, the outlook remains positive due

to the fact that our brands enjoy a strong reputation for quality,

hygiene and value. During the crisis, when customers looked for

assurances of health and safety, they naturally chose us. This has

helped strengthen our consumer connect even further.

Brief Review of Our Performance

Our operating revenue for the year stood at ₹38,858 million, up

by 10.1% over FY 2019. Our EBITDA stood at ₹8,771 million. We

have focused on realising greater productivity throughout the year

to help offset the impact our margins have suffered as a result of

inflation in dairy prices and the year-end COVID-19 crisis.

Our Like-for-Like (LFL) sales growth stood at 4.5% and Same

Store Growth (SSG) at 3.2%. Overall, 130 restaurants were

opened. Among these, 123 were Domino’s Pizza, 4 were

Dunkin’ Donuts and 3 were Hong’s Kitchen restaurants. We also

launched a brand new campaign ‘Dil, Dosti, Domino’s’, crafted

to acknowledge the change in lifestyle of the new-age Indian

consumer. It celebrates the role of friendship as the only one truly

essential element of our relationships. It struck a chord with our

audiences instantly across various platforms.
