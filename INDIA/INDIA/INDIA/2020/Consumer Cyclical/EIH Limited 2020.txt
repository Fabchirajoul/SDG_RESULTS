to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management’s assessment of specific

circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such

accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty. Information

about such litigations is provided in notes to the financial statements.:
