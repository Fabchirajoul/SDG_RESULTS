and support in setting strategic direction for the Company and

guiding in development of talent pipeline for leadership positions.

The leaders at the top level are designated as Executive

Officers (EOs)/Senior Executive Officers (Sr. EOs)/Members

field information to the Board members but also gives the top

management the opportunity to give recommendations relevant

to their business operations. The Sr.EOs/EOs are supported by

the divisional heads and the departmental heads.

Through this, it is ensured that:

•

Strategic supervision is provided by the Board;

•

Control and implementation of the Company’s strategy is

achieved effectively;

•

Operational management remains focused on implementation;

•

Information regarding the Company’s operations and financial

performance are made available adequately;

•

Delegation of decision making with accountability is achieved;

•

Financial and operating controls are maintained at an

optimal level; and

•

Risk is suitably evaluated and dealt with.

Managing Director & CEO of the Company

forms part of this report as Annexure - B.

CEO/CFO Certification

The Company has institutionalised the framework for CEO/

CFO certification by establishing a transparent “controls self

assessment” mechanism, thereby laying the foundation for

development of the best corporate governance practices

which are vital for a successful business. It is the Company’s

endeavor to attain the highest level of governance to enhance

the stakeholders’ value. To enable certification by CEO/CFO

for the financial year 2019-2020, key controls over financial

reporting were identified and subjected to self-assessment by

control owners in the form of completion of self-assessment

questionnaires through a web based online tool called “Controls

Manager”. The self-assessments submitted by control owners

were further reviewed and approved by their superiors and

the results of the self-assessment process were presented to

the auditors and the audit committee. The whole exercise was

carried out in an objective manner to assess the effectiveness

of internal financial controls including controls over financial

reporting during the financial year 2019 - 2020.

Enabling controls self-assessments through the ‘Controls Manager’
