Dear Shareholders,

The automobile sector has seen considerable amount of

turbulence over the past several months due to a series of

events, the most recent being the global pandemic. These

are testing times not only for businesses around the world,

but also for humanity in general and we believe that in this

adversity, reside numerous opportunities to innovate and

serve our customers better. Besides improvements to its

core processes, CEAT is exploring new business models

with a sharp focus on efficiency and sustainability. CEAT’s

Purpose of ‘Making Mobility Safer & Smarter. Every Day.’ is

closely aligned with all initiatives.

We are leveraging our strong R&D capabilities to reduce fuel

consumption, enhance safety and durability of our products,

and are reimagining processes to ensure seamless delivery

during challenging times such as the present. During the

year, we started production at our newest greenfield plant

in Chennai and enhanced capacities in some of our other

facilities. In keeping with our ESG goals, CEAT is integrating

sound environmental practices into its business, which

already comprises of a robust governance framework and

socially responsible policies and initiatives. We are also

harnessing technology and digital capabilities to change

the way we do business. We have taken significant steps to

ensure the wellbeing of our personnel, dealers, customers

and communities during these difficult times.

As India grapples with an unprecedented pandemic, CEAT

has looked beyond business and has been a strong force

in the fight against COVID-19, lending support to frontline

workers, migrant labour and also strengthening sanitisation

and healthcare infrastructure in India. With distinguished

strengths, a growth mindset and aspiration to touch lives of

all our stakeholders, we move forward with confidence as

the world adapts to a new normal.

STATUTORY REPORTS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

Dear Shareholders,

Embarking on the Integrated Reporting journey, CEAT

not only hopes to showcase our Environmental,

Social and Governance (ESG) performance, but also

work on these aspects in earnest.

cornering on wet and dry road conditions. Another one of

our key roles is to continuously invent for our customers.

We recently launched Puncture-Safe Motorcycle Tyres for

the Indian market, where puncture resistance is becoming

ever more important as one of the biggest worries of the

bike riders is getting stranded on the road. We continue to

invest in Research and Development (R&D) in areas such

as green technology, nanotechnology, advanced material

and novel processing. Moreover, our safety-first approach

extends to our operations, which ensure occupational health

and safety through a robust framework comprising of risk

identification and mitigation, trainings and certifications. As

a recognition of our safety efforts, the British Safety Council

conferred the ‘Sword of Honour’, one of the highest safety

awards, upon us.

Our people are our most important asset. We truly believe

that people excel when given freedom and a purpose

beyond making money. Our policies are amongst the most

liberal in the corporate world, with no formal working hours,

options of working from home even before the pandemic

hit us, and care for our people’s health and their families.

We recently appointed a Chief Fitness Officer, who helps

ensure the physical wellbeing of our people. We have

also tied up with mental health specialists in light of the

pandemic. Diversity and inclusion in CEAT goes well

beyond gender diversity to include people with disabilities

and those from different educational backgrounds. All this

has helped strengthen CEAT’s position as an employer of

choice, boosting our Great Place to Work® rank to 35, up

from 67 in the previous year.

Today, all companies have been impacted by digitisation

and we would like to be at the forefront of digital adoption.

In our factories, we have been able to supplement our TQM

(Total Quality Management) thinking with digital solutions

to be even more efficient and consistent. Partnerships and

learning from the outside are extremely important, and to do

the same, we launched a start-up competition ‘Excellerator’

to boost innovation in the areas of connected, shared and

tech-enabled fleet management. The initiative provided

winners with funding and mentorship, along with access to

CEAT’s wide-reaching business network.

The work that I feel most proud about is the work we do for

society. In the reporting year, we continued to impact people’s

lives through efforts in areas like health, hygiene, providing

clean drinking water, road safety, women’s empowerment,

and skills training for employability. As the country came to

a grinding halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing

lockdown, CEAT focussed its efforts on various fronts that

demanded immediate attention. This included the provision

of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, gloves and

masks, and dry rations and hot meals to those in need. The

Company also undertook truck sanitation drives to ensure

the seamless delivery of essential goods in these uncertain

times. Recognising the need for strengthening healthcare

infrastructure, CEAT funded a start-up to develop a low-cost

prototype of a ventilator and leveraged its own prowess to

build COVID-19 testing booths for hospitals. In line with the

Company’s commitment to safety, July 2020 also saw the

launch of the GoSafe S95 face mask to help bridge the PPE

gap.

Climate change is one of the most serious issues that we

face and we believe it is our responsibility to play an essential

role in this space, especially considering the sector that we

operate in. Therefore, as part of a concerted effort to make

the shift to renewable energy, CEAT has collaborated with

Greenzest Solar for a captive solar power for its plant in

Nashik. We are also launching tyres for electric vehicles,

utilising sustainable raw materials like re-used rubber and

silica, and optimising packaging and processes to reduce

the overall environmental impacts of mobility.

The near future is not devoid of challenges. However,

the changing mobility landscape, a global supply chain

shift and growth in Indian rural and semi-urban markets

present a wealth of opportunity for the Company. We are

confident that our commitment to safety and digitisation,

culture of freedom and transparency, R&D expertise and

strong alliances have positioned us to win the marketplace.

Embarking on the Integrated Reporting journey, CEAT not

only hopes to showcase our Environmental, Social and

Governance (ESG) performance, but also work on these

aspects in earnest. We believe that this will take us further

on our journey towards excellence and allow us to channel

our extensive reach to create a world that is inclusive,

sustainable and prosperous.

VI Remuneration of the Directors and Key Managerial Personnel

A. Remuneration to: Managing

Managing Director and the Whole-time Director.

(2) Directors’ remuneration includes commission and sitting fees for FY 2019-20. While Commission is determined based

on the contribution and tenure served by Non-executive Directors during the year, the sitting fees are paid based on the

number of meetings of Board and Committee attended by them respectively. Therefore, variation in the remuneration of

the Directors could be attributed to the committee positions held and the number of meetings attended by them during

the year.

(3) Ms. Vallari Gupte was appointed as Company Secretary w.e.f. October 25, 2018 and remuneration for FY 2018-19 was

paid only for the part of year and hence increase is not comparable between previous year and current financial year.

Committee Meetings are pre-scheduled and a tentative

annual calendar of the Board and Committee Meetings

is circulated to the Directors well in advance to facilitate

them to plan their schedule and to ensure meaningful

participation in the meetings. However, in case of

a special and urgent business need, the Board’s

approval is taken by passing resolutions by circulation,

as permitted by law, which are noted and confirmed in

the subsequent Board Meeting.

The notice of Board / Committee Meetings is given well

in advance to all the Directors. Video / tele-conferencing

facilities are also provided to facilitate the Directors who

are travelling or located at other locations to participate

in the meetings seamlessly. The Agenda is circulated a

week prior to the date of the Meeting. The Board Agenda

includes an Action Taken Report comprising of actions

emanating from the Board / Committee Meetings and

status updates thereof. The Management endeavours

to provide the Board with sufficient information apart

from the items as mandated for discussion by the Board

under Regulation 17(7) read with Part A of Schedule II

to the Listing Regulations. Through various information

being placed or presented at the Board meetings, the

Board is kept well informed about the overall functioning

of the Company, which enables the Board to contribute

to the growth of the Company and helps them to take

informed decisions. Prior approval from the Board is

obtained for circulating the agenda items with shorter

notice for matters that form part of the Board and

Committee Agenda and are considered to be in the

nature of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information.

The Board periodically reviews the updates on the

projects, business performance, risk management,

strategies,

people,

processes,

compliance

with

applicable laws and other key affairs of the Company

having impact on the business. The Board is satisfied

that plans are in place for orderly succession

for appointment to the Board and to the Senior

Management.

The Agenda of the Board / Committee Meetings is

SECTION E: PRINCIPLE-WISE PERFORMANCE

Principle 1: Ethics, Transparency and Accountability

The Company is part of the RPG Group, a group that

has always stood for conducting business responsibly

and ethically. RPG Group has laid down the Code of

Corporate Governance and Ethics (‘the Code’) applicable

and adopted by the Company. The Code has outlined

the principles of corporate governance that will apply in

managing the affairs of the Company. The Group has set

up the Corporate Governance and Ethics Committee (‘the

CGEC’) which acts as a central body for monitoring this

Code. The Code inter alia prescribes that all the activities

and business conducted in the Company should be free

from the influence of corruption and bribery. Employees

and business partners of the Company are expected to be

aware of and follow all anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws

everywhere the Company does its business. The Code is

extended to its subsidiaries, joint venture, and its business

partners to a certain extent.

The Company believes in an environment of mutual respect,

fairness, transparency and integrity and is committed to

conduct its business ethically and responsibly. Towards

this goal, the Company has formulated / adopted various

policies including the Code, covering principles of business

integrity, responsibilities relating to employees, consumers

and the environment. The Company periodically cascades

the principles under the Code across the organisation.

Concerns and issues related to this framework are reviewed

and dealt with by the CGEC.

A dedicated email ID ethics@rpg.in is provided for reporting

grievances and violations of the said Code to the CGEC. The

report of the CGEC is placed before the Audit Committee as

deemed necessary.

The Company has adopted a Whistle Blower Policy which

provides a framework through which the Directors and

employees as well as external stakeholders viz. customers,

vendors, suppliers, outsourcing partners, etc. may report

their concerns and actual / potential violations to the

designated officials of the Company fearlessly.

Additionally, the Company has formulated a Code of

Conduct for Board Members and Senior Management for

ethical and transparent behaviour to achieve the highest

standards of corporate governance.

During Financial Year 2019-20, 1 (one) complaint was

received by the Ethics Committee under Whistle Blower

Policy and Vigil Mechanism as referred to it by the Company

and the same was resolved satisfactorily.

Principle 2: Product Lifecycle Sustainability

A customer-focused strategy is required to retain and

expand the customer base in a competitive environment.

Customer satisfaction can be achieved by ensuring

high standards of quality of products and services. The

Company is committed to supplying quality goods and

services, backed by after-sales services consistent with the

requirements of its customers within the legal framework.

The lifecycle of the product covers the entire value chain

from sourcing of raw materials to manufacturing, distribution,

consumer use and disposal. The Company believes that

product lifecycle sustainability is an approach to managing

the stages of a product’s existence to minimise any negative

impact on the environment. The degree of sustainability is

largely determined during the beginning of the life stage of

the product lifecycle in which the product is designed and

developed. Based on the very same principle, the Company:

Note 1: Corporate information

CEAT Limited (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company

domiciled in India and incorporated under the provisions of the

Companies Act applicable in India. The Company’s principal

business is manufacturing of automotive tyres, tubes and flaps.

The Company started operations in 1958 as CEAT Tyres of

India Limited and was renamed as CEAT Limited in 1990. The

Company caters to both domestic and international markets.

The Company is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)

and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The registered office

of the Company is located at RPG House, 463, Dr Annie Besant

Road, Worli, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400030. The financial

statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a

resolution of the Board of Directors on May 28, 2020.

Note 2: Basis of preparation, measurement and

significant accounting policies

2.1 Basis of preparation and measurement

2.1.1 Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared in

accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards

(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as notified by

Ministry of Corporate Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the

Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 of the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended

from time to time and presentation requirements of Division

II of Schedule III of the Companies Act 2013 (Ind AS

compliant Schedule III).

The financial statements have been prepared on accrual

and going concern basis. The accounting policies are

applied consistently to all the periods presented in the

financial statements.

The financial statements are presented in H, the functional

currency of the Company. Items included in the financial

statements of the Company are recorded using the

currency of the primary economic environment in which

the Company operates (the ‘functional currency’).

All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and

notes have been rounded off to the nearest lacs as per the

requirements of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013,

unless otherwise stated. Wherever the amount represented

‘0’ (zero) construes value less than Rupees fifty thousand.

2.1.2 Measurement

These financial statements are prepared under the

historical cost convention except for the following assets

and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:

Derivative financial instruments and

Certain financial assets measured at fair value (refer

accounting policy regarding financial instruments)

In addition, the carrying values of recognised assets and

liabilities designated as hedged items in fair value hedges

that would otherwise be carried at amortised cost are

adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable

to the risks that are being hedged in effective hedge

relationships.

2.2 Changes in accounting policies

2.2.1 Accounting for leases

The Company has adopted Ind AS 116 ‘Leases’ effective

April 01, 2019, using modified retrospective method. The

Company has applied the standard to all its leases with the

cumulative impact recognised on the date of initial application

i.e. April 01, 2019. The Company has elected to measure

the right-of-use asset equal to the amount of lease liability.

Accordingly, previous period information has not been

restated. On transition, the adoption of the new standard

resulted in recognition of right-of-use asset of H 13,085 lacs

and a lease liability of INR H 13,085 lacs.

In the Statement of Profit and Loss for the current period,

the nature of expenses in respect of operating leases has

changed from lease rent in previous periods to depreciation

cost for the right-to-use asset and finance cost for interest

accrued on lease liability.

In the context of initial application, the Company has

exercised the option not to apply the new recognition

requirements to short-term leases and to leases of low-

value asset.

The following table presents the reconciliation of lease

liability:

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had, while considering the representation of the All India Tyres Dealers

Federation (AITDF) made a prima facie finding that the major players of tyre industry (including the Company) had

some understanding amongst themselves, especially in the replacement market, as they did not pass the benefit of

corresponding reduction in prices of major raw material inputs for the period subsequent to the financial year 2011-12.

CCI had, vide its order passed on June 24, 2014 under Section 26(1) of the Act, directed the Office of the Director General

(DG) to investigate the said alleged violation of the Act. DG submitted its investigation report to CCI in December 2015,

based on which CCI directed the said tyre manufacturers to file their suggestions/objections by May 05, 2016. Objections

were filed as directed and the CCI had also heard the tyre manufacturers in detail.

Aggrieved by the conduct of the Investigation by the DG, one of the other tyre manufacturer filed Writ Petition in the Madras

High Court, challenging the legality of the investigation conducted by the Director General. The Madras High Court had

initially admitted the Writ Petition and directed the CCI to not pass any Orders till the disposal of the Petition. Subsequently,

the Writ Petition was dismissed on March 06, 2018. Aggrieved by the decision of the Single Judge of the Madras High

Court, the above said tyre manufacturer filed Appeal before the Division Bench on March 07, 2018. On hearing the Appeal,

the Division Bench on March 08, 2018 directed the CCI to keep its Orders in sealed cover till the disposal of the Appeal.

The Appeal is still pending.

Meanwhile, few other tyre manufactures having been aggrieved by the decision of the Single Judge of the Madras High

Court, have filed Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court initially admitted the Special Leave

Petition. However, when the Petition came up for hearing, the Parties have withdrawn the Petition citing their willingness to

approach the Division Bench of the Madras High Court. The Appeal filed before the Madras High Court continues to be

pending.

The Group’s decision to change the price is purely a business decision which depends upon many factors like cost of

production, brand value perception, profit margin of each product, quality perception of each product in the market,

demand and supply situation of each product category, market potential and market share targets of various product

categories etc. In view of the above, Group believes that it has a strong case, hence, considered as remote.
