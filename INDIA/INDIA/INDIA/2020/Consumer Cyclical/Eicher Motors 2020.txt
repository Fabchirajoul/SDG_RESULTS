dear Shareholders,

I trust you and your families are safe and doing well.

I am writing to you at a time when the world, as we

know it, is changing. Over the last few months, the

Coronavirus global pandemic and the ensuing

emergency have resulted in disruptive changes in

our world. We’ve seen a paradigm shift in the way

we live, the way we work, and in the way we connect,

engage and collaborate with people.

At the Eicher Group, we’ve moved swiftly to tackle and respond

to this situation and we have taken several initiatives to secure

the interests of our internal and external stakeholders. We

employed a three-pronged strategy to address and engage

all stakeholders outside our fences, close to our fences and

within our fences. We worked to ensure our commitment and

support to our dealers and suppliers, and helped them with

over Rs. 700 crores, as we believe that we need to ensure the

sustainability of the entire ecosystem. We have made an initial

CSR commitment of Rs. 50 crores towards relief and support

measures to fight the pandemic in India and are committed to

increasing spends to deploy additional support and for long-

term rehabilitation in the aftermath of the pandemic.

Businesses have been impacted too, and the automobile

industry in India and across the world has been considerably

hit. At Eicher Motors - both at Royal Enfield and VECV -

we have witnessed the impact of this situation as several

parts of the world, including India went into lockdown.

Our manufacturing facilities and offices remained shut in

compliance, and so did our stores and service centres.

We believe we have built our business on sound fundamentals

that gives us enough room to tackle unprecedented situations

such as this. We have a solid balance sheet and cash position,

a robust business model with a very focussed and cash-

optimized approach, a strong line-up of excellent products,

among the best retail footprint, and overall an exceptional

management team at Royal Enfield and VECV. I am confident

that we are able to pursue our focus and investment for the

long term, while we address near term challenges.

In the year ended March 2020, EML’s consolidated net revenue

from operations (reflecting the business of Royal Enfield

motorcycles) was Rs. 9,154 crores, Consolidated EBITDA was

Rs. 2,180 crores, and Profit After Tax was at Rs. 1,827 crores.

Royal Enfield sold 6,97,582 motorcycles in the financial year.

In an effort to increase the retail footprint in India and to

cater to smaller towns and cities, Royal Enfield announced the

Studio Stores format and launched 600 new Studio Stores

during the year. These, together with the 921 dealerships, take

Royal Enfield’s retail touchpoints to 1,521 across India. In the

international markets, we now have 77 exclusive stores outside

of India, and a retail network spread across 60 countries.

We have opened new consumer touchpoints in Thailand,

Brazil, Argentina, France and the UK, taking our total dealer

touchpoints in international markets to over 660 stores

including multi-brand outlets.

On the back of a challenging year, growth momentum for

the automobile industry was sluggish and subdued. At Royal

Enfield, we continued to push ahead with our long-term plans,

while adapting our strategies to tackle immediate challenges.

We remained focussed on creating more accessibility with the

introduction of new variants of motorcycles and on building

engaging experiences for the customer.

It has been our constant endeavour to strengthen Royal

Enfield’s position as a true global brand, and as a catalyst for

pure motorcycling. In that context, it is a great pleasure for me

to report that we have had an excellent performance in markets

outside of India this year.

We have recorded an overall volume growth of 96%,

in international markets which has been highlighted by

overwhelming growth across all geographies - both developing

markets and matured markets have performed exceedingly well,

with Europe registering a 100% growth over last year. The 650

Twin motorcycles, and the Himalayan have led this growth for us

across these markets, as these gorgeous motorcycles received

unprecedented response from consumers across the globe.

Royal Enfield expanded its retail footprint in the Asia-Pacific

region this year by setting up its first standalone, flagship store

in Seoul, South Korea. The overall footprint grew by 50% in key

priority markets across the Asia-Pacific region. Royal Enfield

now features among the Top 5 brands, in terms of volumes, in

the middleweight segment in Thailand, Australia-New Zealand

and South Korea. In Europe, we are now at No.6 among brands

in the middleweight motorcycling segment. This year, we also

started direct operations of our Thailand subsidiary. This will

be instrumental for us to grow the Royal Enfield brand and the

middleweight motorcycling segment in the Asia-Pacific markets.

We have continuously worked to strengthen our technical

competencies. This year, we completed the set-up of our Global

Headquarters in Chennai which also houses a world-class

product development and technology centre. We now have the

advantage of twin technology centres in the UK and in India,

that house world-class testing and development capabilities

and work in close collaboration across projects.

Our focus this year in India, has been to build accessibility and

aspiration among emerging markets within the country. With
