We believe a sustainable business

like ours is essentially about crafting

a fine balance of priorities and

focusing on the long-term play. Our

expansive portfolio of high-end,

globally acclaimed hotel properties

and mixed-use assets strive to create

unique experiences for our guests and

exceptional value for our partners,

colleagues and all other stakeholders.

Our broad strategy compass points

at three critical priorities. First,

following sustainable best practices,

which translate into energy-saving

initiatives, water & waste management,

minimising plastic use, maintaining

industry leading standards of

operating efficiencies and supporting

the community.

Second, creating a resilient business

model on the pillars of location,

efficient build, partnerships and setting

high performance drivers. We are

following new operating procedures

post COVID-19, sharpening consumer

focus & centralising key functions and

we are engaging with key clients to

identify new formats of offerings as

part of our 'Reboot, Reinvent and Race

Ahead' back to business strategy.

Finally, fostering long-term

partnerships with leading

international hospitality brands and

leading Indian retail brands to expand

our footprint and grow our business.

As India’s economy engine gradually

gathers steam, we are geared to scale

up our portfolio with a judicious and

balanced strategy; as we eagerly wait

to welcome guests.

JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure in presenting the 35th Annual

Report of your Company for the financial year ended

March 31, 2020, wherein your Company has reported a

profit after tax of ` 996 million.

This has been a year of collaborations and new horizons

for your Company. Novotel Pune, Nagar Road was added

to the hotel portfolio, marking an entry into the business

city of Pune. Your Company also signed new hotel

management contracts of ~1,500 rooms with Marriott and

franchise contract of ~250 rooms with Hyatt. With this, we

have fortified the relationships of your Company with the

existing partners and forged new relationships. Being brand

agnostic, the Company continues to grow strategically

in new markets.

The year started on a positive note and marked the third

continuous year of rate growth for the Company, despite

headwinds on the economic front. The emergence of

COVID-19 during the final quarter of the year came as

a setback to the tourism and hospitality industry world

over. This impacted the final quarter performance of your

Company as well and affected our annual performance.

While the situation is still evolving, your Company's

Management has been totally focused on cashflow

management and developing strategies to benefit from

the disruptions that are likely to follow the withdrawal of

lockdowns . Our core Values of Integrity, Agility, Efficiency,

Collaboration, Sustainable Development and Respect have

been key in the current scenario in taking the team together

in formulating a ‘New Normal’ for the business.

We consider this as not only our duty towards society but

our honour and privilege to serve the nation and humanity

at large. Our hotels have been regularly delivering meal

packets to government personnel on duty. Our hotels

have provided PPE kits to the police and employees of

the Municipal Corporation as and when needed. We are

honoured to keep our doors open for the front-line warriors

from the medical fraternity in Mumbai and look forward to

welcoming our guests in the new normal.

Yours Sincerely,

Hetal Gandhi

Annual Report 2019-20:

Managing Director

BEING RESOLUTE.

EMERGING STRONGER.: Dear Shareholders,

It is an honour for me to address you on the second Annual

General Meeting post listing of Chalet Hotels Limited.

In the most challenging crisis, the hotel industry has ever

endured, our highest priority has been the well-being of

our guests and colleagues. We have also adopted a ‘no-

regret action strategy’ to reduce our costs and support

our cash flows to ensure we are able to tide over the next

few quarters. We believe that with a well-positioned asset

base of hotels at key locations and diversified revenue

streams from the non-hotel portfolio, your Company is well

positioned for a quick recovery when travel demand returns.

With extremely harsh economic conditions, a vast majority

of global hospitality markets have seen occupancies drop

down to below 20% in the last few months. Whilst not a

perfect comparison, China is a good directional comparison

for what the recovery in India might look like. Since they are

around three to four months ahead of the virus cycle, we

can assume that India may follow a similar occupancy trend

with a three to four month lag. Like many other markets, key

markets in China too were performing at occupancy levels of

10% - 20% in the months of March and April. However, the

first half of May has shown some green shoots of hope with

peak performance hitting the 50% mark across key cities of

China. This gives us hope for a turnaround in not too distant

a future. However, there are several uncertainties around the

access to a cure or vaccines for COVID-19 and a potential

second wave. We must not let our guard down.

For FY 2019-20, the average room rate of our hotels grew

by 3% whilst the overall occupancy levels were at 71%.

Excluding the period of impact of the pandemic i.e. the

month of March 2020, the performance of the first 11

months witnessed a 4% improvement in average room rates

while occupancy held a steady 75% mark along with a 3rd

consecutive year of rate growth.

The quarter ended March 31st commenced well with the

acquisition of Novotel in Pune in early February 2020,

marking the beginning of a tie up with the Accor Group.

We grew our portfolio to six hotel assets, across seven

brands with 2,554 keys in four key cities in the upscale

to luxury space.

We continue to be cost effective, which is seen in our

operating margins. Your company delivered a healthy

operating margin of 36.1% despite a significant revenue

impact at the end of the year.

An early roll out of ‘No regret action strategy’ have resulted

in sustainable cost efficiencies and maintaining liquidity,

Perspective From The Top

since the start of this crisis. We are reworking one of our

largest cost items, payroll, by rationalising salaries and

numbers to align with business in the near to midterm. Our

other large cost line item of utilities has also contributed to

a downward trend on fixed costs. We have also successfully

renegotiated our AMC and other contracts to achieve

incremental cost savings. Along with these cost savings,

current revenue, cash in books and lines of credit, I am

happy to share that we are reasonably comfortable to meet

our short to midterm cashflow requirements.

The opening of the skies for commercial airlines, bodes well

for the hospitality industry. Further, lifting of restrictions from

key business cities in the country will be critical to quantify

how soon normalcy might return.

Chalet, has played a fundamental role in supporting the

state machinery - with rooms being allocated for medics,

quarantine facilities for asymptomatic travellers, healthy

meals served to the COVID warriors and more. Four out

of six hotels continued to have in-house guests during the

lockdown, including long stay guests, COVID Warriors, and

special circumstance groups. I cannot be more grateful to

my team on the ground who have endured these tough

times providing hospitality services to the guests and going

beyond their line of duty.

We continue to monitor developments on the ground and

look at our strategy with a new lens. In the ‘new normal’ the

nature of demand is likely to change.

Your Company’s development pipeline for new projects in

the hospitality sector has been suitably modified to maintain

positive cash flows and ‘right time’ the projects based on

market dynamics. The proposed Hyatt hotel at Airoli and W

hotel at Powai have been deferred at the moment.

The launch of the proposed Westin hotel at Hyderabad will

be reviewed for opening in the second half of FY 2020-21.

The completion and addition of the 88 rooms and Spa at

Novotel, Pune will be deferred to CY 2021.

Similarly, the new projects pipeline in commercial real estate

space consisting of the commercial tower in Powai, Mumbai

and Bangalore have been staggered over a longer period.

Chalet continues to prepare in multiple ways for the

future - the ‘new normal’ - as we "Reboot, Re-invent

and Race ahead.”

While we keep lines of communication highly active at work

with our teams across locations, we also stay connected with

our customers and key accounts, who play an important

role in our ability to track the nature of demand in the new

normal. As the saying goes, ‘We must reinvent a future,

free of blinders so that we can choose from real options’,

and at Chalet we will evaluate all existing options and tailor

new ones. In the times to come, we believe that standard

conventions may cease to exist, and our values of Agility,

Efficiency and Collaboration will augur well for us.

Your company shall continue to assess the emerging

consumer behaviour and demand drivers thereby and

suitably realign its business strategy with a view to be a

dominant player in the marketplace. The management team

at the hotels continue to proactively engage with their key

stakeholders and guests.

One can expect that new construction across the industry

will be slow over the next 12 - 24 months, as financing is

expected to be constrained, until we see signs of recovery.

With limited supply in the industry, one can expect some

additional tailwinds for the occupancy and rate movement

with the economic recovery.

I must take a moment to thank our colleagues across

the hotels who have borne tough times during the crisis.

Our teams have adapted admirably to new safety and

sanitisation protocols and performed with lean operating

staff, amazing us each day with their heart-warming stories

of resilience and commitment.

Allow me to share some rare good news in such

times. Our Company has recently been certified

as a Great Place to Work by Great Place to Work®

Institute (India) and Ranked 16th in 'India's Great

Mid-size Workspaces'. This recognition comes

as a testament to the team’s effort to constantly

innovate and internalise outstanding human

resource practices.

While these are extraordinarily difficult times, we are certain

that our business model, backed by our Group’s legacy,

and our robust talent pool, is well placed for sustained

long-term growth.

Travel will bounce back, Chalet stands ready to welcome

guests and help them experience outstanding hospitality,

all over again.

My team joins me in thanking you for your

continued support and wish you and your dear ones

good health always.

Yours

recognised in the hospitality industry for sound

The balance between Independent Directors,
