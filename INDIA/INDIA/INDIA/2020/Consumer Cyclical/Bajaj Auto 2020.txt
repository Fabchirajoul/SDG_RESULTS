LETTER:

Letter

8 l BAJAJ AUTO LIMITED

As far as motorcycles were concerned, for the industry as a whole, the average monthly number of

motorcycles billed steadily declined over the four successive quarters of FY2020.

In a milieu of declining demand, your Company has performed well. Here are some key data:

l

Total turnover was H 31,652 crore — a marginal decline of 0.5% from that of the previous year, which

was the Company’s highest turnover ever.

l

Operating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) decreased by 1.0%

to H 5,253 crore — which is your Company’s second highest. Operating EBITDA margin was 17.6% of

net sales and other operating income, versus 17.5% in the previous year.

l

Profit before tax (PBT) before exceptional items grew by 3.4% to H 6,580 crore, which was your

Company’s highest ever. PBT after exceptional items decreased by 1.8% to H 6,580 crore, which was

Bajaj Auto’s second highest PBT in history.

l

Profit after tax (PAT) increased by 9.1% to H 5,100 crore. This was the highest ever PAT.

You will, therefore, agree with me that thanks to unceasing efforts of the Management team and

employees led by your: Managing Director, Rajiv Bajaj, Bajaj Auto has performed very creditably in

battling with the severe demand challenge that the industry faced.

To my mind, the battle may have just begun. The national lockdown on account of COVID-19 has

effectively wiped out 40 days, of which 32 have been in FY2021. With a partial easing of lockdown, our

facilities at Chakan, Waluj and Pantnagar have opened, but are far from working at full pace. In any

event, it would be almost foolhardy to believe that demand will not get affected for at least the first two,

if not three, quarters of FY2021.

We will have to deal with this grave situation in many innovative ways.

We will have to use every lesson learnt in marketing and selling to recreate markets for our bikes and

three-wheelers. We will have to delight our customers with a slew of new products that are on offer.

We are by far India’s largest motorcycle and three-wheeler exporter; even so, we will have to drive

exports even higher. We will have to increase operational efficiencies everywhere. We will have to

eliminate all unnecessary costs. And we will need to do so as a united Bajaj Auto team — all striving in

unison to get back to more business irrespective of the spectre of COVID-19.

Here, I agree with the sentiments echoed in this year’s Management Discussion and Analysis where it is

written “We at Bajaj Auto are confident about our products, our customers and every one of our

employees. A large and profitable company like ours has the financial strength to deal with the

economic impact of this pandemic. We have people who have earned us the distinction of becoming

The World’s Favourite Indian with industry-leading metrics.”

If there is a manufacturing company which can convert this challenge into an opportunity, it is

Bajaj Auto. I look forward to that happening in the course of FY2021, and beyond.

In the meanwhile, stay safe.

With best wishes,

Rahul Bajaj

Managing Director), seven were non-executive independent (including two

women independent directors) and four were non-executive and non-independent, The Board has no

Letter, Management Discussion and Analysis, Corporate Governance and Directors’ Report but does not include the

standalone financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so,

consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the

audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material

misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management for the standalone financial statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation

of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other

comprehensive loss, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally

accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records

in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and

other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable

and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively

for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone

financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a

going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless

Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Key audit matters

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s financial statements (as described in note 42 of the standalone financial statements)

Coronavirus disease 2019 (‘COVID-19’), was declared a global

pandemic by World Health Organisation.

In line with the directions on lockdown issued by the State

Governments of Maharashtra and Uttarakhand, the Company

temporarily suspended the operations of its manufacturing

units at four locations from 23 March 2020 till 31 March 2020;

and subsequently upto further dates as instructed by the

respective State Governments.

COVID-19 has resulted in restriction in movement of goods

during the period from 23 March 2020 till 31 March 2020

impacting normal business operations for the Company

including revenues, receivables, purchases including services

and inventories at the year-end and hence considered key

audit matter.

We have performed the following procedures to assess and evaluate the

impact on financial statements because of business decisions, government

actions or economic environment developments:

l Performed cut-off procedures for a larger sample of invoices during the

lockdown period for both domestic as well as export sales.

l Enquired with the Company on the manner of financial support (if any)

provided to the dealers, vendors and service providers; and their

recognition in the financial statements.

l Enquired with the Company on any information on the liquidity position of

any dealers; and ascertained the need for any additional provisioning for

impairment/credit loss in the financial statements.

l We assessed the disclosures on COVID-19 made in the financial statements.

l Our ability to perform regular audit procedures has been impacted which

has required us in certain cases to perform alternative audit procedures

and exercise significant judgment in respect of the following:

a) Audit and quality control procedures which were earlier performed in

person could not be performed; and hence alternative procedures have

been performed based on inquiries (through phone calls, video calls and

e-mail communications) and review of scanned documentation sent

through e-mails, followed up with sighting with original documents.

b) Year-end inventory observation of inventory counts could not be

performed. However, inventory counts were observed subsequent to

year-end; and rolled back to year-end.:

Independent Auditors‘ Report on the

Consolidated Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) Financial Statements (Contd.)

Key audit matters

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

(a) Impact of COVID-19 on the Holding Company’s financial statements

(as described in note 32 of the consolidated financial statements)

Coronavirus disease 2019 (‘COVID-19’), was declared a global

pandemic by World Health Organisation.

In line with the directions on lockdown issued by the State

Governments of Maharashtra and Uttarakhand, the Holding

Company temporarily suspended the operations of its

manufacturing units at four locations from 23 March 2020 till

31 March 2020; and subsequently upto further dates as

instructed by the respective State Governments.

COVID-19 has resulted in restriction in movement of goods

during the period from 23 March 2020 till 31 March 2020

impacting normal business operations for the Holding Company

including revenues, receivables, purchases including services

and inventories at the year-end and hence considered key

audit matter.

We have performed the following procedures to assess and evaluate the

impact on financial statements because of business decisions, Government

actions or economic environment developments:

l Performed cut-off procedures for a larger sample of invoices during the

lockdown period for both domestic as well as export sales.

l Enquired with the Holding Company on the manner of financial support

(if any) provided to the dealers, vendors and service providers; and their

recognition in the financial statements.

l Enquired with the Holding Company on any information on the liquidity

position of any dealers; and ascertained the need for any additional

provisioning for impairment/credit loss in the financial statements.

l We assessed the disclosures on COVID-19 made in the

financial statements.

l Our ability to perform regular audit procedures has been impacted which

has required us in certain cases to perform alternative audit procedures

and exercise significant judgment in respect of the following:

a) Audit and quality control procedures which were earlier performed in

person could not be performed; and hence alternative procedures have

been performed based on inquiries (through phone calls, video calls and

e-mail communications) and review of scanned documentation sent

through e-mails, followed up with sighting with original documents.

b) Year-end inventory observation of inventory counts could not be

performed. However, inventory counts were observed subsequent to

year-end; and rolled back to year-end.:
