In this annual report, certain statements may be ‘forward-looking statements’ within the

meaning of applicable laws and regulations. These forward-looking statements involve

a number of risks, uncertain ties and other factors that could cause actual results to

differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Important

developments that could affect the Company’s operations include changes in the

industry structure, significant changes in the political and economic environment in

India and overseas, tax laws, import duties, litigation and labour relations.

Lemon Tree Hotels Limited (LTH) will not be in any way responsible for any action taken

based on such statements and undertakes no obligation to publicly update these

forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

containment protocols including continuous sanitization

of surfaces in public areas, social distancing (of people

and seating arrangements), altered food and beverage

service norms, personal hygiene norms like wearing a

mask, sneezing/coughing protocol, use of gloves, etc. This

is implemented within the employee teams, as well as with

hotel guests. We have built the new processes keeping in

mind our core value ‘ensuring the well-being and self-worth

of our colleagues, who are of the utmost importance to us’.

It is imperative for our teams to be motivated and rest

assured that their health and safety are taken care of in

the line of duty, even in these uncertain times.

The business impact of the pandemic on the economy and

specifically on the hospitality and tourism sector continues

to be tremendous. A lockdown means a total lack of

movement within and between cities. With flights, trains

and road travel all coming to a grinding halt, demand

for hotel rooms collapsed. Lemon Tree’s approach is a

two-pronged strategy. First, to bring in revenue from

all segments available in these circumstances. Second,

to re-align and redefine our cost structure – both fixed

and variable costs. Our commitment to ‘maximizing the

efficiency of our processes, to enable us to be the most

cost-effective brand offering the greatest value, which our

customers have every right to expect’ is top of mind at this

time. If the revenue stream is shrinking significantly it

is the company’s responsibility to shrink costs to match

these new revenues and help the company stay net

EBITDA positive. This would mean Lemon Tree’s

stakeholders can rest assured that the risk to their

investment is mitigated to the maximum extent possible,

in the current unprecedented circumstances.

they decline as the population develops herd immunity.

This then arrests and ends the pandemic/epidemic. The

economic recovery and return to normalcy usually takes

2-3 years from the start. In our assessment we feel that

this current pandemic, which has resulted in enormous

short-term destruction of demand may also result in

long term reduction in supply due to hotels permanently

shutting down because of significant operating losses

and/or an inability to service debt obligations. While this

will be a very unfortunate outcome, it would also lead to

a reversal of demand-supply dynamics with a shortage in

surviving supply once demand recovers to pre-Covid19

levels. So while there may be some permanent reduction

in business demand due to increased virtual meetings,

this is more than likely to be matched or even exceeded by

reduction in supply.

Your company is currently channelizing its efforts on

building demand from any and all segments, including

new ones (quarantine guests, health care professionals,

etc.), and on tightly controlling/reducing costs – many of

which will be permanent in nature leading to a permanent

improvement in EBITDA margins once the situation

normalizes. Simultaneously, we are seeking business

development opportunities that are asset light. Hotel

supply is currently shrinking and there are/will be multiple

opportunities to reflag distressed hotels in the next 12

months.

From an industry perspective, 2019 was the best year for

the hospitality industry in the past decade. The occupancy

for branded hotels grew to 69% in 2019 from 67% in

2018 and ADR increased by 4.7% on a like-to-like basis.

This positive trajectory has been temporarily halted by

COVID-19. Going forward, we expect that the demand

segment to first recover will be the retail/online segment,

which has already seen a slight recovery in the last few

months. The MSME sector should recover next. These

two segments normally account for over 50% of your

company’s total revenue. On a broad basis, we expect

domestic travel to recover first (within 9 months) followed

by international travel (after 18 months). This will be

beneficial for your company as nearly 90% of our guests

are domestic.

In FY20, Lemon Tree’s revenue from operations increased

by 21.8% y-o-y from ` 550 crores in FY19 to ` 669 crores

in FY20. The blended ADR increased by 4% from ` 4,180

in FY19 to ` 4,347 in FY20. On the same hotels basis, our

ADR increased by 3.6% from ` 4,179 in FY19 to ` 4,328

in FY20. Our full year blended occupancy stood at 70.3%

as compared to 76.3% in FY19 which was mainly due to

the opening of a large number of new rooms which were

initially at low occupancies. On the same hotels basis,

our occupancy in FY20 stood at 75.0% as compared to

77.6% in FY19, the decline being due to an enormous fall

in occupancy in March 2020. Fees from managed hotels

stood at ` 20 crores in FY20 as compared to ` 17 crores

in FY19. Our cost control focus led to an EBITDA increase

of 21.6% on the old accounting basis from ` 169 crores in

FY19 to ` 205 crores in FY20. Our EBITDA margin remained

flat at about 31%.

Since April 2019, we have added about 2,600 rooms in 26

hotels across 16 cities and now we operate 8,006 rooms

in 80 hotels across 48 cities. With these new hotels, we

have expanded our geographical presence to Amritsar,

Mumbai, Kolkata, Udaipur, Vijawada and Rishikesh in India

and Dubai and Thimpu internationally.

We currently have a strong pipeline of hotels under

development – most of which will be managed hotels i.e.

asset light expansion. In the next 6-9 months, we will open

7 new hotels across 7 cities with ~460 rooms. Based on

our current pipeline, we expect to operate 10,765 rooms

across 109 hotels in 67 cities by the end of a calendar year

2022. This pipeline will constantly increase as we add more

hotels under leased/management contracts in the future.

In June 2020 we raised ` 175 crores in Fleur Hotels Private

Limited, a material subsidiary of our company. Over the

next 18 months and if the situation requires, we may raise

an additional ` 125 crores from our joint venture partner:

APG Strategic Real Estate Pool N.V, the Dutch Pension

Fund Manager. Furthermore, we are also planning to raise

` 100-150 crores in Lemon Tree Hotels Limited through

either a Rights Issue or a Preferential Allotment/Qualified

Institutional Placement. This will improve our liquidity,

strengthen our balance sheet further and help us to easily

tide over this crisis.

Going forward, our focus is to grow asset-light by

expanding our managed hotels portfolio. This will lead

to an expanded network/more choice for our customers,

increased fees and a further distribution of costs, cheaper

sourcing of raw materials and minimal deployment of our

capital. We also intend to continue our asset monetization

and capital recycling efforts to reduce debt and free up

capital.

On behalf of the Board, I thank all our stakeholders

including shareholders, investors, bankers, creditors and

employees for their continued support. I express my

sincere gratitude to all the members of our Board for their

continued insights and invaluable guidance as we explore

new opportunities and move ahead with confidence in this

unprecedented situation.
