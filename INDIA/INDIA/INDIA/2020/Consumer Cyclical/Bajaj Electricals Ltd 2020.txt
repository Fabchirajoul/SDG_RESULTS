to which this financial statement relate till the

date of this Report

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic

COVID-19 has set foot in India and across the globe

and has led the country towards a major slowdown.

This major health crisis has forced governments across

the globe to take unprecedented measures to protect

people’s lives. In a bid to combat the COVID-19 threat,

the nationwide lockdown in India was first announced by

the Government of India on March 24, 2020 which was

further extended in a phased manner.

The lockdown and restrictions imposed on various

activities due to COVID-19 pandemic, while being a

necessary measure to contain its spread, have also

posed unprecedented challenges to all businesses, and

the business operations of the Company have been no

exception to this.

The impact of COVID-19 has been disruptive on the

operations of the Company. With the lockdown in many

States/Union Territories across the country, the supply

chains have been put under stress which has resulted in

loss of business and temporary pressure on cash flows/

liquidity/profitability/margins due to lower collection of

receivables, operating expenses, payment obligations

towards vendors and statutory authorities, etc.

However, the management of the Company is confident

that the business operations will pick up progressively.

Company’s Philosophy on Corporate Governance

The ethical values are the foundation of Company’s

governance philosophy which over the past eight decades

of the Company’s existence has become a part of its

culture. We feel proud to belong to a Company whose

visionary founders laid the foundation stone for good

governance long back and made it an integral principle

of the business. We strongly believe that in business,

there is something more important than just top line

and bottom line and hence, each of us needs to strive

towards producing our very best in all we do, so that, we

not only fulfill the needs of each and every consumer, but

also far exceed their expectations. This is what has set

us apart and this may be the very reason that we have

been able to enjoy a very special relationship with our

consumers. After all, when you strive, with every sinew to

be the best you can be, it will show.

Corporate Governance is about commitment to values

and ethical business conduct. Our actions are governed

by our values and principles, which are reinforced at all

levels within the Company. We are committed to doing

C a s h F l o w S t a t e m e n t:

letter of comfort for all borrowings (long term / short term) taken by its joint

venture, Starlite Lighting Limited (SLL). As on March 31, 2020, the utilised amounts of fund based and non-fund

based facilities were H21,655.14 lakhs and H1,225.30 lakhs respectively. As at March 31, 2020, SLL is in breach of

its loan covenants as per the terms of the loan agreements, resulting in the loans becoming payable on demand.

However, as at the date of approval of these financial statements, the lenders of SLL have not called for the loan

repayment. Management has determined the enterprise value of SLL based on the discounted cash flow projections

for a period of 5 years and a discounting factor of 17.22%. The perpetuity value used in valuation is calculated

under a 2-stage DCF model i.e. high growth phase and mature phase. The 5-year high growth period (FY26 – FY30)

is considered which has contributed H43.95 crore to the enterprise value. Post high growth period, perpetuity sales

growth rate is considered at 3%. The Company is entering into a take or pay agreement with SLL for the revenue

projections considered in the valuation. The enterprise value is greater than the value of the external debt of SLL and

considering the sensitivity around the assumptions used, the exposure in this regard is considered to be ‘possible’

and disclosed as contingent liability (Refer Note 34).

Note 40. Commitments and contingencies (Contd..)

Note 41: Disclosures of revenue from contracts with customers

x.

These represent legal claims filed against the Company by various parties and these matters are in litigation.

Management has assessed that in all these cases the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not

probable.

xi. The Company had in earlier years terminated employment agreements of few die casting workmen at the Chakan

plant. On 3rd July, 2018, the Honourable Hight Court of Bombay had awarded the appeal in favour of the Company.

On 27th June, 2019, the appeal on the matter has been admitted in the Honourable Supreme Court. Management

has assessed that the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable and has accordingly

considered the claim of H258.44 lakhs as contingent liability.

xii. The Company has issued purchase orders to a vendor for procurement of "AB cables and service cables" to its

Madhyanchal (“MVVNL”) and Purvanchal (“PVVNL”) projects site in UP. The vendor being a MSME registered party has

filed the suit under MSMED Act, 2006 claiming interest as well as principal against the Company. Per the suit, vendor

claims to have supplied consignments as per the terms and conditions mentioned in the purchase orders however

payments have not been made by the Company. The management has filed a Statement of Defence and Counter

Claim since the vendor has failed to comply with the terms and conditions in the purchase order (viz. timely supply

of material, supply of the material as per specifications, making good of any short supply of material, providing

replacement of material flagged as not meeting specifications or deficient in quality). Accordingly, the management

has assessed the exposure in this regard to be not probable and disclosed H554.57 lakhs as contingent liability.

xiii. There are numerous interpretative issues relating to the Supreme Court (SC) judgement on Provident Fund dated

28th February, 2019. As a matter of caution, the company has made a provision on a prospective basis from the

date of the SC order. The Company will update its provision, on receiving further clarity on the subject.
