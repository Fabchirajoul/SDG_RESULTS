Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to write to you and present

the Annual Report for FY20.

I hope this: letter finds you safe and

in good health.

As you know, the global auto industry has

grappled with multiple issues during the

year. On one hand, we saw greater clarity

emerge on Brexit; yet on the other hand,

mounting trade tensions, muted global

growth and enhanced regulatory norms

have fundamentally changed the contours

of the business environment in which we

operate. Next came the onset of the COVID-19

pandemic in the final quarter of the year,

which has ushered in a new reality for

industries across the world.

The Indian auto industry faced an

unprecedented year, marked by significant

headwinds. Domestic auto sales declined by

18% Y-o-Y in FY20, the lowest since the data

series was introduced in 2001. Alongside

a broad economic slowdown, regulatory

changes—including changed axle load

norms and the migration to BSVI emission

standards—fuelled uncertainty for both

consumers and suppliers. These challenges

were further exacerbated in the final quarter

of the year by the country’s strict lockdown

measures in response to the pandemic.

Against this volatile macro backdrop, your

Company is charting out a disciplined

path towards a robust and resilient future.

I would like to first address the current

year’s performance, followed by various

transformative initiatives being undertaken.

Tata Motors Limited (TML)

Over the past two financial years,

TML focused on refreshing its portfolio,

improving structural efficiencies and

streamlining internal processes. In doing so,

TML turned a corner and delivered improved

market shares, profitability, and positive free

cash flows. In FY19, we delivered positive net

income of `2,021 crore, after making losses

for five years. In both FY18 and FY19,

TML produced positive free cash flows,

following five years in negative territory.

However, in FY20, this turnaround

journey has been interrupted, as demand

deteriorated sharply on the back of an

abruptly slowing economy coupled with the

spread of COVID-19.

Charting out a disciplined growth path

One of the highlights of

the year was the launch

of the Tata UniEVerse, an

entire electric mobility

ecosystem—from charging

infrastructure, battery

cells, battery packs

and electric motors,

to financing options,

customised for the

needs of electric vehicle

(EV) ownership.

75th Integrated Annual Report 2019-20

Managing Director,

Tata Motors Limited: Dear Shareholders,

I hope this letter finds you in good health.

FY20 was perhaps the most unpredictable

year of the decade for the Indian automotive

industry – entry of new OEMs, slew of

launches from established OEMs, continuing

pressure on liquidity, high fuel prices, revised

axle load norms, mandatory transition to

BSVI norms, plus weak consumer sentiments

that prevailed throughout the year.

Cognisant of the possible rough road ahead,

we started our FY20 journey with a clear

objective to take our turnaround to the next

level by enriching our product portfolio,

accelerating retail sales, enhancing customer

experience and being even more prudent in

managing liquidity and costs.

Building a future-ready product portfolio

Going beyond the necessary technology

upgrade required for the mandatory transition

to BSVI, we unveiled a comprehensive

future-ready product portfolio. This included

the Altroz, India’s first Global New Car

Assessment Programme (Global NCAP)

5-star safety-rated car (a premium hatchback

built on the Alfa platform); refreshed BSVI

Tiago, Tigor, Nexon and Harrier; and new

launches such as the Intra to 55-tonne Prima

in the CV space, with 140+ type approvals

and ~19 engines.

Accelerating retail with ‘Mission Zero’

The mandatory transition to BSVI norms,

effective April 1, 2020, necessitated a

meticulously planned strategy to minimise

BSIV inventory carryover. Our early and

conscious focus on retail sales, against

the industry norm of wholesale, helped us

achieve the target of zero BSIV vehicle stock,

with the retail business recording a 13% jump

over wholesale in PV and 16% in CV.

Delivering superior customer experience

In PV, the upward trend in Net Promotor

Score (NPS) consolidated reiterating an

improved perception of our brand amongst

stakeholders. With the launch of Tata

UniEVerse, a collaboration among Tata

group companies, the EV business unlocked

tremendous underlying potential by bringing

forth the unique strength of each company

to co-create India’s most comprehensive

e-mobility ecosystem.

Prudently managing liquidity and costs

Contribution margins were successfully

maintained despite a change in revenue mix

and overall lower revenues via a rigorous cost

reduction programme. All opportunities to

unlock working capital, capex and receivables

were intensively captured to support

free cash flows.

While we made good progress on the above,

it wasn’t enough to mitigate the overall impact

of the macro environment on our market and

financial performance, further exacerbated

during the last quarter with disruptions

induced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the year, we announced strategic

initiatives to make the organisation

more resilient, agile and future-ready.

Subsidiarisation of the PV business enables

the realisation of its full potential with

mutually beneficial strategic alliances and

better access to products, architectures,

powertrains, new-age technologies and

capital. Reimagining its front end will drive

superior customer experience and improve

market performance. A novel, digital-led

stakeholder engagement programme

underlines the CV business’ endeavour

towards redefining transportation with our

new range of vehicles offering improved total

cost of ownership.

For the immediate, we remain focused

on executing a senior leadership led

comprehensive Business Continuity Plan

(BCP) to manage an effective restart and

ensure the early revival of our ecosystem.

With the safety and well-being of our

employees, customers and partners as the

utmost priority, we have resumed operations

at all our plants after taking the requisite

precautions. We intend to scale in a graded

manner as the entire enabling support

system of suppliers, dealers and customers

comes up to speed.

The demand scenario is expected to remain

uncertain in the aftermath of the COVID-19

pandemic even as the need for safe personal

mobility evolves into a new area of focus.

Accordingly, we continue to build agility

to respond dynamically to the changing

consumer behaviour through closer connect

with our customers.

We are building a profitable roadmap by

reducing the break-evens, improving cash

generation and deleveraging the business.

A cash improvement programme of `6,000

crore (including a cost savings programme

of `1,500 crore) has been called out.

Our refreshed BSVI product portfolio with

customised offerings and enhanced customer

experience will help us improve our market

share. We expect to end FY21 with positive

free cash flows.

Thank you for your continued trust and

commitment to Tata Motors Group.

Dear Shareholders,

This year, Jaguar Land Rover re-imagined

the Land Rover Defender and celebrated

winning a historic treble at the 2019 World

Car of the Year awards with the Jaguar

I-PACE. We are proud to be the UK’s largest

automotive manufacturer, respected across

the world for our outstanding

award-winning products and innovative

customer-focused technologies.

2020 will be remembered for the COVID-19

pandemic, which has devastated lives and

disrupted livelihoods. It is our people who

make us what we are and I would like to thank

everyone at Jaguar Land Rover and the Tata

Motors Group for their outstanding support.

Our performance

Total revenues in FY20 were £23 billion,

with 475,952 wholesale units (excluding

wholesale from our China JV), an EBIT margin

of -0.1% and a loss before tax of £422 million.

Notwithstanding the impact of regulatory

changes, shifting consumer tastes, Brexit and

ongoing trade tensions, during the second

and third quarters, sales for Jaguar and

Land Rover were on a strong and profitable

trajectory, underpinned by the £2.9 billion

of cost and cashflow improvements

achieved through our major transformation

programme, Project Charge. Our decisive

turnaround measures in China resulted in

six months of continued double-digit

Y-o-Y growth.

The unprecedented disruptions caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic inevitably impacted sales

and profitability in the fourth quarter. Despite

the many headwinds, retail sales of our

all-electric Jaguar I-PACE and our all-new

Range Rover Evoque increased Y-o-Y by

40.0% and 24.7%, respectively. In addition,

we sold more of our halo Special Vehicle

products than ever before, with over 9,500

vehicles retailed in FY20, up 64% Y-o-Y.

We have reacted quickly and decisively to

the pandemic, with an accelerated focus

on improving cashflow and strengthening

liquidity to pave the way for long-term EBIT

margin improvement. Charge+, the next

phase of our transformation programme, is

already ahead of schedule, having achieved

£600 million of savings to date against a new

target of over £2 billion of cost improvements

by March 2021.

Our products and innovation

We innovate relentlessly to create exciting

and inherently diverse products with a

compelling combination of British design and

engineering integrity.

This year, our Jaguar XE was updated with

an enhanced exterior and all-new luxurious

interior, focused on new technologies.

Our iconic sports car, the Jaguar F-TYPE,

has also been refreshed.

Our leaps forward in electrification were

evidenced by significant success for the

Panasonic Jaguar Racing team in the

Formula E championship this year.

In November 2019, the ground-breaking

Jaguar I-PACE added the coveted Golden

Steering Wheel to its vast collection of

prestigious awards.

In September 2019, we launched our new

Land Rover Defender to critical acclaim.

It brings the latest advances in technology

and connectivity, plus mild-hybrid and, soon,

plug-in hybrid drivetrains. We have also

expanded our electrified Land Rover line-up

with our latest 1.5 litre, three-cylinder plug-in

hybrid system, now available for Range Rover

Evoque and Land Rover Discovery Sport.

Investing in mobility

Through collaboration and continuous

investment into R&D, we are leading the

transition to connected, seamless and

integrated mobility. Unveiled in February

2020, Project Vector is a physical

representation of our Destination Zero

ambition – an advanced, connected,

autonomy-ready electric vehicle concept

for both public and private mobility.

Our purpose

We are now preparing for a post-virus future

in which private vehicles could play a far

greater role than previously imagined.

We have charted a path towards long-term

sustainable growth, with a lean cost base,

disciplined capital allocation, a highly skilled

workforce and world-class R&D.

Throughout all of this, our purpose will

remain constant; to create experiences

people love for life.

Best regards,

Dr Ralf Speth

Coventry, UK, June 15, 2020

POLICY ON DIRECTORS’ APPOINTMENT AND

The Company’s policy on Directors’ appointment and remuneration and

Integrated Report Statutory Reports > Board’s Report Financial Statements:

Managing Director of the Company, amounting

to `16.48 crores for the financial year, exceeds the prescribed limits

under Section 197 read with Schedule V to the Companies Act, 2013

by ` 11.82 crores.

The management’s response is as follows:

For the year under review, Mr Guenter Butschek, CEO and Managing

Director, was paid managerial remuneration of `16.48 crores, as per

the terms of his appointment for a tenure of 5 years effective February

15, 2016, as agreed with him and also as approved by the members vide

special resolution at the AGM held on August 9, 2016. In furtherance to

the said members’ approval and pursuant to the provisions of Section

197 read with Schedule V of the Act, members’ approval is now being

sought for (a) ratifying the payment of Minimum Remuneration to Mr

Butschek due to losses incurred during the year under review and the

consequent waiver of recovery of a part of the minimum remuneration

that is in excess of the prescribed limit; and (b) for payment of Minimum

Remuneration to Mr Butschek, in case of inadequacy of profits for FY

2020-21. Members attention is drawn to item nos. 4 and 5 of the Notice

of AGM, forming part of the Annual Report.

The Report of the Statutory Auditor forming part of the Annual

Report on Internal Financial Controls, also contains a qualification,

related to preservation of documentary evidence of the input/output

parameters used in extracting system generated reports to validate

the controls over the completeness and accuracy of information

used in the performance of various process level and management

review controls.

Statutory Auditors have considered the material weakness identified in

determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in their

audit of the March 31, 2020, standalone financial statements of the

Company, and the material weakness does not affect their opinion on

the standalone financial statements of the Company.

The management’s response is as follows:

During FY 2019-20, we conducted an assessment of the

effectiveness of the Internal Control over Financial Reporting and

have determined that our Internal Control over Financial Reporting

as at March 31, 2020 is not effective for Tata Motors Limited,

related to preservation of documentary evidence of the input/

output parameters used in extracting system generated reports,

to validate the completeness and accuracy of information used in

various process level and management review controls. These

reports could potentially cause the financial information/disclosure

in the financial statements to be materially misstated if not reviewed

carefully. However, the material weakness did not result in material

misstatements to the annual financial statements.
