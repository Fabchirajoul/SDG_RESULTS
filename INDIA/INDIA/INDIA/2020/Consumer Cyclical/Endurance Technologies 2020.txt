DIVIDEND:

The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on 3rd March,

2020, declared an interim dividend of ` 5.50 per equity

share of ` 10 each (55%) for the financial year 2019-20 and

the same has been paid to all the eligible shareholders as

on record date i.e. 12th March, 2020. Interim dividend paid

shall be considered as final dividend for the year ended 31st

March, 2020. Dividend paid in the previous year was ` 5.50

per equity share of face value of ` 10 each (55%).

The dividend pay-out is in accordance with the Company’s

Dividend Distribution Policy.

Dividend Distribution Policy

This policy is effective from 26th August, 2016 and has been

framed and adopted in terms of Regulation 43A of the SEBI

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,

2015 (“Listing Regulations”). The policy, inter alia, lays down

various parameters relating to declaration/ recommendation

of dividend. There has been no change to the policy during

placed on the Company’s website www.endurancegroup.com

/investor/investor-relations.

COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE:

During the year under review, the Company posted a total

income of ` 49,747.57 million on a standalone basis as

against ` 54,336.82 million in the previous year. The total

income on a consolidated basis was ` 69,653.04 million

compared to ` 75,375.45 million in the previous year. The

Company’s total income on standalone and consolidated basis

de-grew by 8.4% and 7.6%, respectively. This primarily was

on account of negative growth by automotive industry followed

by the nationwide lockdown in March 2020 due to COvID-19

pandemic. Despite a challenging market environment, the

Company recorded a ‘better than industry’ performance.

The profit after tax, however, increased significantly by

19.5% in the financial year 2019-20 at ` 4,276.92 million

as against ` 3,578.61 million in the previous year, on

standalone basis; while consolidated profit after tax grew by

14.2% at ` 5,655.34 million as against ` 4,950.06 million

in the previous year. In spite of de-growth in the automobile:
