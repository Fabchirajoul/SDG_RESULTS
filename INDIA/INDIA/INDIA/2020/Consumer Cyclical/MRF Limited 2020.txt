S DHANVANTH KUMAR

29th June, 2020

Company Secretary:

Dear Shareholders,

We are passing through the most disruptive and uncertain times in modern human history. The world is enveloped by Covid-19

and no country is free from this pandemic and the resultant economic crisis has aggravated the global community’s hardship.

However, I have no doubt India and the world economy will emerge stronger and bounce back quickly and I also strongly believe

that every adversity presents multiple new opportunities.

The work culture has changed dramatically across all industries. The tyre industry is also riding this wave of change.

It has been two months since the Government lifted the lockdown and we are still finding our way to establishing economic

levels of production. We have had to deal with Covid-19 cases in our manufacturing plants from time to time and this has

affected our production momentum.

Fortunately, the demand for tyres, particularly from the Farm and Commercial Sector has not been affected much and we are

able to cater to these market segments. The Government’s initiative, prohibiting the import of tyres is a welcome relief, as it will

definitely alleviate our problem to a great extent.

The forecast of a normal monsoon and its timely onset has boosted the expectations of a bumper crop output and this augurs

well for the rural economy. This can strengthen rural income and demand, which will see a spurt in demand for two-wheelers

and tractors. Thus, a recovery in the rural economy will be a relief to the Indian tyre industry.

Currently, the automobile industry is also passing through tough times as the demand for four wheelers and two wheelers is at

an unprecedented low. The industry has moved to BS VI vehicles which are slowly getting absorbed in the market. We are

expecting to see a fair growth in demand for vehicles, and I am sure that the automobile industry will come out of this slump with

reasonable growth in the near future.

MRF has registered a total income of Rs.16322 Crores for the year ended 31st March 2020. This year marks the 33rd year since

your Company has become the market leader in India. MRF is focused on strengthening its position through this period of

uncertainty with uncompromising emphasis on quality, as it has been one of the major factors helping us take a leadership

position in the industry in almost all the segments of the market.

We will continue to pursue this path so that MRF Tyres always remains every customer’s first choice.

I would like to thank the shareholders, investors, Central and State Governments, lenders, suppliers and customers for their

consistent and resolute support. I thank all my colleagues on the Board for guiding the company during this crucial phase with

their insights, support and encouragement.

Please keep safe and stay healthy.

Best wishes.
