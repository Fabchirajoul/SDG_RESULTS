JBM AUTO LIMITED

Annual Report 2019-20:

LETTER FROM

THE CHAIRMAN’S DESK: Dear Shareholders,

As we conclude another financial year at JBM Auto Limited, it is my pleasure to present

my thoughts to you at the 24th Annual General Meeting of your company.

Over the past few months, we have been deliberating on the sudden shift that the

world has been subjected to due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such unprecedented times

have completely crippled the economies, health systems and industries. For the first

time ever, most part of the world including our country came to a standstill for many

months together. However, unprecedented times bring forth plethora of opportunities

and necessitates fighter’s spirit.

The current scenario has led to emergence of many such opportunities, redefined

skill sets and led to wider adaptation of virtual and digital aspects of working, thereby

evolving to a ‘New Normal’. Businesses and individuals alike have had to adapt rapidly

to cope with uncertainty and anxiety in a seemingly unending ordeal. And yet, the world

endures. The new initiatives and call to action by our Honourable Prime Minister for

Atma Nirbhar Bharat, Vocal for Local and Digital India will boost in the speedy revival

of our economy but the success surely lies in the robust implementation and collective

efforts & commitment of each citizen towards this national call.

The Government had announced a stimulus package of Rs. 20 lakh crores for the revival

of the economy and to support the various business sectors. This timely relief package

has shown some positive results as macro-economic indicators such as manufacturing

PMI, auto sales, railway freight etc. have significantly improved in the month of August

2020. However, the auto sector is reeling under severe slowdown for the last two years

and needs specific government support to ensure revival. Further in this direction, the

industry has made requests to the Government to consider reduction in the GST rate

and an early implementation of the scrappage policy. Moreover, the recent Electric

Vehicle policy related announcements by various states have initiated setting the right

momentum towards accelerating the adoption rate of EVs in India.

At this juncture, it is imperative to quote the Automotive Mission Plan (AMP) 2026

which directs the Indian Automobile Industry to be a front runner in the Make In India

programme, as it is amongst the foremost drivers of the country’s manufacturing sector.

Over the next decade, the Indian automotive sector is likely to contribute in excess of

12% of the country’s GDP and comprise more than 40% of its manufacturing sector. The

AMP envisages that the Indian Automotive Industry will grow 3.5-4 times in value from

its current output of around Rs 4,64,000 cr to about Rs. 16,16,000 – Rs. 18,88,500 cr by

2026, thereby, constituting almost 50% of the total manufacturing GDP.

At JBM Auto Limited, with a clear intent towards making your company agile during this

time, we have taken rapid strides towards incorporating latest technology to reduce

redundancy of tasks & processes and upskilling manpower to enhance productivity.

We are moving very swiftly towards incorporating Artificial Intelligence and Machine

Learning across our manufacturing facilities that has resulted not only in a smoother

resumption of operations post the lockdown, but also ensured in sustaining a safe and

healthy working environment.

Representatives and information available on the websites of the company, Bombay Stock Exchange/ National Stock

have obtained are sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

3.

We have not verified the correctness and appropriateness of financial records and Books of Accounts of the Company. We
