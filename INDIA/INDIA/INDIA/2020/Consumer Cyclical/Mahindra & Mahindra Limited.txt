Economic activity remained largely subdued and tighter

financial conditions impinged upon activity. The second

advance estimates released in February, 2020 implied

real GDP growth of 4.7% for the fourth quarter of the

Financial Year 2020 within the annual estimate of 5%

for the year as a whole.

However, this is now at risk from the COVID-19 pandemic’s

impact on the economy. High frequency indicators suggest

that private final consumption expenditure has been

hit hardest, even as gross fixed capital formation has

been in contraction since the second quarter of the

Board’s Report

Financial Year 2020. On the supply side, the outlook for

agriculture and allied activities appears to be the only

silver lining, with foodgrains output at 292 million

tonnes. Meanwhile, most of the service sector indicators

in January-March, 2020 moderated or declined. Anecdotal

evidence suggests that several services such as trade,

tourism, airlines, the hospitality sector and construction

have been further adversely impacted by the COVID-19.

Due to overall slowdown in auto industry leading to

lower sales during the Financial Year 2019-20 followed by

abrupt closure of business activities from 25th March, 2020

due to COVID-19 lockdown, your Company recorded

a decrease of 15.2% in revenue from operations at

Rs. 45,488 crores in the year under review as against

Rs. 53,614 crores in the previous year.

The Profit for the year before Depreciation, Finance Costs,

Exceptional items and Taxation recorded a decrease of

10.4% at Rs. 7,466 crores as against Rs. 8,328 crores in

the previous year. Profit after tax decreased by 72.3%

at Rs. 1,331 crores as against Rs. 4,796 crores in the

previous year.

Your

Company

continues

with

its

rigorous

cost

restructuring exercises and efficiency improvements

which have resulted in significant savings through

continued focus on cost controls, process efficiencies and

product innovations that exceed customer expectations

in all areas thereby enabling the Company to maintain

profitable growth in the current economic scenario.

Details of Material Changes from the end of the Financial

Year till the date of this Report

The rampant spread of COVID-19 outbreak, across borders

and geographies, has severely impacted almost the whole

world and triggered significant downside risks to the

overall global economic outlook. Due to the lockdown

announced by the Government of India from 25th March,

2020, entire operations of the Company came to a halt.

The lockdowns and restrictions imposed on various

activities due to the pandemic have posed challenges to

all the businesses of your Company and its Subsidiaries.

Though it is difficult to predict any demand scenario

for the immediate short term, the Company expects

the Tractor demand to show good improvement on

the back of several positive factors such as record:
