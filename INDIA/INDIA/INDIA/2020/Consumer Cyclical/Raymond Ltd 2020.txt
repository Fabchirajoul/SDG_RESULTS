Managing Director’s Message: Dear Shareholders,

Living with an old adage – ‘never waste a crisis’

is a reality now as the human race globally is

struggling to come to terms with the new normal

after the unprecedented devastation caused

by the COVID-19 pandemic. The immediate

impact of this pandemic and its aftermath, which

is yet to be fully seen has derailed the entire

economy and human life. It is posing serious

existential questions that needs thorough

introspection, logical re-calibration and prudent

decisions to ensure long-term sustainability of

organisations and its stakeholders. In the current

context, organisations have to be intensely

future-oriented and we remain focused on

our long-term strategy.

Today, many organisations are frozen with

fear, doubt, and lack of clarity; rebooting an

organisation isn’t easy as it requires a lot of

self-belief and creating new ways of doing things

that also brings in fear of change and the fear

of new. It is our passion for excellence that has

propelled us to navigate numerous storms in our

95 year old existence and today we have arrived

at a new dawn in our Raymond story. This new

beginning assumes even more significance as

organisations reinvent themselves to reinstate

their relevance to consumers in the new normal.

Value creation for new-age Raymond

We were on sail through the major part of

FY2019-20 and delivered on our commitment

of value creation for our shareholders when we

announced the demerger of Lifestyle Business,

our foray into Real Estate business as the new

core and consolidating our FMCG business under

Raymond Consumer Care.

In the current context,

organisations have to be

intensely future-oriented

and we remain focused on

our long-term strategy

Managing Director’s Message

Over the course of the year as planned,

we took prudent measures to leverage

value through asset monetisation of

the 20-acre land sale deal to Virtuous

Retail. Additionally, Raymond’s foray

into Realty segment to create an

aspirational township of smart housing

has also received a positive response

with a considerable inventory being sold.

We have been delivering consistently

on our committed plan of enhancing

shareholder value through the proposed

demerger to be executed in the due

course of time. This will enable us to

unlock the potential of the Lifestyle

Business through a new listed entity with

existing business of Branded Textile,

Branded Apparel & Garmenting. As we

continue to build capacities for enhanced

performance and delivery across verticals,

demerging the core Lifestyle Business is

an affirmative step that will also simplify

the Group structure.

In our endeavour to battle the COVID-19

pandemic, Raymond has launched an

exhaustive range of Personal Protective

Equipment (PPE) offerings. We are using

garmenting factory in Bengaluru to

manufacture PPE products (including

masks and suits) which are currently

being supplied to government, hospitals

and other institutions. Additionally, our

FMCG business was quick to respond

and launched a slew of personal hygiene

products as well as skin friendly hand

sanitizers and cleansers as a part of

Raymond Care initiative.

The Phygital World

As Indian economy is gradually

opening up, we have started

re-opening our stores. I am happy

to share with you that over 1,000

Raymond stores are now open for

business. It is also heartening to see

that our loyal customers are waiting

for our shops to resume business.

The current pandemic has rewritten

the rules for business with consumer

behaviour changing by the day

led by the growing thrust on digital.

At Raymond, we have accelerated

our pace of digital adoption and will

be moving our channel and trade

partners extensively onto digital

platforms for trade bookings and

other related activities. Our new

digital infrastructure will lend us the

competitive advantage to have a

unified view of our inventory and will

enable us to service our consumers

across the length and breadth of the

country through omni-channel. As the

fashion industry is going ‘Phygital’,

Raymond is committed to create

delightful consumer experiences both

in the online and offline world.

Make in India 2.0

Post COVID-19, as the clamour for the

global manufacturing supply chain

to move away from China is getting

louder by the day, this is an opportune

moment for India. Unlike our global

counterparts, India is well positioned

to emerge stronger than ever if it

seizes the opportunity to become the

We are once again geared up to manoeuvre

through the tough times with our renewed

agility and our core strengths along with our

deep rooted values of Quality, Trust and Excellence

It is our passion for excellence that has

propelled us to navigate numerous storms in

our 95 year old existence and today we have

arrived at a new dawn in our Raymond story

preferred manufacturing destination.

Our strong capabilities across the

production lifecycle including easy

access to raw materials, human capital

and state-of-the-art manufacturing

facilities makes the Indian economy

more resilient than others. India is the

second-largest producer and exporter

of textiles after China and the

fourth-largest producer and exporter

of apparel after China, Bangladesh and

Vietnam. There is ample headroom for

growth and Indian manufacturing is

in a bright spot, more so for the textile

and apparel industry.

Being a proponent of self-reliance,

Raymond has always followed the

‘Atmanirbhar philosophy’ since its

inception in 1925. We pride upon

creating many firsts and are relentless

in our pursuit to offer world-class

quality products and crafting delightful

retail experiences for our consumers.

We are once again geared up to

manouevre through the tough times

with our renewed agility and our core

strengths along with our deep rooted

values of Quality, Trust and Excellence.

As I conclude my message for this

Annual Report about Raymond as

we know it, I look forward to the same

support for Raymond Lifestyle Business

– the new de-merged entity.

With the dawn of a new era,

bright future beckons Raymond!

Gautam Hari Singhania

Chairman and: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

With this Annual Report, a new chapter will

be written in the history of Raymond Group

as it documents biggest milestones in its

glorious journey of 95 years. This fiscal

witnessed affirmative corporate actions

for deleveraging balance sheet, unlocking

potential and value creation for shareholders

as we announced to create Lifestyle Business

into a separate listed entity through

demerger along with the sale of a land

parcel of an associate company in Thane.

Our foray into Real Estate business coupled

with the consolidation of FMCG business are

the hallmarks of the year gone by.

However, FY19-20 also had a fair share of

blips and witnessed one of worst economic

adversities known to mankind before it

ended with a complete lockdown of the

economic activities both nationally and

internationally. The year witnessed a subdued

consumer demand and trade channels were

impacted by passive consumer sentiments

and an overall liquidity crunch. At retail level,

domestic consumption remained sluggish

due to muted rural sentiments and low urban

demand. Festivals and wedding season

witnessed momentary phases of optimism

which eventually faded with the bitter reality

of aggressive discounting by the industry

to drive sales.

This fiscal witnessed affirmative corporate

actions for deleveraging balance sheet,

un-locking potential and value creation

for shareholders

The fag end of FY19-20 brought a

‘Black Swan event’ which witnessed a

nationwide lockdown imposed during last

fortnight of March thereby severely affecting

performance of all our businesses. With the

lockdown in-line with government guidelines,

all retail stores were shut along with

manufacturing facilities and offices. The entire

supply chain was impacted as dispatches to

the wholesale channel, The Raymond Store

(TRS) and Multi-Brand-Outlet (MBO) were

stalled. The garment export dispatches were

deferred due to retail shutdown in US &

European markets. The high primary sales

on account of a good weeding season from

April to June 2020 was completely washed out

due to lockdown.

In addition to COVID-19, the performance

was also affected by a planned trade

channel stock correction in Branded Apparel

in terms of long-term steps to align primary

sales to secondary channel sales. The need

for action was identified during preceding

quarters and we extended support to

channel partners for liquidation of stock to

clear the pipeline.

FY19-20 Performance overview

(Pre IND AS 116)

Consolidated revenues marginally declined

by 2% to ` 6,571 crores. EBITDA Margin was

at 6.7% vs 10.5% in PY. Net Profit for the year

was ` 202 crores, higher by 20% vs PY which

included exceptional items such as profit from

sale of land in associate company and others.

Our performance was impacted mainly in the

fourth quarter due to the impact of COVID-19

that resulted in topline loss of ` 414 crores

and ` 134 crores at EBITDA level. The impact

of planned trade channel stock correction in

Branded Apparel on topline has been ` 209

crores and EBITDA by ` 106 crores.

Excluding these impacts, the underlying

performance would have been:

Revenues for FY2019-20 would have been

higher by 7% at ` 7,194 crores and EBITDA

margins at 9.5%.

y

In the flagship Branded Textile segment,

the underlying topline was stable

compared to last year due to subdued

retail consumption throughout the year.

While volumes were impacted in wholesale

channel, TRS channel witnessed growth

driven by channel expansion and higher

sale of combo packs. The underlying

EBITDA margin expanded to 14.9% vs

13.8% in PY due to lower wool price,

increased pricing in suiting business &

better product mix and lower discretionary

spends in the shirting business

y

Branded Apparel segment was impacted

due to stock correction in trade channels.

However, there was a strong growth in

retail channels of Exclusive Brand Outlets

(EBO) and Large Format Stores (LFS) with

increased penetration, we also continued

with our stated strategy of asset-light

expansion of stores through franchisee

model. Ethnix, which was launched last

year, was well accepted by our customers

across segments. Underlying EBITDA

margins were lower at 2.7% vs 3.7% in PY

mainly due to higher discounting

y

Garmenting segment delivered

strong underlying topline growth of

12% with EBITDA margins at 4.3%

vs 5.1% in PY. Topline growth was

led by increased exports to US and

Japan along with improved capacity

utilisation in the Ethiopian facility.

The B2B Made-to-Measure (MTM)

services launched last year is gaining

strong traction and has a significant

potential to grow.:

letter (containing salient terms of agreement to sell) is

executed. The period over which revenue is recognised

is based on entity’s right to payment for performance

completed. In determining whether an entity has right

to payment, the entity shall consider whether it would

have an enforceable right to demand or retain payment

for performance completed to date if the contract were to

be terminated before completion for reasons other than

entity’s failure to perform as per the terms of the contract.

The revenue recognition of Real estate property under

development requires forecasts to be made of total

budgeted costs with the outcomes of underlying

construction contracts, which further require assessments

and judgements to be made on changes in work scopes

and other payments to the extent they are probable and

they are capable of being reliably measured. However,

where the total project cost is estimated to exceed

total revenues from the project, the loss is recognized

immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Revenue in excess of invoicing are classified as contract

asset while invoicing in excess of revenues are classified

as contract liabilities.

Other operating revenue - Export incentives

Export Incentives under various schemes are accounted

in the year of export.:

Mumbai, 29th June, 2020:

managing director, all of

them constitute as chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’).

(o) Borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at net of transaction costs

incurred and measured at amortised cost. Any difference between

the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption

amount is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and

Loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest

method.

Preference shares, which are mandatorily redeemable on a

specific date are classified as liabilities. The dividend on these

preference shares is recognised in Consolidated Statement of

Profit and Loss as finance costs.

(p) Borrowing costs

Interest and other borrowing costs attributable to qualifying

assets are capitalised. Other interest and borrowing costs are

charged to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

(q) Provisions and contingent liabilities

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or

constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that

an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation

and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not

recognised for future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s

best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present

obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate

used to determine the present value is a pre tax rate that reflects

current market assessments of the time value of money and the

risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to

the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

Contingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect of possible

obligations that arise from past events but their existence will

be confirmed by the occurrence or non occurrence of one or

more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the

Company or where any present obligation cannot be measured in

terms of future outflow of resources or where a reliable estimate

of the obligation cannot be made.

A contingent asset is disclosed, where an inflow of economic

benefits is probable. The Group shall not recognize a contingent

asset unless the recovery is virtually certain.

(r) Revenue recognition

The Group derives revenues primarily from sale of manufactured

goods, traded goods and related services. The Group has also

engaged in real estate property development.

Revenue is recognized on satisfaction of performance obligation

upon transfer of control of promised products or services to

customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we

expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the

consideration, adjusted to discounts, incentives and returns, etc.,

if any.

The Group operates a loyalty programme for the customers and

franchisees of the Group for the sale of goods. The customers

accumulate points for purchases made which entitles them to

discount on future purchases. A contract liability for the award

points is recognized at the time of the sale. Revenue is recognized

when the points are redeemed or on expiry. The expenditure of

loyalty programme is netted-off to revenue.

The Group recognises provision for sales return, based on the

historical results, measured on net basis of the margin of the sale.

Therefore, a refund liability, included in other current liabilities, are

recognized for the products expected to be returned.

The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the

period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to

the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As

a consequence, it does not adjust any of the transaction prices for

the time value of money.

The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognises

revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:

1.

The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the

benefits provided by the Group’s performance as the

Group performs; or

2.

The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset

that the customer controls as the asset is created or

enhanced; or

3.

The Group’s performance does not create an asset

with an alternative use to the Group and an entity

has an enforceable right to payment for performance

completed to date.:

letter (containing salient terms of

agreement to sell) is executed. The period over which revenue

is recognised is based on right to payment for performance

completed. In determining whether an entity has right to

payment, the entity shall consider whether it would have an

enforceable right to demand or retain payment for performance

completed to date if the contract were to be terminated before

completion for reasons other than entity’s failure to perform as

per the terms of the contract.

The revenue recognition of Real estate property under

development requires forecasts to be made of total budgeted

costs with the outcomes of underlying construction contracts,

which further require assessments and judgements to be

made on changes in work scopes and other payments to the

extent they are probable and they are capable of being reliably

measured. However, where the total project cost is estimated to

exceed total revenues from the project, the loss is recognized

immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Revenue in excess of invoicing are classified as contract asset

while invoicing in excess of revenues are classified as contract

liabilities.

Other operating revenue - Export incentives

Export Incentives under various schemes are accounted in the

year of export.

(s) Employee benefits

(i) Short-term obligations

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary

benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12

months after the end of the period in which the employees

render the related service are recognised in respect of

employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period

and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid

when the liabilities are settled.

(ii) Other long-term employee benefit obligations

The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave that are

not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months are

measured as the present value of expected future payments

to be made in respect of services provided by employees

up to the end of the reporting period using the projected

unit credit method. The benefits are discounted using the

discount rates for Government Securities (G-Sec) at the end

of the reporting period that have terms approximating to

the terms of the related obligation. Remeasurements as a

result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial

assumptions are recognised in the Consolidated Statement

of Profit and Loss.

(iii) Post-employment obligations

The Group operates the following post-employment

schemes:

(a) defined benefit plans such as gratuity and pension;

and

(b) defined contribution plans such as provident fund.

Pension and Gratuity obligations

The liability or asset recognised in the Consolidated Balance

Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension and gratuity

plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation

at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan

assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually

by actuaries using the projected unit credit method.

The present value of the defined benefit obligation is

determined by discounting the estimated future cash

outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the

reporting period on government bonds that have terms

approximating to the terms of the related obligation.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount

rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation

and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in

employee benefit expense in the Consolidated Statement

of Profit and Loss.

Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience

adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are

recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in

other comprehensive income. They are included in retained

earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in

Equity and in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Defined Contribution Plans

Defined Contribution Plans such as Provident Fund etc.,

are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit

and Loss as incurred. Further for certain employees, the

monthly contribution for Provident Fund is made to a Trust

administered by the Group. The interest payable by the Trust

is notified by the Government. The Group has an obligation

to make good the shortfall, if any.

Termination benefits

Termination benefits are payable when employment is

terminated by the Group before the normal retirement

date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy

in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises

termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates:

(a) when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of:

letter of credit and overdraft facility.
