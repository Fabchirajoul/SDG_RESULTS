Message from the Chairman

and: Managing

MANAGING DIRECTOR

A reflection of robust fundamentals: Dear Stakeholders,

I am proud to present to you PEPL’s

Annual Report for FY 2019-20.

Our performance during the year under

review was outstanding and this would

have been an occasion for celebration,

had it not been for the risk and

uncertainty of the environment.

In this context, it is pertinent to

mention that we are observing all

safety protocols mandated by the

Government of India, state governments

and local authorities. We stand

together with the nation in fighting

the pandemic and extending support

in our own capacity, in this hour of

need. During the nationwide lockdown,

when safety and access to food were

of utmost importance, we collaborated

with various local authorities to help

vulnerable families across Bengaluru,

Hyderabad, Chennai, Kochi and Mysuru.

Through the Prestige Foundation,

the Group provided over 2.2 million

cooked meals and dry ration to daily

labourers and migrant workers across

these regions.

THE YEAR AT PRESTIGE

The Indian real estate sector has

witnessed a series of structural reforms

in the past few years, including the

implementation of Goods and Services

Tax (GST), ban on subvention schemes,

and, above all, the establishment

of Real Estate Regulatory Authority

(RERA). Although these measures have

instilled the much-needed transparency,

accountability and fiscal discipline,

together with the liquidity crunch they

have, tempered the growth in the sector.

The sector, which is projected to grow

to US$ 1,000 billion by 2030 and is the

second largest employment generator

in the country, was seeing some uptrend

when the pandemic struck.

There is no doubt that FY 2019-20

proved to be a challenging year for us

as well, but we remained steadfast and

knew where we were headed, even as

we navigated choppy waters.

The macro trends were not encouraging,

with consumer spend down and the

worldwide economic and political

turbulence adversely impacting the

mood at home as well. However, thanks

to our professionalism and sound

business ethics, we delivered projects on

time, gunned for large scale launches,

expanded our operations across the

country and successfully raised capital

from the market to strengthen our

liquidity buffer.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS

Several high points characterised

this year for Prestige. We recorded

the highest number of launches

and completions this year, totalling

17.12 mn sq.ft. and 19.32 mn sq. ft.,

respectively, surpassing our annual

guidance. Further, we have 57 mn sq. ft.

across 38 projects under planning across

key micro-markets of Bengaluru,

Mumbai, Noida, Hyderabad and Chennai.

We undertook several value-accretive

deals and acquisitions. To further

strengthen our annuity income portfolio

and our market share in the retail sector,

we bought out our JV partner’s share in

one of the most successful and popular

malls, Forum Sujana Mall, in Hyderabad.

In line with our growth strategy, we

continued to strengthen our presence

in key cities, while foraying into new

markets in Mumbai, Pune and NCR.

We are also developing commercial

complexes in the prime locations of

Mumbai at BKC (Bandra Kurla Complex)

and Worli, and a mixed-use development

in Aerocity, New Delhi.

To deepen our footprint in Mumbai,

we partnered with the New

Consolidated Construction Company

(NCCL) to jointly develop a residential

project at Byculla, South Mumbai.

In addition, we entered NCR and are

developing a residential complex at

Sector 150, Noida.

Our eyes are firmly trained on the

southern market as well. We have

increased our stake in special purpose

vehicle (SPV) which was holding a

prime land at Kokapet in Hyderabad for

mixed-use development – a large office

space and residential complex.

These transactions were in line with

our strategy to drive steady and

focused acquisition while capitalising

on consolidation opportunities. We are

leveraging our expertise for a wide

range of real-estate developments

across key locations in India.

LOOKING FORWARD WITH

CONFIDENCE

Undoubtedly, the pandemic has

significantly impacted the retail and

hospitality sector. But I will look at it as

a temporary pause, not a break in our

momentum. We have a well-diversified

portfolio, which helps us balance any

unprecedented downturn. We have

long-term leases in our commercial

and property management segments,

and sales in the residential segment

are fast picking up. Besides, we have

a long launch pipeline that will help

recoup sales and collection figures.

Reforms such as RERA have been, in

fact, beneficial for the sector, and led

to greater consolidation favouring

established builders like us. They also

result in reduced construction costs in

the long term and thus reduced property

costs and project delays, and revived

demand for well-executed projects.

We are leveraging our

expertise for a wide

range of real-estate

developments across

key locations in India.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

Managing Director

ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20:

Dear Stakeholders,

Greetings from all of us at Prestige!

We wish you good health and do hope

and pray that we all will soon emerge on

the other side of these turbulent times.

Admittedly, the pandemic has deeply

impacted lives, livelihoods, economies

and businesses worldwide. In such

testing times, we are consistently

sharpening our focus and stepping up

our commitment levels to ensure that

our customers, employees, business

partners and the community have full

access to our services and can count on

us for any help and support they require.

The evolving scenario merits responses

on several planes. First, urgent action

to help those most in need. Second,

embrace the new normal, where we

must challenge old assumptions and

adopt more efficient and empathetic

ways of operating. Third, look at new

opportunities and possibilities of

bringing in systemic and structural

changes to make major differences.

Through the concerted efforts of our

management team, employees, and

partners, we are demonstrating both

energy and resilience to power through

this period of uncertainty.

Now coming to our performance, frankly

speaking, it has been an exhilarating

year for us. We have performed

well across all our segments in all

relevant metrics. FY 2019-20 saw the

deep reservoirs of our resilience, the

consistent strength of our performance

and the spirit of our teamwork.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS

Now deep diving into the financials,

the high water mark was the raising

of `8,995 million from the market that

brought down our gearing to 1.46.

Our revenue stood at `82,433 million,

unique set of interventions. The Group’s

focus will remain on creating value and

setting new benchmarks across different

business verticals. The markets now

are in a flux and we see consolidation

playing out in favour of the established

players who are able to perform.

We do acknowledge the

fact that the scenario

is dynamic and have

put in place a sound

contingency plan to tide

over the crisis. We remain

committed to living up to

the promise and potential

of our brand, and creating

lasting value for all

stakeholders.

Best regards,

Venkat K. Narayana

Chief Executive Officer

the highest ever since inception.

Our EBITDA registered a significant

increase to `24,745 million with a

30.02% margin and PAT at `5,486

million, registering a 6.66% margin.

We see strong revenue visibility for

several years, as our unrecognised

revenue levels are robust. We reached

another important milestone with our

collections, which stood at `46,756

million; our pre-sales figure touched

`45,607 million, the highest in the last

five years, reflecting a favourable market

sentiment despite the overall slowdown

in the real estate sector.

Our exit rentals crossed the

`10,000 million mark for the first

time and we continue to build the

portfolio. In the residential space, we

have 28 ongoing projects totalling

31.50 mn sq. ft. total developable

area (TDA) and 17 upcoming projects

totalling 30.71 mn sq. ft. TDA. We would

not have been able to achieve this feat

without the trust that our stakeholders

and customers repose in us. It is owing

to this that our launches have drawn

such interest and we have recorded

remarkable pre-sales figures.

PATHWAYS OF OPTIMISM

In the year ahead, we will be looking

forward to building on these solid

achievements. Of course, adjustments

will need to be made sector-wise, and

even city-wise because the dynamics

of the market is different for each city,

and each sector will need its own

ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20:

Managing Director

At a time when the Government of India

is doing its utmost to care for the people

of the country, it is expected of India Inc.

to come forward and join the efforts.

The Prestige Group, working through

the Prestige Foundation, provided meals

and provisions to daily wage labourers,

underprivileged children and the needy

across the cities of Bengaluru, Chennai,

Hyderabad, Kochi and Mysuru daily since

the beginning of the first lockdown in

March 2020.

Realising that the sections in immediate

need were the daily wagers, we began

distributing provisions to all our labour

colonies across India that included food

and stationery items such as soaps.

We also reached out to families and

communities in and around Bengaluru.

Starting March 2020, we have delivered

monthly provisions to over 19,000

families, as well as to hospitals,

churches and orphanages. We have

already served close to 2.2 million meals

and dry rations that included rice, dal,

milk powder, vegetables, egg, cooking

oil, biscuits and soap, among others.

We continue to provide meals and

rations to 20,000+ daily wage workers,

underprivileged children and others in

Bengaluru. We have deployed a team

to ensure that the most hygienic and

nutritious meals are prepared in-house

and delivered efficiently to our target

citizens. The aim is to successfully

widen our intervention with time.

We are providing the same services

to daily wagers at our labour colonies

across India.

To amplify our efforts and reach, we

also set up a 24-hour national helpline

to get in touch with anyone in dire

need. Considering India’s population

density and undeniable economic

inequality, we believe it is our civic duty

to fill in the gaps.
