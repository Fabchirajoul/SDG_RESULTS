Forward-Looking Statement

In this annual report, we have disclosed forward looking information to enable

investors to comprehend our prospects and take informed investment decisions.

This report and other statements – written and oral – that we periodically

make, may contain forward-looking statements that set out anticipated results

based on the management’s plans and assumptions. We have tried wherever

possible to identify such statements by using words such as ‘anticipates’,

‘estimates’, ‘expects’, ‘projects’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’ and words of similar

substance in connection with any discussion of future performance. While

these forward looking statements indicate our assessment and future

expectations concerning the development of our business, a number of

risks, uncertainties, inaccurate assumptions and other unknown factors

could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from

our expectations.

These factors include, but are not limited to, general market, macro-

economic, governmental and regulatory trends, movements in

currency exchange and interest rates, competitive pressures,

technological developments, changes in the financial conditions

of third parties dealing with us, legislative developments, and

other key factors that could affect our business and financial

performance.

Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize,

or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual

results could vary materially from those anticipated,

estimated or projected. We undertake no obligation

to publicly update any forward-looking statements,

whether as a result of new information, future events

or otherwise.:

managing direCtor: dear stakeholders and

friends of redington

Even as I gather myself to pen down this

annual address to you, which I consider

amongst my great privileges, the human

populace is experiencing an existential crisis.

Over 13 million human beings have been

directly infected so far and more than half a

million precious lives have been lost due to the

deadly COVID-19 pandemic and these numbers

are increasing every day. Please join me in my

prayers for peace to the departed souls and for

the health and safety of every person on this planet,

that we call our home. I beseech the Almighty for

his blessings towards complete safety and continuing

good health of the entire Redington family, of which

you and your loved ones form an integral part.

The game of cricket being a religion of sorts for most

Indians, we have often seen a contest turning on its

head within a couple of deliveries. as the fi scal 2019-20

was drawing towards its closure, we witnessed our world

changing beyond recognition in just a few weeks. Cities

after cities, across countries and continents, were forced to

confi ne their population at home, almost overnight

the dreaded words “Lock Down” were embedded into our

daily lexicon and our lives, under the severe restrictions,

became focused on ensuring availability of daily-need

essentials – grocery, milk, fruits and vegetables-things that we

take for granted. Internet, already another “essential” to our

daily lives, assumed criticality, as social distancing and isolation

relegated all person-to-person contact to the virtual medium.

From Schools to Colleges and Universities, from hobby classes

to birthday celebrations, from family get-togethers to reunions,

from work collaborations to meetings and conferences, all forms of

social and offi cial activities were rendered to the ether.

MANAgiNg diReCtOR:

letter and in spirit, in our

interactions with both internal as well

as external stakeholders. It is but a

natural corollary that ethical business

practices and attention to internal and

external compliance requirements are

the bedrock on which the foundations

of Redington’s operations and

processes are erected.

Safety and well-being of the highly

committed and talented team of

individuals which makes Redington the

Company it is, will remain our highest

priority. Even during the highly stressful

and severely restricted times of lock-

down, Redingtonians have traversed

even beyond that proverbial extra mile,

to remain connected with our Vendors

and our Partners. Redingtonians kept

their focus on available business

opportunities, execution of the

business acquired and collection of

Accounts Receivables. Along with Team

ProConnect, our employees across

all functions worked towards fulfilling

deliveries to sectors declared Critical

by the government, overcoming the

constraints of highly regulated and

restricted operations, both in the

market, as well as in the warehouses. I

wish to take this opportunity to thank

my team for a stupendous job done.

We take immense pride in the fact that

we are the Distributor of choice for all

our Vendors, who entrust us with the

responsibility of taking their products

and technology to customers spread

across the length and breadth of the

markets that we operate in. We feel

energized by the confidence that they

show in us and I would like to take this

opportunity to thank them for their

support and guidance.

Redington does all its business through

its thousands of channel partners and

it recognizes the fact that they have

alternatives to us. That they choose to

do business with us, is a privilege we

enjoy. We exist because of our partners

and it would be amiss if I do not

acknowledge our gratitude and thank

them for their support.

I wish to express my appreciation

of the support that we continue to

receive from our Bankers. They are an

important stakeholder in our continued

success. Our Auditors provide us with

invaluable advice and I thank them

for their support. our diversified and

highly qualified Board of Directors

are a source of great strength for us

and I deeply appreciate the support

and guidance that I receive from the

richly experienced and knowledgeable

members of our Board.

Last, but not the least, on behalf of my

Board and my team members, I wish

to thank you, our shareholders, for the

trust and confidence that you continue

to repose in us.

I look forward to your continued

support as we attempt to deliver

increasing value to all stake holders in

the new fiscal.
