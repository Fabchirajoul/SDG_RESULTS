Managing Director and

Chief Executive Officer

In a dynamic yet challenging business

environment, it has become more

critical to remain relevant to customers

than it was ever before. As we continue

to harness emerging technologies, we

continue to strengthen our ability to

deliver enriching experiences for our

customers. Our success of Return on

Digital Transformation® With New and

Exponential Technologies (RoD NeXT)

has delivered significant tangible and

visible results for our customers. The

digital business now forms more than

52.4% of our total revenue in the last

fiscal year, proving our ability to seize

opportunities and meet the changing

needs of our customers across sectors

while remaining agile and innovative.

‘Living AI’ is a testimony to our

commitment to evolve and adapt. It

also lies at the core of our strategic

goals, to identify and capitalise on

growing opportunities. AI, as we know,

continues to reduce human efforts with

accuracy and efficiency. At Zensar,

our ‘Living AI’ philosophy rightly

leverages the RoD NeXT platform,

enabling unmatched experiences

every step of the way. Built on the

three pivots of Decision AI, Experience

AI and Research AI, ‘Living AI’ is our

promise to build intelligent operations

for our customers, driving automation

and enhanced productivity.

We ensure effective usage of AI for

our customers, incorporating it into

a broader spectrum of strategies to

rightly fuse it with people, processes

and existing technologies. We

continue to focus on growth areas by

investing in technologies like AI and

cloud infrastructure to create platforms

that provide us with actionable

outcomes and better results for our

customers. This has transpired in

the addition of new clients to our

portfolio, taking our active clients to

283 in FY20. Our existing customers

continue to trust us with our digital and

innovative capabilities, as we continue

to strengthen our wallet share with

them through new offerings that add

value to their operations, consistently.

“Zensar has partnered with Woolworths

Online over the last couple of years and is

playing an important role during the Covid

have experienced, the need to change ways

of working and deliver innovative solutions

during this time was an expressed focus

point. Zensar supported Woolworths very

well during this period and specifically

partnered the IT team on delivering a click

and collect solution within 8 days. The teams

were committed to the business outcomes

and fully understood the importance of

meeting our customers at their point of need

during this very challenging time that is

being felt globally.

We are thankful for the team’s effort and their

ongoing commitment to the Woolworths

business.”

have stuck by each other through both the

tough times and the good times, and I think

that has added the most significant value.”

Li Mae Ong, Executive Director,

our people."

Sam Addeo,Chief Development

Officer, Aptos.

“In the last few years, Aptos has doubled

the number of customers we serve. There

is tremendous demand for our world-class,

end-to-end retail software and services

as retailers transform their businesses

for omnichannel. To meet this demand,

and to accelerate innovation, we selected

Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, with representation

from relevant functions within the organisation, and from global

regions through the formation of Emergency Response Teams. The

Company has used its in-house digital platform to provide features

for Employees to mark themselves, as safe on the platform and

seek help from Emergency Response Teams, if needed. All support

has been extended to the associates impacted by this pandemic,

including those who tested positive for COVID-19. Initiatives were

also launched focusing on the overall wellness of associates,

including online consultation and Telemedicine services, as well as

weekly mindfulness sessions.

To effectively manage the operations during this crisis, the

Company triggered its Business Continuity Management program,

to ensure service continuity with minimal impact on service

deliverables/delivery. With extreme agility the Company enabled

100% Remote Working for its associates across all regions globally,

with heightened emphasis on the obligations and responsibilities of

Associates when working remotely, and on the Information Security

and Data Privacy requirements. It effectively used collaborative

tools and digital platforms to ensure no disruption to associates/

clients’ engagement.

Travel and immigration related challenges faced by associates

were resolved with utmost priority by the Global Mobility and Travel

teams, in line with the guidelines issues by the local authorities.

While revised policies were rolled out to enable remote working,

the Internal Communications Team kept associates constantly

informed on the rapidly changing health and safety, travel, and

business continuity decisions. Associate learning and development

continued to be a focus area with introduction of new modules for

Virtual instructor-led VILT sessions.

As a part of its CSR initiative in the communities wherein your

Company operates, it has contributed to various COVID-19 relief

programs across the regions. A contribution framework was

also established for associates to extend their support towards

COVID-19 relief efforts.:
