Letter to Shareholders

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to report that for the financial year ended March 31, 2020, your Company

posted consolidated revenue of ₹ 48.6 billion. Consolidated net profit for the current financial year grew 6% over the previous

financial year to reach ₹ 14.6 billion.

Our growth streak continued with strong deal momentum around the world with wins across our platform with new and existing

customers. The customers included top banks in US, Japan, Australia, Europe, APAC and Africa. A leading Japanese bank

licensed Flexcube. A regional bank in Africa signed a multi country enterprise deal. LAPO Microfinance Bank, Nigeria’s largest

microfinance bank with four million customers, is implementing FLEXCUBE as well as Oracle Banking Digital Experience, Oracle

Banking Payments and Oracle Financial Services Analytical Applications. Central Bank of Libya in Tripoli, which includes four

of Libya’s public sector banks, is also upgrading its current FLEXCUBE solution. Multiple banks including Al Nile Bank, Balad

Bank in Sudan, as well as Libya’s Alyaqeen and Andalus Banks, chose Oracle Banking Digital Experience alongside FLEXCUBE

to enhance their operations. Other wins for the year include, My Bucks Banking Corporation, a new banking entity in Malawi,

has invested in the latest banking technology by signing a deal for Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking and Oracle Banking

Digital Experience. Westlake Financial Services, a Southern California based finance company has extended its relationship by

signing a deal for Oracle Financial Services Lending and Leasing for servicing and collection of loans. A leading Canadian bank

has extended its relationship with Oracle by signing a deal for Oracle Financial Services Analytical Applications. A top Australian

bank has extended its relationship with Oracle by signing a deal for Oracle Banking Platform.

Through the financial year, we continued to strengthen our solutions portfolio to help financial institutions in their

transformation initiatives. We introduced Oracle Banking Enterprise Originations, localized and compliant for UK banks and

building societies. We announced the availability of Oracle Financial Services Anti Money Laundering (AML) Express Edition.

Targeted at small and mid-sized banks, the solution is available at a lowered total cost of ownership without compromising core

functional capabilities. This is an engineering breakthrough that your Company has made possible with the use of modern

cloud-compatible architectures. We launched Oracle Banking Supply Chain Finance, a comprehensive digitized end-to-end

solution that supports the full lifecycle of supply chain finance across receivables and payables offering supplier centric and

buyer centric financing.

The Company has been at the forefront of innovation to ensure our customers stay ahead in today’s shifting business landscape.

We introduced machine learning frameworks, included Chatbots and built Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities into several

products. We also received a patent for our “Computerized Transaction Management Module for Blockchain Networks” that allows

Oracle FLEXCUBE customers to instantly utilize the power of Blockchain. The Financial Crime and Compliance Management and

Anti-Money Laundering portfolio was enhanced with new capabilities and solutions, leveraging machine learning for analytical

capabilities, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for workflows, and graphic analytics for the visualization of networks. These

offerings are setting a new industry standard and turning compliance into a competitive advantage for banks.

Forging a path towards better banking, our products and services continued to win us and our customers several accolades

and industry recognition. Oracle FLEXCUBE has been recognized as a ‘Leader’ in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Global Retail

Core Banking, 2019. Oracle Asset Liability Management won ‘Product of the Year’ at Asia Risk Technology Awards 2019. The

Company remained among the top three vendors in Chartis RiskTech100, 2020 for the fifth consecutive year, while retaining

awards in two categories: core technology, data integrity and control. Arbuthnot Latham, a FLEXCUBE customer in the UK, has

won the title “Bank of the Year – 2019” in the City A.M. awards beating digital challengers and some of the bigger UK high street

banks. Westpac, one of our key customers in Australia, running Oracle Banking Platform, took the coveted iTnews benchmark

award in finance for its work on the single view of the customer.

As we closed the year, we faced the unprecedented disruption due to global COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively

switched to work from home to keep employees safe and avoid exposure. This was the time when our customers had joined

the battle with the local government in respective countries and needed our support. Our sales and services have increasingly

taken on a digital format, while our robust infrastructure, business continuity programs and most importantly our people have

ensured that we deliver our customer commitments with minimal disruptions. With processes that support the delivery of

products, services, and software from anywhere, anytime, your Company has helped customers alleviate the negative impact

of the pandemic. We have many heartening stories and accolades from our customers. While the uncertainty due to COVID-19

continues, our value proposition remains very relevant and even more so as the economic recovery begins.

On behalf of the Board of Directors and Management of Oracle Financial Services Software, I would like to thank you for your

support through this financial year. I look forward to your continued patronage as we chart a new path towards fulfilling our

mission of providing world class solutions for the financial services industry.

Regards,
