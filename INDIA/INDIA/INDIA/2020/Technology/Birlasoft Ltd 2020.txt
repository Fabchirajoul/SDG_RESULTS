•

Registration of bank account details for members

holding shares in dematerialized form:

The members of the Company holding shares in

bank details, can get the same registered with their

respective DPs by following the procedure prescribed

by them.

20. In terms of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“the

IT Act”) as amended by the Finance Act, 2020, dividend paid

or distributed by a Company on or after April 1, 2020, shall

be taxable in the hands of the members. The Company

shall, therefore, be required to deduct TDS at the time of

payment of dividend at the applicable tax rates. The rate

of TDS would depend upon the category and residential

status of the member.

As it is important for the Company to receive the relevant

information from members to determine the rate of tax

deduction, the members are requested to furnish relevant

documentation in the prescribed manner on the portal of

RTA on or before Friday, August 21, 2020 (06:00 p.m.

IST). The applicable TDS rate for dividends and documents

to be furnished by each category of members is given in

the “Annexure – TDS on Dividend”, annexed hereto. The

relevant documents can be uploaded on RTA portal at

https://linkintime.co.in/formsreg/submission-of-form-

15g-15h.html.

The information given in the said Annexure may not be

exhaustive and the members should evaluate on their

own about the category for which they should furnish the

documents. In absence of all the relevant documents, the

Company shall determine TDS rate based on information

available with the RTA (for shares held in physical form) and

with the respective DPs (for shares held in dematerialized

form).

Please note that the duly completed & signed documents

should be uploaded on the portal of the RTA on or before

Friday, August 21, 2020 (06:00 p.m. IST). Incomplete

and/or unsigned forms and declarations will not be

considered by the Company. No communication on the

tax determination/deduction shall be considered after the

abovementioned date & time.

Members are also requested to update changes in their

Residential Status, if any, with the RTA (for shares held in

physical form) & DPs (for shares held in dematerialized

form), along with the supporting documents.

In case tax on dividend is deducted at a higher rate in the

absence of receipt of the specified details/documents, you

would still have the option of claiming refund of the excess

tax paid at the time of filing your income tax return. No claim

shall lie against the Company for such taxes deducted.

Members should note that any document/form not

uploaded on the portal will not be considered for the

purpose of processing and shall be rejected, therefore, it

should be uploaded on the portal only.

Members who have uploaded documents on the portal of

the RTA should also forward the originals to the Company

after normalization since physical submission of certain

documents is a legal requirement.

A detailed communication with respect to the same

is already sent to the members on Thursday, July 16,

2020, whose e-mail IDs are registered with the RTA/

DPs respectively and is also available on the website of

the Company at https://www.birlasoft.com/company/

312 | Birlasoft Limited:

Managing Director & CEO (upto May 31, 2019) (Director

Identification Number: 06407055), during the financial year

2019-20.

The managerial remuneration paid to Mr. Lahiri, during the

financial year 2019-20, has exceeded the limit prescribed under

Section 197 of the Act, on account of perquisite value of the

equity shares under the Special Purpose Birlasoft- Employee

Stock Option Plan 2019 (“ESOP-2019”), vested in and exercised

by him, during the said financial year and the managerial

remuneration excluding the perquisite value of ESOP-2019

shares would have been well within the prescribed limits.

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 197 of the Act, the waiver

of recovery of excess remuneration payable to the Managing

Director & CEO would require approval of members of the

Company by way of special resolution. Therefore, the members

are requested to accord their approval for waiver of recovery of

the excess remuneration paid to Mr. Anjan Lahiri, during the

financial year 2019-20.

The Board of Directors recommends the resolution for approval

of members of the Company, as set out at Item No. 7 of the

notice.

None of the Directors, Key Managerial Personnel or any of their

respective relatives are, in any way, concerned or interested,

whether financially or otherwise, in this resolution.
