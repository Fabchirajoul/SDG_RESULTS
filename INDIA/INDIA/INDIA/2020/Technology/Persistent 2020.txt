Dear Shareholders,

In FY20, our team delivered a growth of 4.3% in USD terms and 5.9% in INR terms. We had a special year as we crossed a

half-billion-dollar milestone, which is always an important threshold in the Company’s growth journey.

Customers across industry segments are adopting digital transformation technologies to expand and sustain their position in

a highly competitive market. Our offerings and strengths in the digital space are very relevant to address these needs, and we

see an increased level of engagement.

Our services revenue grew by 12.4% to reach ₹ 28,396 million. However, the revenue from our IP led portfolio declined by

13.4% at ₹ 7,262 million. The total revenue was ₹ 35,658 million, a growth of 5.9%. Our focus on industry verticals has started

to show results, with revenue growth of 23.5% in BFSI and 8.8% in Healthcare. The technology companies segment weighed

under lower IP led revenue and had a decline of 3.9%.

The operating margin for the year at 13.8% was impacted by lower IP led revenue and the investment made in sales and

marketing. We believe that as we prepare for the next phase of growth, these investments are necessary to improve market

penetration and deepen customer relationships.

Increasing adoption of cloud creates a new set of requirements in managing data and security. In the current challenging

environment caused by the corona virus pandemic, the customers are increasingly embracing digital technologies. Our

offerings are thus increasingly relevant to them. We continue to invest in new technologies to be able to deliver value to our

customers and help them achieve business outcomes that are meaningful for their customers.

The cash position of your Company continues to be healthy. We completed the share buyback amounting to ₹ 2,250 million

in June 2019. During July 2019, we acquired Youperience GmbH, a Salesforce consulting company in Europe, which will help

us improve our presence in Europe. Interim dividends totalling ₹ 12 per share for Financial Year 2019-20 was paid during the

year. Cash and cash equivalents stood at ₹ 14,796 million at the end of the year, as compared to ₹ 14,798 million at the end of

the previous year.

On the CSR front, your Company has always been committed to the society at large and contributed ₹ 86.11 million towards

CSR activities through Persistent Foundation.

Further, we have pledged to contribute ₹ 250 million during Financial Year 2020-21 to support the global response to the

pandemic.

I am grateful to all our investors for their continued support, and we will strive to deliver value to our customers and enhance

shareholder value..

Sincerely,

Sunil Sapre

Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer

Report of the Directors

Your Directors are pleased to present the Thirtieth Annual Report of your Company along with the Audited Financial

Statements for the Financial Year ended March 31, 2020.

It has been an exciting thirty-years’ journey for your Company that started in 1990 on March 27, 1990, Gudhi Padawa, the new

year day in the local lunar calendar followed by Maharashtrians and others in India. Mr. S. P. (Dada) Deshpande, the founding

Director of the Company initiated the paperwork to establish your Company. The actual paperwork was completed in two

months and your Company received the Certificate of Incorporation dated May 30, 1990.

At this time in the thirtieth year of your Company, we are in the midst of an unprecedented crisis caused by the global

COVID-19 pandemic. Since mid-March, most countries where our people are located, and where we do business, are locked-

down and all employees of your Company are working from home. While all the employees of your Company are safe, this

crisis has caused very high levels of uncertainty and economic hardships globally. As a responsible corporate citizen, in the

first week of April 2020, your Company declared a contribution of ₹ 250 million (US$ 3.3 million) to support communities

globally with food, rehabilitation, treatment, vaccines, research and other support for medical professionals.

This year was momentous for your Company as two significant milestones were achieved -- your Company crossed the

10,000-employee mark in April 2019 and crossed the Half Billion Dollar in revenues for the Financial Year.

Mr. Christopher O’Connor joined Persistent Group as the Chief Executive Officer on February 25, 2019 and Mr. Sandeep Kalra

joined as the President of the Technology and Services Unit on May 1, 2019. This was the first full year for the new CEO and

the new management team.

Revenues for the year was ₹ 35,658.08 million which is 5.9% growth over the previous year. This is US$ 501.61 million which

was 4.3% growth over the previous year. The Profit after Tax was ₹ 3,402.89 million which is 3.2% lower than the previous year.

Future Outlook

As we entered 2020, the world was progressing steadily in how it operates to a more cloud-centric, digitally focused set of

services and work patterns. Remote banking, shopping, medical care, logistics, business to business marketplaces and other

scenarios were all projects that Persistent has repeatably undertaken for clients across the world. We therefore began the

year with a focus on banking, finance, healthcare, life sciences and the industrial sector.

The outbreak of COVID-19 was clearly a Black Swan event, the likes of which we have not experienced before as a global

business community or society. While each business must navigate the pressure on both their bottom and top line uniquely,

COVID-19 has created the impetus and mandate for cloud-centric, digital acceleration. Some industries such as travel and

leisure have experienced the worst impact, but others will expand and flourish. Persistent is well positioned to help banking,

healthcare and industrial organizations move beyond the status quo of incremental digital projects and instead transform into

truly digital enterprises. The ISV community – always an important client set for Persistent -- is also re-evaluating how work is

done, which plays into our longstanding strength at building better software with greater efficiency and at lower cost.

This year saw Persistent cross the USD half a Billion revenue milestone – an important landmark and one that gives us

significantly more influence in the market with both clients and partners. We also brought in a new leadership team across

sales, strategy and marketing which is now executing on a USD 1 Billion growth strategy and plan.

Report of the Directors

Today, we are a forward-looking global solutions company supporting our clients’ most pressing issues at the core of their

digital futures. In the context of helping our clients navigate this future, we introduced our digital mosaic approach – defining
