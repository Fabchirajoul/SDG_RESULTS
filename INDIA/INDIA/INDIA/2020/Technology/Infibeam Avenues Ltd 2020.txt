We are a leading Fintech provider in India and among

the very few profitable Fintech companies in India,

with a consistent growth and profitability track record.

We aspire to replicate our success in India, in other

fast growing digital economies of the world. We have

already proven ourselves in the UAE region. In less than

18 months, we became the second largest non-bank

private DPS provider in the UAE competing with some

top companies. We aim to be the number one player

in the UAE in next 18-24 months. We have recently

launched our services in the largest economy in the

Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), in the Kingdom of

Saudi Arabia (KSA), as well as Oman, and we are also

venturing in the USA, one of the world’s most advanced

Fintech markets. We have been awarded an exclusive

Infibeam Avenues Limited (IAL) since beginning, has always focused on building a

digital organisation that not only can scale but can also solve problems at scale. We had

ventured into various digital-led businesses and explored different opportunities in

our early days. We leveraged that experience to become one of India’s leading Digital

Payment Solutions (DPS) and Enterprise Software Platform (ESP) provider.

Today, as a global Fintech Company catering to the large and diverse Business-to-

Business (B2B) client segment, we are taking our deep understanding of India’s

eCommerce and digital payments to markets across the world.

mandate competing with well-known global technology

giants to offer our world-class eCommerce platform to

the Government of India (GoI) for online procurements

of products as well as services. We continue to

explore opportunities in ESP business in India and in

international markets.

We believe countries like India, the Middle East region,

North Africa, ASEAN countries, developed economies like

the USA, and some more geographies, present a large

scope for us. With our comprehensive Fintech portfolio,

we aspire to play a key role in increasing the share of

digital transactions in the markets we operate and the

one’s we plan to expand into, most of which are at an

inflection point of strong growth in eCommerce and

online business models.:

Dear Shareholders,

The world is confronting one of the greatest health

threats of a generation, one that profoundly impacts

the global economy and all of its citizens. Our thoughts

remain with the communities and individuals, including

healthcare workers and first responders, most deeply hit

by the COVID-19 crisis.

Resilience and relevance: Responding to

COVID-19 challenges

We have always stood for our customers, employees and

communities in good and bad times. COVID-19 is one

of those extraordinary times and we have responded

with agility to this global crisis, prioritising our various

stakeholder groups. Our employees are our greatest

asset and customer centricity is at the center of all our

business discussions and decisions.

We have very quickly mobilised and implemented work-

from-home and other resiliency measures. To ensure

business continuity, we quickly procured laptops and

arranged to move desktops to employees’ residences.

During the lockdown in April, over 90% of our staff

across all our offices worked from home. Even now, with

some relaxations, majority of our staff continues to work

from home with stabilised business flow, flow, making

it the new normal. For those coming to work, we are

reinforcing both basic and enhanced personal and office

hygiene measures to keep them, their colleagues and

their clients safe. We have also distributed face masks

and check temperature to help protect employees and

support staff.

The relevance of our Fintech solutions cannot be

emphasised ever more than now. We realised that

consumers, during lockdown, will require a continuous

and smooth flow of daily goods and services while

limiting their outdoor mobility and maintaining social

distance for safety. We realised that this will also become

the new normal, and our digital services will become

part of their daily essentials. Thus, we further deepened

our relationship with merchants and banking partners.

We enabled many utility companies, education institutes,

essential industry segments and penetrated across

various industry verticals to allow end consumers to

easily be able to make payments for these services

online. We added more banks to our portfolio of banks

including international banks to allow a greater number

of customers to use their preferred bank for payment.

In each of the businesses and solutions we offer, we broke

our own previous records of integrating and activating

client accounts, partnering with merchants and banks,

and surpassing our own daily payment volume and value.

Sometimes, conditions may have become unusual and

difficult, yet we are functioning smoothly. In fact, in

the month of June we've crossed the pre-COVID daily

payment processing value and volume. Surprisingly,

we have seen consistent growth in the UAE,

month-on-month since beginning of the year with no

negative impact from COVID-19, especially during the

months of March, April and May.

Needless to say, this success would have been

impossible without our exceptional employees.

We recognise our responsibility to support both their

professional and personal lives.

There are great lessons to be learned from this

experience and we believe we will emerge stronger.

As we deal with the spiraling effects of this pandemic,

I want to assure you that we remain strong, resilient and

are well-positioned to capture the ongoing opportunities

in digital. We are at an inflection point staring at

multi-year strong growth as consumers, businesses,

banks and governments all transition steadily to adopt

digital payments and digital platforms for transacting

locally and globally.

To capitalise on this opportunity our Company has

undertaken various initiatives through the year to build

a future-proof business backed by our comprehensive

digital solutions and led by our strong leadership team

and motivated employees.

Looking back over a decade and half, we have come

a long way and withstood some unprecedented

challenges, as we will with this current pandemic too,

which has not stopped us from accomplishing some

Dear Shareholders,

allowed in May in India, we observed

strong sequential growth in

transaction processes volume and

value compared to a dip during

lockdown in April 2020, indicating

strong recovery in the business. We

will be able to cross the pre-COVID

levels easily in July 2020.

Severe pricing competition in the

DPS business, triggered by loss-

making and well-funded payment

solution companies, zero Merchant

Discount Rate (MDR) guidelines by

the Government of India on UPI and

RuPay cards, increase in low MDR

and flat fee transactions related

to recharges, utility payments,

education, etc. led to a drop in our

gross take rate on the total value

of payments processed. However,

our prudent pricing policies,

long-standing client relationships,

and aggressive business

development led to significant rise

in volume of payments processed.

This helped in maintaining our net

take rate to remain almost same

compared to FY 2018-19, and helped

in improving our EBITDA margins

and net profits. On the back of newer

product launches, especially on

payment issuance side like express

settlement, prepaid cards, corporate

credit card, etc., and expanding into

international markets, we will be

able to improve our net take rate in

DPS business going forward, which

should further enhance operating

and profit margins.

We are also seeing an increased

usage in bill payments through

NPCI’s Bharat BillPay (BBPS)

infrastructure. The monthly volume

has increased from 15.8 million

transactions in FY 2019-20, up

28% year-on-year (y-o-y), while

Q4 FY 2019-20 recorded highest

ever volume in a quarter totaling

40 million, despite the last week

of the quarter being impacted by

COVID-19 pandemic. We processed

payments worth `622 billion, up

28%, compared to FY 2018-19.

The DPS business in the UAE,

achieved strong sequential growth

since the beginning of calendar year

2020, even in April and May 2020,

a period impacted by COVID-19

globally. The PTV and volume were

up 42% and 48%, respectively in May

2020 versus March 2020. The PTV

and volume grew in the Ramadan

period in May 2020 by 10% and 7%,

respectively over April 2020, when

compared to a sequential fall in PTV

and volume in Ramadan period of

May 2019.

On account of pandemic, the

consumers and the enterprises

have both felt the necessity for

digital adoption and business

transformation, leading to wide

acceptance of digital payments in

India as well as in our international

operations. This helped in merchant

addition in DPS business remaining

strong and unaffected even

during the lockdown at the end of

March, April and May, which will

potentially result in growth once

the economy gradually re-opens.

We were processing at a run-rate of

`750 billion in the month of March

2020, based on the average of first

twenty-four days of March 2020,

before the nation-wide lockdown

was announced by the Government

of India. Due to partial relaxations

We ended FY 2019-20 on a strong note with

growth across the board, both in Digital

Payment Solutions (DPS) and Enterprise

Software Platforms (ESP) businesses and

across financial and operational metrices.

DPS business continued its upward rally with

strong growth in transaction volume and

value processed, while ESP business marked

another year of high double-digit growth.

We have continued our journey to record

strong operating and profitability margins,

highest ever.

Delivering strong results

sustainably

We achieved a revenue of `6,481 million in

FY 2019-20, up 10%, compared to FY 2018-19,

excluding the demerger and divestment of

non-core entities in FY 2018-19. The growth

in revenue was on account of growth in DPS

business and strong engagements in ESP

businesses in our domestic and international

operations. The DPS business achieved

positive growth during FY 2019-20 compared

to FY 2018-19. We recorded highest ever

number of successful payments transaction

(Volume) and successful Payments Transaction

Value (PTV). We processed 147 million

in March 2020 to 16.5 million in

May 2020. Infibeam Avenues bill

payments value and number of

bills processed increased by 91%

and 93%, respectively in FY 2019-20

compared to FY 2018-19. We are the

exclusive non-bank bill processer for

all three gas cylinder providers in

India namely, IOCL, BPCL and HPCL.

ResAvenue, our hospitality platform

integrated with our digital payment

solution now has over 2,000

hotel properties working with us

compared to a little over 1,000

properties in FY 2018-19. We are

working towards increasing the

number of hotel properties to

3,000 by end of FY 2020-21. We are

integrated with all the major Online

Travel Agents (OTAs) and we also

added Paytm as the new OTA on the

ResAvenue platform. On an average,

in Q3 FY 2019-20, more than 3,000

room nights were being booked

daily, compared to 2,000 room

nights being booked on an average

daily in Q4 FY 2018-19, a growth of

50%. The average daily room nights

booked for the entire year was over

2,600 room nights, affected in the

month of March due to COVID-19.

ESP business achieved strong

double-digit revenue growth in

FY 2019-20 compared to FY 2018-19.

During the year, upgrades and

additional requirements by few

subscription-based enterprise

clients, and increase in volumes on

GeM portal (our transaction-based

client) led to a very strong growth.

However, Q4 FY 2019-20 revenue

was impacted due to lower invoicing

and collections on account of

lockdown in the last few days of

March 2020. This will be realised in

the first half of FY 2020-21.

Our EBITDA margins improved to

33.4% in FY 2019-20 compared to

19.4%, adjusted for demerger and

divestments, in FY 2018-19. The

improvement is primarily on growth

of volume of business and operating

efficiency achieved on growing scale.

Our prudent pricing policies,

long-standing client relationships,

and aggressive business development

led to significant rise in volume of

payments processed.

This will significantly enhance

initiative, and uplift the marginalised

and underprivileged sections of the

society in which GeM wants to be a

part of their growth story. It will also

enhance procurement volumes on

the GeM portal and revenue for us.

In the DPS business, we are building

additional revenue streams to have

a diversified Fintech portfolio, gain

higher market share, and to further

boost our operating and profitability

margins. We were earlier present

on the Payment Acquiring side,

accepting and acquiring payments

digitally for the merchants.

In FY 2020-21, we are entering

into the issuance side of the digital

payments, offering; 1) instant

settlement of merchant funds on

successful payment transaction

instead of T+2 or T+3 days

settlement, 2) to capitalise on huge

credit opportunity to SMEs in India

we will offer credit cards to corporate

to meet their recurring business

expenses, and 3) issue pre-paid

cards to corporate employees for

personal and business spends.

Under the ESP business, we are

evaluating multiple proposals to

offer our eCommerce platform

integrated with payments to large

enterprises and governments both in

domestic and international market.

We are seeing growing traction

for our Fintech solutions which

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

a)

Composition and category of Directors

We believe that our Board needs to be well

diversified and have an appropriate mix of Executive,

Non-executive and Independent Directors, to maintain

its independence, and separate its functions of

governance and management. The Listing Regulations

mandate that for a Company with Non-executive

Chairman, who is a promoter, at least half of the Board

should be Independent Directors. As on March 31,

2020, our Board comprised eight members, consisting

of one Non-executive and Non-Independent Chairman,

two Executive Directors, one Non-executive Director

and four Independent Directors including one woman

Independent Director. The Board periodically evaluates

the need for change in its size and composition.

The present strength of the Board reflects judicious mix

of professionalism, competence and sound knowledge

which enables the Board to provide effective leadership

to the Company.
