CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE

AT INFOSYS

Our corporate governance framework ensures that we make

timely disclosures and share accurate information regarding

our financials and performance, as well as disclosures related

to the leadership and governance of the Company.

As on March 31, 2020, the Board comprised eight members,

consisting of one non-executive and non-independent

chairman, two executive directors, and five independent

directors. An independent director is the chairperson of

each of the Board committees – namely audit committee,

nomination and remuneration committee, stakeholders

relationship committee, risk management committee, and

corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee.:

Managing Director (CEO

& MD) is responsible for executing corporate strategy in

consultation with the Board, as well as for brand equity,

planning, building external contacts and all matters related

to the management of the Company. He is responsible for

achieving annual and long-term business targets. The CEO

& MD also monitors the external and internal competitive

landscape, and new industry developments and standards,

identifies opportunities for expansion and acquisition, and

builds relationships with customers and markets with an

eye to enhancing shareholder value and implementing the

organization’s vision, mission, and overall direction.

The CEO & MD acts as a link between the Board and

the Management and is also responsible for leading and

evaluating the work of other executive leaders including

the Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Financial Officer

(CFO), Presidents and Executive Vice Presidents as per the

organizational structure.

The COO has overall strategic and operational responsibility

for the entire portfolio of the Company’s offerings and is

responsible for ensuring that the business enabling functions

provide the necessary support for the sales and delivery teams

in enabling them to help our clients achieve their business

objectives while keeping the highest standards of governance

and professionalism. He oversees the key functions of global

delivery and business enablement.

The role of the lead independent director is to provide

leadership to the independent directors, liaise on behalf of

the independent directors and ensure Board effectiveness to

maintain high-quality governance of the organization and the

effective functioning of the Board.

We believe that an active, well-informed, diversified and

independent board is necessary to ensure the highest

standards of corporate governance. At Infosys, the Board is

at the core of best corporate governance practice. The Board

oversees the Management’s functions and protects the long-

term interests of our stakeholders.

Indemnification agreements

We have also entered into agreements to indemnify our

directors and officers for claims brought against them to

the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. These

agreements, among other things, indemnify our directors

and officers for certain expenses, judgments, fines and

settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any

action or proceedings, including any action by or in the right

of Infosys Limited, arising out of such persons’ services as

our director or officer, expenses in relation to public relations

consultation, if required.

C. Board meetings

Scheduling and selection of agenda items for

Board meetings

The tentative dates of Board meetings for the next fiscal

are decided in advance and published in the Annual report

as part of Shareholder information. The Chairman and the

Company Secretary draft the agenda for each meeting, along

with explanatory notes, in consultation with the CEO & MD,

and distribute these in advance to the directors. Every Board

member can suggest the inclusion of additional items in the

agenda. The Board meets at least once a quarter to review the

quarterly results and other items on the agenda, and also on

the occasion of the AGM. Additional meetings are held when

necessary. Independent directors are expected to attend at

least four quarterly Board meetings and the AGM. However,

with the Board being represented by independent directors

from various parts of the world, it may not be possible for

each one of them to be physically present at all meetings.

Hence, we provide video / teleconferencing facilities to enable

their participation. Committees of the Board usually meet the

day before the Board meeting, or whenever the need arises

for transacting business. The Board members are expected to

rigorously prepare for, attend and participate in Board and

applicable committee meetings. Each member is expected to

ensure their other current and planned future commitments

do not materially interfere with their responsibilities with us.

Attendance of directors during fiscal 2020

During the year, eight Board meetings were held. These were

held on April 11-12, 2019; May 15, 2019; June 22, 2019;

July 11-12, 2019; October 10-11, 2019; November 06, 2019;

January 09-10, 2020 and February 10, 2020.:

letter in line with

Recommendation No. 9 of the Blue Ribbon Committee

on Committee effectiveness, to be provided in the financial

statements prepared in accordance with IFRS in the Annual

Report on Form 20-F.

Relying on its review and the discussions with the Management

and the Independent Auditors, the Committee believes that

the Company’s financial statements are fairly presented

in conformity with Ind AS and IFRS and that there is no

significant deficiency or material weakness in the Company’s

internal control over financial reporting. In conclusion,

the Committee is sufficiently satisfied that it has complied

with its responsibilities as outlined in the audit committee

charter. The Board accepted all recommendations made by

the audit committee.

6. Members whose shareholding is in electronic mode are requested to direct notifications about change of address and

updates about bank account details to their respective depository participants(s) (DP). Members whose shareholding

is in physical mode are requested to opt for the Electronic Clearing System (ECS) mode to receive dividend on time

in line with the Circulars. We urge members to utilize the ECS for receiving dividends. Please refer point no. 16 for the

process to be followed for updating bank account mandate.

7. Members may note that the Board of Directors, in its meeting held on April 20, 2020 has recommended a final dividend

of ` 9.50 per share. The record date for the purpose of final dividend for fiscal 2020 will be June 01, 2020. The final

dividend, once approved by the members in the ensuing AGM will be paid on the fifth working day (i.e. July 03, 2020),

from the date of AGM, electronically through various online transfer modes to those members who have updated their

bank account details. For members who have not updated their bank account details, dividend warrants / demand

drafts / cheques will be sent out to their registered addresses once the postal facility is available. To avoid delay in

receiving the dividend, members are requested to update their KYC with their depositories (where shares are held in

dematerialized mode) and with the Company’s Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) (where shares are held in physical

mode) to receive the dividend directly into their bank account on the payout date.

8. Members may note that the Income Tax Act, 1961, (“the IT Act”) as amended by the Finance Act, 2020, mandates that

dividends paid or distributed by a company after April 01, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of members. The Company

shall therefore be required to deduct tax at source (TDS) at the time of making the payment of final dividend. In order

to enable us to determine the appropriate TDS rate as applicable, members are requested to submit the following

documents in accordance with the provisions of the IT Act.

For resident shareholders, taxes shall be deducted at source under Section 194 of the IT Act as follows-

Members having valid PAN

7.5% or as notified by the Government of India

Members not having PAN / valid PAN

20% or as notified by the Government of India

However, no tax shall be deducted on the dividend payable to a resident individual if the total dividend to be received by

them during Financial Year 2020-21 does not exceed ` 5,000 and also in cases where members provide Form 15G / Form

15H (applicable to individuals aged 60 years or more) subject to conditions specified in the IT Act. Resident shareholders

may also submit any other document as prescribed under the IT Act to claim a lower / Nil withholding tax. Registered

members may also submit any other document as prescribed under the IT Act to claim a lower / Nil withholding tax.

PAN is mandatory for members providing Form 15G / 15H or any other document as mentioned above.

For non-resident shareholders, taxes are required to be withheld in accordance with the provisions of Section 195

and other applicable sections of the IT Act, at the rates in force. The withholding tax shall be at the rate of 20% (plus

applicable surcharge and cess) or as notified by the Government of India on the amount of dividend payable. However,

as per Section 90 of the IT Act, non-resident shareholders have the option to be governed by the provisions of the:

letter for the appointment of Uri Levine as an independent director setting

out the terms and conditions is available for electronic inspection without any fee by the members.

The resolution seeks the approval of members for the appointment of Uri Levine as an independent director of the Company

up to April 19, 2023 pursuant to Sections 149, 152 and other applicable provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder

(including any statutory modification(s) or re-enactment(s) thereof) and his office shall not be liable to retire by rotation.

As per the provisions of Section 161 of the Act, an additional director appointed by the Board shall hold office up to the

date of the ensuing annual general meeting and shall be appointed as a director by the members. The Board, at its meeting

held on April 20, 2020, appointed Uri Levine as an additional and independent director who holds office up to the ensuing

AGM. Accordingly, his appointment is placed for the approval of members. In compliance with the General circular number
