Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statement

Certain statements in this annual report concerning our future growth prospects are forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual

results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties relating to these statements include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties

regarding fluctuations in our earnings, revenue and profits, our ability to generate and manage growth, intense competition in IT Services, our ability to maintain our cost advantage, wage

increases in India, our ability to attract and retain highly skilled professionals, time and cost overruns on fixed-price, fixed-time frame contracts, client concentration, restrictions on

immigration, our ability to manage our international operations, reduced demand for technology in our key focus areas, disruptions in telecommunication networks, our ability to successfully

complete and integrate potential acquisitions, liability for damages on our service contracts, the success of the companies in which we make strategic investments, withdrawal of fiscal

governmental incentives, political instability, war, legal restrictions on raising capital or acquiring companies outside India, unauthorized use of our intellectual property, and general economic

conditions affecting our business and industry. Additional risks that could affect our future operating results are more fully described in our filings with the United States Securities and

Exchange Commission. These filings are available at www.sec.gov. We may, from time to time, make additional written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained

in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our reports to shareholders. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from

time to time by us or on our behalf.:

Dear Stakeholders,

As I write this, we are in the middle of the biggest crisis we

have seen in our lifetimes, the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, it

has created unprecedented socioeconomic disruption, fear

and the tragic loss of human life. The collapse in economic

activity this time is likely at a level unseen in previous

recessions. The exit path remains a vaccine and till then it is

likely to be a bumpy ride with a continuous stop-start rhythm

and strict health protocols.

Having said that, most of us have lived through economic

crises before. Each time the agony has been different but

each time we have adapted and bounced back. I am hopeful

that like all previous crises, the COVID-19 calamity will

also pass and in time, a fresh wave of business energy

will be unleashed. The next few months will be critical for

organizations as they build their resilience in order to

persist, resurrect their businesses and master the new

business environment.

Chairman’s: letter

“I am confident

that we will emerge

from this crisis, a

stronger Wipro

and a more valuable

partner to our

clients than

ever before.”

Managing Director,

effective July 6, 2020. Thierry brings with him an exceptional

leadership track record, strong international exposure, deep

strategic expertise, a unique ability to forge long-standing

client relationships, and proven experience of driving

transformation and managing technological disruption. I

believe that Thierry is the right leader for Wipro to drive us

forward in our next phase of growth.

Lastly, I am truly humbled at being appointed Chairman of

Wipro Limited. I have begun this journey with a deep sense

of gratitude - it is both an honor and a privilege to lead our

company. I am thankful to our clients, partners, and other

stakeholders who have reposed their trust and confidence in

me and team Wipro. We are committed to work through the

current environment and our future feels bright and exciting.

Together, we shall overcome and triumph!

Very Sincerely,

Rishad A premji

Chairman

Together,

we shall

overcome and

Annexure -1:

letter and spirit of being a responsible business.

Our goals are centered around (i) making Wipro more

sustainable as defined by the triple bottom-line framework

and (ii) contributing to a more just, inclusive and sustainable

society through our work in Education, Ecology, Primary

Health Care and Disaster Response.

Our areas of work span a wide range- Energy and Climate

Change, Water, Solid Waste, Biodiversity, Urban Ecology

and Public Spaces, issues of Quality, Access and Inclusion

in Education, Sustainability in Education and Access to

Primary Health Care for the disadvantaged sections. Our

approach emphasizes depth and a systemic, long term

view that informs the way we choose our areas of work, the

partners we collaborate with and the bedrock of ethics and

good governance that underlies all our programs. Collectively,

these initiatives help in enhancing social and natural capital

while our workplace culture of diversity, inclusion and

employee empowerment strengthen human capital. Value is

created when all these capitals reinforce each other.

During the reporting year, we made significant progress on

our goals through our extensive network of nearly 200 civil

society and academic partner organizations across India

and the overseas geographies where we have presence- US,

UK, Europe, LATAM and APAC. A detailed articulation of our

programs is available in the MD&A Report forming part of this

Annual Report. The articulation is aligned with the integrated

multiple capitals approach and covers salient facts, metrics

and narratives on our goals, programs, outcomes and

governance.

Towards the end of the financial year, the whole world came

face to face with the COVID-19 crisis, an unprecedented

challenge for humanity. The multi-dimensional nature of the

crisis- healthcare, humanitarian, economic and social- poses

a particularly daunting challenge. At Wipro, we have made a

commitment of ` 100 crores for FY21 towards our COVID-19

response. In combination with the commitments of Azim

Premji Foundation (` 1,000 Cr) and Wipro Enterprises Private

Limited (` 25 Cr), we are weaving together an integrated

response that addresses the different facets of the problem

in a holistic manner. We recognize that the COVID-19 crisis

is going to be with us for some time and therefore, our

commitment is not just for immediate short-term relief but

designed for impact over the medium and long term as well.

Lastly, we would like to highlight that our COVID-19 financial

commitment is in addition to our regular CSR work that

we will continue to strengthen and focus on in the coming

year.

Summary of CSR spend for financial year 2019-20 is provided
