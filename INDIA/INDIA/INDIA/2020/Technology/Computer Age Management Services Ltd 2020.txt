LETTEr: Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present the Company’s Thirty Second Annual Report. Your company has maintained a steady growth

in profitability in the current macro-economic backdrop.

Currently, with the unprecedented events surrounding the worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 the impact of this

outbreak to the macro environment is still uncertain.

However, the concerned the financial year 2019-20 has been eventful reporting a Consolidated net profit of Rs.17,189.22

lakhs. Consolidated Total revenue of the Company for the financial year 2019-20 was Rs. 72,059.70 lakhs as compared

to Rs.71,170.71 lakhs for the previous year.

The assets of the Indian mutual fund industry have grown consistently since financial year 2000. Especially in recent

years, mutual funds in India have seen a robust growth. However, the penetration of mutual funds (AUM to GDP) is

significantly lower in India than the world average. During the financial year 2019-20 while the overall AAUM of the MF

industry was declining CAMS continued to retain its preeminent position in the MF RTA space.

CAMS offers a technology-driven financial infrastructure, with transactions through digital and electronic modes

contributing significant part of the total inflows thus offering more convenience to its customers and enabling a wider

customer base.

While CAMS has maintained a dominant market share and provided good results to its shareholders and is confident

with its ability to meet customer expectations in this trying time, and is doing its best to mitigate the impact of the

macroeconomic and other external environment related factors, it is expected that there could be strain on its profitability

during FY21.

The company is proposing, subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, receipt of requisite approvals,

market conditions and other considerations, to make an initial public offer of its equity shares through an offer for sale

and the draft red herring prospectus has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India on January 9 2020.

We are committed to work towards creating value for our shareholders and customers even during this crisis to the best

position of us. We are very grateful for the support we receive from our shareholders and other stakeholders.
