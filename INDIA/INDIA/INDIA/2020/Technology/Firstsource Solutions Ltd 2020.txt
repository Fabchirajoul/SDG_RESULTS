Message from the Chairman

•

Profit After Tax (PAT) fell 10.1% Y-o-Y to

` 3,397 Million. This was primarily due

to key investments undertaken to drive

future growth and meet operating

challenges in the early part of the year.

Driven by strong momentum in the

Mortgage and Collections businesses, the

BFSI vertical recorded the fastest growth.

Healthcare reported mixed performance

with growth in the Provider segment

partially offset by weakness in the Payer

segment. Telecommunications and Media

was impacted by the re-balancing in a

key client portfolio earlier during the year

as well as some execution challenges.

However, we are witnessing signs of

improvement in this vertical.: Dear Shareholders,

In the wake of the ongoing crisis, I hope

you and your family are taking good

care of your health and well-being. As

humanity as a whole grapples with these

unprecedented

times,

the

pandemic

has had widespread ramifications on

economies and businesses alike. In this

surrounding uncertainty, the only thing

that can be said with certainty is that the

post COVID era, will permanently change

the way we live, work and socialise.

Notwithstanding the negative impact

of the pandemic on the economy and

businesses, especially during the fourth

quarter, we grew our FY20 revenues,

making meaningful progress on our

strategic objectives. We adapted rapidly

to a distributed operating model to serve

our clients’ needs while ensuring the

safety and well-being of our employees.

Revenue

from

grew

7.1% Y-o-Y to ` 40,986 Million

•

Operating Margin de-grew 3.8% Y-o-Y

to ` 4,437 Million

management team led by Vipul Khanna.

We welcome Vipul and other senior

leaders who joined us this year. We will

continue to make the requisite investments

to further strengthen the team.

With

uncertainty

looming

large,

we

chose not to provide full-year guidance

for the current fiscal. As near-term

volatility is expected to continue across

most verticals, we hope the situation will

stabilise in the second half. We believe the

business will gather momentum and grow

strong over the medium-to-long term.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to 21,000+

Firstsourcers

for

demonstrating

their

unwavering commitment even during the

difficult times of the lockdown. We are

committed to providing them a nurturing

work

environment

that

focuses

on

enhancing their capabilities.

We thank all our stakeholders and seek

their continued support in our journey.
