Contents: Letter from the

Letter from the Chairman and Group CEO

Dear Fellow KPITians,

FY2020 was the first complete year of KPIT post the

restructuring leading to an independent technology

company, focused only on the mobility sector.

I am personally very happy with the way we have

shaped up over the year in terms of our strategy,

focus, technology orientation, alignment with customer

requirements and nurturing of talent.

The year that went by:

We started the year with the following primary focus

areas:

1.

Customers

2.

People

3.

Delivery Excellence

4.

Profitable Growth

Our strategy of focus on select strategic customers

yielded good results with majority of the growth

contributed by these customers. Our strategic customers

contributed more than 80% of the total revenues.

Autonomous driving and electric powertrain were the

fastest growing practices for us during the year.

We want to be a net talent creator and envision KPIT to

be a ‘Great Place to Grow’ for all our employees. During

the year we focussed on multi-level interactions with

our employees to ensure our Vision and Strategy is

understood by one and all and every employee believes

to be a vital link in the organization. Leadership and

technical training across the board helped upskill the

employees. Last but not the least, we ensured our

people, especially technical roles are compensated

commensurate with the best in the industry and the

increments were accordingly higher. All these factors

helped us in reducing attrition to a great extent and the

year saw one of the lowest attrition levels in our history.

Zero Defect delivery is one of our prime goals. It is more

of a culture than an arithmetic number. Defect free

software delivery and ongoing productivity improvement

are the two main areas under delivery excellence.

Enhanced customer and team communication, ongoing

quality control and reporting, weekly rigor in tracking

of projects, individual level, project level and program

level productivity tools deployment and tracking and

succession planning are some of the areas we worked

upon and improved during the year. We will continue to

pursue delivery excellence as one of our foremost focus

areas.

FY2020 was a good year for KPIT with annual revenues

of USD 303.81 Million, registering an industry leading

organic growth of 14%+ on a constant currency

comparable basis. The operating margin (EBITDA) stood

at around 13.7% for the year, a healthy growth in margins

as compared to last year. The Net Profit (PAT) for the

year was ₹ 1,466 Million.

One of the key operational areas for us was increase in

cash conversion and we ensured we progress on the

same every quarter. The Net cash position at the end of

the year was ₹ 3,278 Million as compared to ₹ 900 Million

as at the end of last year. Our days of sales outstanding

(DSO) came down from 87 days as at the end of last

year to 66 days as at the end of the current year. We will

continue to focus on the same going forward.

Thus, FY20 was a great start to the ‘New’ KPIT and we

were looking forward to a similar or better year going

forward.

The year ahead:

As the year was progressing well, the world witnessed

a never seen before phenomenon – the Covid-19

pandemic. The whole world is putting up a united fight

against the virus and these are extraordinary times

experienced by one and all.

As the pandemic started spreading its wings by the mid

of the last quarter, we acted very swiftly and worked on

enabling Work From Home (WFH) for all our employees

across the globe after due approvals from customers

and regulatory authorities, wherever required. Employee

safety and Customer Deliverables were the two primary

things that we focused on and within a period of

around 3 weeks we enabled more than 95% of WFH

for our employees. The industry that we focus on viz.

Mobility also faced initial problems due to the pandemic

and strict lockdowns across countries, globally. The

automotive industry is slowly gaining lost ground and it

is a matter of time before the industry gets back fully in

action to address the growing demands of its customers.

In view of the current pandemic and the resultant

economic situation, we have reoriented ourselves and

reset our goals for the coming year and the Top 4 goals

are as follows:

1.

People: The well-being of our people is of

paramount importance to us and for the first half

of the year we have chosen continuity of jobs over

continuity of remunerations. All our employees have

a variable component in their salary and everyone

will most likely end up forgoing a part of this:

INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEIR

ADEQUACY

The CEO & CFO certification provided elsewhere in this

Annual Report discusses the adequacy of internal control

systems and procedures in place.

RISKS AND CONCERNS

A separate report on Enterprise Risk Management is

provided elsewhere in this Annual Report.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC NOTE

The rapid outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID – 19)

presents an alarming health crisis that the world is

grappling with. The impacts of COVID-19 pandemic

are unfolding in real time. The COVID-19 outbreak is

expected to have an impact on the economies of the

affected countries and the international markets.

Countries across the globe resorted to lockdowns,

resulting in shutting down the manufacturing & services

activities and bringing the global supply-chain to a

grinding halt. Globally across all industries, companies

are working hard to recoup revenue losses, manage

costs, keep employees safe and at the same time ensure

uninterrupted service to the clients. KPIT has received

many testimonials from its existing clients for its

seamless remote delivery model & managing this crisis

effectively.

KPIT is working on bringing in appropriate changes

in the business model to tackle the possible future

uncertainties in economic conditions due to the global

pandemic and taking appropriate measures to control

its cost structure. We will continue to build on the work

we have done over the past years to drive efficiency

in operations and strengthen the foundations of the

business.

Since beginning of March, KPIT started working on

business continuity enabling its employees work

remotely to ensure both employee safety and service

to customers with due necessary approvals from the

customers as well as regulatory authorities in various

countries. We are glad to inform that by end of March

31, 2020, KPIT had over 95% of its global staff working

from remote locations. While direct vehicle sales and

manufacturing plants of our customers were directly

impacted, KPIT revenue model did not have direct impact

since its revenue model is not linked to direct vehicles

sold during the year.

In view of pandemic relating to COVID-19, KPIT has

considered internal and external information and

has performed sensitivity analysis based on current:
