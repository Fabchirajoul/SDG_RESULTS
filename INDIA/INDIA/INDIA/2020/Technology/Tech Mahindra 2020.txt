Dear Shareholders,

It’s a new day. A new world. A new normal. The world

has changed in the last six months and what we have

witnessed, weathered and traversed in the last

six months has transformed our perspective, and how!

As I write this: letter, we have only started to recover

from the immediate impact of COVID-19. In a short

time, the pandemic has had a far-reaching impact

globally, impacting the economy, our society and

human life in all aspects. And yet, amidst all

of this, we have seen some magnificent examples

of human resilience, solidarity and innovation.

When the pandemic broke out, we had two key

priorities - the safety and wellbeing of our people and

business continuity of our customers. We facilitated

work-from-home for over 90% of our associates while

safeguarding those attending office. We surpassed

customer expectations with our continuous connect,

seamless delivery and data security measures.

We adopted a new #DistantButConnected logo to

convey our solidarity in the global war against COVID-19,

as well as our commitment to #WellnessFirst. Leadership

teams and support functions worked round the clock

to ensure associates remained safe, connected,

informed and motivated. I thank every TechMighty for

staying together as one family always, but especially

during this crisis.

The year that was

In retrospect, our focus on becoming an increasingly

agile, resilient and future-ready company has helped

us overcome changing business challenges in the

globally disruptive environment. We were able to

leverage our digital prowess to create sustainable

solutions, catalyse societal growth and contribute

positively to climate action.

Looking at some of the key performance highlights for

the year, Communications Vertical has grown by 6.8%

in constant currency terms, driven by modernisation

spend and pre-5G work. We announced a strategic

collaboration with AT&T, to accelerate its network

application, shared systems modernisation and

movement to cloud. The Enterprise business, although

impacted by weaker macro trends in select verticals,

grew by 4.7% constant currency terms. We signed

the largest Enterprise deal in history in Insurance and

Annuities space. We announced net new deal wins of

$3.71 Billion, significantly higher than $1.67 Billion in

FY19. Our digital offerings were strengthened with the

acquisition of Born Group, Mad*Pow, Zen3 and Cerium.

Our focus on cash collections helped us generate $

523 Million of free cashflow, while we returned capital

to our shareholders through the completion of our

maiden buyback. We also announced a higher dividend

of ` 15 for FY20. Overall, it was a satisfactory year, with

revenues at $ 5,181.9 Million and profit after tax at

$ 566.8 Million.

Our ESG focus: co-creating a better world

We focused on environment, social and

governance in all aspects of our work and tried to

innovatively solve problems by connecting ESG with

business results.

We are at par with global practices in technology

disruption, climate change and water scarcity,
