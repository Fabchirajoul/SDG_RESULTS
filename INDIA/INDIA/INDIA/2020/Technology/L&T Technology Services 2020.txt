Managing Director’s Message

I hope all of you are staying safe and

well during these extraordinary times.

Despite the global crisis caused by the

COVID pandemic towards the end of

the fiscal year, our Company remains

well-positioned to help our customers

navigate through the turbulent new

normal.

Over the last decade, there have been

multiple external challenges as well

as disruptive technological shifts that

we have had to overcome, and LTTS

has emerged stronger because of it.

This has been possible because of a

combination of distinct Engineering

DNA, a concentrated focus on ER&D

services and an underlying culture of

innovation.

LTTS has benefited immensely from

its parent L&T’s engineering heritage

over eight decades spanning multiple

domains and disciplines. Our ability

to leverage this engineering expertise

and cross-pollinate technologies from

one segment to another has been

the defining factor that has helped us

to maintain our leadership position

across all five industry segments, a fact

that is also validated by the annual

Zinnov Zones ratings where we have

maintained our leadership position year

after year.

Today, LTTS has well-defined offerings

in each of our segments helping us

expand our customer engagement

size. In a span of a few years, LTTS’

technology portfolio has grown, as we

successfully merged our strong domain

knowledge in engineering with new-

age technologies. Our suite of Digital

Engineering offerings prepares the

roadmap for mobility and autonomy,

provides affordable healthcare for the

masses, helps develop semiconductor

chip designs for 3D Cameras and: Dear Shareholders,

Having achieved the distinction

of being India’s #1 pure-play

ER&D services company, we

are committed to our vision of

being the world’s leading ER&D

Services Company and an agent

of transformation for global

industries.
