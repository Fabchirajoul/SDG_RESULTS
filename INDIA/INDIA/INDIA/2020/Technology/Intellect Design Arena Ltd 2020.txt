letter, I started reflecting on

the last four years' journey of Intellect. As you know,

Intellect de-merged from Polaris Consulting Services

in October 2014. The initial steps of organising the

company around the four business units, listing

Intellect in the stock exchanges, identifying talent for

each of the business lines, and building a brand

around Intellect, were allcompleted in the ﬁrst 18

months. Soon after that, we started accelerating our

progress across the six capitals of Brand, End

Customer, Leadership, IP, Execution and Finance -

represented by BELIEF as an acronym.

In 2016-17, we commenced the Intellect iGTB -

Oxford Leadership programme that has now become

a marquee signature event, looked forward to and

attended by the who’s who of the Global Transaction

Banking industry. We also commenced design of

Go-To-Market strategies for our products. On the IP: Letter to Shareholders

unique Design Thinking-led approach, the certainty in

implementation guaranteed by our Delivery

Excellence framework and our flexible commercial

models – all elaborated later in the report – it’s truly

‘My agenda, my way’ for our customers.

The Future Does Hold a Promise

While the pandemic that we are in the midst of did

unleash a sense of gloom and despair around us, our

investments, our IP assets, our talent pool and our

brand prowess have collectively put us in good

stead. In the ﬁrst 75 days of this Financial Year, we

have mastered the art of running the business

remotely – conducting demos, e-meeting customers,

submitting proposals, winning deals, signing

contracts and going live in key deliveries. We were

seamlessly on our feet in the remote working mode

in less than 24 hours and have managed key

business functions without a let-up. While the

Governments, public institutions and the medical

fraternity are doing their best, I urge each of us , as

individuals and organisations, to stay safe and

discharge our responsibility to the communities

around us and to ourselves.

Well-prepared and therefore optimistic, we look

forward to the days when the pandemic will be behind

us. We are conﬁdent of cashing in on the

opportunities as outlined above and look forward to

reverting to you with stories of success!

I thank you for your support, and continued faith and

conﬁdence in Intellect!

I also wish to place on record my deep appreciation

for all the stakeholders - customers who have trusted

us, our business partners, vendors, our associates

and our bankers - who have been with us in this

journey.

With fully mature products

that are comprehensive in

their User Journeys and

architecturally superior

and a lean and agile

implementation

methodology, we are

ready to leapfrog into our

monetisation phase.:
