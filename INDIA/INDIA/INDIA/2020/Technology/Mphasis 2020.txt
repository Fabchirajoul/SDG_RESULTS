OUTLOOK

Technology companies globally have spent the past few years advising businesses to pivot their strategy to be ‘Digital first’. As

the ever-changing demand of consumers, powered by their new expectations through use of smart phones, increase pressure on

businesses; the only way enterprises can count on surviving and thriving is by being agile, nimble and disruptive. However, what the

world did not anticipate is a pandemic, that is literally, a bolt from the blue; causing economies to grind to a halt. This has impacted

global supply chains, financial markets, international and domestic travel, crude oil prices, retail and consumer businesses among

others. The latest Global Financial Stability Report shows that the financial system has already felt a significant impact, and a further

spiralling of the crisis could affect global financial constancy.

As we step into the ‘New Abnormal’, universally we will undoubtedly witness short to medium term impact, including spike in volatility,

deterioration in market liquidity, stress in funding markets, surge in public borrowings and plummeting of the asset prices all leading

to a shrinking economy. However, monetary, fiscal and financial policies by various economies will work to cushion the impact of the

pandemic shock and to ensure a steady, sustainable recovery once the virus is under control. The pandemic, although extensive in

its impact on industry, is not indicative of a structural change; it does not signal a break in the system. It is a pause, and growth will

return and markets will self-correct.

What is most critical for organizations to action in the new abnormal is to think ahead and strategize on two core aspects. In the

short term - how to manage a gradually re-opening of business, focusing on key products and services, restructuring their priorities

as well as employee and customer initiatives. Once this starts to take root, enterprise focus is likely to very quickly pivot to focusing

on how to trigger the next wave of business growth. Going by the imperative that the pandemic has occasioned to virtualize nearly

every industry, undoubtedly harnessing technology in all its forms is going to be a deciding factor for how companies survive and stay

ahead. While the tsunami of exponential technological advancements continues to stack over one another, both in scale and impact;

the technology industry will continue to write the operating system for digital global economy, one thing becomes more certain: digital

adoption will accelerate exponentially. Even the most tightly regulated industries, including banking, insurance and healthcare will

accelerate transforming business operations with urgency seamlessly and at scale. While it is tempting to backburner digital strategy,

organizations need to rapidly rethink business models with digital first approach by embracing all forms of modernization and digital

transformation to shorten time scales thus enabling end-to-end digital transaction and integration to emerge stronger than before and

survive these testing times.

From the dotcom bust to 9/11 to the great recession, disruptions have thwarted digital strategies. According to Forrester Research,

“CIOs even have a cost-cutting playbook that starts with hardware haircutting and elimination of new projects. But organizations that

contained costs during past disruptions felt pressure from companies that took a pro-investment approach when the global economy

rebounded.”

In certain cities where there are challenges for employees residing in Paying Guest

accommodations and have been asked to vacate; we are providing alternate accommodation.

So, employees do not have to travel back home, as by travelling you put yourself, and your

near and dear ones at risk.

We have extensive online collaboration capabilities for all employees to communicate with each other and with

clients. We are working tirelessly to help everyone stay safe while at the same time continuing to serve our

customers. When we come out on the other side of this situation, we will no doubt be held in good stead for

having displayed this approach.

letter is written to all our suppliers

on the code of conduct to be followed by them

while dealing with us. This: letter is also part of the

supplier enrolment form to ensure that before we

empanel them, they are aware of the code of

conduct and follow the same. Most of our high

value procurements are from vendors where

sustainability is paramount. Additionally, we

encourage local procurement by requiring that

suppliers exist in the same geography as the

facilities served. Approximately 1.5% of our needs

are met by local suppliers.

Supplier performance evaluation: The

procurement department is responsible for

providing performance feedback to key suppliers at

least once a year. The supplier’s performance

review involves assessing the supplier’s

deliverables on key projects and giving a rating that

reflects their performance. The evaluation is done

on non-price parameters like technology,

flexibility, quality, performance to commitments

and communication. Additional criteria can be

added depending on the project or commodity.

Supplier screening: All procurements over INR 25

Lakhs are routed through our Negotiation

Committee consisting of three members which are

procurement representative, Finance representative

and user group representative. These three

members scrutinize all the vendors and do the

selection. While conducting a sourcing event,

preference is given to diverse suppliers. It

encourages the use of suppliers who are minority

owned, women owned, veteran owned, LGBT

owned, disabled owned, SME etc. in the supply

chain.

Diverse suppliers with growth potential can be

selected even if they are not the most competitive

in a sourcing process. However, the standard

procurement process will be followed.

Managing our Water Footprint

Water conservation is essential for a water stressed

country like India and we have stepped upon to

conserve this priceless resource. Our core operations

are not water resource dependent, but it is used for

drinking, for kitchen use and for lavatories.

Wastewater generated from the use is reused and

recycled to the extent possible and it is used for

landscaping, gardening or toilet flushing.

We have also installed water aerators to reduce our

water consumption from operations.

Water aerators

Creating awareness and engaging employees: We

have nurtured an enabling environment for employees

to help them reduce their impacts. Through regular

events in partnership with various NGOs, internal

awareness campaigns and demand side management

approaches, we regularly encourage positive

environmental action in our employees.

Concern towards environment is promoted by

sending regular e-mails to the organization that

highlight the benefits of simple activities like taking

the stairs, carpooling, turning off lights and

computers when not in use to reduce overall carbon

footprint. By linking employee behaviour to carbon

emissions, and providing them with opportunities to

reduce their footprint, we have seen a decline in our

monthly carbon emissions data.
