Letter

to Fellow Shareholders

27 Years of Service to Nation

deep and mile-wide strategy of other Defence players. For almost

three decades, we have adhered to the Zen philosophy of ‘Less is

More’. Having established ourselves deeply in training solutions for

defence forces, Zen is now ready to explore non-training segments.

In addition to adjacent defence segment it also includes non-defence

segments like medical devices. We have conviction that medical

devices is a ield in which your Company can establish itself well. As

usual, it will be a convex bet - small investment with a potential upside

which is very huge. To ensure that such a venture doesn’t dilute our

current eforts and prospects, the medical devices venture will be a

distinct and separate efort.

With full support from the management, we hope that medical

devices industry will be a faster and predictable and sustainable

revenue generator and our venture into this ield will be very fruitful.

COVID-19: Opportunity in Crisis

COVID-19 has expanded the thinking within your Company. Almost all

key employees did few online courses to deepen the understanding of

the theoretical underpinning for the work we do. This has resulted in

better understanding and the team coming to the same page. Also, we

have done innovations in marketing that has improved our customer

reach signiicantly. While our revenues may take a temporary dip, our

optimism is at its highest today. We expect big orders to materialize in

the coming months, especially after the COVID-19 panic is over.

COVID-19 has completely reinforced, the once optional, but now

almost mandatory work option: Work-from-home. Or the more

aggressive, work-from-anywhere. For knowledge workers this will

become the new 5-day week. Companies that don’t ofer WFH will

have to forego a huge talent pool. Companies like Zen, that do

extremely sensitive work, are inding it challenging to give WFH to

some employees. However, newer technologies are helping us realise

what was till now thought impossible. As of now, we are in transition,

and expect to make some progress during the year.

While the Government announced a slew of measures to delay the

pain of MSMEs, your Company did not need to take advantage of

restructuring of loans, or moratorium on repayments ofered by the

banks. In fact, one long-term loan which your Company availed was

prepaid and foreclosed out of internal accruals. Your Company has

become Zero debt. We have seen that some banks have become very

predatory in nature and are asking for their pound of lesh even during:

letter however due to global pandemic

COVID-19 we expect the coming quarters to be subdued but for Long-term, your Company is very positive and optimistic.

We are thankful to all the stakeholders for reposing conidence into the Company’s business model and its management.
