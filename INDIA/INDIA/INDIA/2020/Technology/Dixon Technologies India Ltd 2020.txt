MANAGING DIRECTOR

Can you elaborate on the

achievements and highlights of

your business segments?

Our continued efforts to reduce cost

and improved focus on operational

restructuring have accelerated our

achievements across business verticals.

Revenue from consumer electronics

segment grew by 76% over the previous

fiscal, reaching H 209,522 Lakhs in FY

2019-20. We expect the segment to

deliver sustained growth in the near

short-term, after we complete the

capacity expansion of our television

segment. We are also doubling our

assembly and process lines for LCM

and PCBA to further reduce our delivery

time. The addition of new customers,

an increased order book from our

anchor customers and the likelihood of

getting some more reputed clients in the

In a rapidly evolving business

environment, how does Dixon

continue to remain relevant and

improve its market leadership?

Can we have some insight on how

business integration is helping

reap operational excellence and

other tangible results?

Given the recent advances in technology and

product innovation at a breakneck speed,

we at Dixon, have shown the propensity

to remain relevant. In the context of rapid

changes in business environment, we

have demonstrated a resilient attitude to

underpin innovation and quality to deliver

multiple and innovative products to our

diverse customer base. We continue to

leverage our integrated business model and

state-of-the-art manufacturing capacities

along with our robust R&D capabilities to

strengthen our foundation and deliver

sustainable value for all stakeholders.

As we continue to emerge as a leading

ODM and OEM player in the electronics

and consumer products segment, our

operational excellence forms the corner

stone of our success story. This was largely

possible on account of backward integration

across key business segments, structured

over a period of time and on account of

our fungible assets which enhances our

operational leverage. These assets have

largely helped us in scaling our production

capacities across verticals. We have seen

multiple benefits arising from our integrated

business model. It has helped to increase

capacity utilisation, improved quality

standards and reduced operating costs,

thereby improving margins. It has also led

to the addition of more customers, widened

our topline and increased order capacity

from existing customers.

Overview and State of Company’s Affairs

India’s GDP growth rate is estimated to be 5% and Gross Value

Added (GVA) is estimated to be 4.9% in FY 2019-20. The

softening of growth, in comparison to the previous year, was on

account of multiple headwinds such as slowdown in private final

consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation. The

Indian economy was going through a cyclical slowdown during

most part of FY 2019-20, and was expected to revive in the next

fiscal with the GDP growth expected to touch 6% on FY 2020-

21. However, on account of the restrictions imposed to curb the

outbreak of COVID-19 in the country starting March 2020, a

significant disruption is expected across multiple sectors, which

could negatively impact the outlook. Although the government

has announced measures to mitigate the crisis, the quantum and

duration of impact on the Indian economy is yet to be realized.
