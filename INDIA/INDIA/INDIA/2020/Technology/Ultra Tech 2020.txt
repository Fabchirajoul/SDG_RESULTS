Letter

to Shareholders

Dear Shareholder,

COVID-19 and the associated

lockdowns across countries have

triggered

a

once-in-a-century

crisis for the society and the

economy in 2020. January now

seems like a month of a bygone

era – such has been the enormity

of change. This is a defining

period in human and business

history: one that will test the

resilience of individuals, societies,

corporations, and nations.

Given the fog of uncertainty all

around, it is hard to be prescient

in these times. But there is little

doubt on one reality: companies

with quality leadership, sound

business

fundamentals,

and

a track record of winning in

turbulent times, will emerge as

champions in the new global

order.

Global Economy

It has been several months since

the pandemic engulfed the world

and yet there is a lot of uncertainty

with respect to the extent of the

economic contraction due to this

crisis, and the subsequent pace of

recovery.

This year will see an economic

contraction,

but

this

2020

recession

is

turning

out

very different from the past

recessions. It has been too

Mr. Aditya Vikram Birla

We live by his values.

Integrity, Commitment,

Passion, Seamlessness

• Keeping

in

line

with

its

premium

positioning, UltraTech added various

new value-added products like UltraTech

Super, UltraTech Premium and UltraTech

Weather Plus. Sales of these new

products scaled to over 8% of UltraTech’s

total sales in FY20.

I am pleased to report that your Company

has taken rapid strides in its Sustainability

journey. Over the last 3 years, the use of

Alternative Fuel and Raw Materials, has

increased almost two-fold. The WHRS

capacity has doubled to 118 MW in FY20.

Also, the solar and wind capacity has crossed

99 MW compared to none three years ago.

UltraTech is 2.8x water positive and 2.11x

plastic negative (i.e. we consume less than

what we recycle). In the RMC business,

UltraTech has won the prestigious award

from Economic Times for “Innovation for

Sustainability”.

UltraTech was featured amongst the top 10

companies on the Dow Jones Sustainability

Index (DJSI) in the construction material

category. This has enabled your Company to

now benchmark itself against world’s best

corporations in sustainability performance.

Your Company has also been recognised

as one of India’s Great Places to Work and

among the Best in the Industry by the Great

Places to Work® Institute in 2020.

Conclusion

FY20 is not just another fiscal. Never has the

transition between two financial years been

as tumultuous for the global economy. The

pandemic is no doubt, a sobering reminder of

how the world can change in unforeseeable

ways.

As COVID-19 gets quelled and the global

economy reawakens, endurance will pave

the way for renewal — for individuals and

corporations alike. When we emerge from the

coronavirus, I have no doubt that the world

will recognise and celebrate corporations

that are exemplars of good governance and

sustainable growth. You can count on your

Company as being one of them.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Shareholders,

Your Directors present the Twentieth Annual Report together

with the Audited Accounts of your Company for the year ended

31st March, 2020.

OVERVIEW AND THE STATE OF YOUR COMPANY’S

AFFAIRS

2019-20 was a year of contrasting global economic scenarios.

Marred by trade wars and the weakening economic scenario

in China, the global outlook remained weak during the

initial months. This was worsened by the slow growth in the

manufacturing sectors, which were either hit by a recession

or close to it, across many countries.

In an effort to revive the economic growth, central banks

offered support in the form of favourable monetary policies,

with some countries such as China, providing an additional

stimulus to enable fast-paced revival. The latter part of CY19

saw some relief, with diminished risk of a no-deal Brexit and

as the uneasy trade hostilities between China and the United

States came to a halt. This was supported by easing of the

financial conditions, as stimulus provided by central banks

began to filter through. While global financial conditions

started indicating signs of improvement in the second half

of the calendar year, rising debt levels posed a future threat

to the economy.

The domestic economy also witnessed a slowdown in FY20 as

the GDP growth rate was pegged at 4.2%. This was primarily

on account of weak demand across sectors, tightening of

credit, and the lingering effect of previous policy measures.

A key development, however, was the decline in the prices

of crude, oil and coal, on the back of moderation in global

economic activities.

Several steps were taken to address the situation, including

monetary easing by the Reserve Bank of India throughout the

fiscal year; introduction of reforms to improve ease of doing

business; steps to liberalise FDI; lower corporate income tax

rates and disinvestment plans by the Government of India

among other measures.

The cement industry, after witnessing a healthy demand

growth of ~13% in 2018-19, exhibited slowdown with

de-growth. Apart from the general economic slowdown,

cement demand was sluggish during H1FY20 post the general

elections in April-May, 2019. H2FY20 witnessed extended

monsoons, low-capital expenditure on infrastructure and

road activities, along with financial stress in the NBFC and

housing sectors. Though the demand started indicating some

signs of improvement since December, 2019, the momentum

could not be sustained due to the outbreak of the COVID-19

pandemic. This severely impacted construction activities,

which consequently resulted in the industry witnessing

de-growth for the year, the first time in the last two

decades.

With anticipated pick-up in private investment, financial

sector reforms and resolution of stressed assets under the

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, expected to contribute

to cleaning up of banks’ balance sheets and positive

interventions by the Government of India, the outlook for

fiscal 2020-21 was seen to remain largely positive. These

initiatives, coupled with the fact that the fundamentals of

the Indian economy remain intact, were expected to have

a positive impact on economic growth and demand for

cement.

Just when the sector was reviving, the world was hit by the

COVID-19 pandemic. With no cure presently available, the

virus has become one of the biggest threats to the global

economy.

India has been no exception to the impact of COVID-19, which

spread across the country rapidly. In this unprecedented

situation, the Government announced a nationwide lockdown

beginning from 25th March, 2020 to curb the spread of

the virus. In line with the Government’s directive and to

contain the impact of the virus, manufacturing activities

across sectors came to a standstill. However, to mitigate

hardship to the public, select activities were allowed to

operate from 20th April, 2020, after due compliance with

the lockdown guidelines and preparatory arrangements

with social distancing in offices, workplace, factories and

establishments.

As a responsible corporate citizen, your Company has initiated

various steps across the country to fight the coronavirus

outbreak. Our teams across our facilities in India are working

with Government authorities and the local administration

to support the fight against this pandemic. Collectively, it

has helped more than half a million people. The magnitude

of work can be ascertained from the fact that the teams

have so far provided people with over 1.80 lakhs free meals,

0.50 lakh grocery kits, 6 lakhs masks and hand sanitisers,

and over 1 lakh medical PPEs, hand gloves and other items

like soap, disinfectants, etc. Alongside, online learning and

wellness programmes have been organised for the employees

and business associates.

The nationwide lockdown, amid the coronavirus outbreak,

will have a significant near-term impact on the cement

industry. While the sector witnessed robust demand prior to

the lockdown, the event led to the closure of all major cement

plants, including those of your Company, and cessation

of construction activities at the sites. This brought your

Company’s cement dispatches to a complete halt. As a result,

volumes were negligible during the last week of March, 2020

and the whole of April, 2020.

Once the lockdown is fully relaxed, the migrant task force

is expected to return from their native towns and resume

activity at the construction sites in about 10-15 days. Similarly,

the companies are also expected to take a week to ramp up

the activities within the plants post relaxation. Increase in

Government spends on health and public welfare; weak real

estate and an overall slowdown in the economy is expected

to reflect in a subdued performance of your Company in the

current financial year. Nonetheless, given your Company’s

healthy credit profile, it is confident of its ability to weather

the storm and come out stronger.

It is against this backdrop, that we share your Company’s

performance during FY20.

Cement production at 76.57 million tonnes in FY20 is lower

by 2% as compared to 77.87 million tonnes in the previous

year. This is mainly attributable to the de-growth in the

cement industry, witnessed after 20 years. Consequently,

capacity utilisation was also lower at 69% as compared to

76% last year.

During the year, your Company acquired the Cement

Business of Century Textiles and Industries Limited

(“Century”) having a capacity of 14.6 MTPA (“Century

Cement Business”). In terms of the order dated

3rd July, 2019 passed by the National Company Law Tribunal,

Mumbai Bench (“NCLT”), the Appointed Date for the

Scheme of Demerger amongst Century, your Company and

their respective shareholders and creditors (“Scheme of

Demerger”) was 20th May, 2018. Consequently, your Company

has restated its financial statements with effect from

20th May, 2018, to include the performance of the Century

Cement Business.

Your Company also commissioned a 2.0 MTPA cement

grinding capacity at Bara, Uttar Pradesh, taking its total

capacity in India to 111.35 MTPA, including 6.25 MTPA capacity

of its wholly owned subsidiary, UltraTech Nathdwara Cement

Limited (“UNCL”). Your Company’s consolidated capacity

stands at 114.8 MTPA, including its overseas operations,

which makes it the 3rd largest cement player globally,

excluding China.

reasonable price. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities

and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due. The

Group’s treasury team is responsible for liquidity, funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes

and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Group’s liquidity

position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.
