Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

At Sanofi, we are committed to the dual purpose of doing well, and,

doing good at the same time. The last twelve months have shown us

the importance of this purpose, and its central role in guiding all that we

do. We do well when our medicines reach the people who need them and

make a difference to their lives. At the same time, we do good for society

when our contribution is maximized through our activities, whether it is our

commitment to promoting health in India or improving access to care or building

an inclusive and diverse company where employees can bring their best selves

to work.

Through the pandemic, your Company has stayed focused on three key priorities: safety, supply and service - affirming the

safety and well-being of all our employees and partners; ensuring uninterrupted supply of essential medicines; and

maintaining business continuity of our operations by adopting new ways of working to serve our customers, employees,

partners and patients.

The scale of infectious and non-communicable diseases continues to call for crucial, new treatments and better access to

healthcare. A growing and rapidly ageing population combined with prevailing unhealthy lifestyles have led to a growing

number of patients suffering from chronic diseases. Furthermore, rapid urbanization and an expanding and affluent middle

class have led to a rising demand for better healthcare. The Indian pharmaceutical industry, which is currently valued at

$41 billion, is thus expected to grow to $65 billion by 2024, and $120-130 billion by 2030.

The pandemic has shown that many aspects of society and the economy are negatively affected by a healthcare crisis. It

has impacted every part of our society and changed the way we live and work. Pressures across the entire healthcare value

chain are resulting in reforms and innovation in business models. Technological advances are delivering new and

transformational outcomes, which are capable of being executed at scale. Digitalization represents an opportunity to offer

more personalized healthcare for the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases.
