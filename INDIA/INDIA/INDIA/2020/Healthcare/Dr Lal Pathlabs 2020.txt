Dear Shareholders,

We have concluded another year with consistent focus

on delivering quality diagnostics with the help of our

highly trained staff that delivers the best quality in

diagnostics in India. India largely remains underserved

in terms of reliable testing despite there being an

abundance of laboratories all over. During the past

year our brand has continued to provide benchmarked

services affordably, while also adding to the test menu

and network reach.

Financial year 2020 will however get remembered for

the impact that the CoVID-19 pandemic delivered to

our industry. As a well-established national brand Dr. Lal

PathLabs was able to swiftly respond to this situation.

At the outset we formed a dedicated task force to

address all CoVID-19 related issues operationally and

strategically. Steps were taken to ensure availability of

reagents and other important supplies so as to maintain

uninterrupted service. We also leveraged our digital

infrastructure to convey to all patients about zero

disruption at our laboratories and collection centres,

and further increased our home collection in key cities

as well as promoted online booking of tests. While

doing this, we made sure that all our costs were kept in

check during these difficult times.

We take pride in sharing that we were one of the first

private laboratories in India to have got approval to

begin testing for CoVID-19. Thus three laboratories in

our network including the National Reference Lab at

Delhi, the Regional Reference Lab at Kolkata and Central

Lab at Indore are rendering this service. We continue

to liaise with the concerned State Governments to

meet their testing requirements efficiently and as per

prescribed norms.:

Managing Director

For FY2019-20, we witnessed positive growth of

11% in revenues and 14% in profit after tax. The

performance could have been much better, but for

the CoVID-19 disruption towards the end of the

year. During the year under review, we served 19.4

million patients and processed 47.7 million samples.

Volumes have been enhanced by our bundled test

packages under ‘SwasthFit’ and targeted offerings

like ‘Sugar and Me’. Such offerings are witnessing

growing popularity because they provide greater

value for our patients, thereby contributing to higher

sampling.

We have a robust hub and spoke model network

with pan-India presence. Overall, we have 216

clinical laboratories (including National Reference

Lab, Delhi and Regional Reference Lab, Kolkata),

3,095 patient service centres (PSCs) and 6,995

pickup points (PUPs), as on March 31, 2020. Further

our test menu comprises of 455 test panels, 2,537

pathology tests and 1,961 tests related to radiology

and cardiology among others during the period. By

leveraging our strength and brand equity in existing

markets and expanding judiciously into newer

ones, we have been able to sustain our growth

momentum. We expect this momentum to persist,

helping us cater to more patients across country.

The CoVID-19 pandemic notwithstanding we are

very prudent with costs management and have been

spearheading productivity enhancing initiatives

during the year. The pandemic has strengthened

our resolve as we reassess strategies and optimise

our spends. With a clear belief in the potential of

the industry we maintain our the long-term vision

for growth and will resume multiple initiatives

actively towards further expanding operations as

the situation allows.

I would like to conclude by thanking all of our

stakeholders for being a vital part of our journey.

I would also like to thank our Board of Directors

for their constant guidance. I also express my deep

appreciation to the countless investors, employees,

vendors and patients for their continued support

and trust in the company.

iii. Creating opportunities for employees to participate in

socially responsible initiatives.

The Corporate Social Responsibility Committee consisting of the

Board of Directors monitor the CSR initiatives. Some of the key

initiatives taken up last year are:

Skill Development in the ﬁeld of Paramedics:

Lal PathLabs Foundation is helping in the skilling and

employment of the unemployed rural youths, through well-

established training centers, in the area of paramedics as per

standard norms of Health Sector Skill Council (HSSC - NSDC)

and Indian Medical Association (IMA). After training, we also

facilitate the process to get in to job as per their eligibility and

choice in their geographical areas.

1.

Lal PathLabs Foundation has two Skill Development

Training Centres namely ‘Centre for Excellence’ in Gurugram

(Haryana) and Kolkata (West Bengal). Under this initiative,

they are providing training in the area of Medical Laboratory

Technologies and Phlebotomy. Candidates with science

background in 10+2 who want to make their career in allied

health services are the ideal for the course. These centres

are affiliated with Health Sector Skill Council (HSSC -

NSDC) and Indian Medical Association (IMA). Kolkata centre

inaugurated its courses in March 2020. During financial year

2019-20, they have trained total 61 candidates, certified 58

candidates and placed 40 candidates, while 141 and 10

candidates are there in ongoing batches at Gurugram and

Kolkata centres, respectively.

2.

Lal PathLabs Foundation has been implementing Skill

Development Training centre with the help of NGOs like

‘Institute of Livelihood Research and Training’ (ILRT - B Able)

and Sambhav Foundation (LabourNet), in Lucknow, Meerut,

Kanpur (UP) Jaipur and Udaipur (Rajasthan). These centres

provide training to underprivileged youth preferably

from rural areas in Phlebotomy. Candidates with science

background in 10+2 who want to make their career in allied

health services are the ideal for the course. These centres

are affiliated with Health Sector Skill Council (HSSC - NSDC).

These centres help to create sustainable and dignified

livelihood opportunity for the rural youth by providing

training and employment opportunities. During financial

year 2019-20, they trained a total of 196 candidates,

certified 98 candidates and placed 58 candidates, while

244 candidates are there in ongoing batches across all the

centres.

Non-Communicable Disease Management :

1.

Lal PathLabs Foundation is running Project Arogya, focused

on community-based interventions for Non-Communicable

Diseases’ Prevention and Control, in Kamroop (Assam) and

Lucknow (UP) with VHAI as their partner and in Shimla

(Himachal Pradesh), Patna and Vaishali (Bihar) with MAMTA

as implementation partner. The project is being run in

close co-ordination with National Health Mission (NHM)

and Department of Health & Family Welfare (DoHFW) of

the respective states. The focus of the project is to support

and strengthen the quality of the state Health System,

and Prevention & Control of NCDs. The objective of the

programme is to

•

Sensitize and educate target population about their

health, wellbeing and risk factors associated with

NCDs

•

Motivate them to adopt healthy lifestyle and food

habits through behaviour change

•

Help them in getting proper testing and treatment

at local government health facilities by making them

aware about NCDs.

In Bihar, this project is focusing on women in the age group

of 30 to 70 years for three most common cancers, oral,

breast and cervical cancers.

All this is achieved through community based screening and

proper referrals to the local government health facilities.

The grass root level functionaries from Health and ICDS

departments like the ANMs, ASHAs, AWWs, ICDS Supervisors

etc. have played a crucial role in effective implementation

of these projects. Under project Arogya, we are reaching out

to almost 29 Lac+ population including direct and indirect

beneficiaries.

2.

Under

Non-Communicable

Disease

initiative,

LPL

Foundation supported CHILD EYE, an NGO, to procure

health education books for Class VI. This initiative aims

to implement the Comprehensive School Health Program

(CSHP) which requires educating Class 6 students on Health

Education (HE) as a curriculum. It has been implemented in

three schools in Delhi.
