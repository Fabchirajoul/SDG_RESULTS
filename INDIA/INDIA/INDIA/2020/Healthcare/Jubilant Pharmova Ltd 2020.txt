OuTLOOk

The Company, in the near term, is focused on sustaining

its operational and financial performance in the current

uncertain scenario unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic

with medium term focus at ensuring sustainable growth

across our various businesses. In the near term to tide

over the COVID-19 pandemic led crisis, the Company

is deferring its major capex plans, without sacrificing

growth, until the business environment stabilises. The

Company is focused on generating healthy operating

cashflows to further reduce debt levels. We continue

to stay focused on our strategy of being closer to the

customer and of further strengthening our leadership

position in defined businesses.

CONCLuSION

We would like to thank all our valued stakeholders,

including

our

customers,

vendors,

lenders

and

shareholders for continuing their support and upholding

their confidence and trust in us. We remain deeply grateful

to all our employees globally for their contribution and

commitment to our organisation, especially during

the lockdown periods. We wish for safety of all our

stakeholders and their dear ones during these trying

circumstances.:

Letter and our Nanjangud facility received

an Official Action Indicated (OAI) classification

from the US FDA. The Nanjangud plant was a co-

inspection by US FDA and Health Canada. During

this financial year, Health Canada removed the OAI

classification for the Nanjangud plant and we expect

favourable resolution from the US FDA as well.

Regarding the Roorkee facility, we have submitted

comprehensive responses to the US FDA and have

completed remediation activities by consulting

with third party consultants and are hopeful of

clearance from US FDA once they re-inspect the

plant. At both the plants, we continue to service

our current operations but new product approvals

from the facilities are delayed. We are committed

to the highest level of compliance and quality and

are taking steps to ensure further stringent controls.

In addition to inspections by the US FDA, our sites

are also inspected by a number of other regulatory

agencies, including, Health Canada, Central Drugs

Standard Control Organisation in India, ANVISA

Brazil, PMDA Japan, TGA Australia and SAHPRA

South Africa.

(6) Offer an integrated business model that provides

products and services which are cost-effective

We expect to continue to optimise margins by

enhancing efficiencies in our integrated operations.

We believe the integrated business model we

have in place makes us well-positioned to deliver

products and services which are cost-effective. For

example, our Radiopharmaceuticals and Allergy

Therapy Products businesses are supported by

our CMO operations. We are also able to utilise

our network of radiopharmacies to distribute our

radiopharmaceutical products in the US. Our multi-

site manufacturing capabilities in North America

and India gives us flexibility and provides us with

cost advantages. In addition, our Solid Dosage

Formulations business line is supported by R&D

from India and is integrated into our low cost APIs

manufacturing in India. We aim to continue to

increase the share of solid dosage formulations

manufactured with the Company’s cost-competitive

in-house APIs manufactured in India. We also plan

to continue our focus on methods to optimise our

margins through business excellence programs

involving Lean Six Sigma initiatives, which are aimed

at productivity enhancement. In this regard, we

expect to achieve higher gross margins for many

of our new products and to improve our yields on

existing products by increasing capacity utilisation

for these products. We also aim to improve our

operating margins by leveraging our existing sales

capabilities and administrative functions across

an expanded revenue base as a result of expected

growth in our product portfolio, thereby gaining

scale in operations.

(7) Continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to further

consolidate leadership positions and accelerate

growth

We have historically grown the Pharmaceuticals

segment through a series of organic and inorganic

initiatives. For example, we started our Pharma

business with the acquisition of our Nanjangud

facility, followed by multiple acquisitions in the

United States, Canada and Europe. Most recently

in September 2017, we acquired substantially all of

the assets which comprised Triad’s Radiopharmacy

business. While we remain focused on driving the

growth of our business organically, we intend to

continue to pursue sizeable, strategic acquisitions to

further strengthen our portfolio, gain competitive:

Letter from the US FDA. We

are currently in the process of implementing remediation

measures at the facility and are hopeful of resolving the

issue at the earliest.

As on 31st March 2020, the business had 56 products

commercialised, including 32 in US, 15 in Canada, 29

in Europe and 29 in RoW. Also, we filed a total of 98

ANDA filings in US, 39 filings in Europe, 24 filings in

Canada and 41 filings in other RoW countries so far.

As on 31st March, 2020, we have received 63 ANDA

approvals in the US, 33 in Europe, 23 approvals in Canada

and 36 approvals in RoW markets.

During the year, we increased the oral solid dosage

capacity at our manufacturing facility in Roorkee, India

by one billion doses to meet the anticipated future

growth requirements. We are expanding our product

portfolio in oral solids and certain niches in Novel Drug

Delivery System (NDDS) with an objective of increasing

the contribution to revenue as we grow beyond the

traditional regulated markets. We will continue to

enhance our focus in the key RoW markets, wherein we

foresee significant growth opportunities. We currently

have approvals in key markets of Asia and Africa—

including South Africa, Philippines, and Malaysia, and a

large number of these approved products are already

commercialised. In Latin America, Middle East and

Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) markets, our

growth would be driven by new filings and new product

launches in key markets, including Brazil, Chile, UAE and

Ukraine.

Further, we continue to expand our operations in Europe,

which has been a consistent revenue contributor for our

global business over the years. We have built a strong

customer base of more than 35 customers in Europe

and we are continuously strengthening our product

portfolio with them. Further, our business in Canada and

Australia is expected to see significant growth based on

new launches and new partnerships. In the US market,

we are seeing product specific opportunities due to

rationalisation of product portfolio and plants by some

of our peers.

In our IBP business, we target the local formulations

(branded generics) market in India. The chosen

therapeutic areas include chronic specialties like

Cardiology, Diabetes, Neurology & Nephrology. These

segments are supported by multiple growth & economic

enablers which include higher awareness, longer life

spans, enhanced propensity to spend and evolving

lifestyle changes. For FY 2020, IBP business revenue stood

at ` 289 million as compared to ` 247 million in FY 2019.

Our IBP portfolio includes high growth molecules and

combinations of Rosuvastatin, Telmisartan, Teneligliptin,

Glimepiride, Cilnidipine and Voglibose. These primary

therapies are supported by supplementary or nutritional

formulations like Vitamin B12, Vitamin D3, Proton Pump

Inhibitor (PPI) and Pregabalin + B12 combination. The

growing portfolio is backed by distribution network

covering 30,000 retail points and robust field force of

approximately 225 sales representatives that serve

a network of 20,000 + health care professionals. The

HCP network includes Cardiologists, Diabetologists,

Nephrologists, Neurologists and consulting physicians.

Through its best in class marketing activities, the

business has joined hands with doctors to support them

on their mission of spreading awareness through diet

& medication on diseases like Hypertension, Diabetes,

Dyslipidaemia & heart failure.

We see ample growth opportunity in existing segments

and will evaluate additional products where we believe

we can make an impact in select & relevant therapies.

In FY 2020, IBP was one of the fastest growing companies

within Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) therapy in India.

We shall continue launching relevant products in the

CVD domain and at the same time evaluate interesting

opportunities and category adjacencies in other

segments/therapies to tap future growth.

We are one of the market leaders in the united states, based

on the market share of several key products and rank among

the top three for a few other products.:

Letter status. We continue to work with the US

FDA to bring the regulatory status of our API facility in a

complete state of compliance. We have also undertaken

significant remediation activities to resolve the Warning: Letter issued to our Jubilant Generics Limited, Roorkee

facility by the US FDA in March 2019 and the Form 483

observations issued in November 2019. We are working

very closely with the Agency and have provided them

with regular updates, we expect GMP status of this

facility should be resolved soon. Our Roorkee facility was

also inspected in November 2019 by TGA Australia and

received the highest compliance rating of A1 (Good).

Our Jubilant HollisterStier General Partnership - CMO

Montreal, Canada facility was inspected in December

2019 by Health Canada and the facility maintains its

compliant rating as a result of this inspection.

Jubilant Radiopharma division operates over 50

compounding nuclear pharmacies (Radiopharmacies)

and three PET (Positron Emission Tomography) drug

manufacturing facilities across twenty-two states in the

US. Our products are viewed as reliable and trusted in the

industry, as we procure, prepare, and deliver the highest

quality FDA-approved products, and fully support

and comply with USP compounding standards. Once

United States Pharmacopeia officially publishes the new

chapter, we will be compliant to the new chapter

guidelines. Our pharmacies are 'open formulary',

providing customers with a full array of options that

allow clinicians to achieve the greatest benefits for their

patients.

Regulatory standards for compounding radiopharmacy

facilities have been undergoing constant change over

the past few years, with regulatory agencies demanding

the highest quality products. During the financial

year ending 31st March, 2020, many of our facilities

underwent successful inspections by multiple regulatory

agencies, including the State Boards of Pharmacy,

US FDA, State Departments of Health and Radiation

Safety, and Environmental Protection Agency. There

letter of the

law, in both word and spirit. We believe in creating robust

processes that ensure that our operations are conducted

within the precincts set forth by the law of the land. To

ensure that we always remain abreast with the laws and

on top of our game, we have implemented an intranet

based application ‘EY Compliance Manager’ for our Indian

and North American manufacturing facilities. Compliance

Manager tool uses contemporary technology and helps

us with a single reporting framework across the Jubilant

Group for various clusters including: Environment,

Health & Safety (EHS), Human Resources (HR), Regulatory

Affairs, etc. It also helps in linking compliances to our

processes and where required, changing business

processes / policies. Compliance Manager tool also

helps us with real time MIS capability for the reviewer/

approver and management. The compliances are

reported and reviewed by the Board on a periodic

basis. Jubilant HollisterStier facility at Spokane US

successfully completed a periodic inspection by the State

Department of Ecology. Jubilant Cadista Pharmaceutical

Inc. facility at Salisbury, Maryland completed the

periodic inspection by - Maryland Department of the

Environment/City of Salisbury, Maryland. Jubilant

HollisterStier facility at Montreal inspected by Standards,

Fairness, Occupational Health and Safety Commission in

FY 2020.

At Nanjangud, our facility runs on zero liquid discharge

basis. Further improvement is made in segregation

of lean effluent streams that resulted in reducing

operational cost of effluent management. The operation

of the in-house liquid & Solid waste Incinerator

has been completely suspended by disposing of

such incinerable hazardous waste through Cement

Co-incineration

and

thereby

mitigating

risk

of

community health. Successful in-house piloting has been

done in the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) to further

reduce Volatile organic Compounds (VoC) emissions

while handling the process effluent carrying high-volatile

compounds and this being implemented at multiple

stages of effluent treatment plant. Changes have been

implemented in the hazardous ETP sludge handling

operations that has further improved the Housekeeping

and safety of labour handling these wastes.

At Nanjangud, we understand that safety and health of the

people is of paramount importance. We are committed

and ensure that the health and safety of our employees,

customers and the public at large is protected. We take

pride in managing our operation with a high concern for

EHS. Ever changing EHS regulations are being complied

and we understand these requirements are not only

license to operate but we are committed to comply them

beyond the requirement.

We ensure that the process safety reviews are assessed

through the external subject matter expert and the

recommendations are effectively executed to enhance

safer processes by effective process controls. Safety

culture in terms of safe behaviour of the people is being

aggressively promoted at workplace. People capability is

built within Line function to enhance the knowledge on

the safety management systems through various training

programs.

Site is equipped with well equipped Occupational Health

Centre (OHC) run by highly professional and experienced

occupational health physician and trained medical

staff. A comprehensive health assessment program is

ensured for all the people working within the facility. The

OHC provides curative, advisory and health promotion

services to the employees.

We have a full-fledged EHS team which continuously

address the matters of environmental safeguards and

health & Safety of the people and conduct periodical

safety assessments and audits.

Customer service: Jubilant operations fundamentally

focuses on Supply Level Adherence (SLA) and Right First

Time (RFT). By achieving excellence in these two key

metrics, high levels of customer service is automatically

achieved.

Capacity and Capabilities expansion: Our Roorkee,

India manufacturing facility completed the expansion

DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION POLICY

PURPOSE

In compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder (the ‘Act’) and Regulation 43A

of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (the

‘Listing Regulations’), as amended from time to time, this Policy provides guidance for declaration of dividend and its

pay-out by the Company. The Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) will consider the Policy while declaring / recommending

dividend on behalf of the Company. The Policy is not an alternative to the decision of the Board for recommending

/ declaring dividend, which takes into consideration all the relevant circumstances enumerated hereunder or other

factors as may be decided by the Board.

CONCEPT OF DIVIDEND

Dividend is the share of the profit that a company decides to distribute among its shareholders. The profits earned by the

company can either be retained in the business or can be distributed among the shareholders as dividend.

TYPES OF DIVIDEND

The Act deals with two types of dividend - Interim and Final.

•

Interim Dividend

Interim dividend is the dividend declared by the Board between two Annual General Meetings as and when

considered appropriate. The Board shall have the absolute power to declare interim dividend during the financial

year, as and when deemed fit. The Act authorises the Board to declare interim dividend during any financial year out

of the profits for the financial year in which the dividend is sought to be declared and/or out of the surplus in the

profit and loss account.

Normally, the Board could consider declaring an interim dividend after finalisation of quarterly (or half yearly)

financial statements.

•

Final Dividend

Final dividend is recommended for the financial year at the time of approval of the annual financial statements.

The Board shall have the power to recommend final dividend to the shareholders for their approval at the Annual

General Meeting of the Company.

DECLARATION OF DIVIDEND

Subject to the provisions of the Act, dividend shall be declared and paid out of:

A.

Profits of the Company for the year for which the dividend is to be paid after setting off carried over previous losses

and depreciation not provided in the previous year(s);

B.

Undistributed profits of the previous financial years after providing for depreciation in accordance with law and

remaining undistributed.:

Standalone Financial Statements:

Managing Director

(CCMD) of the Company are responsible for

allocating resources and assessing performance

of the operating segments, and accordingly,

identified as the chief operating decision maker.

Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, which

are common to the enterprise as a whole and are

not allocable to segments on a reasonable basis,

have been treated as "unallocated revenues/

expenses/ assets/ liabilities", as the case may be.

(r) Foreign currency translation

(i) Functional and presentation currency

The functional currency of the Company is

the Indian rupee. These financial statements

are presented in Indian rupee (`).

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated

into

the

functional

currency

using

the exchange rates at the dates of the

transactions. Foreign exchange gains and

losses resulting from the settlement of such

transactions and from the translation of

monetary assets and liabilities denominated

in foreign currencies at balance sheet date

exchange rates are generally recognised in

Statement of Profit and Loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured at

fair value in a foreign currency are translated

using the exchange rates at the date when

the fair value was determined. Translation

differences on assets and liabilities carried

at fair value are reported as part of the fair

value gain or loss. For example translation

differences on non-monetary assets such as

equity investments classified as FVOCI are

recognised in other comprehensive income

(OCI).

(s) Government grants

Grants from the government are recognised

at their fair value where there is a reasonable

assurance that the grant will be received and

the Company will comply with all attached

conditions.

Government grants relating to income are

deferred and recognised in the Statement

of Profit and Loss over the period necessary

to match them with the costs that they are

intended to compensate and presented within

other operating revenue.

Government grants relating to the purchase of

property, plant and equipment are included in

non-current liabilities as deferred income and

are credited to Statement of Profit and Loss on

a straight-line basis over the expected lives of

the related assets and presented within other

income.

(t) Earnings per share

(i) Basic earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by

dividing:

•

the profit attributable to owners of the

Company

•

by the weighted average number

of equity shares outstanding during

the financial year, adjusted for bonus

elements in equity shares issued during

the year.

(ii) Diluted earnings per share

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures

used in the determination of basic earnings

per share to take into account:

•

the after income tax effect of interest

and other financing costs associated

with dilutive potential equity shares, and

•

the weighted average number of

additional equity shares that would

have been outstanding assuming the

conversion of all dilutive potential equity

shares.

(u) Measurement of fair values

A number of the accounting policies and

disclosures require measurement of fair values,

for both financial and non-financial assets and

liabilities.

Fair values are categorised into different levels in

a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in

the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active

markets for identical assets or liabilities.:

Managing Director of the Company have been identified as the Chief Operating

Decision Maker (CODM) as defined by Ind AS 108, "Operating Segments". Operating Segments have been defined and

presented based on the regular review by the CODM to assess the performance of each segment and to make decision

about allocation of resources. Accordingly, the Company has determined reportable segment by nature of its products

and services, which are as follows:

a.

Life Science Ingredients: (i) Specialty Intermediates, (ii) Nutritional Products and (iii) Life Science Chemicals.

b.

Pharmaceuticals: India Branded Pharmaceuticals.

The Company prepares its segment information in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and

presenting the financial statements of the Company as a whole.

No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.

Common allocable costs are allocated to each segment according to the relative contribution of each segment to the

total common costs.

Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities which relate to the Company as a whole and not allocable to segments on

reasonable basis have been included under ‘unallocated revenue / expenses / assets / liabilities’.

Finance costs and fair value gains and losses on financial assets are not allocated to individual segments as the

underlying instruments are managed on a Company basis.

Borrowings, current taxes, deferred taxes and certain financial assets and liabilities are not allocated to the segments

and have been included under ‘unallocated assets / liabilities’.

Information related to each reportable segment is set out below. Segment results (profit/(loss) before interest and tax)

is used to measure performance because management believes that this information is most relevant in evaluating the

results of the respective segments relative to other entities that operate in the same industries.

Consolidated Financial Statements:

Managing Director of the Parent Company have been identified as the Chief

Operating Decision Maker (CODM) as defined by Ind AS 108 “Operating Segments”. Operating Segments have been

defined and presented based on the regular review by the CODM to assess the performance of each segment and to

make decision about allocation of resources. Accordingly, the Group has determined reportable segments by the nature

of its products and services, which are as follows:

a.

Pharmaceuticals: (i) Specialty Pharmaceuticals comprising Radiopharmaceuticals (including radiopharmacies) and

Allergy Therapy products; (ii) Contract Development and Manufacturing Operations (CDMO) comprising Contract

manufacturing of Sterile Injectables and Non-Sterile products (CMO) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs);

and (iii) Generics comprising Solid Dosage Formulations; iv) India Branded Pharmaceuticals

b.

Life Science Ingredients: i) Specialty Intermediates ii) Life Science Chemicals and iii) Nutritional Products; and

c.

Drug Discovery and Development Solutions: Proprietary in-house innovation and collaborative research and

partnership for out-licensing.

Effective 1 April 2019, the Group has realigned its segment to report its India Branded Pharmaceuticals as “Pharmaceuticals”.

Further, the segment earlier presented as "Others" has been renamed as "Drug Discovery and Development Solutions".

Hence, previous year numbers have been regrouped to conform to current year reporting.

The Group prepares its segment information in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and

presenting the consolidated financial statements of the Group as a whole.

No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.

Common allocable costs are allocated to each segment according to the relative contribution of each segment to the

total common costs.

Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities which relate to the Group as a whole and not allocable to segments on

reasonable basis have been included under ‘unallocated revenue / expenses / assets / liabilities’.:

letter from U.S. Food and Drug

Administration (“USFDA”) for its solid dosage formulations manufacturing facility located at Roorkee, India.

As a result of this, USFDA may withhold approval of any new applications or supplements till the Group

resolves the issues raised by the agency, however, the Group continues to manufacture and distribute existing

products from its Roorkee facility. The Group has submitted comprehensive responses to the USFDA and has

engaged with third party consultants to help in the remediation activities. The Group is taking all necessary

steps to ensure further stringent controls at all its facilities.

(iii)

Additionally, the Group is involved in other disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory

inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including commercial matters that arise from time to

time in the ordinary course of business. The Group believes that none of these matters, either individually or

in aggregate, are expected to have any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.

The above does not include all other obligations resulting from claims, legal pronouncements having financial

impact in respect of which the Group generally performs the assessment based on the external legal opinion and

the amount of which cannot be reliably estimated.

The Group believes that none of these matters, either individually or in aggregate, are expected to have any material

adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.
