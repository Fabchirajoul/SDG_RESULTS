due to the LTA of previous year paid in the current year and increase in the notional value of perquisite as per Income Tax Act, however the

Message from the Director’s Desk

The COVID-19 global pandemic has reiterated the

importance of healthcare in a never-before manner.

The pharmaceutical industry is at the forefront of the

battle against the pandemic. It has quickly and efficiently

responded to this global challenge by ensuring that there

is no shortage of medicines across markets despite supply

chain disruptions. It has also simultaneously commenced

clinical trials to test the effectiveness of existing

medicines in treating symptoms of COVID-19. Many

global pharmaceutical companies, as well as some Indian

companies, have initiated efforts for the development of a

COVID-19 vaccine. The industry has also donated certain

medicines used in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms, personal

protective equipment (PPE) kits, disinfectants, gloves, etc.

Going forward, as healthcare gains priority, the role of the

pharmaceutical industry will also become more important.

We are living in unpredictable times. The COVID-19

pandemic and consequential lockdowns across the world

has only confirmed that. From climate change to technical

disruptions, it would get more and more difficult to foresee

the future. Businesses that would be more responsible

towards resources, whether material or human, would be

in a better position to adapt to these changes and thrive.

Sustainability is not an option anymore.

Pharmaceutical companies are going to play a pivotal

role in shaping this future as healthcare becomes the top

priority. At Sun Pharma, we develop high-quality medicines

trusted by healthcare professionals and patients, making

us the world’s 4th largest speciality generic pharmaceutical

company. However, what gives us more satisfaction is that

we could make these medicines affordable and accessible,

in over 100 countries across 6 continents.

Our vision of ‘Reaching People. Touching Lives’ globally as

a leading provider of valued medicines is what motivates

us to strive responsibly and scale newer heights towards

a holistic growth, where all stakeholders benefit, be it

patients, healthcare professionals, communities, planet,

regulatory bodies, employees or shareholders.

This extends to a triple bottom line approach where we

extend the philosophy of enhancing the quality of life

by focussing on wellness for Employees, Community

and Environment.

Employee Wellness

Our 36,000+ strong multi-cultural workforce from over

50 different nationalities is the reason for our success

and continuous growth. We are committed to hiring

exceptionally talented human resources and nurture them

professionally. Our multi-dimensional work environment

offers high growth opportunities through challenging roles

with clear responsibilities and the opportunity to work on a

variety of assignments.

Our all-encompassing HR Policy covers every aspect of

employee management from recruitment to retention.

Employee engagement, equality of opportunity, freedom

of association, health & safety, recognition & recreation,

and continuous learning are key principles of the policy.

In FY20, 90% of our employees, including 18% of women

employees were provided with safety and skill up-

gradation training.

Community Wellness

By continuing to enhance our Corporate Social

Responsibility (CSR) efforts and simultaneously partnering

with Government and Non-Government organisations, we

are enhancing the quality of life of the local communities.

In FY20, we invested `43.71 Million for the implementation

of CSR programme and projects.

Our focus areas in CSR interventions are healthcare,

education, rural development, sanitation, environment

conservation, drinking water and disaster relief. During the

outbreak of Novel Corona Virus, we committed donation of

medicines and hand sanitisers to support India’s COVID-19

pandemic response. Along with awareness generation

programmes, we also distributed food packets in the

rural communities.

Environment Wellness

A robust EHS policy enunciates our commitment to create

a safe and healthy workplace, and a clean environment

for employees and the community. The policy ensures

that we manufacture our products safely and in an

environmentally responsible manner. For that, we follow

the highest international standards in plant design,

equipment selection, maintenance, product development

and operations.

Waste management, conservation measures, increasing

efficiency, green energy and implementing Clean

Development Mechanism (CDM) projects at our facilities

are some of the measures we employ to reduce our burden

on the environment. In FY20, we generated approximately

1.6 Million kWh of clean energy.

This Business Responsibility Report (BRR) summarises our

commitment to the community, environment and all our

stakeholders. We welcome your feedback on this report as

your insights will help us take more responsible steps on

this ongoing journey.

letter and in spirit. So, we are not only compliant with all the statutory laws and

regulations, we also have grievance redressal mechanisms in place for violations, if any. In the reporting year, there were

no human rights violation complaints, relating either to child, forced and involuntary labour or discriminatory employment

against the Company. However, we did receive one complaint related to sexual harassment during the year, which

has been resolved.

Principle 6

Environment

As humans keep producing more for convenience and

comfort, they are ironically progressing towards a time

where clean air, fresh water, rich biodiversity and required

natural resources are getting scarce.

At Sun Pharma, we are aware of the emerging situation

and investing in measures that mitigate this situation. Be

it conservation measures or reducing our dependence on

limited resources, we are not only reducing the burden on

the environment, but also on our operational costs.

A robust Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) policy is

in place which is encouraging our employees to be more

ecologically aware and our vigilant teams to be more

cautious in pre-empting potential threats by developing

relevant measures to address them.

Some of our green steps which are a must-do:

• Ensure statutory compliance

• Optimise natural resources

• Effect continuous improvement in

environment management

• Innovate greener technologies and processes

• Spread green awareness across internal and

external stakeholders

We also engage with the concerned authorities and

industry in devising responsible laws, regulations,

and standards.

letter observations

issued in May 2014. It is continuing to work closely and co-operatively with the US-FDA to resolve the matter for

lifting the import alert. The contribution of this facility to Company’s revenues is not significant.

4

The US-FDA, on January 23, 2014, had prohibited using API manufactured at Toansa facility for manufacture of

finished drug products intended for distribution in the U.S. market. Consequentially, the Toansa manufacturing

facility was subject to certain provisions of the consent decree of permanent injunction entered in January 2012 by

erstwhile Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd (which was merged with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd in March 2015). In

addition, the Department of Justice of the USA (‘US DOJ’), United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New

Jersey had also issued an administrative subpoena dated March 13, 2014 seeking information. The Company is

continuing to fully co-operate and provide requisite information to the US DOJ.

5

In December 2019, the USFDA inspected the Halol facility and issued Form 483 with 8 observations. Post the

submission of the company’s response in January 2020, the USFDA classified the inspection status as Official Action

Indicated (OAI). The company is in continuous communication with the USFDA to resolve the outstanding issues from

the December 2019 inspection. The Company continues to manufacture and distribute products to the U.S from this

facility. However, the OAI status normally implies that the USFDA may put all new approvals from the Halol facility

on hold till the outstanding corrective actions are completed.

6

In September 2013, the USFDA had put the Mohali facility under import alert and was also subjected to certain provisions

of the consent decree of permanent injunction entered in January 2012 by erstwhile Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd (which

was merged with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd in March 2015). In March 2017, the USFDA lifted the import alert and

indicated that the facility was in compliance with the requirements of cGMP provisions mentioned in the consent decree.

The Mohali facility continues to demonstrate sustainable cGMP compliance as required by the consent decree. The

Company continues to receive approval of applications, manufacture and distribute products to the U.S from this facility.

7

In accordance with Ind AS 108 “Operating Segments”, segment information has been given in the consolidated Ind AS

financial statements, and therefore, no separate disclosure on segment information is given in these financial statements.

8

The Board of Directors at its meeting held on March 17, 2020 has approved the buy-back by the Company of its

equity shares from the open market through stock exchange mechanism as prescribed under Buy-back regulations at

the maximum price of `425.00 per share for an aggregate maximum amount of `17,000.0 Million.

9

The Scheme of Arrangement between Sun Pharma Global FZE (“the Transferor”), and the Company (“the Scheme”),

inter-alia envisaged merger of unbranded generic pharmaceutical undertaking of the transferor (Specified business)

into the Company. The scheme was approved by Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal, Ahmedabad Bench on

October 31, 2018 and became effective on December 01, 2018 upon completion of all the formalities.

Consequent to the amalgamation prescribed by the Scheme, all the assets and liabilities of the specified business

were transferred to and vested in the Company with effect from April 01, 2017 (“the Appointed Date”).

The amalgamation was accounted under the “pooling of interest” method prescribed under Ind AS 103 - Business

Combinations, as prescribed by the Scheme.

Accordingly all the assets, liabilities, and other reserves of the specified business as on April 01, 2017 were

transferred to the Company as per the Scheme. As prescribed by the Scheme no consideration was paid as the

transferor is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Accordingly, the resultant difference between the book

value of assets and liabilities taken-over as on the appointed date amounting to `17,450.8 Million is credited to

capital reserve account. Also, any gain or loss on translation of assets and liabilities to functional currency (i.e. `) till

the date of order has been credited or debited to foreign currency translation reserve.
