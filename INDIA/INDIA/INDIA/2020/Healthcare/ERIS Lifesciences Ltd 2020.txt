pandemic behind us and will

emerge from it stronger and

wiser.

In these trying times, let me

assure you that your company

has been able to navigate itself

efﬁciently. Three fundamental

pillars of our business model

assured that the disruptions

caused by the pandemic were

effectively managed.

T h e ﬁ r s t p i l l a r i s t h e

composition of our portfolio –

in terms of therapy areas as

well as large Mother Brands.

Our portfolio constitutes 86%

chronic and sub chronic

therapies, with 56% coming

from Diabetes Care and

Cardiac Care alone. This

ensured that most of our

business comes from therapy

areas that were least affected

by the lockdown. Our emphasis

on building large, strong and

resilient Mother Brands – top 10

Mother Brands constitute 66%

of the portfolio – stood ground

The second pillar is the strong

cash ﬂow generating ability of

our business model. With

4.

Average percentile increase already made in the salaries of employees other than the managerial personnel in the last financial year and its comparison with the

percentile increase in the managerial remuneration and justification thereof and point out if there are any exceptional circumstances for increase in the managerial

remuneration:

The percentile increase in the managerial remuneration has been 0.02 % which is higher than the change in the remuneration of employees other than constituting

magagerial remuneration which register a decline of 5.47%. The change in the remuneration of field staff is made as per their sales performance as per a

documented increment structure uniformly applied to the field staff. The managerial function is concerned with more critical issues which influence and determine

the survival, continued growth, and the business direction for the company. The managerial talent is scarce and hence its retention is even more important.

Managerial personnel form executive management and remain accountable to all the stakeholders of the company for business performance as well as corporate

governance and therefore need to demonstrate balance of judgement and mature decision making in the backdrop of fast changing and increasingly complex

industry landscape. These reasons justify the higher increase in the managerial remuneration.

Remuneration of Directors, KMP and other employees is in accordance with the Company’s Remuneration Policy.
