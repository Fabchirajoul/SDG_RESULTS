Dear Shareholders,

We are living in extraordinary times. The entire world is being

affected directly and indirectly by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pandemic is not only the most serious global health crisis

since the 1918 Great Influenza (Spanish flu) but is also set to

become one of the most economically exorbitant pandemics in

recent history.

Against this backdrop, the International Monetary Fund

(IMF) projects global growth to contract significantly. As

a responsible member of the global pharma fraternity, we

crafted our own business continuity plan in keeping with the

safety protocol mandated by governments. Even as much of

the world paused, we operated our facilities to manufacture

critical products, fulfilling delivery commitments to our

customers globally. We are proud of our employees and

other stakeholders for their commitment during the crisis for

ensuring business continuity.

FY20 saw us perform without any major supply disruptions.

Our procurement teams continuously monitored the supply

of APIs and other packaging materials, keeping adequate

inventories. Our logistics department followed up with airlines/

ocean liners to ensure that commodities were picked up by the

first available connection. We have been working to mitigate

geographical dependence by identifying alternative suppliers

across the world for sourcing raw materials. In effect, we are

developing multiple source of supplies.

Consistency in our performance

Managing Director’s message

Strong fundamentals

delivering growth

Our medium-to-

long term focus is to

develop and monetise

our differentiated

product basket.: Dear Shareholders,

We are committed to protecting the health and well-being of

our employees, their families and other stakeholders in these

testing times and ensuring business continuity so that more

patients can have access to life-saving drugs.

BUSINESS-WISE PERFORMANCE

Following a series of acquisitions, we are now in the process

of consolidation. We successfully completed the integration

of acquired Apotex businesses in five European countries

and started leveraging synergies. This was the first full year

of operations of acquired branded oncology business by

Acrotech Biopharma, where the performance was in line with

our expectations.

We maintained our growth momentum despite challenges.

This was achieved with improved market share for our

existing products, along with new product launches across

geographies.

Our formulations revenues increased by 23.9% to `200,119

million in FY20 from `161,570 million in FY19. The US

continues to remain the largest growth driver where our

revenues grew by 27.2% from `90,307 million in FY19 to

`114,835 million in FY20. Our Rx market share has significantly

improved to 8.5% in FY20 vis-à-vis 7.0% in FY19 as per IQVIA.

Our large-scale integrated manufacturing and diversified

product basket have supported our growth trajectory. Our

dependency on oral solids has further reduced with the
