Dear shareholders,

I am delighted to present a second

consecutive excellent year for your

Company – FY2020. Your company had

a record-breaking performance in terms

of revenue and earnings growth along

with achievements of key business, as

we took strides to become a truly global

pharmaceutical product manufacturing

company.

It has been almost three decades that

your company is engaged in providing

collaborative and strategic partnership

to global pharmaceutical leaders by

producing best quality API and PFI

through

manufacturing

excellence,

process

innovation

and

regulatory

expertise. Continuous focus on building

execution excellence over the last

several years coupled with recent

focus on launching our own products

in US and other regulated markets has

resulted in a fairly backward integrated

Pharmaceutical

company

trying

to

establish its foot print in almost all the

sectors including the finished dosage.

Our success strategy is dependent on

mainly on the following five verticals

1) Continue customer centric approach

2) Continue to strengthen operational

capability

3) Value creation by choosing right

partners and having long term

contracts with them

4) Organisational agility and human

capital creation

5) Continuous review of existing and

pipeline portfolios.

I am confident that we have now started

our orbit changing transformation journey

and will grow in many folds in the years to

come

Performance highlights FY20

FY20 was another excellent year for

Granules India with a robust revenue

growth of 14% from H227,919.77 lakhs

in FY2019 to H259,864.65 lakhs in

FY2020, which was mainly contributed

by PFI and FD growth by 9% and 27%

and API sales was flat over the previous

year. The increases were mainly from

the US and Europe market driving the

higher volume Sales of FD. We applied

financial discipline to ensure that our

cost levers underpin our targeted

growth, while safeguarding profitability.

The gross profit improved by 28.7%

over the previous year from H102,363.55

lakhs

to

H131,771.51

lakhs

which

was mainly due to higher FD sales

and increased contribution from GPI

business over the previous year.

EBITDA for the year stood at H52,531.83

lakhs after recognising the H2,171.53

lakhs as impairment charge which is a

36.8% increase over the EBITDA of the

previous year which was H38,403.77

lakhs. The primary reasons are increased

Granules India is focussed on

building a business for the long-

term through the efficient use

of capital, strong and profitable

revenue growth and focussed

risk management.
