Mumbai, May 18, 2020:

Managing Director of the Company has been identified as CODM and

he is responsible for allocating the resources, assess the financial performance and position of the Company and

makes strategic decisions.

The Company has identified one reportable segment “Pharmaceuticals” based on the information reviewed by the

CODM. Refer note 51 for segment information presented.

t)

Provision and contingent liabilities

A provision is recognised if as a result of a past event, the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive)

that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle

the obligation. Provisions are recognised at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present

obligation at the balance sheet date. If the effect of time value of money is material, provisions are discounted

using a current pre tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the

provision due to passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.

A contingent liability exists when there is a possible but not probable obligation, or a present obligation that

may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources, or a present obligation whose amount cannot be

estimated reliably. Contingent liabilities do not warrant provisions but are disclosed unless the possibility of outflow

of resources is remote.:

letter dated May 4, 2011 called upon the Company

to discharge the entire liability, including upto date interest calculated at 15% p.a., and has vide: letter dated October 10, 2011,

raised a demand on the Company for the interest amount amounting to ` 247,44 lakhs. Without prejudice to the position that

interest is not payable, the Company has recognized a provision of ` 247,44 lakhs in respect of the Government’s claim for

interest in 2011. The Company has filed a writ petition at Delhi High Court against the above demand which has been admitted.

The Company also filed stay applications which have been dismissed and has filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the

Supreme Court for stay of the interest demand until final determination of the writ petition filed in the Delhi High Court. The

Supreme Court on hearing the above SLP, passed an order on April 3, 2012. The said order stayed the demand notice dated

October 10, 2011 during the pendency of the writ petition at the Delhi High Court subject to the Company depositing ` 136,82

lakhs in three equal installments within six month’s time from the date of order. All three instalments have been deposited

with the Government as of date. The Supreme Court, vide its order dated October 5, 2012, directed the Delhi High Court to

dispose of the writ petition as expeditiously as possible. After the arguments given by the Company’s counsel on July 6, 2018,

January 22, 2019, March 26, 2019, May 16, 2019, July 18, 2019, September 20, 2019, February 5, 2020, May 5, 2020, the

DPEA matter now stands adjourned to June 2, 2020.

NOTE 42 : MATTERS IN RESPECT OF ERSTWHILE BURROUGHS WELLCOME (INDIA) LIMITED (BWIL):

(i)

The Government of India, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers, New Delhi, passed a final order on July 21, 1993,

directing erstwhile BWIL to pay an amount of ` 1,91.15 lakhs along with interest due thereon from the date of default into

the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account (DPEA) in respect of a bulk drug procured by erstwhile BWIL during the period

April 1981 to April 1983.

Erstwhile BWIL filed a writ petition in August 1993 which was admitted by the Bombay High Court. After hearing both

the parties, the High Court granted an interim injunction restraining the Government of India from taking any action in

furtherance of and/or implementation of the order dated July 21, 1993 or from in any manner seeking to compel erstwhile

BWIL to deposit any amount into the DPEA, pending the hearing and final disposal of the petition on the condition that

erstwhile BWIL furnishes a bank guarantee for ` 2,00 lakhs from a nationalised bank and undertakes to pay the amount

demanded with interest at the rate of 20% per annum in case the petition fails.

Erstwhile BWIL had accordingly furnished the required bank guarantee. If calculated on the basis of correct data, taking

into account set offs claimable for earlier years for which data has been provided by erstwhile BWIL, no amount will be

payable by the Company and accordingly no provision in that respect is considered necessary. The Company’s stand

that the demand is not sustainable has been confirmed by an eminent counsel. The Government of India’s application

in the Supreme Court praying that the writ petition be transferred to the the Supreme Court from the Bombay High Court

was not allowed and the Company’s writ petition will now be heard by the Bombay High Court.

Managing Director and three whole time Directors amounting to ` 10.93 lakhs for

the year ended August 31, 1986, which was in accordance with the minimum remuneration provided in the agreements

entered into with them prior to erstwhile BWIL becoming public, which required such Government of India’s sanction.

The approval is still awaited.

NOTE 43 : MATTERS IN RESPECT OF ERSTWHILE SMITHKLINE BEECHAM (INDIA) LIMITED:

(i)

` 1,44.44 lakhs received from Beckman Instruments International S.A. on account of disputed alleged additional

commission has been included under non-current provisions and Income tax paid thereon aggregating ` 64.77 lakhs has

been included under other non-current assets. The Company is contesting the matter with the concerned authorities.

(ii)

Refund of surtax ` 96.81 lakhs, and interest thereon amounting to ` 48.52 lakhs, received during 1994, have not been

adjusted against the provision for tax in the books of accounts and recognised as income respectively, since the Income

tax department had filed a reference application against the income tax tribunal’s order which was pending before the

High Court of Karnataka. The Company has received an order dated April 18, 2007 from the High Court of Karnataka

which is partially in the Company’s favour. On the basis of the aforesaid order, Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT),

Bangalore will pass an order giving directions. On receipt of the ITAT order, the Company will take appropriate steps in

the matter.

Mumbai, 14 May 2020:

letter dated 20th/24th August, 1998 from the

Central Government demanding an amount of ` 4,40,79,918 comprising

` 1,42,74,110 in respect of prices relating to Salbutamol formulations

during the period April, 1979 to December, 1983 with interest thereon

amounting to ` 2,98,05,808 upto 31 July 1998. The Company had been

legally advised that the demand of ` 1,42,74,110 is not sustainable

and it, therefore follows that the interest demand also cannot be

sustained. The total demand has been challenged by the Company in

a Writ Petition filed in the Bombay High Court. The Bombay High Court

has granted an interim stay of the demand, subject to the Company

depositing 50% of the principal amount. Accordingly, the Company has

deposited an amount of ` 71,50,000 with the Government on 3 May,

1999. This is a normal interim order passed by the High court in such

matters and does not in any way reflect upon the merits or otherwise

of the case. The amount will be refunded if the Company succeeds

at the final hearing of the matter. The Government’s application in

the Supreme Court praying that this writ petition be transferred to the

Supreme Court from the Bombay High Court was not allowed and the

Company’s writ petition will now be heard by the Bombay High Court.

Standards issued but not yet effective

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards. There is no

such notification which would have been applicable to the Company from April 1, 2020.

NOTE 2 : CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will

seldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies.

This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which

are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally

assessed.

a

Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations

The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key actuarial

assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation and vested future benefits and life expectancy. The

discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.:

directing erstwhile BWIL to pay an amount of ` 1,91.15 lakhs along with interest due thereon from the date of

default into the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account (DPEA) in respect of a bulk drug procured by erstwhile BWIL

during the period April 1981 to April 1983.

Erstwhile BWIL filed a writ petition in August 1993 which was admitted by the Bombay High Court. After hearing

both the parties, the High Court granted an interim injunction restraining the Government of India from taking any

action in furtherance of and/or implementation of the order dated July 21, 1993 or from in any manner seeking to

compel erstwhile BWIL to deposit any amount into the DPEA, pending the hearing and final disposal of the petition

on the condition that erstwhile BWIL furnishes a bank guarantee for ` 2,00.00 lakhs from a nationalised bank and

undertakes to pay the amount demanded with interest at the rate of 20% per annum in case the petition fails.

Erstwhile BWIL had accordingly furnished the required bank guarantee. If calculated on the basis of correct data,

taking into account set offs claimable for earlier years for which data has been provided by erstwhile BWIL, no

amount will be payable by the Group and accordingly no provision in that respect is considered necessary. The

Group’s stand that the demand is not sustainable has been confirmed by an eminent counsel. The Government

of India’s application in the Supreme Court praying that the writ petition be transferred to the the Supreme Court

from the Bombay High Court was not allowed and the Group’s writ petition will now be heard by the Bombay High

Court.

Managing Director and three whole time Directors amounting

to ` 10,93.00 lakhs for the year ended August 31, 1986, which was in accordance with the minimum remuneration

provided in the agreements entered into with them prior to erstwhile BWIL becoming public, which required such

Government of India’s sanction. The approval is still awaited.

NOTE 43: Biddle Sawyer Limited (BSL) received a: letter dated August 20/24, 1998 from the Central Government demanding

an amount of ` 4,40.80 lakhs comprising ` 1,42.74 lakhs in respect of prices relating to Salbutamol formulations

during the period April, 1979 to December, 1983 with interest thereon amounting to ` 2,98.05 lakhs upto July 31, 1998.

BSL had been legally advised that the demand of ` 1,42.74 lakhs is not sustainable and it, therefore follows that the

interest demand also cannot be sustained. The total demand has been challenged by BSL in a Writ Petition filed in the

Bombay High Court. The Bombay High Court has granted an interim stay of the demand, subject to BSL depositing

50% of the principal amount. Accordingly, BSL has deposited an amount of ` 71.50 lakhs with the Government on

May 3, 1999. This is a normal interim order passed by the High court in such matters and does not in any way

reflect upon the merits or otherwise of the case. The amount will be refunded if BSL succeeds at the final hearing

of the matter. The Government’s application in the Supreme Court praying that this writ petition be transferred to

the Supreme Court from the Bombay High Court was not allowed and BSL’s writ petition will now be heard by the

Bombay High Court.
