Managing director has

been identified as being the chief operating decision

maker. Refer note 38 for the segment information

presented.

2.3 Foreign currency translation:

(i)

Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the consolidated financial

statements of each of the group’s entities are

measured using the currency of the primary

economic environment in which the entity operates

(‘the functional currency’). The consolidated

financial statements are presented in Indian rupee

(Rs.), which is Divi’s ( the Company’s) functional

and presentation currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into

the functional currency using the exchange rates

at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange

gains and losses resulting from the settlement

of such transactions and from the translation of

monetary assets and liabilities denominated in

foreign currencies at year end exchange rates

are generally recognised in statement of profit

and loss. A monetary item for which settlement

is neither planned nor likely to occur in the

foreseeable future is considered as a part of the

entity’s net investment in that foreign operation.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair

value in a foreign currency are translated using

the exchange rates at the date when the fair value

was determined. Translation differences on assets

and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as

part of the fair value gain or loss. For example,

translation differences on non- monetary assets

and liabilities such as equity instruments held at

fair value through profit or loss are recognised

in statement of profit and loss as part of the fair

value gain or loss and translation differences on

non-monetary assets such as equity investments

classified as FVOCI are recognised in other

comprehensive income.

(iii) Group Companies

The results and financial position of foreign

operations (none of which has the currency of a

hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional

currency different from the presentation currency

are translated into the presentation currency as

follows:

•

assets and liabilities are translated at the

closing rate at the date of that balance sheet

•

income and expenses are translated at

average exchange rates (unless this is

not a reasonable approximation of the

cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on

the transaction dates, in which case income

and expenses are translated at the dates of

the transactions), and

•

All resulting exchange differences are

recognised in other comprehensive income.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising

from the translation of any net investment in foreign

entities are recognised in other comprehensive

income. When a foreign operation is sold, the

associated exchange differences are reclassified

to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale.

156:

Managing Director has been identified as being the Chief Operating Decision Maker(CODM). Operating segments are defined as

components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available. This is evaluated regularly by the CODM, in deciding

how to allocate resources and assessing the group’s performance. The group is engaged in the manufacture of Active Pharmaceutical

Ingredients (API’s) and Intermediates and operates in a single operating segment.

The amount of revenue from operations by each country (based on where products and services are delivered) exceeding 10% of total

revenue of a group and non-current assets broken down by location of the assets respectively are as follows:

The revenue from transactions with one external customer exceed 10% of the total revenue of the group for each of the year ended
