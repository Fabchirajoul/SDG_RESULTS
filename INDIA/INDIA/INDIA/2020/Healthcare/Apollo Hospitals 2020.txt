Corporate Review

2: Message from the

Message FRoM the ChaiRMan

Dear Members,

The second decade of the twenty-first century will be

the decade of Non- Communicable diseases (NCDs).

The World Economic Forum and the United Nations

have both warned that the world will face a huge NCD

crisis in the next ten years in the form of diabetes,

heart disease, strokes, cancer, respiratory disorders,

infectious diseases and obesity. It is estimated that by

the end of this decade, 80% of deaths worldwide will

be from NCDs, which will amount to a staggering

global cost of USD 30 Trillion, with India’s share of

that cost being USD 4.8 Trillion. It is a huge threat

that no family, corporate or nation can sustain. It has

been always our endeavour to work with

Governments, corporates and communities in general,

to reduce this burden, especially for younger people

in the age group of 30-60, who are precious to their

employers, their families, and above all to the nation.

In pursuit of the well-being of people at large, we

have devised specific programs for diabetes

management, detection of risk factors and corrective

treatment for heart disease, strokes and cancer. It is

important to remember that cancer, if detected early,

can be easily controlled through surgery, including

robotic surgery. For more advanced cases, we also

have state-of-the-art Photon therapy, through

Novalis, Tomo and Halcyon machines, and Proton

therapy. Our Proton Centre in Chennai, is the first-of-

its kind in South East Asia and people from all over

the world come here for treatment. Today, we are not

only the No. 1 provider of cardiac services, we are

marching towards making India the best cancer care

center in the world.

As a definitive step towards combating NCDs, and to

encourage early-detection and prevention, we have

completed over 22 million Preventive Health Checks

so far. We have now created a new program Apollo

ProHealth, powered by Artificial Intelligence, which

will help Predict, Prevent and Overcome NCDs. The

program includes personalised healthcare under the

supervision of health mentors.

The second decade of the twenty-first century will

also see the advent of Artificial Intelligence,

Automation, Robotics and 3-D printing in Healthcare.

We have already adopted all of these to make a

significant impact in the way we manage our patients

and their medical conditions, with precision. I am

happy to share that the Apollo Hospitals network is

performing the highest number of robot-assisted

surgeries in the country; we have also started using

robots for cardiac procedures now.

Suddenly and unexpectedly, in the month of March

2020, another major health crisis erupted for the

world with the COVID-19 pandemic. We launched

Project Kavach, an integrated and holistic plan for

the fight against COVID-19. Kavach includes

modalities for screening, testing, assessment,

isolation, treatment, monitoring and follow-up. We

have designated close to 2,000 beds across our

hospitals for COVID-19. We have been working with

the Governments of 16 states where our hospitals are

located. We have set up fever clinics in 30 locations.

So far, we have made a positive difference to the lives

of over 30,000 patients and we will continue to

extend care.

During this time, we also launched our digital

healthcare app Apollo 24/7 - agile and digitally

connected to the consumer, and we have been

humbled by the response - 3.7 million registered

users, ~3,200 doctors live on the platform, over

125,000 digital consults till date and over 12.7

million COVID-19 risk scans completed.

While managing COVID-19 as well as other ailments,

we have created an iron curtain, in all our hospitals,

between COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19

patients so that the safety of the hospitals for the

non-COVID-19 patients is not compromised. We have

also fully separated the staff - doctors, nurses,

housekeeping staff and others - and are housing

them separately. This has helped us to make our

facilities completely safe for the treatment of normal

medical and surgical procedures as they arise.

Against the backdrop of COVID-19, it has now

become abundantly clear that controlling NCDs,

especially conditions like hypertension and diabetes

is critical for building immunity to protect oneself

from infections that can become life threatening.

The prevailing social stigma around COVID-19,

coupled with the fear of contracting infections may

have made patients rather lax about their health,

lifestyle, regular medications and follow-up for their

ailments. There is an urgent need to bring in a

behavioural shift and ensure that people do not

ignore conditions and illnesses, which may become

life-threatening if left unattended.

With 71 hospitals with a total of 10261 beds; 3766

pharmacies, and 956 retail touchpoints, and emerging

formats of care such as digital healthcare and home

healthcare, across the length and breadth of India, I

can confidently say no other hospital in the world has

the gamut of health services we offer. Our Centres of

Excellence continue to differentiate themselves

through clinical excellence, high standards of quality,

and skilled, experienced doctors. Our COE focus

enables us to maintain a leadership position in

treatment protocols and outcomes. Our focus on

Telemedicine has deepened, facilitating our reach

into non-urban geographies to provide access to

primary, secondary and tertiary care.

Returns are measured not merely in financial terms

alone; we’ve done so much work beyond just the

numbers. But numbers are important for

shareholders and I am very pleased to share with you

our consolidated FY20 results. Our YOY growth in

Revenue is 17% at ` 112,468 mio in Healthcare

Services which contributes 53% to our Topline, and

Standalone Pharmacies contribute 41%. Overall, the

EBITDA (Pre Ind AS 116) stood at ` 12,880 mio, a YOY

growth of 21%. I am delighted to announce a final

dividend of ` 2.75 per share.

The ultimate goal of innovation in healthcare has

always been to find a model which fosters complete

convergence and benefits for all stakeholders -

investors, consumers, clinicians, employees,

governments and society. Ours is a purpose-led model

that achieves this balance, and proves that a profitable

business can have significant socio-economic impact.

The entire Apollo Family has risen to the challenge of

caring for COVID and non-COVID patients. I would at

this time, like to acknowledge the efforts of our

doctors, nurses and support staff who have shown

fierce determination and dedication in performing

their duties. This gives me the confidence that we

can overcome any challenge that may come our way

and enable us to serve the interests of all our

stakeholders.

I would also like to thank the Board members for their

trust and unfailing support in our journey. I sincerely

look forward to that in the coming year as well.

Work of the magnitude that we have done this year

was possible only because of the faith and trust, you,

the shareholders have reposed in us; helping us move

beyond conventional boundaries. I thank you for

your support.

We stand on the frontline to assist our country

during these difficult times and will continue to

partner with Governments - both central and state, as

we pursue the dream of building a self-reliant India

in the healthcare space.

Let me remind you once again that your body is

Priceless and should be preserved with care.

My warm personal regards to all of you,

Stay safe. Stay Healthy.

ManaGeMent Discussion & analYsis

industry structure & Developments

Good health is the foundation on which a person’s happiness

and well-being rest. When a nation’s population is healthy,

it automatically means that the people make an important

contribution to the economic progress of the country, as they

live longer and are more productive. Studies have revealed the

significant interlinkages between the economic performance of

a country and the health of its population, making investment in

health not just desirable, but a priority for societies. It is important

that every citizen has access to basic healthcare facilities, an

important factor that will influence a better quality of life for

the populace. A comparison of the basic health indicators

between developed and developing countries clearly show that

developed nations lead the way in healthcare provision and

utilization in terms of all resources i.e., money, infrastructure,

people, education, and products. Developing nations, which

have not been able to invest similarly in healthcare infrastructure,

are characterized by lower human development.

Today, the primary challenge for developing countries like

India, is the improvement of healthcare access across sectors,

in terms of both reach and affordability, and the pursuit of

universal healthcare to ensure that healthcare needs of the

vulnerable and under-privileged sections of the society are

addressed. Additionally, coping with modern diseases, public

health engineering, disease surveillance and rising healthcare

costs present significant challenges for the healthcare industry.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused immense

disruption, bringing to the fore, the importance of good

health from an economic standpoint and the pressing need to

devote resources for the prevention of future epidemics while

managing such crises without excessive economic disruption.

It is believed therefore, that once the crisis dissipates, there will

be a perceptible paradigm shift worldwide towards providing

sustainable and equitable pre-eminent healthcare for all. For

this to be successful, it is imperative that all stakeholders

including healthcare providers, Governments, investors

“Harnessing the power

of digital technologies

is essential for

achieving universal

health coverage.

Ultimately, digital

technologies are not

ends in themselves;

they are vital tools to

promote health, keep

the world safe, and

serve the vulnerable.”

—Dr. Tedros Adhanom

Ghebreyesus,

WHO Director-General

Corporate Information

Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited (‘the Company’) is a public Company incorporated in India. The address of its registered

office and principal place of business is at 19, Bishop Gardens, Raja Annamalaipuram, Chennai, Tamilnadu. The main business

of the Company is to enhance the quality of life of patients by providing comprehensive, high-quality hospital services on a cost-

effective basis and providing / selling high quality pharma and wellness products through a network of pharmacies. The principal

activities of the Company include operation of multidisciplinary private hospitals, clinics and pharmacies.

Significant Accounting Policies

This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the standalone financial statements.

These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.

2 application of new and revised Ind ass

The company has applied all the Ind ASs notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

Ind AS 116 - Leases

Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted Ind AS 116 “Leases” and applied the standard to all lease contracts existing on

April 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method (except for one lease contract where modified prospective method is used)

has taken the cumulative adjustment to retained earnings, on the date of initial application. Consequently, the Company recorded

the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate and the right of use

asset at its carrying amount as if the standard had been applied since the commencement date of the lease, but discounted at

the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. Comparatives as at and for the year ended March 31,

2019 have not been retrospectively adjusted and therefore will continue to be reported under the accounting policies included as

part of our Annual Report for year ended March 31, 2019. On transition, the adoption of the new standard resulted in recognition

of ‘Right of Use’ asset and a lease liability as at April 1, 2019. The cumulative effect of applying the standard was debited to

retained earnings, net of taxes.

The financial impact on initial application of this standard on the standalone financial statements is disclosed as part of Note 46.

Appendix C to Ind AS 12 - Uncertainty over income tax treatments

Appendix C to Ind AS 12 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. The interpretation is to be applied to the

determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty

over income tax treatments under Ind AS 12. The adoption of Appendix C to Ind AS 12 did not have any material impact on the

standalone financial statements of the Company.

Amendment to Ind AS 19 - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued amendments to Ind AS19, ‘Employee Benefits’, in connection with accounting for plan

amendments, curtailments and settlements requiring an entity to determine the current service costs and the net interest for

the period after the remeasurement using the assumptions used for the remeasurement; and determine the net interest for the

remaining period based on the remeasured net defined benefit liability or asset. The adoption of amendment to Ind AS19 did not

have any material impact on the standalone financial statements of the Company.:

IndePendent AudItor’S rePort

To The Members of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited (”the Company”/ “Parent

Company”) and its subsidiaries, (the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) which includes Group’s

share of profit /loss in its associates and joint ventures, which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2020, and

the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and

the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other

explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of reports

of the other auditors on separate financial statements of the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures referred to in the Other Matters

section below, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in

the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133

of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended (‘Ind AS’), and other accounting principles

generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2020, and their consolidated profit, their

consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and their consolidated changes in equity for the year ended

on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section

143 (10) of the Act (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit

of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint ventures

in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical

requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made

thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics.

We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred

to in the sub-paragraphs (a) of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on

the consolidated financial statements.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to Note 5 (iv) to the consolidated financial statements in respect of proceedings initiated against the company’s

subsidiary, Imperial Hospital & Research Centre Limited, by the Government of Karnataka. The above matter has also been reported in

the Emphasis of Matter paragraph in the Audit report of the standalone financial statements of the said subsidiary company audited by

other auditors.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated

financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial

statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have

determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.:

retained earnings, net of taxes.

The financial impact on initial application of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is disclosed as part of

determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty

over income tax treatments under Ind AS 12. The adoption of Appendix C to Ind AS 12 did not have any material impact on the

consolidated financial statements.

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued amendments to Ind AS19, ‘Employee Benefits’, in connection with accounting for plan

amendments, curtailments and settlements requiring an entity to determine the current service costs and the net interest for

the period after the remeasurement using the assumptions used for the remeasurement; and determine the net interest for the

remaining period based on the remeasured net defined benefit liability or asset. The adoption of amendment to Ind AS 19 did not

have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.:

practices that go beyond adherence of statutory

frameworks to bring transparency and accountability

in all facets of our operations. We have thus

developed and implemented internal controls at all

levels of the organization.

In terms of the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading)

Regulations, 2015, the Board has formulated internal

procedures for Prevention of Insider Trading in

dealing with the securities of the Company and also

ensures that all applicable rules, regulations,

corrupt practices that may arise in the course of

its business for which we have zero tolerance. In

addition to the Code of Conduct, the Company also has a

Whistle Blower policy (https://www.apollohospitals.

com/apollo_pdf/whistle-blower-policy.pdf) in line

with the requirements of Section 177 of the Companies

Act, 2013. The policy enables all employees to report

to the Company management, concerns of unethical

behaviour, actual or suspected, fraud, or violation

of the Company’s Code of Conduct without fear of

reprisal or victimization. Our intent behind the

whistle blower policy is to identify potentially

serious concerns which could have a long-term impact

on the operations and performance of AHEL.

W

hile the term “Grievance Redressal” primarily

covers the receipt and processing of complaints

from consumers, a wider definition includes actions

taken on any issue raised by internal and external

stakeholders to avail services more effectively.

A grievance is any dissatisfaction or feeling

of injustice which is brought to the attention

of management. Speaking broadly, a grievance

is any dissatisfaction that adversely affects

organizational productivity.

committed to transparency in all its operations and
