Chairman’s Message:

Managing Director

At Aster, we continue to strengthen our

position as a leading private healthcare

challenging environment, by focusing on

patient-centric care. It has enabled us to

venture successfully into every aspect of

healthcare - right from primary care to

trust in our brands and we continue to be

guided by our endeavour to consistently

provide quality care. It has not only carved

a differentiated position for Aster but, has

significantly driven growth and profitability

across segments, year after year.

Our constant efforts to combine quality

care with affordability has increased

our patient count steadily. During the

year under review, we treated around

The recent COVID-19 outbreak has not only

impacted healthcare delivery but, has also

severely impacted economic activity across

the globe. But, if we analyse this situation

from a futuristic perspective, we may

realize how the pandemic emerged as a

turning point in the history of healthcare –

to explore unique and innovative methods

to deliver and interact with healthcare

systems. It has shifted focus to the

healthcare sector and efforts to improve

the healthcare ecosystem globally. It is

also anticipated to attract investments to

the sector, opening up innovative avenues

for delivering care and consultation by

leveraging digital communication tools.

Aster introduced a microsite called ‘Our

New Earth’ as an effort to coach people to

transition to the ‘New Normal’ living post

lock-down. The microsite is aimed at all

our customers who like each one of us is

also trying to get adjusted to the new way

of living. It aids each one of us to have this

conversation with our families, friends,

customers and patients and encourage

holistic well-being with Aster as their

trusted health-partner by their side.

Going forward, we plan to introduce

digitized solutions for patients, to provide

end-to-end care at home. We are also

seeing a huge demand for Telehealth and

are among the first in the industry to setup

out-patient consultations through Tele-

Health Centers across India.

Motivated by our promise- ‘We’ll Treat You

Well’, we continue to foster a differentiated

approach to sustain our legacy as a

trusted healthcare provider. No matter

how challenging or uncertain the market

is, at Aster we remain confident about
