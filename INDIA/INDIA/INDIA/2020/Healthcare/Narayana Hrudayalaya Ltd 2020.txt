For Narayana Hrudayalaya Limited

Sridhar S

Group Company Secretary, Legal & Compliance Officer

Place: Bengaluru

Date: 15th June, 2020:

Dear Shareholders,

I spend half my day seeing patients and performing surgeries

on children and adults with complex heart conditions. I love

operating and when I go to sleep at night, I dream about different

ways to perform surgeries safely. My professional life has been

dedicated towards achieving excellence in cardiac surgery

and we have built this organisation with the goal of delivering

excellence across all clinical specialties. I am extremely

fortunate to work with a dedicated group of individuals who

share my mission of making world-class healthcare affordable

to everyone.

I spend quite a bit of my time working with the government on

programmes that can improve the state of healthcare in this

country. This is not directly related to your Company, but I

strongly believe that India’s greatest strength is its people. If we

train enough doctors, nurses, and medical technicians, we can

change the world. I know this is possible because I have seen

engineers from small towns across India build software that

powers mighty companies. I strongly believe that economy of

the 21st century will be driven by health sector, and I believe that

healthcare is the industry that offers most scope for children

from small towns to build a better future for themselves.

CoVID-19 has changed the world forever. The existing

healthcare model was only beneficial to a small percentage of

the world’s population and the rest of the world barely managed

to survive on the remaining scraps. This pandemic has brought

the deficiencies of global health care delivery to the forefront

and exposed the soft underbelly of every country’s healthcare

delivery system. Some scientists are predicting that CoVID-like

pandemics will keep repeating themselves. India has one of

the most fragile healthcare systems and we will not be able to

survive another pandemic.

The time has come for us to work with the government to build

a healthcare system that is more robust, more equitable, and

financially viable. These are my suggestions.

address the Supply Shortage

There is no reliable database of the number of doctors and nurses

actively practicing in India. out of the 10 lakh doctors registered

with the Medical Council of India, 1 lakh doctors actually practice

in the uSA, 40,000 practice in the uK, and we have no idea how

many of the rest are even alive or still practicing medicine. The

National Medical Commission must create an active database

and use it as the basis for a Strategic Roadmap for Health. India

should aim to become the world’s largest producer of trained

doctors, nurses, and medical technicians. If we train 50 lakh

healthcare workers from small towns across India, they will be

able to earn a minimum of uS$ 100 billion in remittances every

year. This money will transform the economy of poorer states

across India, just like what happened in Kerala. As a benefit, there

will be more than enough doctors to run clinics, nursing homes,

and hospitals across the length and breadth of our country.

With such a large domestic market, Indian companies will find

it viable to manufacture all the medical equipment indigenously

and we will not be reliant on multinational companies to meet the

requirements.

Fix the infrastructure

I am sorry to say that privatising healthcare is not the solution

for a country like India. No matter how much a private

hospital reduces the treatment charges, they simply cannot

treat a patient with no money in his pocket. Most government

hospitals today are nearly empty because of the shortage of

doctors. So patients end up in private hospitals and spend

lot of money on their treatment. This is the root cause of

public unhappiness with hospitals. Public hospitals can

serve majority of the population if we make them vibrant and

Dear Shareholders,

It’s a matter of pride for me to present the performance of

your Company for the year gone by. We are pleased to close

FY 2019-20 on a strong note with significant uptick across

financial and operational parameters. This is aptly reflected in

our consolidated eBITDA growing over 33% YoY (was growing

at around 55% YoY on like-to-like basis for the 9 months

ended 31st December, 2019) and consolidated PAT more

than doubling YoY on a like-like basis (pre-Ind AS 116). That

we have been able to register this, despite the material impact

of CoVID-19 pandemic on our operations in March which

traditionally is the strongest month of the fiscal year, makes it a

truly remarkable achievement.

Strategic Focus on Consolidation of operations playing out

our emphasis on consolidation of operations with portfolio

rationalisation through exit of operations at Whitefield unit and

Durgapur heart centre and its hospital managed operations

during the year has ensured all-round growth across the

network. Adjusted for the Whitefield unit, this has resulted

in over 30% YoY growth in its eBITDA on like-to-like basis.

on international business front, continuing its impressive

performance trajectory, our Cayman Islands unit registered

over 45% YoY growth in its FY 2019-20 eBITDA on like-to-like

basis.

This comprehensive performance aided by highly efficient

working capital management resulted in robust cash accrual

from operations of over ` 2.4 Billion for the year post servicing

of capital expenditure and financial expenses. This has helped

us to deliver healthy return ratios for FY 2019-20 of 14.4% at

the consolidated level on cash deployed basis i.e. adjusted for

accounting treatments of Ind AS 116 and non-cash deferred

government grant.

our all-round showing has helped us to maintain a strong

balance sheet with very healthy capital gearing and liquidity

profiles. Adjusted for ` 1.8 Billion of cash and bank balance

and liquid current investments, as on 31st March, 2020, our

consolidated Net Debt/eBITDA stood at 1.3x (on Trailing Twelve

Month i.e. TTM basis). We believe, this does provide us a lot of

competitive advantage especially in these testing times.

Non-Flagship Facilities Adding to Profitability

Anchored by our 3 flagship hospitals’ continual impressive

performance which were complemented by operations steadily

ramping up at the 3 newer hospitals and Jammu, the category

of other hospitals delivered a robust all-round growth.

Continuing its strong growth momentum, for the fiscal year

2020, this category of other hospitals delivered a strong 58.9%

eBITDA growth on like-to-like basis, resulting in a healthy

eBITDAR margin of 14.7% when adjusted for the Whitefield unit.

In order to further strengthen this set of hospitals, we have

planned investment across civil and medical infrastructure

across centres. In this category, we are in the process of

Managing Director (w.e.f. 11th February, 2019)

Dr. Ashutosh Raghuvanshi -: Managing

letter dated 19th January, 2011, the timelines committed by NHPL are as follows:

Commissioning timelines

a)

500 bed multispecialty hospital

June-2012

b)

1000 bed multispecialty hospital (expansion)

June-2012

c)

100 seat Medical College

June-2013

d)

5000 bed Health City

June-2016

The Company commenced operations in its Ahmedabad unit on 3rd May, 2012. As of 31st March, 2020, the Group is yet to

achieve the above timelines. The Group based on its past projects with government and other authorities believes that the

terms/ conditions of grant of leasehold land at concessional rate would be renegotiated and no liability or adjustment to

recorded assets is required as at 31st March, 2020.

40. NHPL had entered into a lease agreement and obtained a 5 acre land from Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority in

February 2009 for construction of a hospital for a consideration of ` 25 Millions disclosed as prepaid rent under other current

and non-current assets. As per the lease agreement, NHPL was required to complete the construction of the hospital by

August 2009. However, no construction has been completed till date. During the year, the company has written off the prepaid

rent of ` 22.20 Millions.

41. In the year 2008-09, NHPL was allotted 35 acres of land by Jaipur Development Authority (‘JDA’) for establishing a medical

college at Bagrana Grama, Jaipur (“”Bagrana””). Subsequently, NHPL has surrendered 25 acres of land to JDA and retained

10 acres of land. However, in the year 2013-14 JDA intimated NHPL that 6,000 sq. meters of land out of the 10 acres land

retained will be utilised for the completion of ring road project. Subsequently, JDA gave another proposal of land allotment at

Govind Pura Ropada, in lieu of 10 acres at Bagrana, NHPL gave its consent on the same through: letter dated 24th April, 2015.

Since this land is given in lieu of land allotted at Bagrana, NHPL has requested JDA that the land at Govind Pura Ropada to

be valued the same as it was during the time of allotment of land in Bagrana in March 2008.

As at 31st March, 2020, NHPL has paid ` 54.44 million (31st March, 2019 : ` 54.44 million) to JDA and accrued the balance

payable of ` 41.52 million (31st March, 2019 : ` 35.59 million). NHPL would capitalize this amount along with any other payment

once NHPL gets the land registered in its name. NHPL believes that this advance towards land is recoverable from the JDA

and hence provision for doubtful advance is not required as at 31st March, 2020.

42. Prepaid expenses

Expense prepaid as on 31st March, 2019 amounting to ` 275.48 million representing rent paid to Asia Heart Foundation and

Modern Medical Institute have as at 1st April, 2019 been considered as ROU assets for the remaining lease term and presented

appropriately as at 31st March, 2020.

43. Share based payments

During the year ended 31st March, 2016, the Company introduced the NH ESOP 2015 (“NH ESOP”) for the benefit of the

employees of the Company, its subsidiaries and associates, as approved by the Board of
