METROPOLIS HEALTHCARE LTD:

Dear Shareholders,

Returning to how life was at the beginning of 2020

seems like a far-off reality. The COVID-19 virus struck

like a sudden spectre, creating an extraordinary

situation for everyone. Today, our primary collective

effort is to safeguard life and health of our people.

Even as the pandemic and consequent lockdowns

brought economic activities to a virtual standstill,

threatening livelihoods of millions, a strong resolve

to adapt and survive is the need of the hour for all.

With the looming clouds of uncertainty, we know

that life after COVID-19 will be very different, with

outcomes dependent on the intensity and timeline

of the virus itself.

QUALITY, SAFETY AND HYGIENE WILL

REMAIN OUR TOP PRIORITY

The pandemic has created a widespread awareness

on how pathology labs operate, and consumers

today are more aware than ever on good quality labs,

accuracy, and reliability in reports. Patients turned

to us during their most anxious times and it is of

immense pride to us that Metropolis is continuing

to perform thousands and thousands of COVID-19

tests for the benefi t of the nation. We believe that

Metropolis with its strong legacy of quality has

further cemented its trust with doctors, hospitals,

patients, and key stakeholders. Quality, Safety and

Hygiene will continue to remain our top priority as we

move forward.

PEOPLE, PATIENTS AND VALUES

As an organisation, we remain empathetic to all our

stakeholders. Metropolis has always put people fi rst

and we will continue holding on to this value that

is helping us navigate through this unprecedented

crisis. We are proud of the 4,500-member Metropolis

family who have worked incredibly hard during

these diffi cult times to ensure that COVID-19 and

MESSAGE

METROPOLIS HEALTHCARE LTD:

Dear Shareholders,

The dramatic current situation has put the great

strengths of Metropolis on display yet again. Our

employees stayed attuned to their responsibilities

by continuing to outperform and overcome

this extraordinary situation. Our expertise and

experience of over 26 years in RNA PCR helped us

prepare to meet the testing needs and challenges.

Our strong, scientifi c, and technical team of over

2,000 members, led by a team of 200 doctors and

pathologists, have together enabled the Company in

achieving this feat.

The Diagnostic Industry is at the cusp

of a transformation

At a macro level, we strongly believe COVID-19

will change the operating dynamics for Indian

Diagnostics industry. As a result, the organised and

capable testing laboratories like ours, will be the

biggest benefi ciaries of this change. Let us see how:

1. As per estimation, unorganised and standalone

labs are facing severe cost pressures due

to lockdown. The faster adoption of quality

standards partly enforced by Government and

partly forced upon by customers, indirectly,

could result in the closure of operations for

many of unorganised standalone labs. A faster

consolidation in the industry, along with changes

in the regulatory framework is also anticipated

soon.

2. Customers are now anticipated to place quality

over pricing when it comes to diagnostics. Higher

quality standards, authentic reports, after sales

service and doctor engagement will be the key

deciding factors in the lab selection process.

This is where the organised labs will outscore

unorganised ones. Safety and hygiene will take

a lead and we will use this as an opportunity to

utilise our professional services and gain market

share.

3. The current health scare of COVID-19 is set to

bring about a change in the mindset of Indian

customers. An increasing number of customers

will now evaluate and label diagnostics chains

as COVID-19 capable and non-COVID-19 capable.

With these tests becoming the new norm, a: LETTER FROM
