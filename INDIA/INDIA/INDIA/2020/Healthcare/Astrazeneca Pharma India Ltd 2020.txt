letter dated March

1, 2014, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals AB, the promoter

of the Company had proposed a voluntary delisting of

the Company’s equity shares from the National Stock

Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange. Such

proposed delisting is subject to an on-going inquiry with

SEBI and that inquiry has not yet been resolved. In any

event, based on the passage of time, any potential future

proposal for voluntary delisting of the Company would

need to be conducted de novo.

45 Grant of Exclusive Distribution Rights

During the previous year ended March 31, 2019, the

Company had entered into a distribution agreement (the

'agreement') with a customer for specified products

(“Products”). Pursuant to this agreement, an upfront fee of

`213.1 was received from the customer towards marketing

and promotion already carried out by the Company

in order to create market presence for the products.

Management determined that such marketing and

promotion was a distinct service provided to the customer.

The said upfront fee met the point in time recognition

criteria as per Ind AS 115 and was recognised separately

from the sale of products envisaged in the agreement.

The Company has an agreement with an overseas group

company to receive reimbursement of certain costs

incurred for the marketing and promotion for launch

of new products, net of any upfront fee received by

the Company from its customers. During the previous

year ended March 31, 2019, the Company incurred an

aggregate expense of `161.4 towards marketing and

promotion of new products and accounted such expense

under appropriate headings in the Statement of Profit

and Loss. The aforesaid upfront fees received from

the customer exceeds the aggregate expense incurred

towards marketing and promotion of new products during

the year and hence such expenses were not billed to

the group Company.

During the current year ended March 31, 2020, the

Company has not received any upfront fee from any

customer and accordingly, all the expenses incurred

during the year towards marketing and promotion of new

products are considered as receivable from the group

company and have been netted off with the respective

expenses heads in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

46 Provident Fund– Supreme Court Judgement

The Company has evaluated the impact of Supreme Court

(“SC”) judgement dated February 28, 2019 in the case of

Regional Provident Fund Commissioner (II) West Bengal

v/s Vivekananda Vidyamandir and Others, in relation to

exclusion of certain allowances from the definition of

“basic wages” of the relevant employees for the purposes

of determining contribution to Provident Fund (“PF”)

under the Employees’ Provident Fund & Miscellaneous

Provisions Act, 1952. There are interpretation issues

relating to the said SC judgement. Based on such

evaluation, management has concluded that affect of

the aforesaid judgement on the Company is not material

and accordingly, no provision has been made in the

financial statements.

47 Impact of COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 outbreak has spread rapidly during

the last quarter of the financial year. Governments

across the globe, including in India, have undertaken

various measures to contain the spread of the virus

including restrictions on travel, social distancing and

other emergency measures. These measures have had

a direct impact on businesses and have affected the

supply chains and production of goods. Lower economic

activity has also resulted in the suppressed demand for

goods and services.

The Company is engaged in the business of manufacture,

distribution and marketing of life-changing medicines

in crucial areas of healthcare including oncology,

cardiovascular, diabetes, renal, metabolic and respiratory.
