Action Indicated (OAI) status assigned by the agency to the facility on 6th August, 2019 after it inspected the facility between 22nd April and 3rd May,

IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON COMPANY’S OPERATIONS

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to

be a global pandemic in March 2020. Majority of the countries

across the globe were into lockdown situation all throughout

April 2020 and major part of May 2020, impacting business

operations across various sectors with severe restrictions

on movement of people and goods. The Company has

implemented several initiatives across its manufacturing and

other business locations including allowing employees to

work from homes, keeping social distancing at work places

and proper sanitization, at regular intervals, of work places,

etc. for ensuring safety of its employees and continuity of its

business operations with minimal disruption. The Company

has created a group of senior management team to monitor the events happening in the external environment and take

suitable preventive and corrective measures to ensure continued safety of the employees and continuity of the business.

The team has implemented a business continuity plan across the functions to ensure that the operations continue right

through the pandemic situation. The Company has also established Liquidity Management Office for monitoring of the Cash

Flows with the objectives of managing and controlling costs, preserving liquidity and sustain the business operations. The

Company operates in manufacturing and selling of pharmaceutical products, which are classified as essential commodities

and hence its operations continued to be run with fewer challenges on people movement and supply chain. At present, all the

manufacturing facilities of the Company are operating at a reasonable capacity utilization. The company has strengthened

the supply chain to ensure continued and timely delivery of the products to the customers.

The Company has taken several steps to support the Governments and the communities at large in the fight against COVID-19.

This includes, among others, supplying Hydroxychloroquine Sulphate tablets to the Govt. of India and other customers

across several countries at very reasonable prices, manufacturing Covid testing kits for Indian Council of Medical Research

(ICMR), partnering with Gilead Sciences Inc. for manufacturing of Remdesivir for India market, exploring the biologics route

to treat the disease with the long-acting biological therapy Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b and working on development of

a vaccine for COVID-19 virus.

The Company is exploring newer ways of managing the business and has been working on changes in the business operating

model, including the possibilities of using digital technology. While the lock-down impacted the performance of different

businesses in India during the months of March and April, they have now started to recover on account of the unlocking

strategy adopted by the Government.

remediation measures necessary to address the observations raised

facility and also submits the periodic updates to brief them about

the actions which have been taken against the commitments made.

In the month of June, 2020, the Company gave the 5th update to the

the way forward and a desk top audit.

The Company has already initiated site transfer of all injectable

products from Moraiya formulations facility to the injectable

formulations facility of Liva near Baroda. In fact, the Company

has launched the first site transferred product from the injectable

formulations facility of Liva in the month of May, 2020.

The Company constantly evaluates the potential demand of its

products in different markets and based on the demand scenario,

it takes a call to build the additional capacities for the future. During the

year, the Company commenced commercial manufacturing from one

more block of Oral Solid Dosage formulations manufacturing facility

located in Ahmedabad SEZ. The Company expanded the capacity of

pallet based products and added a block for soft gelatin products at

Moraiya formulations facility during the year.

During the year, Baddi formulations manufacturing facility won the Gold

The Company runs an organization wide program

PRISM which aims at optimizing the spends across

several categories through multiple levers and in

turn, build the operational efficiencies. During the

COMPANY OVERVIEW

STATUTORY REPORTS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

letter of credit or through advance payments.

RISK OF COMPETITION, PRICE PRESSURE AND

GOVERNMENT CONTROLS ON PRICES

The Company is a global pharmaceutical player which sells generic

medications to its customers across the globe. Generic industry is

characterized by a presence of large number of players who compete

with each-other to grab the market share, which in turn, leads to the

reduction in prices of the products. Government of different countries

encourage generic competition as it enables them to provide the

patients high quality medicines at the affordable prices and in turn, bring

the overall healthcare costs down. In addition to this, Governments

of some countries, by law, regulate the prices of medicines and

periodically revise them downwards to make them affordable to

the patients. Such practices put the pressure on the prices which

the generic players charge to the customers. The Company tries

to mitigate the impact of such price reduction by expanding the

volumes of existing products and launching high value added

new products. The Company also continuously strives to improve

operational efficiencies to rationalize costs and thereby minimize

the impact of price erosions in the finished products.

RISK OF REGULATORY ACTIONS DUE TO NON-

COMPLIANCE OF QUALITY STANDARDS

Pharmaceutical industry is one of the most dynamic industries

across the globe. Changes in regulations by leading regulatory

bodies to ensure the quality of the products have compelled the

pharmaceutical companies across the globe to modify their quality

assurance systems and compliance practices. The Company

must comply with all applicable quality standards prescribed by

regulatory authorities of countries where it either supplies products

or intends to do the same. Applicable regulations are increasingly

becoming stringent and the cost for non-compliance can be severe

as it can lead to the revocation or suspension of licenses, imposition

of fines and criminal sanctions. Any violation of regulatory methods

or non-compliance of standards can also tarnish a Company’s

reputation and thereby, risk its future.

The Company continuously evaluates the quality of its products,

their manufacturing and supply chain processes to ensure that

all the applicable regulations are complied with at all times by

focusing on building a robust quality culture among its employees,

simplifying and improving the existing processes and investing the

resources towards newer technologies and automation initiatives.

The Company also keeps a constant vigil on the regulatory

actions initiated by regulatory agencies on other pharmaceutical

companies across the world and takes pro-active measures to

improve its systems and processes.

RISK OF LITIGATION RELATED TO QUALITY OF

PRODUCTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES AND

OTHER LITIGATIONS

Pharmaceutical products manufactured by the Company must comply

with the regulatory and quality standards prescribed by the regulatory

authorities of the countries where the products will be supplied. If the

quality of the products doesn’t match the standards laid down by the

regulatory authorities, it can lead to penal actions from the regulatory

authorities. Such a non-compliance can also lead to the litigations from

the customers as well. To mitigate the risk of litigation which may arise

due to product quality, the Company takes ‘Global Product Liability

Insurance’ as a safeguard against the potential claims regarding quality

of the products.

Innovator companies can also take a legal action against the generic:
