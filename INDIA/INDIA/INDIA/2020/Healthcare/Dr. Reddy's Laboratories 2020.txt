LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

AND CO-CHAIRMAN: Dear Member,

Some of you may recall that in our letter

to you two years earlier, we had written,

“From the beginning of FY2018 there has

been a totally focused drive on eliminating

needless layers and unnecessary costs.”

Last year, too, we reiterated this theme

when we wrote, “With changing dynamics of

the generics markets, we believe that cost

competitiveness will continue to be a key

driver. Hence, we aim to continue creating a

leaner and more effi cient organization.”

Cost competitiveness, de-layering,

improving effi ciencies and increasing

speed-to-market are continuous processes.

These can never stop for any company that

seeks to remain on the path of proﬁ table

growth. Dr. Reddy’s is no exception to

this rule.

Your company’s strategy is based on

three inter-locking and interacting themes.

These are:

• Leadership in chosen spaces

• Operational excellence and continuous

improvement

• Patient-centric product innovation

How is the strategy bearing out? Last year,

we had said that this strategy is getting

organization-wide traction and believed

that we could be “reasonably optimistic of

the prospects for FY2020”. We are pleased

to inform you that it has, indeed, been the

case.

To appreciate this, consider the key ﬁ nancial

results for FY2020:

• Consolidated revenues for FY2020 were

₹ 174.6 billion, or a 13% growth over the

previous year. This was on top of an 8%

growth in FY2019.

• Consolidated gross proﬁ t was ₹ 94

billion, which was 13% greater than the

previous year. This, too, came over and

above a 9% growth in FY2019.

• Earnings before interest, taxes,

depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)

increased to ₹ 46.4 billion, or an increase

of 36% compared to the previous year -

on top of a 42% growth in FY2019.

• Proﬁ t before taxes (PBT) was ₹ 18 billion,

which was 20% lower than ₹ 22.4 billion

earned in the previous year. This was

largely on account of impairment charges

taken on a set of product intangibles.

• Proﬁ t after taxes (PAT) was ₹ 19.5

billion, versus ₹ 18.8 billion in FY2019 -

representing a growth of 4%.

• Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was

₹ 117.40 in FY2020, versus ₹ 113.09

in FY2019.

Let us now touch upon some of your

company’s businesses.

Revenue from Global Generics in FY2020

was ₹ 138.1 billion, or an increase of 12%

compared to FY2019. The growth was

driven by impressive performances in

Europe, Emerging Markets and India.

Revenue from North America Generics was

₹ 64.7 billion, representing a growth of 8%

over FY2019. Pricing pressures continued

in this geography. However, we mitigated

these by launching 27 new products.

Revenue from Europe increased by 49% to

₹ 11.7 billion - thanks to expansion of the

base business, new product launches and

scaling up in new geographies such as Italy,

Spain and France.

Revenue from Emerging Markets grew

by 14% to ₹ 32.8 billion. Each of our key

markets - Russia, the CIS countries, Romania

and the Rest of the World territories -

witnessed signiﬁ cant revenue growth.

Revenue from India was ₹ 28.9 billion, or

a growth of 11% compared to FY2019.

This was due to an increase in both sales

volume and price of our existing products,

plus additional revenues from the launch

of 21 new brands. We also entered the

nutrition segment by launching our diabetes

nutrition drink ‘Celevida’.

Revenue from Pharmaceutical Services

and Active Ingredients increased by 7% to

₹ 25.7 billion.

Revenue from Proprietary Products was

₹ 7.9 billion. In FY2020, we sold our US

and select territory rights for some products

belonging to our neurology franchise.

Your company’s path to excelling in the

manufacture of complex generics and

biosimilars depends on its successful ﬁ ling

for new drugs - be these formulations or

active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

In FY2020, your company ﬁ led

eight new Abbreviated New Drug

Applications (ANDAs) with the US Food

and Drug Administration (USFDA).

As on 31 March 2020, your company had

99 generic ﬁ lings pending approval from the

USFDA, consisting of 97 ANDAs and two

New Drug Applications (NDAs). We believe

that 30 of these 97 ANDAs have ‘First to

File’ status. In APIs, we ﬁ led 98 Drug Master

Files worldwide during FY2020, including

10 ﬁ lings in the US.

K Satish Reddy

letter*, some 6.2

million people have been infected by the

virus, and over 370,000 have lost their lives

across the world. The US is reeling with

over 1.8 million cases; the number of cases

has shot up exponentially in Brazil and

Russia; and with over 180,000 cases, India

now features among the ten worst aff ected

nations.

Over and above the sheer humanitarian

and health costs that the pandemic has

imposed on countries, rich and poor alike,

the economic costs are estimated to be

phenomenal.

According to the International Monetary

Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook

(April, 2020), global GDP growth is expected

to crash by 5.9 percentage points - from

2.9% in CY2019 to -3% in CY2020. It could

be worse. For India, growth is estimated to

reduce by 5.5 percentage points: from 5%

GDP growth in FY2019 to -0.5% in FY2020.

IN SUCH A TERRIBLE GLOBAL MILIEU,

HOW DO WE EXPECT YOUR COMPANY

TO PERFORM?

The national lockdown that was imposed

in India from 25 March 2020, coupled with

similar lockdowns in other countries, led

to major disruptions in the supply chain

and in logistics. These, plus restrictions

on people movement, adversely impacted

plant operations. Added to such constraints

were restraints on face-to-face meetings

with doctors, which is critical for domestic

marketing. All these factors challenged

the usual manner of doing business.

In large part, we rose to the occasion with

timely and proactive initiatives supported by

our strong digital infrastructure. Well before

COVID-19, we had been working at rapidly

building various digital platforms not only

across our businesses but also with our

suppliers, buyers and doctors. Thanks to this

digital backbone, we managed to continue

most of our business operations despite

the initial challenges. Going forward, we will

be using our digital channels even more

actively to enable working from home and

to reach out to doctors, customers and

vendors.

Various measures have been undertaken to

ensure that our manufacturing operations

continue unhampered. Moreover, across

all our manufacturing and R&D facilities,

offi ces and canteens, we have rigorously

imposed social distancing, masks at work

and frequent hand sanitizing.

In the initial period, we witnessed two

opposite developments. On the one hand,

there were incremental sales in certain

markets, such as the US, Europe and Russia,

thanks to panic buying of medicines. On the

other, some of our sales were impacted and

deferred in APIs, in the India business and

in a few Emerging Markets.

Overall, however, there was no major impact

of the pandemic on either in Q4 FY2020 or

the full year FY2020.

Equally, there is no denying that we may

face many COVID-19 related uncertainties

in FY2021. Let us touch upon a few.

First, pharmaceutical players worldwide

have been hugely dependent on China

for their supply of intermediates and

APIs. We believe this will change.

Global pharmaceutical majors will want

to reduce their dependence on China;

and there ought to be more backward

integration as companies attempt to

establish themselves as end-to-end

manufacturers. Here, your company has an

advantage, thanks to its signiﬁ cant in-house

API facilities.

Second, we expect to see greater outlays

in preventive healthcare and for public

health emergencies. While that is good

for all nations, and especially India where

such spends are woefully inadequate, it

is not certain how it will directly beneﬁ t

pharmaceutical companies, other than

hospital equipment suppliers.

Third, if the pandemic continues for another

six to eight months as it is expected to,

we should be prepared to see increasing

delays in the treatment of other diseases.

Hospitals and nursing homes all over the

world have already begun to push back

admission of non COVID-19 patients.

Delays in treating these patients could lead

to worsening health conditions, as well as

reduced demand for many pharmaceutical

products.

Fourth, on the ﬂ ip side, there can be an

increased demand for over-the-counter

(OTC) medicines. The COVID-19 outbreak

has seen a signiﬁ cant upsurge in buying

of OTC medicines, especially relating

to immunity enhancement, vitamins,

analgesics, and ﬂ u and anti-infective

medication. This stockpiling is expected

to continue in the short-term, and result in

demand surges for OTC drugs.

Fifth, in the short-term we will see

less face-to-face interaction between

medical representatives and doctors.

Given its importance, one might witness

some negative impact on pharmaceutical

sales. Here, we are at an advantage given

our strong digital platforms.

Sixth, other than the race for COVID-19

vaccines, one might see some

de-prioritization on R&D.

Finally, the pandemic will seriously aff ect

medical tourism via travel restrictions.

This, in turn, will reduce the consumption of

pharmaceutical products across hospitals

and selected pharma outlets.

Despite these signiﬁ cant uncertainties,

we believe that successful execution of

our strategy mentioned earlier - involving

leadership in chosen spaces, operational

excellence and continuous improvement,

and patient-centric product innovation - will

create the necessary levers to deal with this

uncertain business environment.

Stay safe. Stay healthy.

With our best regards,

*As on 31 May 2020

Annual Report 2019-20:

letter dated

5 November 2015 relating to good

manufacturing practice (cGMP) deviations

at our API manufacturing facilities

at Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh and

Miryalaguda, Telangana, as well as at

our oncology formulation manufacturing

facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam,

Andhra Pradesh.

The contents of the warning: letter

emanated from Form 483 observations

that followed inspections of these three

sites by the USFDA in November 2014,

January 2015 and February-March 2015,

respectively.

Pending resolution of the issues

identiﬁ ed in the warning letter, the

USFDA withheld approval of new

products from these facilities.

After receiving the warning letter, we

promptly instituted corrective and

preventive actions and submitted

a comprehensive response to

the USFDA, followed by periodic

written updates and in-person

meetings. Moreover, to minimize

the business impact, we transferred

certain key products to alternate

manufacturing facilities.

Our strategy for the

Emerging Markets is to

build a healthy portfolio

pipeline, including

expansion of biosimilars

and oncology products.

SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF

NEW DIRECTORS

Recommending any new member on the

board is the responsibility of the NGCC

of the board, which consists entirely of

independent directors. Given the existing

composition of the board, the tenure

as well as the years left of the existing

members to serve on the board, and

the need for new domain expertise are

reviewed by this committee. When such a

need becomes apparent, the committee

reviews potential candidates in terms of

their expertise, attributes, personal and

LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

Upon their appointment, independent

directors are given a formal appointment: letter containing, inter alia, the term of

appointment, roles, function, duties and

responsibilities, the company’s code of

conduct, disclosures and conﬁ dentiality.

For such terms and conditions, see:

www.drreddys.com/investor/governance/

policies-and-documents/terms-condition-

directors.html

BOARD EVALUATION

Since FY2015, the board has carried

out an annual self-evaluation of

its performance, the working of its

committees and peer evaluation of each

director internally. Prior to that, on two

such occasions, an independent expert

was engaged to conduct the evaluation

process.

During FY2019, an independent expert

was engaged to perform the evaluation

and eff ectiveness process of the board,

its committees and individual directors.

During FY2020, the evaluation process

was undertaken internally.

For the purpose of this year's annual

evaluation, each director completed a

questionnaire involving peer evaluation

and feedback on processes of the board

and its committees. The contribution

and impact of individual members were

evaluated on a number of parameters,

such as level of engagement,

independence of judgment, conﬂ icts

resolution, contributions to enhance

the board’s overall eff ectiveness, etc.

Peer ratings on certain parameters,

positive attributes and improvement areas

for each director were provided to them on

a conﬁ dential basis.

The committees were evaluated on various

parameters such as eff ective discharge

of their roles, responsibilities and advice

given to the board for discharging its

ﬁ duciary responsibilities, including

adequate and periodical updates to the

board on the committees’ functioning.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION

We have a policy for the remuneration

of directors, key managerial personnel

(KMP), senior management personnel

(SMP) and other employees. It lays down

principles and parameters to ensure

that remunerations are competitive,

reasonable, and in line with corporate and

individual performance. The remuneration

policy is enclosed as Annexure A to this

chapter.

Executive directors are appointed by

members' resolution for a period of ﬁ ve

years. No severance fee is payable to

them. Except the commission payable,

all other components of remuneration to

the executive directors are ﬁ xed in line

with the company’s policies. Their annual

remuneration, including commission

based on standalone net proﬁ ts of

the company, is recommended by the

NGCC to the board for its consideration.

While recommending such commission,

the committee also takes into account

the overall corporate performance in

a given year and the key performance

indicators (KPIs). The remunerations are

within the limits approved by members.

Perquisites and retirement beneﬁ ts are

paid in accordance with the company’s

compensation policies, as applicable to

all employees.

Independent directors are entitled to

receive sitting fees, commission based on

the standalone net proﬁ ts of the company

and reimbursement of any expenses for

attending meetings of the board and its

committees. Such remuneration, including

commission payable, is in conformity

with the provisions of the Companies

Act, 2013, and has been considered and

approved by the board and the members.

The company, in compliance with Section

197 of the Companies Act, 2013, and the:

managing director and

chief executive offi cer (CEO) are permanent

invitees to all committee meetings.

Offi cials heading IPDO, GMO, quality,

proprietary products and biologics are also

invited to the meetings. The head of IPDO

acts as secretary of the committee.

The committee met four times during the

year: on 16 May 2019, 29 July 2019,

31 October 2019 and 25 January 2020.

Table 8 gives the composition and

attendance record of the committee,

and its report is enclosed as Exhibit 3 to

this chapter.

RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

The risk management committee also

consists entirely of independent directors.

Its key functions are to:

(ERM) and management of cyber

security risks and other key risks;

Ensure that it is apprised of the most

signiﬁ cant risks along with mitigating

actions taken by management; and

Review risk disclosure statements in

any public documents or disclosures,

where applicable.

The company has in place an enterprise-

wide risk management system.

The risk management committee

of the board oversees and reviews

the risk management framework as

well as the assessment of risks, their

management and mitigation procedures.

The committee reports its ﬁ ndings and

this annual report.

The chairman, CEO, CIA and the CCO

management committee meetings.

growth across North America Generics,

Emerging Markets and India, with a strong

growth in Europe.

Revenues from North America stood at

` 64.7 billion, registering a year-on-year

growth of 8%. This was largely on account

of revenue contribution from new products

launched, increase in volumes for some of

our base products, and favourable foreign

exchange movement, partly off set by high

price erosions in some of our products.

During the year, the company ﬁ led eight

abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)

in the USA. As of 31 March 2020, there were

99 generic ﬁ lings awaiting approval with the

US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA),

comprising 97 ANDAs and two NDAs ﬁ led

under Section 505(b)(2). Of the 97 ANDAs, 54

are Para IV applications, and we believe 30 of

these have ‘First to File’ status.

Revenues from Emerging Markets were

` 32.8 billion, registering a year-on-year

growth of 14%. Revenues from India stood

at ` 28.9 billion, registering a year-on-year

growth of 11%. Revenues from Europe were

` 11.7 billion, registering a year-on-year

growth of 49%.

Revenues from PSAI stood at ` 25.7 billion,

registering a year-on-year growth of 7%.

During the year, the company ﬁ led 10 drug

master ﬁ les (DMFs) in the US.

SCHEME OF AMALGAMATION

During the year, the board of directors

approved the scheme of amalgamation

of Dr. Reddy’s Holdings Limited with

the company (“the scheme”) subject to

the receipt of necessary approvals from

statutory authorities, members, creditors

and Hon’ble National Company Law

Tribunal (NCLT), Hyderabad. The company

October 2019, from the BSE Limited and

National Stock Exchange of India Limited

on the basis of no comments received

from Securities and Exchange Board of

India (SEBI). The members and unsecured

creditors of the company at the Hon’ble

NCLT convened meetings held on 2

January 2020, approved the said scheme

with requisite majority. The petition for

approval of the said scheme has been ﬁ led

with the Hon’ble NCLT, Hyderabad Bench

on 9 January 2020. The ﬁ nal hearing on the

petition is pending.

DIVIDEND

Your directors are pleased to recommend

a dividend of ` 25 (500%) for FY2020,

dividend distribution policy of the company.

The dividend, if approved at the 36th annual

letter from Chairman and Co-Chairman included in the Annual report, which is expected to be made available to us

after that date. The Other information does not include the Standalone Ind AS ﬁ nancial statements, Consolidated Ind AS ﬁ nancial statements

and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated Ind AS ﬁ nancial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any

form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS ﬁ nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing

so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated Ind AS ﬁ nancial statements or our knowledge

obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a

material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated Ind AS ﬁ nancial

statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated ﬁ nancial position, consolidated ﬁ nancial

performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash ﬂ ows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group

and joint ventures in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind

AS) speciﬁ ed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective

Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting

records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and of its joint ventures and for preventing

and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates

that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal ﬁ nancial controls, that were

operating eff ectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of

the consolidated Ind AS ﬁ nancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or

error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated Ind AS ﬁ nancial statements by the Directors of the Holding

Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated Ind AS ﬁ nancial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of

its joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its joint ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as

applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate

the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are also responsible for overseeing the

ﬁ nancial reporting process of the Group and of its joint ventures.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated Ind AS ﬁ nancial statements as a whole are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high

level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it

exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be

expected to inﬂ uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated Ind AS ﬁ nancial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

We also:

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ind AS ﬁ nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error,

design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a

basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as

fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the

circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company

has adequate internal ﬁ nancial controls with reference to ﬁ nancial statements in place and the operating eff ectiveness of such controls.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

letter dated 30 April 2014 that the Company had

violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the “CPSA”) and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (the “PPPA”) and that the CPSC intended

to seek civil penalties. Speciﬁ cally, the CPSC asserted, among other things, that from or about 14 August 2008 through 1 June 2012,

the Company sold prescription drugs having unit dose packaging that failed to comply with the CPSC’s special child resistant packaging

regulations under the PPPA and failed to issue general certiﬁ cates of conformance. In addition, the CPSC asserted that the Company violated

the CPSA by failing to immediately advise the CPSC of the alleged violations. The Company disagrees with the CPSC’s allegations.

Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) began to investigate a sealed complaint which was ﬁ led in the United States

District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) related to these same issues (the “FCA

Complaint”). The Company cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation. The DOJ and all States involved in the investigation declined to

intervene in the FCA Complaint. On 10 November 2015, the FCA Complaint was unsealed and the plaintiff whistleblowers, who are two

former employees of the Company, proceeded without the DOJ’s and applicable States’ involvement. The unsealed FCA Complaint relates

to the 6 blister pack products originally subject to the investigation and also 38 of the Company’s generic prescription products sold in the

U.S. in various bottle and cap packaging.

The Company ﬁ led its response to the FCA Complaint on 23 February 2016 in the form of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon

which relief can be granted. On 26 March 2017, the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss, dismissing the FCA Complaint and

allowing the plaintiff s one more chance to reﬁ le this complaint in an attempt to plead sustainable allegations.

On 29 March 2017, the plaintiff s ﬁ led their ﬁ nal amended FCA Complaint, which the Company opposed and during the three months ended

31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff s ﬁ led a petition with the Court requesting

that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

The parallel investigation by the CPSC under the CPSA and the PPPA was referred by the CPSC to the DOJ’s offi ce in Washington, D.C.

in April 2016, with the recommendation that the DOJ initiate a civil penalty action against the Company. The CPSC matter referred to the DOJ

relates to ﬁ ve of the blister pack products.

On 18 January 2018, the Company and the DOJ entered into a settlement of the action and agreed to a consent decree providing for a civil

penalty of US$5 millions (` 319), and injunctive relief. The settlement was without adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and the Company

has not admitted any violations of law pursuant to this settlement.

During the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff s

subsequently ﬁ led a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice,

and that request was denied.

In June 2018, the plaintiff s ﬁ led their Notice of Appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. During the three months ended September 2018,

the plaintiff s and the DOJ settled and thus this appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff s then ﬁ led an application for recovery of attorneys'

fees from the Company under the "alternative remedy doctrine." The Company made opposing ﬁ lings to this and in response the plaintiff s

withdrew their application.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the FCA Complaint is not probable. Accordingly, no

provision has been made in these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

letter from Glenmark Farmaceutica Ltda and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited (collectively

“Glenmark”) for invocation of arbitration under a distribution agreement and a deed of assignment relating to a product between the Company

and Glenmark. Glenmark alleged that the non-supply of the product by the Company severely aff ected the value of the intellectual property

and goodwill and asserted claims to recover the loss along with interest and penalties from the Company.

In March 2018, an arbitrator was appointed by the Supreme Court of India at Glenmark’s request. In July 2018, Glenmark ﬁ led a claim

statement against the Company and in September 2018, the Company ﬁ led a reply against the claim along with a counterclaim.

Glenmark ﬁ led a reply to the counter claim of the Company in November 2018 and the issues were ﬁ nalised. Inspection of documents along

with the ﬁ ling of the statement of admissions and denials was completed in December 2018.The Company was asked to submit the list of

witnesses by 5 March 2019.

Affi davits in chief examination were ﬁ led by witnesses of the Company and Glenmark. The cross examination of the witnesses of Glenmark

was completed and that of the Company commenced and continued in November and December 2019. The parties have agreed to settle

the disputes for an amount of ` 50 payable by the Company to Glenmark.

Accordingly, during the three months ended 31 December 2019, the Company recognised the provision of ` 50 representing the probable

outﬂ ow on account of settlement of litigation. The such provision is recognised as part of “Selling and other expenses”.

The Settlement Deed entered into between the parties was conﬁ rmed as an arbitral award dated 11 February 2020 by the arbitrator and the

issue remains closed.

MR. PRASAD R MENON (DIN:00005078), INDEPENDENT

DIRECTOR, IN TERMS OF REGULATION 17(1A) OF

THE SEBI (LISTING OBLIGATIONS AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS) REGULATIONS, 2015.

To consider and, if thought ﬁ t, to pass, with or without

modiﬁ cation(s), the following resolution as a special resolution:

“RESOLVED THAT pursuant to the Regulation 17(1A) and any

other applicable Regulations of the Securities and Exchange

Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)

Regulations, 2015 including any statutory modiﬁ cations and

re-enactment thereof, for the time being in force, approval

of the members of the company be and is hereby accorded

for continuation of directorship of Mr. Prasad R Menon

managing director. In the mid-1990s, as the company

prepared for its global foray, he anchored the establishment of

key systems and initiatives that positioned Dr. Reddy’s for rapid

expansion and helped to build its brand and corporate identity.

Mr. Reddy played an instrumental role in the company’s transition

from a bulk drugs manufacturer to a global player in the branded

space by spearheading Dr. Reddy’s entry into international Emerging

Markets, especially Russia. He is focused on translating the

company’s strategy into action to drive its growth and performance

globally.

Mr. Reddy was reappointed as whole-time director designated as: managing director and chief operating offi cer for a period of ﬁ ve years

commencing on 1 October 2012. After the demise of the company’s

founder, Dr. K Anji Reddy, he was re-designated as vice-chairman

and managing director with eff ect from 30 March 2013 and has

been subsequently re-designated as the chairman of the company

with eff ect from 13 May 2014.

The board of directors and members of Dr. Reddy’s, at their

meetings on 12 May 2017 and 28 July 2017 respectively, approved

the reappointment of Mr. K Satish Reddy as a whole-time director

designated as chairman of the company for a further period of ﬁ ve

years, commencing from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2022,

liable to retire by rotation. He retires by rotation at the 36th AGM of

The company has received an intimation in form DIR-8 pursuant

to Rule 14 of the Companies (Appointment and Qualiﬁ cation of

He leads the core team that drives the growth and performance

at Dr. Reddy’s. He has played a key role in the evolution of

Dr. Reddy’s from a mid-sized pharmaceutical company into a

globally respected pharmaceutical major. Mr. Prasad is widely

credited as the architect of Dr. Reddy’s successful Global Generics

(GG) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) strategies, as well

as the company’s foray into biosimilars, Proprietary Products and

diff erentiated formulations.

Mr. Prasad was listed among the Top 50 CEOs that India ever had

by Outlook magazine in 2017 and was recognized as one of the

Top Five Most Valuable CEOs of India by Business World in 2016.

He was also listed in the prestigious ‘Medicine Maker 2018 Power

List’ of the most inspirational professionals shaping the future of

drug development, and has been named India Business Leader of

the year by CNBC Asia in 2015.

Prior to May 2014, he held titles of chairman and chief executive

offi cer. He was the: managing director of Cheminor Drugs Limited,

prior to its merger with Dr. Reddy’s. He was reappointed as

whole-time director designated as co-chairman, managing director

and CEO of the company at the 32nd AGM of the members held on 27

July 2016, for a period of ﬁ ve years commencing 30 January 2016

to 29 January 2021, liable to retire by rotation. Subsequently he

was re-designated as co-chairman and managing director of the

company eff ective from 1 August 2019.

As part of the initiative to create enduring guidance for the company,

the board of directors of the company, at their meeting held on 20

May 2020, have approved the reappointment of Mr. G V Prasad

as whole-time director designated as co-chairman and managing

director of the company for a further period of ﬁ ve years commencing

30 January 2021 to 29 January 2026.

The company has, inter alia, received an intimation in Form

DIR-8 pursuant to Rule 14 of the Companies (Appointment and

Qualiﬁ cation of

in 2006, he stepped outside the chemicals ﬁ eld to become: managing director of Tata Power Company Limited, from where

he eventually retired in January 2011. Mr. Prasad R Menon also

holds directorship in the Singapore Tourism Board and Sanmar

Group Advisory Board.

He is the chairman of nomination, governance & compensation

committee and a member of science, technology and operations

committee of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited. He is also a

member of the governance committee of Singapore Tourism

Board. The continued association of Mr. Menon would be of

immense beneﬁ t to the company.
