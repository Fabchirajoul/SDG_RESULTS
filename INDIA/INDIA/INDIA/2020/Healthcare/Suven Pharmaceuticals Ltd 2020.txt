For Suven Pharmaceuticals Limited

K Hanumantha Rao

Company Secretary

Encl: as above:

Dear shareholders,

Q

UESTIONS. That’s what

makes an entity more

responsible and more

accountable. The ability to ask

questions and the courage

to field questions are seeded

deep into the genes of Suven

Pharma. And, this genetic

structure makes it resoundingly

independent and robust right

from the birth.

Representing an organisation

which has shown that baby

steps can be giant strides with

strong determination and

flawless strategy is indeed a

matter of great pride.

Suven Pharma, as you all know, is

born out of Suven Lifesciences.

You must be wondering

what drove us to create an

independent entity. The answer

lies in the questions you had

been posing before us: Why are

you restricting yourself to a small

part of the entire value chain?

Why aren’t you expanding your

activity? What stops you from

leveraging your deep chemistry

skills in synergic verticals? And,

so on.

In response to all your queries,

here I present your very own

company, which is focused on

expanding its horizon, vertically

and laterally, with the objective

of emerging as a full-fledged

pharmaceutical solutions

provider.

We are steadily building the

infrastructure and capabilities to

reach that level. Suven Pharma

will not just be about CDMO.

It will be a lot more. Even in

CRAMS, which was until now

restricted to intermediates,

will now straddle the

pharmaceutical value chain. We

will also expand our customer

profile from innovators to virtual

companies and local markets for

multinationals.

Our first step in this direction

was entering the formulations

space. And, I must mention that

it has been a healthy beginning.

We cherry-picked our niche

opportunities and worked deftly

in translating them into reality.

And it worked with three out

of eleven products we filed

received approvals from the

regulator. Even as I write to you,

our team has shipped the first

few batches of two products,

while the fourth is awaiting

approval. In a few-years from

now, Suven should have a

healthy basket of products in

its pipeline, at various stages of

development.

Rising Pharma Holdings, Inc.,

our associate, may also assist

us in enlarging our formulation

venture. Rising is a development

and distribution company in the

FROM THE

HELM

06

SUVEN PHARMACEUTICALS LIMITED

ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20

formulations space. It has many

ANDAs in development every

year with its partners. Some of

those may fit into our capability

matrix. For those products,

we will have the first right of

refusal. I look forward to projects

coming out of Rising. The

additional advantage with Rising

is its strong forte in distribution.

I would like to mention that

we – Suven and Rising – have

interesting synergies which

will help us explore ways of

combining our capabilities for

strengthening our individual

businesses and our business

relations.

To cater to these opportunities,

we drew up a H320-crore capex

plan which includes creating a

multi-vertical capacity. Out of

this, H210 crore was pumped

into the business up to 2019-20,

while the rest will be invested

this year. Our OEL facility – a

highly sophisticated and

automated unit which operates

in a closed atmosphere – began

operations during the year

under review, while our other

facilities such as speciality

chemicals and formulations will

go on stream this year.

So, the question you would want

to ask me now is: Do we have

the products and customers

in place? No, we don’t. But we

have to prepare. Because, if you

do not have the capacity, you do

not get the business. Conversely,

when the capacity is ready, it

will not start generating revenue

from day one.

At Suven, we have to take tough

strategic calls. This capacity

creation is one such call which

is based on interactions with

customers and the future

requirements. The intrinsic value

from our investment will come

when we are able to secure

projects appropriate for our

capacities. Till then, we have the

flexibility to utilise it for other

products.

Expansion at Suven will not

only transpire in terms of

adding new revenue verticals,

it will also expand our existing

operations. Take CDMO for

instance. In a few years from

now, CDMO will not be the

same. We are manufacturing

only intermediates today, and

we would be doing much more

tomorrow.

Our customer requirements

are also increasing. They want

us to move up the value chain

so that we are able to engage

with them for managing the

entire product lifecycle. We have

responded to that – our first

step being creating relevant

capacities. We are working

out the contours of moving

into this higher orbit with our

customers as well as within

the organisation. It would

take time but I am definite

that this change will happen

inevitably. We will prudently

utilise our operational cash flow

to acquire new technologies

with an eye on the prospective

customer category it can cater

to, undertake technology-based

development which will then

help sourcing and securing

relevant projects.

With these strategies in

place, we have drawn up a

comprehensive blueprint for

the current year. I am cautiously

optimistic about our growth.

This is primarily owing to the

pandemic which has ravaged

the world, pushing nations,

economies, businesses and

people on the edge. It’s a shock

the world was ill-prepared for

and will take long to recover

from.

This catastrophe has taken a

toll on Suven as well, though

our robust business model

lowered the impact. We

expect our existing projects to

continue, deliveries for which

could be delayed by a month

or so because of labour and

logistics issues. The issue will be

in acquiring new development

projects because not much is

happening in that space now.

But, given the current business

in hand, I feel we should be able

to grow our topline by about 10-

15% over the previous year.

In 2020-21, we will bring

in the power of disciplined

creativity to find newer ways

to grow. And then approach

these opportunities with a

determination to seize the future

one day at a time.

From a medium-term

perspective, by when we will

hopefully see our strategy in

motion, our business profitability

should be evenly balanced

between our three verticals

– CDMO-Pharma, CDMO-

Non-Pharma and formulations

– making Suven a full-fledged

pharmaceutical solutions

provider.

In closing, I would like to thank

the Board for guiding me to

execute my responsibilities

in the best possible manner.

I would like to extend my

gratitude to each and every

member of our team for their

relentless efforts in making

Suven a respected and

responsible partner to innovator

companies globally.

My deep appreciation to

all our loyal and valuable

shareholders for their

confidence and support. I also

place on record my gratitude

to all our other stakeholders –

vendors, customers, bankers

and government authorities

– for their consistent support

and assistance. I solicit your

continued co-operation in

helping Suven move into a

brighter future.

Significant accounting policies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended by the

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) (Amendments) Rules,

2016, the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

and the guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of

India (SEBI), as applicable.

The financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020 were

approved by the Board of directors on June 18, 2020.

(ii) Basis of measurement

The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost and

on accurual basis, except for the following items in the balance sheet:

Certain financial assets are measured either at fair value or at

amortised cost depending on the classification

Employee defined benefit assets/(liability) are recognised as the

net total of the fair value of plan assets, plus actuarial losses,

less actuarial gains and the present value of the defined benefit

obligation; and

Share-based payments which are measured at fair value of the

options

Right-of-use assets are recognised at the present value of lease

payments that are not paid at that date. This amount is adjusted for

any lease payments made at or before the commencement date,

lease incentives received and initial direct costs, incurred, if any.

b) Current versus non-current classification

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current

as per the Company’s normal operating cycle and other criteria set

out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1,

Presentation of Financial Statements.

An asset is treated as current when:

Expected to be realised or intended to sold or consumed in

normal operating cycle

Held primarily for the purpose of trading

Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting

period, or

Cash and cash equivalent unless restricted from being

exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months

after the reporting period

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle

It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting

period, or

There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the

liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period

The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets

and liabilities.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for

processing and their realisation in Cash and Cash equivalents. The

Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.

c)

Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with

the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision

maker. The Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the Chief

Operating Decision Maker. Refer note 28 for the segment information

presented.

d) New Standard adopted by the company:

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) notified

Ind AS 116, Leases as part of the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards (Ind AS)) Amendment Rules, 2019. Ind AS 116 replaces

the existing standard on leases i.e. Ind AS 17, Leases effective for

accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract

is or contains a lease, which applies if the contract conveys the

right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time

in exchange for consideration. The Company recognises a right-

of-use asset at the commencement date of the lease, i.e. the date

the underlying asset is available for use. Assets and liabilities

arising from a lease are initially measured at present value, which

comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any

lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus

any initial direct cost incurred and an estimate of cost to dismantle

and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying

asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives

received.

As a Lessee:

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight

line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end

of the useful life or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful life
