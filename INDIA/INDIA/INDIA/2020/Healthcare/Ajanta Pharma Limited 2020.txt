Letter to Shareholder

We hope and wish that all of you have been safe and

healthy during this unprecedented challenge faced by

the humanity. The uncertainty around the course of

the COVID-19 pandemic started in March leading to

governments across the world initiating lockdowns. This

partly affected our business and operations in the last

month of FY2020. As the disruption got into FY 2021, its

major impact on global economics will be seen in the

quarters ahead. We need to accept the new normal for

working – be it in the corporate office, factories, R&D

laboratories, or on the field for doctors’ meetings.

Though, demand disruption is least for pharmaceuticals

in comparison to other industries, operational

challenges are still huge. We also require strong

response on costs to preserve cash to manage volatility

in the external environment. But our strong balance

sheet provides us the confidence that we will once again

emerge resilient.

Last financial year was truly the demonstration of our

resilient business model. While defying challenges, we

also continued to achieve the growth in almost all our

geographies.

This resilience in our business model was built

over last 2 decades where we invested in different

markets and geographies in a sustained manner

to de-risk the business. FY 2020 saw the US generic

business contributing meaningfully to your Company’s

performance.

We continued our focus on building strong brands

across the markets. Our consistent efforts to provide

Dear Shareholder,

differentiated products along with seamless execution

allow us to delight our customers, which in turn

generates superior quality business for us. This year

was no exception as it reconfirmed our capability to

take the challenges in the stride and achieve growth on

consistent basis - displaying the inherent resilience of

the organisation.

The year also saw conclusion of major capex-cycle

spread over the last 6 years which saw your Company

investing about H 1,600 cr., including investments in three

greenfield manufacturing facilities (Dahej, Guwahati and

Pithampur) and expansion of R&D centre. This capital was

allocated to ensure we continue to be ready for satisfying

upcoming opportunities, while maintaining highest

quality standards. Most importantly, it was funded

entirely from internal accruals. With all these facilities

commencing operations, we expect easing of pressure on

our operating free cash flow in coming years.

Segment Review

Branded Generic business, which constitute almost 70%

of our revenue, is strongly built on providing solutions

to the patients for their unmet medical needs through

R&D and achieve consistent growth. For the year, it

performed well with a growth of 17% and going forward,

should achieve a growth in the range of low teens.

Indian Pharmaceutical Market (IPM) saw a volatile

movement month over month during FY2020. However,

our branded generic business in India grew 13% against

industry growth of 11% as per IQVIA MAT March 2020.
