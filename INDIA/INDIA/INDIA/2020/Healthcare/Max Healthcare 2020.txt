revenues and 66% growth in EBITDA. On a proforma

consolidated basis including the demerged business

INR 4,371 Crores and the operating EBITDA stood at

INR 589.8 Crores (Post INDAS). With a very strong

performance last year, we also emerged as amongst

the industry leaders on many financial parameters.

These results are a testimony to the successful

implementation of our focused approach towards

unlocking value through operational efficiency and

organisational reinforcement.

This year, we also embarked on an exercise to sharply

define our purpose. What emerged was a reaffirmation

of our values of Compassion, Excellence, Efficiency

and Consistency with our motto ‘To serve. To excel.’

keeping the wellbeing of our patients, uppermost

in mind.

been hugely encouraging. There are over 80 on-going

clinical research projects currently in partnership with

various reputed institutes including Imperial College

London and NIHR (National Institute of Health

Research, UK) with over 15,000 research participants,

Ohio State University (USA), Deakin University

(Australia) and University of Antwerp (Belgium).

INTERNAL

FINANCIAL

CONTROLS

&

ITS

ADEQUACY

WITH

REFERENCE

TO

THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Your Company has put in place an adequate system of

internal financial control commensurate with its size

and nature of business which helps in ensuring the

orderly and efficient conduct of its business.

These systems provide a reasonable assurance

in respect of providing financial and operational

information, complying with applicable statutes,

safeguarding of assets of the Company, prevention

& detection of frauds, accuracy & completeness of

accounting records and ensuring compliance with

corporate policies.

The Financial policies, standards and delegations

of authority have been disseminated to senior

management to cascade within their departments.

During the year, your Company has taken various key

new initiatives to improve reliability and objectivity

in Financial Reporting & Controls viz. review of

key Accounting policies with the Audit and Risk

Committee ("AC"), review of significant areas requiring

management estimates and judgement with the AC,

change in Depreciation Policy after benchmarking

with the best in class, Digitisation of various module

and processes, improvement in MIS and introduction

of auto alerts and exception control reporting to

improve control environment.

During the year, such controls were tested and

no reportable material weakness in the design or

operation was observed.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness

of any system of disclosure controls and procedures,

including the possibility of human error and the

circumvention or overriding of the controls and

procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure

controls and procedures can only provide reasonable

assurance of achieving their control objectives.

Further, in the design and evaluation of our

disclosure controls and procedures, our management

was necessarily required to apply its judgment in

evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible

controls and procedures.

Your Company has a dedicated Internal Audit team

and the Internal Audit Head reports functionally to

the AC of Board that reviews and approves annual

internal audit plan. The Company's AC, which is a

sub-committee of the Board, reviews internal control

systems and internal audit reports and performance

of the internal audit function on a periodic basis.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Management is overall responsible for identifying,

evaluating and managing all significant risks faced

by the Company. The Board monitors and reviews

the implementation of various aspects of the Risk

Management Framework of the Company through

the AC.

The Company follows detailed risk assessment and

mitigation procedures, which are reviewed by the

AC. The Company has in place a Risk Management

Framework for identifying risks and opportunities that

may have a bearing on the organisation's objectives,

assessing them in terms of likelihood and magnitude

of impact and determining a response strategy.

The AC assists the Board in evaluating the Risk

Management System of the Company including

Risk Framework; Risk Processes (Risk Identification,

Assessment, Mitigation and Monitoring) laid down

by the Management. The AC provides oversight of

the Company's management of key risks, including

strategic and operational risks, as well as the

guidelines, policies and processes for monitoring and

mitigating such risks under the aegis of the overall

business risk management framework.

In the opinion of the Board, none of the risks faced

by your Company threatens its existence, however,

keeping in view the areas in which your Company

operates, risks with respect to litigation by / against

the Company or regulatory directions having impact

on various cost lines, may arise or may become

material in nature.

WHISTLE BLOWER POLICY / VIGIL MECHANISM

Your Company promotes integrity and ethical

behavior in its business activities and has a Whistle

Blower Policy to provide appropriate avenues to the

stakeholders to raise bonafide concerns relating

to unethical and improper practices, irregularities,

governance weakness, financial reporting issues

or any other wrongful conduct and to prohibit the

victimization of the whistle blowers.:
