paying off any liability, investments including amongst

others, in subsidiary companies, general corporate

purposes including but not limited to pursuing new

business opportunities, acquisitions, alliances, etc. and

such other purpose as may be determined by the Board,

from time to time.

The Company is therefore seeking enabling approval of

the members to access the capital market through public

issue or on a private placement (including qualified

institutions placement) basis to create, offer, issue and

allot equity shares or other securities convertible into

equity shares of the Company or any combination

thereof and as mentioned in the resolution in one or

for Life’ has been our guiding

and will continue to light our path

Chairman’s Message:

Dear Shareholders,

I am humbled to be given the

responsibility of taking Cipla into the

future – to achieve new goals, scale

new heights and create an even

stronger legacy. I would also like to

extend my gratitude to Ciplaites -

past and present – for their passion,

commitment and partnership.

For a large organisation with global

operations, we are remarkably agile

and this is reflected in our decisions

and initiatives from time to time

- be it the portfolio revamp that

has taken our consumer business

to greater heights, or the digital

transformation that commenced in

2016 paving a smoother transition

for business continuity during the

lockdown.

Future of Pharma

The new normal is here to stay

and presents a unique opportunity

for the Indian pharma industry to

enhance its position as the largest

provider of generics globally

and emerge out of this crisis as

a preferred sourcing hub for the

world. With many countries looking

at de-risking their API supply chains

by exploring alternative sourcing

hubs, this is an opportune period for

India to step in and present itself as

a viable option in the long term. For

this to materialise, it would require

a sustained intervention from the

Government to create an enabling

environment, easing regulatory

hurdles, incentivizing research &

development and creating a strong

innovation ecosystem – not just for

India but also for exports.

In a post-pandemic world, the

influx of digitisation across the care

continuum will help Cipla reach

more patients and offer them

better solutions for awareness,

diagnostics, cure and adherence.

The resilience and agility, together

with the forward-thinking vision

of our leadership team led by

Umang Vohra, MD & Global CEO,

and the talent of our team, will

chart the way for your Company’s

outstanding performance in the

months and years to come. With our

heads up and our hearts open, we

look forward to better days!

Best Wishes,

Samina Hamied

Caring For Life since 1935

Annual Report 2019-20:

Dear Shareholders,

ability to innovate and stay ahead of

the curve.

Breathe. Think Cipla

Our lungs are exposed to a

spectrum of illnesses and the recent

COVID-19 pandemic highlighted

its crucial role in our overall

wellbeing. Over the last six decades,

unmatched presence across the care

continuum and the widest portfolio

of drug-device combinations has

established Cipla’s position as a lung

leader in India and key emerging

markets. According to the IQVIA

report (Mar 2020), Cipla is the

second largest inhaler (MDI + DPI)

selling company by volume and four

of our respiratory brands are listed

among the Top 50 medicine brands

in the country2. With ‘Breathe. Think

Cipla’, we recently articulated our

aspirations to become the lung

leaders of the world. As leaders,

we aim to build a robust respiratory

ecosystem and improve access by

bringing effective cure closer to the

patients.

Health in Your Hands

Wellness will be another growth

engine for us, accelerating

Cipla’s leadership in healthcare.

The acquisition of four umbrella

brands from Wanbury Limited in

the nutraceutical segment gave a

boost to our wellness portfolio and

strengthened our four-decade long

presence in the women’s health

category.

In line with the One India model,

we transferred select consumer-

oriented brands from trade

generics to Cipla Health, our

consumer healthcare subsidiary.

We continue to build relevance

beyond medicines, by partnering

with customers for their health and

wellness needs through our digital

therapeutics’ initiatives.

Cipla has been identified as one

of the world’s Top 3 companies

making steady progress in tackling

the global spread of Antimicrobial

Resistance (AMR). The Access to

Medicine Foundation’s Benchmark

Report 2020 has awarded Cipla

the highest score of 70%, through

an evaluation of our performance

against the key parameters of

responsible manufacturing, access

and stewardship in AMR.

Reimagining Tomorrow

As the world gets a grip on the

unabated COVID-19 pandemic, I

firmly believe that it also presented

us with multiple opportunities

to reflect and reimagine the

future! At Cipla, we swiftly

deployed technology to ensure

business continuity and offset the

disruptions caused by nation-wide

lockdowns. We acted with speed

and agility; optimising overall

resourcing across businesses and

creating a digital roadmap for the

future.

Our top priority will be to address

patient needs and maintain a

sharp focus on cost optimisation

in managing supply chain, R&D

and marketing, while ensuring

all our facilities are in a state of

compliance and control.

I feel humble to be a part of an

industry that can truly make a

difference in the lives of patients.

This is our core purpose - to be

able to care and to surge ahead

with hope and gratitude. This is

what has inspired us at Cipla for

the past 85 years and continues

to fuel our passion even today.

Apart from the gratitude I have

for the relentless support from

my colleagues at Cipla, I am also

grateful to the Cipla Board for its

guidance and counsel. I would like

to thank you, our shareholders, for

continuing to believe in us.

Best Wishes,

Umang Vohra

MD & GCEO’s Message:

Letter from

the US FDA following an inspection

of our Goa plant. While we have

been able to substantially de-risk

the impact of the Warning: Letter,

we remain extremely focused on

maintaining highest standards of

quality across our manufacturing

network and are working with the

US FDA on addressing the findings.

Enhancements during the year

Embarked upon a Quality

Transformation Programme that

covers the following aspects:

Identification & communication

of vital behaviour shifts that are

required

Deployment of structured

quality recognition programme

to reward positive behaviour

Targeted leadership

interventions to encourage and

reinforce good practices

Initiated training programmes

covering multiple aspects

Rolled out global CAPA at all sites

based on continual learnings from

audits conducted by regulatory

agencies

Our business models worldwide

are experiencing a varying

degree of disruptions such

as commoditization, digital

innovations, an increase in channel

consolidation and a shift from

curative to preventive healthcare.

In India, we witnessed pressure

on our margins and volume

growth due to commoditization

and hyper-competition in select

therapies. Further, while we enjoy

market leading positions in certain

therapies, incremental high growth

similar to the past could be

challenging.

In South Africa, we look to maintain

consistent growth while gearing

up for potential changes such as

the proposed National Health

Insurance (NHI) program. Our

Global Access and South Africa

local tender businesses were

impacted by an erosion in tender

prices.

In US, the commoditisation of

generics has led to significant

price erosion across therapies.

Growth in this market is thus led by

successful product launches. While

we progressed well on clinical trial

for generic Advair and secured

approval for Albuterol, we need to

be vigilant of intensified competition

which can prevent us from achieving

product launch outcomes that are

predicted.

Mitigation

Our One India initiative is

aimed at achieving portfolio

expansion, enhancing patient

connect and driving affordability.

This initiative will enable us to

leverage strengths across India

prescription, trade generics and

consumer health businesses.

Our Integrated Approach to Risk Management

letter in February 2020. To

address their observations, Cipla

shared a detailed plan with the

USFDA, describing the remedial

actions and improvements

we would undertake. We are

working with external experts to

achieve successful completion

of these remedial actions and

improvements, and are updating

the USFDA regularly on the

progress of our remediation and

improvement plan. Cipla also

witnessed 107 customer audits

completed by our B2B partners.

In FY 2019-20, there have been

16 recalls involving 91 batches.

For each of the recalled batches,

the impact on public health was

assessed through a Health Hazard

Evaluation. None of the batches

that we recalled posed any safety

concerns.

At Cipla, we also evaluate our

vendors and suppliers on quality

parameters, and ensure they

meet cGMP requirements of in-

house SOPs, which are prepared

according to industry regulatory

standards.

Quality targets

‘Caring for Life’ is a tradition and

a promise that we have been

abiding by for the past 85 years.

It means providing the highest

quality medicines to our patients

at affordable prices, and creating

an ecosystem that effortlessly

adapts to external changes. Cipla’s

mission is to ensure that our drugs

are effective and safe to use by

patients. We achieve this through

a process that ensures compliance

with required quality standards.

This year, we focused on three

key areas – embedding a quality

culture across the organisation

through the TRUST initiative,

leveraging the power of data and

automation to improve processes,

and growing the skills and

competencies of our employees to

deliver high quality output.

The Cipla Corporate Quality

Assurance (CQA) team is entrusted

with implementing our quality

management system through

standard operating procedures

(SOPs) and policies. The system
