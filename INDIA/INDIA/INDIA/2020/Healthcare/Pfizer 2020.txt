Managing Director Mr. S. Sridhar was re-elected

as the Chair of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce

& Industry’s (FICCI) National Pharmaceutical Committee for

the current year. He also continues to serve as an Executive

Committee Member in the Organisation of Pharmaceuticals

Producers of India (OPPI). Pfizer also assumed the Co-Chair of

the India Pharma Committee of the Pharmaceutical Research

and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the US India

Business Council (USIBC).

a)

Engagement through industry associations and direct

advocacy:

As a member of the OPPI, FICCI, PhRMA, USIBC and US

India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), your Company

continued to participate and play an active role in leading

the dialogue with relevant government stakeholders

and contributing recommendations and comments on

key policy matters such as the revision of the National

List of Essential Medicines, amendments of the Drug Price

Control Order, Drug and Magic Remedies (Objectionable

Advertisements) Amendment Bill 2020 and strengthening

of Intellectual Property eco-system among others.

b)

Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya

Yojana (AB-PMJAY):

The National Health Authority (NHA), the implementing

arm of the government’s AB-PMJAY has shown interest in

engaging with the industry and explore possibilities that

would increase the availability and access to in hospital

treatments and medicines for the AB-PMJAY beneficiaries.

The review of the Health Benefit Packages (HBPs) and

implementation of the second version of the same by the

NHA, after only one year of the launch of the scheme, has

signaled the government’s intention to cover therapeutic

areas and packages that were not covered earlier.

Your Company has been engaging with the NHA to explore

the possibility of working out mechanisms through which

innovative therapies could be included in specific HBPs and

make them available to the AB-PMJAY beneficiaries.

c)

Adult immunisation:

Your Company strongly believes that adult immunisation

against vaccine preventable pneumococcal disease

should be taken up on a large scale. With the World

Health Organization also recommending pneumococcal

vaccination to prevent deaths due to respiratory problems

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the time is appropriate

for the Government to initiate an immediate targeted

adult immunisation campaign. Your Company has been

in discussions with several State Governments to explore

the possibility of partnerships to roll out the pneumococcal

adult vaccination campaign in these States. It also

continues to explore other avenues for inclusion of adult

immunisation in specific government programs and by

government agencies such as Ayushman Bharat and

National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).

Communications

Your Company’s communications team plays the role of a key

enabler in communicating the organization’s growth plans,

important decisions and milestones to stakeholders both

internally and externally.

Externally, your Company, continued to engage with media to

share important messages pertaining to business developments

and key therapies and products. The team also showcased

important corporate responsibility initiatives to a wider universe

of external stakeholders, including media, the HCP community,

Government and industry stakeholders, through communication

and participation in industry events.

Internally,

your

Company

continued

to

maintain

a

high-impact communication program, especially to keep

colleagues informed, engaged and supported during the

COVID-19 crisis. Your Company maintained a high-performance

culture by engaging employees and aligning them with our

values, purpose and strategy. Through an active calendar of

activities that focused on the wellness of our colleagues, as well

as celebrations of achievements and festivals, your Company

worked towards bringing its colleagues together regularly.

Highlights of the year under review include:

REASONS FOR SHORTFALL IN CSR SPENT

Your Company had earmarked a significant proportion of the CSR outlay towards two key initiatives – namely the AMR - Hospital

Transformation Project in partnership with Americares and the Cancer patients support program in partnership with Tata Trusts.

Given the extensive planning required for these projects, the scale of interventions and time taken to conclude initial work,

the projects were not in a position to consume the entire outlay within the financial year.

Consequently, in line with the provisions of sub-section (6) in Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013, (to be gazetted),

your Company has placed an amount of `4.63 Crores earmarked for the aforementioned identified projects in a dedicated bank

account with a plan to utilize the same within 3 years for the said projects which are long term and continuing in nature and are

expected to remain in your Company’s CSR portfolio in the subsequent years.

Further your Company will look towards meeting its CSR spend obligations in the year 2020-21.:
