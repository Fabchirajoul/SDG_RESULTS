by a non-executive director depends on (a) amount of sitting fee fixed by the Board for meetings of the Board and a particular

Committee, and (b) number of meetings of the Board and Committee(s) thereof attended by him. Therefore, the information

as to ratio of sitting fee paid to the median remuneration of employees and percentage increase in remuneration of

non-executive directors is not relevant and meaningful. However, the said information is given here below:

letter of credit.

Management does an impairment analysis at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. In addition,

a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively.

Further, the Company’s customers base is widely distributed both economically as well as geographically and in view of

the same, the quantum risk also gets spread across wide base and hence management considers risk with respect to

trade receivable as low.

For trade receivables, as a practical expedient, the Company computes credit loss allowance based on a provision

matrix. The provision matrix is prepared based on historically observed default rates over the expected life of trade

receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates.

Expected credit loss for trade receivables under simplified approach as at the end of each reporting period is as follows:

53. The world is going through a challenging time on account of spread of COVID -19 virus. The World Health Organization (WHO)

has declared the situation as global pandemic. According to the WHO and medical practitioner’s advisory, many governments

across the world, have, inter alia, declared social distancing and lockdown as measure to prevent the rapid spread of virus.

During March 2020, the Government of India has also declared nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of COVID -19 virus.

However, in order to facilitate livelihood and minimize inconvenience to the people, Government of India has categorized

certain businesses/activities as “essential good/ services” and have permitted carrying on of those activities with due

precaution during the lockdown. Since the Group is in the business of manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical

products which is categorized as “essential goods/services”, the Group is able to continue its business during the lockdown.

However, the situation of lockdown has led to lot of uncertainty and disruption with regard to movement of people and

material. The Group is therefore, carrying on its activities with due care and precaution and there is no significant adverse

impact on the business.

The Group has also considered several internal and external information while finalizing various estimates and recoverability

of receivables, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets up to the date of approval of the Consolidated

financial statements by the Holding Company Board of Directors and the Group expects to fully recover the carrying amount

of receivables, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets. Management continues to closely monitor the

situation and changes to future economic conditions which may be caused due to COVID-19.

54. Figures of previous year have been re-grouped, rearranged and recast, wherever considered necessary. Figures in brackets
