AGM Notice

Theme: For Good

Theme explained: At Caplin Point Laboratories

Limited, we are engaged in a business that enhances

well-being for all stakeholders (‘For Good’) and is

engaged in being sustainable across time (‘For Good’).:

Managing Director’s performance review

“The principal message I wish to leave

shareholders with: that Caplin Point is

at the cusp of a journey from which

point our growth could be larger and

more profitable.”

Dr Sridhar Ganesan analyses the Company’s competitive position and prospects

Q: What was the big message

from the Company’s performance

for 2019-20?

a: When one reviews our performance

for 2019-20, there is a possibility that one

may look at our revenues and profits

and conclude that the biggest highlight

of our performance was the Company’s

sustained outperformance in Latin

America. While this would be indicative,

the highlight of the year was something

that contributed negligibly to our financial

numbers in 2019-20 – the Company’s

revenues derived from the US. In strict

financial terms, the revenues from the

US market accounted for around the

mid-single digits in percentage terms

as a proportion of our overall revenues

in 2019-20. However this was easily the

highlight – one, because US revenues

climbed 3.5X times during the year, and

two, because we see this as the bottom-

end of a long J curve that could graduate

us into a new orbit and potentially

transform the face of our Company.

Q: How is the Company intending

to strengthen its Latin American

marketing business?

a: It would have been simplistic for us

to say ‘more of the same’. But that is

precisely what is not likely to happen

in our Latin American business. On

the contrary, by the virtue of access

to rich data of markets, patients and

consumption, we are now in an informed

position to precisely understand

unmet needs. There will be an even

more informed response in the Latin

American markets. There is an additional

development that should graduate us to

the next level at a time when probable

competition could be trying to catch

up with us. The Company proactively

invested in the CRO segment to enhance

its competence in bio-equivalence studies.

The result is that when we approach

institutional and government customers

in Latin America, we will possess stronger

credentials. We will have raised the

bar, we will have positioned ourselves

as forward-looking and we will have

strengthened our brand as a company

with patient welfare as its core. As a result,

our Latin American retail operations are

not jading or plateauing out; they are at

the cusp of entering a new orbit.
