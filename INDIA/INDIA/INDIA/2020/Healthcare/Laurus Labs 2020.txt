Dear Stakeholders,

I am delighted to share with you my thoughts at the end of

what has been a satisfying financial year for Laurus Labs.

Amid an uncertain global economic environment and challenging

industry dynamics, we continued to perform with resilience.

This performance has been supported by our relentless focus on

integrating our diverse capabilities and resources, commitment

to quality that is at par with global standards, manufacturing

excellence and strong supply chain capabilities.

We registered our highest ever revenue, EBITDA and profitability

during the reporting year. Our formulations business led by

LMIC tender business continues to deliver robust growth,

resulting in 30% revenue contribution for the year. Along with the

tender business we are also pursuing emerging opportunities in

developed markets of North America and Europe. We continue to

file 8-10 ANDAs a year as we see many long-term opportunities in

the US generics space. On the other hand, our Custom Synthesis

business sustained its growth trajectory with higher volumes from

the CDMO business.

With higher volumes and introduction of new products, our

‘Other API’ business segment has registered attractive growth

during the year. We do expect this growth rate to continue

and improve in the coming quarters. Our integrated strategy is

delivering outcomes and we are investing in the future to drive

sustainable long-term growth. With the improvement in margins

and profitability in 2019-20 and the COVID impact on supply

chain petering out soon, we remain highly optimistic of delivering

even better performance across parameters, going forward.

As a responsible corporate citizen, we are equally committed to

help address the COVID-19 outbreak. We have prioritised the

safety of our employees, continued the supply of our medicines

to patients, and ensured the health of the communities where

we live and work.

Foundation continues to be strong

We have delivered more value from our differentiated market

portfolio, successfully launched new products, become a

more trusted strategic partner for customers and improved

service standards. Also, we have increased capacity utilisation

and improved business processes. Besides, we simplified our

organisational structure, implementing crucial changes that mean

operational decisionmakers, intellectual property and business

activities are now more closely located and aligned.

We have reached maximum utilisation levels of our formulation

unit and with healthy outlook and order book, we continue

to invest further in our FDF infrastructure and also in the

development. When it comes to ARV, our degrowth stemmed

primarily from lack of clarity on the awards of supplementary

tender in South Africa where our key customers are not

building up inventory.

Delivering on Our

Commitment

CEO’S MESSAGE

Once the tender results are clear, we will be able to improve our

ARV sales in the coming quarters. We have completed filing of

our second line ARV APIs of Lopinavir and Ritonavir and we expect

to do formulation development of second line API as well. In the

other API segment, we performed well, the growth was primarily

driven by contract manufacturing of APIs to other generic

companies. Synthesis business continued to show gains in line with

scale up in engagement with Aspen.

Our consolidated revenues stood at ` 28,317 million in

2019-20, against ` 22,919 million in 2018-19. We have once

again demonstrated excellence in our operational efficiencies.

Our EBIDTA grew by 53% to ` 5,695 million, vis-à-vis

` 3,712 million in the previous year. Our PAT grew by 172% to

` 2,553 million in 2019-20. For the year ending March 2020, we

declared an interim dividend of 15% amounting to ` 1.5 per share.

Our asset utilisation rates have improved with Unit 2 running at

near full capacity. With attractive business opportunities and

healthy order book for 2020-21, we continue to invest in our FDF

infrastructure. At the same time, we remain confident of achieving

positive free cash flow status from 2020-21 onwards.

Broad stakeholder engagement

We are committed to engaging with our stakeholders, including

shareholders, patients, healthcare professionals, customers,

suppliers, regulators and the communities in which we operate.

Continuous engagement with a broad fraternity of stakeholders

informs our day-to-day commercial and operational decisions, as

well as our long-term investments in our business and our people.

This helps fulfil our commitment to operate as a high-quality,

reliable source of essential medicines.

Sustainable for good reasons

During the year, we continued to strengthen our Environment,

Social and Governance (ESG) performance. On the environment

front, we are working towards reducing our carbon footprint,

plastic use and optimising the use of water in our manufacturing

facilities. On the community front, we are extending need-based

interventions in our focus areas and stepping up our COVID relief

measures to the disadvantaged sections. You can read more about

those initiatives in other sections of the Report.

A sustainable and fast-growing enterprise like ours moves on

the knowledge, innovation, and commitment of the talent pool.

During the year, we undertook several employee training and

development initiatives to upskill our workforce to stay ahead in

the markets in which we operate.

Execution with research-first approach

We are reinforcing our R&D backbone through prudent

investments to ensure a sustainable pipeline of new products

and services, to which our customers can have easy access.

Also, our emphasis on automation and quality control ensured a

good compliance track record.

Across our manufacturing sites, we set up quality systems that

encompass all areas of business processes, including supply chain,

product delivery, quality, efficiency and safety of products.

We are committed to working closely with our suppliers

and making far-reaching changes across our value chain by

encouraging our business partners, suppliers, and contractors to

adopt responsible and sustainable practices.

The challenges that we are facing owing to the unprecedented

health emergency and consequent cessation of economic

activity will be temporary and can impact a couple of quarters,

going forward. However, we are confident that our integrated

capabilities and execution brilliance will continue to drive our

brand prominence globally. I am confident I will have more

interesting developments to share in my next: letter to you.

I am thankful to our customers, employees, investors, regulators

and all other stakeholders for their vision and guidance.

Wishing you all a safe and prosperous future.
