the company for the year under review.

We were marginally impacted by the lockdown enforced

due to COVID-19 pandemic and part of operations were shut

down in last two weeks of March 2020.

The Company has taken adequate steps for safe guarding

its employees while ensuring continuity in operations

going forward. Complete social distancing norms are being

followed at all plants and offices of the company. We will

continue to leverage our strength of adaptability and agility.

The demand of some of the products of the company

slowed down due postponement of the elective surgeries

in the hospitals but the company very quickly developed

new products which helped it to maintain reasonable sales

during this period.

I would like to share with you the brief data related to the

turnover and profitability during the year under review.

Your Company has achieved net sales of ` 687.24 Crores

preceding year. During the same period, we have achieved

profit after tax of ` 95.88 Crores.

I am also happy to share with you that your Company received

the “CII Industrial Innovation Award 2019” as one of the Top

25 Innovative Companies in India by Confederation of Indian

Industry (CII).Your company continues to prove its mantle

in export market and has received the Top Export Award

8th year in a row by Plastic Export Promotion Council for

COVID-19 pandemic is opening newer opportunities for

your company in terms of new product ideas. Your company

plans to work closely with the academia and institutions

to develop cost effective high quality medical devices.New

opportunities are continuously being ideated and explored.

Technological advancement and expertise coupled with

government support has proved to be advantageous for

the sector in last few years. Governments new schemes will

encourage manufacturing in India and will help us reduce

the import dependency.

Given your companies inherent strengths and its financial

stability, I am confident that it will emerge stronger from this

unprecedented global crisis.

Our CSR Policy covers almost every area of social

advancement and development, livelihood, education,

LETTER FROM: MANAGING DIRECTOR

COVID-19 pandemic on your company. R&D Team worked

round the clock to develop new products in a short period

which allowed company to be at the forefront of the crisis.

Newly developed products like Viral Transport Medium kits,

Masks, Ventilator accessories have found great acceptance

in the market.

The Company’s operations were impacted for initial few days

during the lockdown period. As transportation networks

came to a complete halt, we were not able to ship products

to customers in last 2 weeks of March and first 2 weeks of

April 2020. Since then the operations has stabilized.

We are maintaining all social distancing norms at our various

manufacturing plants and work places to ensure safety and

well-being of our employees.

Your Company was able to quickly turn to digital technology

and analytics which guided us to prepare for new ways of

empowering the team and serving our customers. New

internal training programs were conducted to upskill our

workforce with clinical and product knowledge.

This situation also gave us an opportunity to engage digitally

with the healthcare community by means of webinars. These

virtual programs enabled us to build online learning events

aimed at imparting knowledge and skills to different set of

healthcare professionals.

The novel coronavirus outbreak had managed to teach us

the importance of local manufacturing, local market, and

local supply chain. The government’s new mantras ““Vocal

for Local” and “Atma-nirbharBharat” are opening new

opportunities in the Indian Medical Devices Sector.

Financial Performance

I would like to share with you the financial performance of

your Company for the financial year ending 31 March, 2020.

Your Company has achieved net sales of ` 687.24 Crores

as against the net sales of ` 610.83 Crores in the previous

financial year. EBITDA improved to ` 184.57 Crores from

rise of 23.77%. Profit before Tax is ` 125.72 Crores as against

` 100.07 Crores representing a growth of 25.63% over the

previous year.
