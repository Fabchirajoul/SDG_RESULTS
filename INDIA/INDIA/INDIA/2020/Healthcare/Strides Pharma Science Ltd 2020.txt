Our strategy has always been to challenge

conventional notions of doing business in the

global pharmaceutical sector. It plays out in the

way we conduct scenario analysis meticulously

across key markets, disrupt existing segments

with proper product selection, ramp up

manufacturing capability and supply chain

efficiency with speed, strengthen customer

advocacy and maximise margins.

Our focus primarily is on regulated markets,

where we develop and manufacture a wide

range of technically complex pharmaceutical

products with a high-technology barrier. On

the other end of the spectrum, we continue to

operate with a calibrated approach in emerging

markets and institutional businesses; and

we are expecting promising performance in

the coming years.

Our value enablers comprise our

transcontinental presence, growing scale,

reliable supply chain, rationalised cost

structure, smart R&D; and above all our

commitment to always remain ahead on the

compliance front.

Our DNA remains that of a challenger in a

dynamic pharmaceutical landscape, and we

will continue to play our strategy to create

significant value for all stakeholders.

in July 2019. This event has cast

a blemish on our otherwise

exemplary track record in

having successful outcome from

inspections. Committed to the

highest standards of quality

and compliance, we are working

diligently with the US FDA to

resolve all relevant concerns and

currently awaiting intimation

from the US FDA on reinspection

timelines. We strongly believe

that Puducherry event has been

an unprecedented outcome as

following this inspection, we

concluded 6 FDA inspections of

which 2 were ‘Zero 483s’ and

the Establishment Inspection

Report (EIR) has been received for

all inspections.

In terms of the business, we also

experienced another unforeseen

development that presented itself

on the last day of the financial year

in the form of a US FDA notification

directing all manufacturers of

'Ranitidine' to withdraw their

products from the markets. We

have discussed the impact of this

withdrawal in detail separately

in this Report.

Ears to the ground

In FY 2019-20, we covered good

ground across performance

parameters with a resurgent spirit

and tailored strategy across key

markets. That said, there are many

more milestones to accomplish in

the long marathon. To put things in

perspective, we are fortifying our

manufacturing capabilities, raising

quality benchmarks, crafting

differentiated product pipeline and

upskilling people.

Our performance during the year

validates our continued focus on

ground realities and making the

most of available opportunities.

'Reset to Resurgence' is an eventful

and exciting journey that we are

happy to undertake and at which

we can persevere. In FY 2019-20,

we achieved 33%* revenue growth

of `29,127 Million*, compared to

`21,936 Million in FY 2018-19.

Our EBITDA stood at `6,514 Million*

in FY 2019-20 against `2,575 Million

in the previous year. We reported

a 22.4%* EBIDTA margin, which

is a new milestone for Strides.

Our profitability stood at `2,341

Million with EPS of `26.1. Our

strategies continue to play out

in the major markets, delivering

profitable growth with encouraging

EBITDA expansion.

Our performance during the year

validates our continuing focus on

ground realities and making the

most of available opportunities.

and build on our

and nurturing the

niche has always held

us in good stead.

*Adjusted performance does not include the impact of Ranitidine withdrawal

Regulated markets

The regulated markets, led by

the US, performed well during

the year. Our US business

continued to benefit from

careful product selection and

thoughtful launches, driven by

our well-entrenched front-end.

Despite the discontinuation of

Ranitidine, we remain confident

of our US business and continue

to maintain positive progress and

outlook. We have 123 cumulative

ANDA filings with US FDA, of

which 85 ANDAs have been

approved already, and only 35+

products are commercialised in

the US. We also have a pipeline of

38 products pending approval with

the US FDA. Our future growth

in the US will primarily be driven

through improved market shares

and healthy order book for our

commercialised products, along

with a robust pipeline of new

launches in the market.

Aligned with our growth plans,

we recently acquired a US FDA

European continent

• Accelerate product launches

across new territories and

enhance productivity in Africa

• Develop a steady product

pipeline to be at the forefront

of new regimen products in

Managing Director & CEO’s message

Strategy in Action

Dear Friends,

It is an honour to join the Strides

family and it gives me great pride

to address you in my first Report.

Over the last thirty years, Strides

has come to be known for its vision,

value creation and agility. I would

like to begin by thanking the Board

for giving me the opportunity to

lead this dynamic enterprise.

I assumed my position as MD

& CEO at Strides at a time of

unforeseen and exceptional

developments. The world was

already in the throes of the novel

coronavirus (COVID-19), the

Ranitidine withdrawal request

from US FDA had just come in, and

it was the start of a new financial

year. Therefore, my immediate

priority in consultation with

the Board and my Management

team was to establish clarity

and confidence among our own

employees as well as external

stakeholders on these concerns.

With regard to COVID-19, our

aim was clear – employee

well-being and safety came first.

We established a global COVID-19

taskforce guided by our 3P model

of people, patients and purpose.

Taking action to protect employees,

establishing global leadership

outreach to remain in constant

touch with employees worldwide,

and extending the emotional

connect to families of employees

were among our foremost steps. At

the same time, pharma being an

essential and life-saving service,

we needed to be able to continue to

manufacture and serve patients in

need at this crucial time. We put in

place extremely detailed business

continuity work protocols. I am

proud of the way our employees

demonstrated an exemplary

sense of duty in rallying together

to stay true to our purpose and

serve patients during this difficult

time, while maintaining the

strictest adherence to safety and

hygiene protocols.

On Ranitidine, a detailed statement

was released with complete

chronology of events, the situation

as it stood, and our assessment of

the impact. Continuing in the same

vein of transparency and clarity

to shareholders, regulators and

other stakeholders, we followed

up with another detailed picture

of its impact in our Q4 results

presentation. While Ranitidine

was one of our top five products,

our ex-Ranitidine growth in the

U.S. market has been extremely

healthy. We have now re-adjusted

our U.S. base business and way

forward strategy to ensure that

we remain on track to grow well

in the U.S. Our Other Regulated

Markets (ORM) business too saw

strong momentum in FY 2019-20.

For our Emerging Markets (EM) and

institutional businesses, it was a

successful reset year.

As we outlined to all of you during

our Q4 of FY 2019-20 results, many

areas saw robust performance

and we look forward to unlocking

further value in the current fiscal.

Overall, I was happy to note that in

spite of exceptional developments,

our well-executed reset strategy

for FY 2019-20 remains on track to

deliver sustainable growth.

With FY 2020-21 now well

underway, we stay on track to meet

our aspiration. In the current fiscal,

our priorities are:

• Delivery of growth in key

markets will be the biggest focus

for us – robust growth over our

reset base in the U.S, continued

strong momentum in ORM, and

a recharge of our institutional

business and branded generics

business in Emerging Markets

• While increased market share

of launched products will

provide a major leg of growth,

our R&D engine will anchor

our growth plans with a strong

pipeline of new filings and new

launches in the U.S., ORM and

institutional business

• Maintaining a healthy balance

sheet – sustaining gross

margins, high operating

ratios, driving efficiencies in

our business working, risk

mitigation – will enable our

business to grow responsibly

and sustainably.

As a pharma company, upholding

a state of complete vigilance and

control in our manufacturing sites

is non-negotiable. Remediation

work in our Puducherry site has

been among the topmost priorities

for the leadership team. We now

await information from the US FDA

on re-inspection. We do not take

this lightly. There can be no room

for complacency when it comes to

quality compliance. It is with this

view that we launched the Quality

Fabric initiative in FY 2019-20.

Quality Fabric is our internal

initiative to strengthen and

define our quality culture based

on people, products, processes

and facilities. Each employee is

a custodian and stakeholder of

our quality culture and this will

be an ongoing project to facilitate

learning and re-learning constantly

on the job. I am also committed

to fostering a culture of openness,

collaboration, taking ownership

and accountability. Our above

efforts are aimed at ensuring

timely delivery to patients and

customers with the end-goal of

achieving a high level of customer

advocacy. Pharma is an extremely

competitive industry and we need

to identify and harness our core

strengths in order to distinguish

ourselves from others.

In fact, this competitive industry

in India has been the world’s

pharmacy for a while. And now

more than ever in the year 2020,

Indian pharma has found itself

in focus. As the world comes

together to find solutions to this

global pandemic, we remain ready

to do our part, support and work

with various stakeholders. At the

I am proud of the way our employees

demonstrated an exemplary sense of duty in

rallying together to stay true to our purpose

and serve patients during this difficult time.

Ananth

As we outlined to all

many areas saw robust

performance and we look

developments,

FY 2019-20 remains

same time, we continue to track

and monitor policy, regulatory and

political developments to ensure

we plan ahead and build resilience.

Thank you for the trust you have

reposed in Strides through the

years. I wish to reassure you

that your Company will remain

firmly committed to upholding its

values of integrity, collaboration

and efficiency, and creating value

for all its stakeholders. I look

forward to the journey ahead

with the guidance of the Board

and the counsel and partnership

of my Management colleagues,

employees, partners, customers

and all our stakeholders. I wish you

and your loved ones good health

and well-being.

Post WL response roadmap

• We engaged with a third-party independent

external consultant to assist in a comprehensive

remediation programme. The consultant has

earlier worked at the FDA as an investigator and

compliance officer for ~27 years and has been in

private practice for eight years

• We also completed the risk assessment on all

distributed drug products in the US market

within shelf life and concluded that all drugs met

all quality and safety standards

• After the Puducherry unit audit, significant

changes were made to the quality and compliance

framework of Strides. We reorganised our quality

unit leadership to set up a dedicated team for

Puducherry remediation led by Mr. Umesh Kale,

Head of Quality Management Systems, who

reported directly to the CEO’s Office

• Subsequently, we invested significant time and

resources to facilitate targeted training for

upskilling individuals and teams. Several training

sessions led by external and internal instructors

have already been conducted for employees at

various sites of Strides

• Our Puducherry site continues to supply

products to the US under enhanced compliance

procedures and oversight

• We completed and submitted all Corrective

and Preventive Action (CAPA) plans, verified

by external remediation consultant. On the

submission of CAPAs, we requested the FDA to

re-inspect our Puducherry site. The inspection is

delayed due to COVID-19

• Capability building:

Competence assessment

conducted to evaluate staff

by using structured Good

Manufacturing Practice (GMP),

role-specific Standard Operating

Procedures (SOPs) and business

communication skills.

• Training: Training process and

e-Learning Management System

(eLMS) implemented for new

manufacturing sites at Chennai,

India and Florida, USA.

Enhancing compliance across

the organisation

We completed all Quality

Management System (QMS),

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

and other IT and digitalisation

initiatives during the year to

integrate with our corporate

policies and systems. We have also

implemented inline inspection

systems on container filling lines

across sites to enhance quality and

patient safety.

Our newly acquired facility

in Florida underwent major

infrastructural changes to

meet our standards.
