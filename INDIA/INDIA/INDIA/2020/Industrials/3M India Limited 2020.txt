Message from the Chairman

Message from: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to write to you again as

the Chairman of 3M India Limited, and

present to you the Annual Report of

your Company’s performance for the

Financial Year 2019-20.

We are experiencing unprecedented

times today. As I write this message, our

economy is adapting to the dynamic

challenges emerging out of the ongoing

COVID-19 situation. With the onset of

the pandemic, economies were forced

to shut down which triggered a sharp

global downturn and contraction. The

outlook for the remainder of this

ɥnancial year also remains very

uncertain at this time. Realistic

estimates by economy watchers such as

International Monetary Fund (IMF)

reveal the likely contraction of the

global economy by 4.9% in FY 2020-21.

India’s economy experienced a soft

demand most of ɥscal FY 2019-20 with

fall in investment and domestic

consumption and slow growth of

agriculture and manufacturing sectors.

The real GDP decelerated to its lowest

in over six years in the third quarter of

FY 2019-20. The outbreak of COVID-19

towards the last quarter of FY 2019-20

further aggravated the slowdown,

impacting all sectors of the economy.

Coming out of a diɣcult year, and

moving into an uncertain period, your

Company registered a modest

performance while focusing on

strengthening the portfolio mix,

maintaining ɥscal prudence and cash

ɦow management through most of FY

19-20. Your Company’s revenue from

operations on a standalone basis de-

grew by 1.56% and on a consolidated

basis de-grew by 1% for the ɥnancial

year ended March 31, 2020. The

operating margin on a standalone basis

for the current year is 13.59% compared

to 19.02% for the previous ɥnancial year

and on a consolidated basis, it is 16.34%

for the current year vs 18.75 % for the

previous ɥnancial year.

COVID-19 brought with it several new

and unprecedented challenges. I would

like to commend the leadership and

employees of your Company for a

comprehensive response to the

situation. Actions were undertaken to

protect employees and ensure business

continuity through a smooth transition to

work from home. Medical and safety

products were prioritised to nodal

government agencies and hospitals

overcoming supply chain disruptions.

The employees of the Ranjangaon plant

were committed to support critical

manufacturing lines to ensure essential

supplies throughout the lockdown

period. Humanitarian support was also

extended to local communities aɢected

by lockdown restrictions with timely

food security initiatives.

Your Company’s emphasis on

sustainable growth was evident in the

several CSR initiatives undertaken to

support various causes under education,

community and environment. The

culture of the company continues to

celebrate innovation, inclusivity and

doing good, extending to all

stakeholders.

We are looking at uncertain times ahead.

I am conɥdent of your CompanyǤs ability

to adapt with resilient business models

and ɥnancial strength, continuing to

take advantage of emerging

opportunities and oɢering diɢerentiated

value to customers.

On behalf of the Board of Directors of

3M India Limited, I want to thank you,

our shareholders, for your trust and

continued support. We are also very

thankful to the various government

agencies which extended their

unstinting support through the year, and

more speciɥcally during the recent lock-

down period to facilitate movement of

essential commodities and critical staɢ

members. I wish the 3M India team the

very best to continue to operate safely

and eɢectively manage the volatile

period ahead of us.

Thank you.

Bharat D. Shah

Chairman of the Board

3M India Limited

Bharat D. Shah

“Adversity is often

the true test of

character and it is

shines through

tough times, time

and again.”:

Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to share my message

and thoughts with all of you. With over a

year in my role as: Managing

dear shareholders for

your continued trust and conɥdence in

your Company. I look forward to your

sustained support as we emerge from this

crisis, stronger and more resilient in the

coming days.

Thank you.

DEVELOPMENTS IN HUMAN RESOURCES / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS

Learning and Development:

The Financial Year 2019-20 was a year when 3M India took necessary steps to make development to all employees, in line with

the 3M Global Philosophy of ‘Development for All’. Nearly 1100 employees were part of various learning programs throughout

the year. Our e-learning platform called ‘Develop U’ continues to stay updated and relevant to learning needs of 3M’s people.

Development through virtual technologies brings to employees, a wide range of easily accessible, quick learning modules through

engaging facilitators across Asia.

At 3M learning begins right from joining the company. The Company organizes a comprehensive 4 day ‘Feel@Home’ program for

all our new employees to enable an orientation to 3M. This program gives a new employee a complete overview to our Company,

our culture, our businesses and technologies. Nearly 120 employees were part of this engaging program.

A special program rolled out this year, was the ‘Energy Audit’. The Energy Audit is an employee well-being focused program that

helps employees learn, reflect and take personal action on the 4 dimensions of Energy – Physical, Mental, Emotional and Spiritual.

3M today has various approaches to support well-being and this program was a unique program that blended learning with ‘care

for the employee’.

Your company’s shop floor employees are an integral part of our learning audience. Your Company was able to bring the benefits

of learning and development to the shop floor colleagues through ‘Associates Contributing Together’ a program initiated in 2018.

While this program has supported employee learning, it has also contributed to greater idea sharing, enhanced trust levels and

openness to role changes amongst employees. By the end of 2019, your company’s plant HR teams were able to engage 95% of

our shop floor through this interactive learning program. This program is a strong contributor to maintaining peaceful employee

relations across all the plants.

People Leaders drive the employee experience in the company. Your Company stepped up our supervisory programs in 2019 to

reinforce the supervisor’s role with employee engagement and retention. The Company’s 3 day Evolving Leader Program covering

a range of leadership topics is contributing to the long journey of developing stronger people leaders. Your company was also able

to bring our corporate programs from Franklin Covey to our senior leaders in India. The corporate programs served as preparation

to important changes in people processes and reinforced trust behaviours. The Company’s programs are also strengthened by

leadership coaching for leaders. 1:1 engagement with a 3M certified coach helps our leaders reflect on their challenges and
