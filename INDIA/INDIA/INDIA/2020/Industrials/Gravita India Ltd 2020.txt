Dear Shareholders,

Resources have become a central issue for Gravita’s

clients as they increasingly turn to secure their

requirements amidst scarcity and pollution concerns.

This duality is on account of both surplus withdrawals

from nature that have led to deficiencies, as well as

excess emissions that have Lead to a deteriorating

environment.

In such an operating context, as a Company with

longstanding experience in the resources and recycling

business, we have seen from up close our growing

relevance in global supply chains, as well as in helping

protect and preserve the environment, while advancing

the green economy.

- Dr. Mahavir Prasad Agarwal

Chairman and Whole-Time Director

Reinforcing our specialist position in secondary

Lead

Lead is one of the most recycled resources in terms of

its recovery rate. It can be re-melted infinitely to remove

impurities, thus making it easily identifiable and cost-

effective to aggregate and recycle. Further, the quality

of recycled Lead is near-identical to primary Lead

collected from mining. Hence, over 65% of Lead used

in the production of new Lead products is sourced from

recycled Lead.

As a Company with specialist position in secondary

Lead manufacture, our core competencies include our

deeply-embedded global Lead scarp collection network

and our plants that are located close to these scrap

collection centres. Further, we possess robust technical

expertise that enable us to secure best-in-class Lead

recovery rates from scrap, with incremental recoveries

being directly accretive to profitability. Our rich R&D

expertise and sound knowledge around the science

of Lead has reinforced our turnkey services offering

for third-party clients in recycling infrastructure, thus

opening up a growing revenue stream and enabling us

to continuously improve our technical services.:
