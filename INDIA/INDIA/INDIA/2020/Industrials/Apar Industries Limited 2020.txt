Interest rate sensitivity for fixed rate instruments

The Company does not account for any fixed-rate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through statement of profit or loss.

Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments

A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) profit or loss by

the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant.:

Interest rate sensitivity for fixed rate instruments

The Group does not account for any fixed-rate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through statement of profit or loss.

Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments

A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) profit or loss by

the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant.
