Commitment w.r.t. Acquisitions

The Company, on June 21, 2017 executed deﬁ nitive share purchase agreement for acquisition

of 100 % equity shares in La-Gajjar Machineries Private Limited (LGM). On 1st August 2017 the

company acquired 76% of equity shares of LGM as per the terms of share purchase agreement

for consideration of Rs.252.93 crs. Further, as per the said agreement, the company agreed

to pay additional consideration with respect to certain identiﬁ ed projects, linked to EBITDA

achieved up to 31 DEC 2018. As per extant guidelines of IND AS 103, ‘Business combination’,

this additional consideration being contingent in nature is to be fair valued. Accordingly,

the fair value is estimated at Rs.0.85 crs by applying the discounted cash ﬂ ow approach to

the expected EBITDA. This additional consideration, is capitalized as investment by creating

corresponding ﬁ nancial liability in the standalone ﬁ nancials. The Contingent consideration has

been discharged in previous year.

Further, the company has entered into a shareholders agreement on June 21, 2017 to purchase

remaining 24% equity shares. The Company has a call option to acquire and simultaneously,

shareholders of LGM have put option to sell the remaining 24% equity shares, to be exercised

after holding period at a price based on mutually agreed upon formula. However, if the options

are not exercised in the given option period, the company has to purchase remaining equity

shares at the end of the option period by applying same formula agreed for at the time of

exercising options.

The company has made an initial assessment of impact due to Covid 19 pandemic while

evaluating the purchase price of 24 % shares based on agreed upon formula and reasonably

believes that it does not carry any intrinsic value.:

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis

for major clients. In addition, a large number of minor receivables are combined into

homogenous category and assessed for impairment collectively. The calculation is based

on actual incurred historical data. The Company does not hold collateral as security. The

Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low,

as its customers are spread over vast spectrum.

Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and ﬁ nancial institutions is managed by the

Company’s treasury department in accordance with the Company’s policy. Investments

of surplus funds are made as per the approved investment policy. Investment limits are

set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate ﬁ nancial loss if any.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis

for major clients. In addition, a large number of minor receivables are combined into

based on actual incurred historical data. The Group does not hold collateral as security.

The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low,

as its customers are spread over vast spectrum.

Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and ﬁ nancial institutions is managed by the

Group’s treasury department in accordance with the Group’s policy. Investments of

surplus funds are made as per the approved investment policy. Investment limits are

set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate ﬁ nancial loss if any.

Liquidity risk

The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a liquidity planning tool.

ﬂ exibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans. The Group has access to a

sufﬁ cient variety of sources of funding and debt maturing within 12 months can be

rolled over with existing lenders.

The risk arises due to asset liability mismatch. The inadequacy of the subsidiary company

ARKA Fincap Limited (NBFC) in increasing its asset base, managing any unplanned

changes in funding sources and meeting the ﬁ nancial commitments when required may

result in non-liquidity.

Mitigation:

•

NBFC has Asset Liability Management Policy in line with the RBI guidelines.

•

The Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is responsible for managing

the risk arising out of exposures to interest rate changes and mismatches between

assets and liabilities.:
