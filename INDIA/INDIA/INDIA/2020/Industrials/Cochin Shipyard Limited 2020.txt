Dear Shareholders

It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you all, on behalf

of the Board of Directors to the 48th Annual General

Meeting of your Company, Cochin Shipyard Limited

(CSL). I would like to take you through the highlights of

performance and achievements of the Company in the year

2019-20, impact of COVID-19 and the initiatives for the

future.

Operating Scenario

The operating scenario this year saw significant changes

with CSL Mumbai Ship Repair Unit (CMSRU) at Mumbai

ramping up operations and increasing momentum. CSL

Kolkata Ship Repar Unit (CKSRU) at Kolkata became

operational and has since completed three projects.

The year also saw CSL moving into Andaman & Nicobar

with the inauguration of the CSL Andaman & Nicobar

Ship Repair Unit (CANSRU) at Port Blair. The long term

business strategy road map worked out firmly points

out the necessity of pro-active marketing efforts on

both commercial and defence sectors. The main focus

segments on the commercial front would include

coastal, inland, fishing, specialised vessels etc. The

eight Ro-Pax vessels contracted for Inland Waterways

Authority of India (IWAI) for operations in NW1 & NW2

was delivered amidst the COVID-19 lockdown and

sailed off to Kolkata. The yard construction at Hooghly

Cochin Shipyard Limited (HCSL), the 100% subsidiary

of CSL at Kolkata is making good progress, except the

delay that would accrue on account of the COVID-19

lockdown period. This is being set up as a dedicated

facility for construction of inland water vessels. With

further development of the inland waterways and

coastal segment, the Company sees more opportunities

here. CSL has also delivered 11 out of the 16 Fishing

Vessels contracted for the Tamil Nadu beneficiaries.

The balance 5 vessels are ready for delivery. Sensing

the high potential in this arena for good quality safe and

technologically advanced vessels, CSL aspires to spin

off a dedicated vertical which will enable production

of these vessels to cater to the high demand volume

envisaged. Towards this, CSL submitted a Resolution Plan

for TEBMA Shipyard Limited, which was listed under the

National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and succeeded

in obtaining favourable orders for taking over the facility.

Physical activities towards this will commence once

lockdown restriction are eased up.
