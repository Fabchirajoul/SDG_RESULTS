letter dated July

9, 2015. The Company against the said: letter dated

July 9, 2015 of ED and confirmation Order of the

Adjudicating Authority, filed appeal before the

Appellate Tribunal for PMLA. The Appellate Tribunal

granted stay against operation of the Letter dated

July 9, 2015, subject to certain conditions vide Order

dated July 30, 2015 and the said stay has been

extended from time to time, and continues during

the pendency of the Appeal. The matter was posted

to August 17, 2020 and will be heard along with

applications filed by NBPL & NBEIL seeking provision

of alternate security worth of ₹138.59 crores and

release of attachment on the equity shares of NBEIL

held by NBPL.

Brahmani Infratech Private Limited (BIPL)

BIPL is a subsidiary of the Company with 65.74% equity

stake. Following the surrender of land of SEZ back to the

Government, BIPL has been engaged in investments in

urban lands and properties to diversify its portfolio and

to pursue urban infrastructural development.

Following the cessation of SEZ activity and surrender

of land, BIPL has been embroiled in protracted litigation

with Mantri Group, its Co-developer and Technical

Associate for SEZ. Following an unsatisfactory outcome

of the Arbitration, the matter has since been adjudicated

by a local court which also is devoid of merits concerning

development of real estate and so is not considered

fair by BIPL. Accordingly an appeal was filed before the

Hon’ble High Court of Telangana against the orders of

the lower court and the Hon’ble High Court passed an

interim Order dated September 3, 2019 directing the

Company to pay ₹10 crores to Mantri Technology Parks

Private Limited (MTPPL) and MTPPL shall secure this

payment by furnishing Bank guarantee to the Company.

The Company complied with the above interim Order

and it was directed to be listed for final hearing. Pending

the outcome of the Appeal, the matter is being reflected

as a contingent liability.

Further, Malaxmi Infra Ventures (India) Private Limited

(MIVPL), a Corporate member, filed a petition against

BIPL before NCLT Hyderabad Bench, alleging certain

issues and seeking interim reliefs for the same from

NCLT. MIVPL was also praying the bench to direct winding

up of the Company and direct the Company to sell its

shares to the MIVPL and to pass such consequential

reliefs. The Company denied all the allegations as being

totally contrary to the facts and ready to file a counter for

the above mentioned petition. The matter is sub-judice.

Kinnera Power Company Pvt. Ltd (KPCPL)

(Associate Company)

KPCPL is an associate of the Company with 26% equity

stake which is continued as specified by National

Highway Authority of India (NHAI). As per the professed

intention and there being no economic interest, the

Company plans to fully off-load its stake in KPCPL in

favour of Meenakshi Infra Group as per the regulations.

Accordingly, no economic interest from KPCPL is being

factored in the consolidated financials nor the accounts

of KPCPL appended in the annual report of the Company.

mance evaluation of its own, the individual directors

as well as the Board committees (Audit committee,

Nomination and Remuneration committee, Corporate

was adopted after taking into consideration the inputs

received from the directors, covering various aspects

culture, execution and performance of specific duties,

obligations and governance. Evaluation of the Board

control and guidance. Some of the performance

indicators based on which the Independent directors

are evaluated are:

•

Ability to contribute to and monitor corporate

governance practices.

•

Ability to contribute by introducing international best

practices to address top management issues.

•

Active participation in long term strategic planning.

•

Commitment to the fulfillment of a Director’s

obligations and fiduciary responsibilities.

Attendance: The performance evaluation of Independent

or non-executive directors is done by the Board annually

based on criteria of attendance and contributions at

Board / Committee meetings as also the role played

other than at meetings.

The evaluation process also considers the time spent

by each of the Board members, core competencies,

personal characteristics, accomplishment of specific

responsibilities and expertise.

letter) in respect to material

breaches noted in note 15(l) of the consolidated

financial statements;

•

Review the insurance policies issued in favor of the

lenders;

•

Evaluate the assumptions and forecasts made by

management in the future budgets;

•

Reviewed and evaluated the security documents

applicable to this facility (project finance);

•

Devoted attention to the assumptions made with

respect to the ability of the MCL to continue as a

going concern, the results and the cash flows in order

to assess the MCL's ability to continue meeting its

payment obligations and its obligations under the

financing covenants in the year ahead

Treatment of transaction cost on borrowings - The

matter related to the audit of MCL:

Refer note 48(a) for the restatement related disclosures.

•

MCL obtained loans from various lenders for the

construction of the 300MW Thermal Power Plant that

was commissioned in July 2017. The component

paid a total of ₹36,331.23 lakhs. These costs were

capitalised to the cost of the asset.

•

IAS 39/ IFRS 9, however requires that transactions

costs directly related to the acquisition of the loan

must be deducted from the carrying amount of the

loan and accounted for using the effective interest

method, which requires the amortisation of the

transaction costs over the life of the financial liability.

•

This was significant to our audit because the

assessment process is complex and the transaction

costs are significant to the financial statements of

the component.

•

Management are required to determine the effective

interest rate applicable and accordingly recompute

the cash flows applicable after determining the

effective interest rate using various financial

analysis tools. This will result in significant changes

in the interest expense charged in the MCL’s income

statement as well as the amounts that would have

been capitalised as borrowing costs in line with

IAS 23 – Borrowing costs.

In view of the significance of the matter the auditor of MCL

has reported the following audit procedures were applied

in this area, among others to obtain sufficient appropriate

audit evidence

•

Reviewing the loan amortisation schedules as well as

the amortisation schedules based on the effective

interest method as per IAS 39 and IFRS 9;

•

Recomputing the effective interest rate using various

financial modelling tools;

•

Assessing the accounts that were affected which

included, Property, Plant and Equipment, Project

Finance, and Deferred tax;

•

Assessing the amounts that would qualify as

borrowing costs under IAS 23, and reviewed the

respective restatements so as to confirm if it was

in line with IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in

Accounting Estimates and Errors;:

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (Cont...)

for the year ended 31 March 2020

(All amounts in lakhs of ₹, unless otherwise stated):

letter to MCL

on 25 March 2020, indicating that there was

a material breach and the: letter was in no way

providing a waiver of the rights of the lenders.

MCL is yet to receive a formal waiver from its

lenders as the date of adoption of its financial

statements.

On the basis of assessment of the following

factors by the management, the financial

statements of MCL have been prepared on a

going concern basis:

•

MCL obtained Insurance cover on some

of the Project Finance loans at the

commencement of the project. In the

unlikely event of default on payments, the

impact on the MCL’s cash flows should

the lenders call in the insurance claim will

be reduced significantly, as the Insurance

Company

would

pay

the

specified

amounts as per the provisions of the

insurance policy.

•

The Government of Zambia issued a

sovereign guarantee for the Project

Finance loans. In the unlikely event of the

MCL’s default on payments owing to non-

receipt of monies from its customer for

sale of power, the impact on it’s cash flows

should the lenders call for immediate

repayment will be reduced significantly, as

the Government of Zambia would pay the

specified amounts as per the provisions

of the Guarantee.

Notes

to the Consolidated Financial Statements – March 31, 2020

letter to the Project Finance

lenders have requested for an approval

in relation to certain matters such

as – deferral of the principal and

interest due on the 25 March 2020 and

25 September 2020 to 25 March 2021;

agreement for a standstill on acceleration

and enforcement until the 31 March 2021

and an approval to commence arbitration

proceedings against ZESCO for non-

receipt of dues for sale of power. A formal

response in respect of these matters is

yet to be received.

•

The lenders have not yet demanded

for immediate repayment of the loans.

Management do not believe that the

lenders

will

demand

for

immediate

repayment of the loans at this point, as

discussions are currently underway on

how the loans may be restructured as

demonstrated above.

f) Current vs non-current classifications:

The Group presents assets and liabilities in the

balance sheet based on current / non-current

classification.

An asset is treated as current when it satisfies the

below mentioned criteria:

i.

Expected to be realised or intended to be sold

or consumed in normal operating cycle;

ii. Held primarily for the purpose of trading;

iii. Expected to be realised within twelve months

after the reporting period, or

iv Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted

from being exchanged or used to settle a

liability for at least twelve months after the

reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current

assets.

A liability is classified as current when it

satisfies the below mentioned criteria:

i.

Expected to settle the liability in normal

operating cycle;

ii. Held primarily for the purpose of trading;

iii. Due to be settled within twelve months after

the reporting period, or

iv. There is no unconditional right to defer the

settlement of the liability for at least twelve

months after the reporting period.

All other liabilities are classified as non-

current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are

classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

The operating cycle is the time between the

acquisition of assets for processing and their

realisation in cash and cash equivalents.

g) Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost,

less accumulated depreciation and accumulated

impairment losses, if any. Cost comprises the

purchase price and any attributable cost of

bringing the asset to its working condition for

its intended use. Borrowing costs relating to

acquisition of property, plant and equipment

which take substantial period of time to get ready

for its intended use are also included to the extent

they relate to the period till such assets are ready

to put to use.

The Group adopted cost model as its accounting

policy, in recognition of the property, plant and

equipment and recognises transaction value as

the cost. The Company had applied for the one-

time transition exemption of considering the

previous GAAP carrying cost on the transition

date i.e. 1st April, 2015 as the deemed cost under

Ind AS. Hence regarded thereafter as historical

cost.

Direct expenditure incurred and other attributable

costs on projects under implementation are

treated as unallocated capital expenditure

pending allocation to the assets and under

construction or in the process of installation are

termed as Capital work-in-progress and shown at

cost in the Balance Sheet.

An item of property, plant and equipment is

derecognised upon disposal or when no future

economic benefits are expected to arise from

the continued use of asset. Any gain or loss

arising on the disposal or retirement of an item

of property, plant and equipment is determined

as the difference between the sales proceeds

and the carrying amount of the asset and is

recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

The improvements/modifications carried on

the lease hold land/property are recognised

as lease hold improvements and are written off

over the primary lease period or the life of such

improvement whichever is lower.

Notes

to the Consolidated Financial Statements – March 31, 2020:

letter dated 25

March 2020 to MCL, duly reserving their rights in

accordance with the terms of the Common Terms

Agreement entered with them. These loans are

primarily secured by the assets of MCL, a sovereign

guarantee issued by the Government of Zambia (To

the extent of monies owed to MCL by ZESCO) and

an insurance cover for a majority portion of the

outstanding balance. Pursuant to various on-going

discussions held between the lenders and MCL, the

management of MCL has invoked necessary dispute

resolution clauses in accordance with the terms of

the power purchase agreement with ZESCO, which

is a mandatory pre-requisite for commencement of

arbitration proceedings, in pursuit of strengthening

its efforts to realise the amounts due and also to

ensure the repayment of the instalment defaulted.

As mentioned in the aforesaid paragraph, these loans

are collectively secured by a sovereign guarantee

issued by the Ministry of Finance, Government of

Zambia. Further, outstanding balances of majority

of the lenders are also secured by an insurance

cover. While the management has secured a formal

approval from the lenders in relation to invoking

the government guarantee, the invocation of

the insurance claim does mandate completion

of an arbitration proceedings against ZESCO in

accordance with the terms of the power purchase

agreement and the arbitration award being in favor of

MCL. In accordance with the terms of the underlying

insurance policy, the insurer would make good to the

lenders only the amount of instalments which have

been defaulted and the rest of the instalment would

be paid in accordance with the terms of the original

repayment schedule agreed between MCL and the

lenders. Further, in accordance with the terms of the

sovereign guarantee, the guarantee amounts are

payable on demand failing which MCL has a right

to initiate arbitration. The management is however,

evaluating the status of the ongoing discussions/

dispute resolution process with the ZESCO in its

evaluation of invocation of the sovereign guarantee.

Consequently,

on

the

basis

of

a

collective

assessment of the status of the discussions with

lenders, the dispute resolution process initiated

with ZESCO, the acknowledgement by ZESCO of

the amounts owed to MCL, the legal advise received

from an independent attorney on the time frame

for completion of the arbitration proceedings and

the ability of the Government of Zambia to honor

its sovereign guarantee, the management has

continued to classify the outstanding balance of

borrowings owed to these lenders in accordance

with the terms of the underlying common terms

agreement as at 31 March 2020.
