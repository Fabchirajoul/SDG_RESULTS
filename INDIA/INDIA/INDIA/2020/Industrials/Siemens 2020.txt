(Up to 29th January, 2020):

Dear Shareholders,

During the financial year 2020, the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic together

with existing geo-political tensions impacted businesses and economies across the world.

The business environment remained volatile and challenging, particularly impacting

manufacturing growth that slowed down across several sectors such as automobile,

energy, infrastructure, agriculture, travel and severely impacted the small and medium

scale enterprises as also government spending. Further, the lockdown in April and May

2020 impacted production activity and supply chains across the country and in many

parts of the world as well. The Company’s performance was impacted mainly on account

of a disruption in the supply chain, capacity under-utilization, logistics-related issues as

well as the challenges related to migrant workers.

Despite the pressures from global market conditions, India has over the years continued

to remain one of the most resilient and attractive destinations for investment and I am

convinced that India’s intrinsic growth potential remains intact even though it may have

shifted on timelines due to the pandemic.

With Siemens’ portfolio of Energy, Mobility, Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure coupled with Siemens’ leadership role in

Digitalization across all these businesses, Siemens Limited continues to be well-positioned to meet the needs of India.

Financial Performance from continuing operations – Highlights

For the financial year ended 30th September 2020, the Company received New Orders valued at ` 107,517 million, a

13.8 percent decrease over ` 124,744 million in the financial year ended 30th September 2019. The Order Backlog as of

30th September 2020 stood at ` 123,596 million. Sales (excluding Other operating revenues) were down by 24.3 percent to

` 95,808 million, compared to ` 126,487 million in the previous year.

Profits from Operations stood at ` 7,399 million compared to ` 13,135 million in the previous year. For the year ended

30th September 2020, the Company’s Profit before Tax stood at ` 10,206 million compared to ` 16,963 million in the previous

year, decrease of 39.8 percent. The Profit after Tax for the year was ` 7,574 million, decrease by 32.6 percent compared to

` 11,231 million in the previous year.

The Board of Directors of the Company has recommended a dividend of ` 7/- per equity share of the face value of ` 2/- each for

the Financial Year ended 30th September 2020.

Business Performance – Highlights

From an operational perspective, the Company continued to focus on profitable growth, introducing innovative solutions to the

market and enhancing its digitalization offerings across all its business segments.

Among the key highlights during the financial year, the Company took strides towards finding solutions to the nation’s energy

challenges when it signed a Memorandum of Understanding with NTPC Limited and TERI. The MOU is aimed at identifying,

evaluating and setting up reference use cases of hydrogen sector-coupling for various upstream and downstream applications.

The Company signed another MoU with TERI for collaboration on technologies to support the energy transition in India

including sector-coupling. In addition, the Company successfully implemented an efficient power supply system with advanced

passenger safety features for Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation Limited (KMRCL). The Central Park Depot of Kolkata Metro will also

be equipped with advanced Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA) and Operation Control Centre supplied

by the company, contributing to a safe, energy-efficient and comfortable rail commute. The ‘Atal Tunnel’, one of the world’s

longest and highest-altitude tunnels which was inaugurated by Honorable Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, has also

been equipped with the Company’s state-of-the-art automation technologies.

In a step to meet the increasing demand for electrification across industry, infrastructure and buildings in India, the Company

also signed an agreement to acquire New Delhi-based C&S Electric Limited. The acquisition has further received the regulatory

approval of the Competition Commission of India. This will strengthen the Company’s portfolio not only in India, but also for

export to competitive international markets. In addition, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the sale of the Mechanical

Drives business to Siemens AG, which has subsequently announced its intention to sell the business to Carlyle Group.

Digitalization

During the financial year 2020, the Company’s digitalization portfolio saw renewed interest from customers particularly in the

Pharma, Food and Beverage, Automotive and Power Distribution segments enabling increased productivity and flexibility. The

Company also won an order from Lalitpur Power Generation Company Limited (LPGCL), a Bajaj Group company, for advanced
