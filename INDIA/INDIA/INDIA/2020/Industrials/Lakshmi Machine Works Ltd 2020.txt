Dear Shareholders,

Your organisation is becoming

more robust and resilient

to overcome seemingly

unsurmountable vagaries and

stay the charted course.

This philosophy has transpired

through the rank and file

because the Total Quality

Management (TQM) journey,

which we set afoot in the

previous fiscal, has, during the

period under review, been

institutionalised across the

organisation.

TQM has from the shop-floor

to the top floor has facilitated

in cascading the organisational

goals into divisional objectives

and then further flowing it

down to departmental targets.

It’s been quite a tall ask indeed,

considering the intricate

complexities of our diverse

businesses.

What is extremely satisfying

is that, not only the

management, but every

department can accurately

access their contribution to the

organisational goal. Moreover,

our rigorous monitoring

discipline of mapping the

aspiration with reality helps

realign our approach with the

prevailing situations.

The energy and enthusiasm

among the teams are palpable.

Their unwavering focus and

dedicated effort in absorbing

this contemporary philosophy

has enabled the Company to

secure its turf despite the highly

challenging and demanding

business environment of 2019-

20.

TQM helped us in better

identifying and plugging the

gaps in our processes, products

and services. This, I believe,

will strengthen our opportunity

matrix when demand revives.

After the first full year under

the TQM umbrella, we are now

highly charged to take this ethos

to the next level – where the

TQM philosophy gets ingrained

into the organisational DNA. For

this, we will need to, individually

and collectively, continue to

push the envelope so much that

it would propel

the organisation

to a higher orbit.

The year ended

with the menace of

the new novel Corona

virus pandemic, setting

the global economy

on a tailspin. As the virus

runs riot across the globe, a

global economic recession

looks imminent, drowning

consumption to its nadir.

India is not exception to this

global trend. The lockdown

announced by the Central

Government to curb the spread

of this contagion has brought

business activity to a grinding

halt.

It is natural that the global

economy will take time to come

out of this crisis that have

swept through the world.

The Indian growth story,

too, will need time to

regain the momentum

after stepping out of

the rough patch.

Under such

circumstances,

From the Chairman’s desk

“What started as a process

has silently got woven into the

organisational fabric.”
