ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20:

mAnAgIng DIrector’s

messAge: Dear shareholders,

We are indeed living through unusual times. Countries

across the globe continue to face multitude of challenges

in the form of Covid-19 health crisis that contributed to an

economic slowdown. The Government of India intervened

by taking prompt measures to contain the spread of the

virus and boost demand.

At Astral, we responded to these headwinds by being

well-prepared through our strong core competencies

and resilient business model. The Company implemented

adequate steps to protect employees and its immediate

communities. Though we faced temporary disruption in

our manufacturing operations, our robust IT infrastructure

ensured uninterrupted services for our customers by

enabling seamless ‘work from home’ facility.

With steady performance during the year, we stand

confident even in turbulent times. Diversified product

range, extensive distribution network, and cutting-

edge technologies are the cornerstone of our business

strategy. More importantly, robust balance sheet quality

and manufacturing efficiencies remain the distinctive

characteristics of our operations.

On the financial front, our consolidated revenue during the

year stood at ` 25,779 million in Fy 2019-20 from ` 25,073

million in Fy 2018-19. The piping segment recorded a

revenue of ` 20,428 million with sales volume of 132,200

metric tons. The consolidated EBITDA margin and PAT

margin stood at 17.59% and 9.68%, respectively, during

the year under review. The anti-dumping duty imposed on

CPVC resin proved to be an opportunity for the Company

to gain market share, as one of the leading organised

industry players.

Our state-of-the art manufacturing units and distribution

channels across the country enabled us to timely deliver

products to our customers despite the nationwide

lockdown. We expect our new piping plant in Odisha

to be ready by Fy 21, which will help us expand in the

North-East markets. Moreover, we acquired additional

land measuring 157,648 sq. meter, adjacent to our plants

located at Sangli, Hosur, Santej and Odisha. With our right

expansion strategies, we are well-poised to cater a larger

customer base, optimise logistic cost and explore potential

opportunities in the country.

We prioritised driving technological excellence, enhancing

operational efficiencies while focusing on customer-

centricity. Our innovative product PEX-A-PRO has been

growing consistently with great response from the

customers. We further plan to manufacture the high quality

PEX product in-house by sourcing the best technology and

machinery from the global experts. Astral has extended

its product basket by supplying double wall corrugated

piping solutions in the infrastructure segment through Rex

Polyextrusion Private Limited (REPL). During the year, we

took various steps to fortify our brand identity. One such

initiative was to bring on board the famous Bollywood

celebrity, Ranveer Singh, as our new brand ambassador

which will further add to the brand’s visibility. We also

launched a unique loyalty program for plumbers across the

country and a dealer attachment program to strengthen

the distributor connect.

In our Adhesive & Sealant business, we registered a

consolidated revenue ` 5,830 million and EBIDTA of ` 765

million during the year. We initiated structural changes in

Resinova to strengthen distribution system and human

capital, which impacted margins to some extent. We

introduced robust IT system to track active number of

ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20

Dear shareholders,

Amid an uncertain global economic environment and

challenging industry dynamics, we continued to perform

with resilience. Our solid foundation, consistent focus on

bringing innovative products and robust financial strength

yielded desired value for all.

Today, Astral is present across the country through its

state-of the-art manufacturing plants and depots. With our

increased reach and presence at multiple locations, we

have been able to efficiently serve our customers despite

the nationwide lockdown. The Company continues to grow

its manufacturing capacity through a greenfield facility in

Odisha in order to meet the requirements of the North-

East region. Our focus will remain on increasing capacity

utilisation across our facilities. In addition, the expanded

capacity at our existing plants will help us deliver value-

added products, improve market share and save logistic

cost in the long-run.

I would like to conclude with an expression of gratitude

to our key stakeholders, customers, bankers and vendors

for their continued support in our growth journey. I thank

our Board, senior management and employees for being a

major source of inspiration.

Regards,

sandeep engineer: Managing
