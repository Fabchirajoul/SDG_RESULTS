Managing Director’s

Communique

dear fellow Shareholders,

My warm greetings to all of you!

I am delighted and humbled to share your Company’s first

Annual Report as a listed entity, for FY 2019-20.

Your Company has a tremendous foundation, strengthened over

generations. We have a distinct brand recognition, powerful

performance capabilities, and a truly extensive reach. Our

incredible team of people constantly bring their strengths

together to take the organisation to greater heights. Our

journey of more than five decades has been an inspiring one. All

along the way, we have remained true to our guiding principles

of simplicity, teamwork, trust building, customer-centric focus,

and delivering value to our different stakeholders. We are

proud of the reputation we have built and are committed to

maintaining this track record as we move ahead.

The fiscal 2019-20 posed a challenging operating environment

for the Indian economy, marked by liquidity constraints, muted

investments, weak consumption and volatile commodity

prices. Various macro indicators as well as overall GDP growth

witnessed consistent deceleration. These challenges were

further exacerbated by outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19)

pandemic towards the end of the fiscal year. As a responsible

corporate entity, Polycab selflessly undertook a series of

measures to ensure safety and well-being of our employees,

partners and to support, dealers, distributors, customers, and

communities across India. We leveraged our robust information

technology infrastructure to ensure seamless transition to

work-from-home environment with little or no disruption of

operations. I’m pleased to state that currently all our factories

and offices are operating, majority of our authorised dealers,

and distributors, and retailers are back on their feet with decent

progress in terms of billings. During this period, we also focussed

on conserving and augmenting our liquidity position through

judicious cost management and deferring non-critical spends.

We accelerated our long-term strategic and structural initiatives

like business diversification, increasing channel financing,

inventory

rationalisation,

increasing

automation

and

debottlenecking

of

processes,

augmenting

supply

chain

operations with technology and building data analytics

capabilities which will help us fortify our dominant market position

and provide long-term sustainable competitive advantages.

Performance Review

Fiscal 2019-20 concluded with a healthy underlying

performance across segments withstanding significant external

headwinds. During the year under review, we recorded a 11%

growth in revenue to ` 88,300 million from ` 79,856 million

in the previous year, partly tapered by COVID-19 impact. Wires

and cables business saw good traction in exports and new

product categories. During the year, we partially executed our

largest cable supply export order till date and made successful

inroads into new geographies. We helped provide high speed

digital connectivity to over 4,700 Gram Panchayats in states of

Gujarat and Bihar under BharatNet Phase II programme. This

achievement will play a precursor to our ventures into large

digital infrastructure projects. Our consumer electricals vertical

continued its strong momentum on the back of portfolio

augmentation across price points, better product mix and

distribution expansion. We penetrated new geographies in

India, touching more lives in lower tier towns. Our new product

launches, with a strong quality and value proposition, garnered

very good response from consumers. Our profitability put up a

strong footing with profit after tax standing at ` 7,656 million

as against ` 5,003 million in the previous year, a growth of 53%.

Rising contribution along with improved cost management

flowed into higher operating margins. Lower finance costs and

reduction in corporate tax rates further aided bottom-line. What

is interesting to note is that your Company has been delivering

improved financial performance year-on-year, demonstrating

the soundness of our robust business model. We also delivered

good operational performance during the year. Our return

ratios are improving led by increase in underlying profitability.

Balance sheet remains strong with net cash position. Our

strategic interventions to optimise working capital will further

reinforce our financial position.

Polycab India Limited

Managing Director

Our strategic framework leverages our key strengths

i.e. manufacturing, distribution, innovation, branding and

technology which will enable us to sustain our leadership

position in wires and cables as well as strengthen our

consumer electricals business.
