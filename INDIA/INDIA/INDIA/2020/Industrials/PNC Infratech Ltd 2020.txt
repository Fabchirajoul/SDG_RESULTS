PNC Infratech Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2020:

Dear Shareholders,

At the outset, I express my deep concern

for the outbreak of pandemic, COVID-19

and its unabated spread across India

and the world, causing huge losses not

only to the economy but to the lives

and livelihoods of people. To address

the crisis, the Government of India

has come out with wide-ranging relief

measures under the Atmanirbhar Bharath

Abhiyan and more such measures are

expected to mitigate the sufferings and

losses holistically. Historically, in such

crisis situations, as the underprivileged

and marginalised populations being

vulnerable are affected more severely, the

policy changes and new policies should

increasingly be aimed at these sections

of the society. Rapid expansion and

upgradation of the existing health care

infrastructure in the country is another

imperative that should be addressed by

the governments at both central and

state level.

While coming back to our Company, I

am happy to present to you the Annual

Report of FY2020. The fiscal was another

remarkable year for PNC Infratech Limited

in terms of its growth and performance.

During this period, we were able to record

significant growth on the back of our

balance sheet strength, project execution

capabilities and our ability to meet the

challenges apart from seizing the right

opportunities at right times. With our

three decades of expertise in the field

of infrastructure, we have completed

over 66 major infrastructure projects. We

are currently executing 20 expressway,

highway, and airport runway projects

worth over ₹15000 crore on the EPC

mode. Our performance is driven by the

end-to-end proven execution capabilities

that enable us to deliver complex projects

within the most demanding timelines.

FY2020 in perspective

During the year, we were successfully

able to deliver on our commitments

along with strengthening our order book

for sustainable future growth. Though

impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the

Company’s performance in FY2020

was not significant, both construction

activities and operations of the Company

were majorly disrupted during the last

fortnight of financial year. In the pre-

lockdown period, we had a robust bidding

pipeline of highway projects on both EPC

and HAM models, which has not been

affected much, even during the pandemic

period, till date. During the Q4 of FY2020,

we were awarded three new projects

including four laning of Unnao-Lalganj

section of NH 232 A, Jagdishpur-Faizabad

Section of NH-330A, Aligarh-Kanpur

section of NH 34. Our unexecuted order

book as on 31st March 2020 including

these three new HAM projects was over

₹ 13000 crore. At PNC Infratech, we have

always strived to maintain healthy balance

sheet with sound financials. As a result,

the ratings of our Company has always

been one of the best in the infrastructure

industry, thereby enabling us to sustain

our credit cost at competitive levels. I am

happy to inform that during the year, the

CARE Ratings have reaffirmed our credit

ratings at ‘Double AA Minus’ for Long

Term and ‘Single A1 Plus’ for Short Term

Bank Facilities.

Leveraging on our robust

construction capabilities

At PNC Infratech, our execution and

operation capabilities are supported

by in-house planning, construction and

operations, wholly-owned state-of-the-

art large fleet of construction equipment,

mostly-owned mining and aggregate

crushing facilities and unstrained liquidity.

Strategic Report

"At PNC Infratech, our

execution and operation

capabilities are supported by

in-house planning, construction

and operations, wholly-owned

construction equipment, mining

and aggregate crushing facilities

and unstrained liquidity."
