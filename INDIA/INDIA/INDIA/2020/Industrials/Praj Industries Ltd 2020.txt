Presence in

Export Oriented Unit

Manufacturing Facilities:

Dear Shareholders,

I am privileged to present the 34th Annual Report of your

Company for FY 2019-20, an eventful year in many ways.

Following its annual summit in Davos in January 2020,

the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a global risk

report which listed six of the top 10 risks to the global

economy pertaining to environment. Energy source and

consumption has a direct relationship to progress of

living standards as also on the environment. Striking right

balance

between

progress

and

preservation

of

environment calls for enhanced efforts by embracing

renewable energy sources and sustainable practices.

We endeavor to develop and deploy innovative and

sustainable decarbonization solutions that enhance the

cause of circular bioeconomy. Reduction in GHG

emissions and increasing use of carbon neutral fuels

developed based on our technology serve energy,

environment and economy with equal aplomb. Our

inclusive solutions deliver higher value by boosting the

agricultural sector and farmer livelihood.

Bio-MobilityTM and Bio-PrismTM are the mainstays of

Praj‚Äôs contribution to the global Bioeconomy. Your

Company has pioneered the Bio-mobilityTM platform that

envisages use renewable biological resources to produce

carbon-neutral transportation fuels across all modes of

mobility i.e. Surface, Air and Marine.

Building on the success of Bio-MobilityTM, Praj has

embarked on a path to unveiled basket of technologies for

production of Renewable Chemicals & Materials (RCM) its

Bio-PrismTM

portfolio.

Produced

from

bio-based

feedstock, RCM has the potential to replace most

chemicals and materials currently sourced using fossil

resources.

Praj continues to strengthen a global ecosystem of

partners across the value chain to develop innovative

technologies and expand markets. We have partnered

with India‚Äôs premier R&D institutions such as ARAI, NCL

and with international organizations like DVO (USA), Gevo

(USA), Lygos Inc. (USA) and Sekab (Sweden) to develop

sustainable solutions.

With its advanced solutions for water conservation, Praj

is ensuring zero liquid discharge and minimizing the

water footprint for customers. We continue to help

industrial segments through our engineering business,

delivering on commitments and deepening customer

engagement.

Innovation is the growth engine of your Company,

supporting customers by deÔ¨Åning solutions to their

today‚Äôs and tomorrow‚Äôs needs as also helping them

enhance their competitiveness.

Your Company has continued with several new Ô¨Årsts to its

credit. Just to name a few, Praj is setting up India‚Äôs Ô¨Årst

batch

of

four

commercial

scale

2G

bioreÔ¨Ånery,

Ô¨Årst-of-its-kind integrated bioenergy complex and Ô¨Årst

demonstration facility for multi feedstock compressed

biogas system.

Among

our

several

national

and

international

recognitions, the number one position in the Best Places

to Work in the advanced bioeconomy 2020 stands out as

testimony to our excellent workforce.

However,

the

year-end

was

disrupted

by

the

unprecedented outbreak pandemic that brought the world

to a standstill. We are managing the crisis resourcefully,

remaining irrepressible and staying focused on cash, cost

and creating value for customers. We continue to rally

around other important stakeholders -- society, suppliers,

employees, and shareholders.

As a social commitment to Ô¨Åght the pandemic, Praj

contributed to government funds besides providing free

and open access to its proprietary hand wash sanitizer

(HWS) manufacturing technology. We are also helping

customers around the world set up pharma grade alcohol

plants in short time.

We wholeheartedly welcome the honourable PM‚Äôs vision

of ‡§Ü ‡§ø‡§®‡§≠‡§∞‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§(self-reliant India) to emerge stronger from

the crisis. Aligned to this vision, we vow to continue our

contribution towards ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡•Ä ‡§á‡§Ç‡§ß‡§® (fuel made in India) in the

form of biofuels which is a captive source of renewable

energy.

In conclusion, here is a verse I had penned for employees

and I would like to share the same with you.

‚ÄúCommitted to being caring and compassionate,

Innovating

amidst

challenges

while

seeking

opportunities,

Driven by dreams and the spirit of dynamism,

We are passionate about excelling;

We are Praj.‚Äù

Thank you for your continued support.

Dr. Pramod Chaudhari

Executive Chairman

Aug 2020, Pune:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me pleasure to communicate the progress of your

Company

for

FY

2019-20.

For

FY

2019-20

on

consolidated basis, revenues stood at Rs. 1102.37 cr as

against Rs. 1141.11 cr in FY 2018-19. PAT stood at Rs.

70.43 cr as against Rs. 68.22 cr in the previous year.

Your company‚Äôs business endeavors are aimed at

sustainable decarbonization, reducing energy and water

footprint as well as optimizing resources for customers.

We continued to strengthen our leadership position in

core businesses while leveraging our innovation prowess,

developing customer centric solutions, investing in deep

rooted relationships with customers and delivering on our

promise of unmatched performance.

Praj is at the forefront of leading the future of

transportation through its Bio-mobilityTM platform which

helps address challenges such as high GHG emissions,

air pollution and associated health hazards. It also has

far reaching impact across several stakeholders such as

boosting

rural

economy

and

encouraging

energy

self-reliance, unmatched by any other alternative.

Your Company forged new partnerships, commercialized

new technologies and expanded its customer footprint.

The business environment had its usual challenges

during course of the year, while the yearend presented

completely

different

and

unprecedented

scale

of

challenge in form of the Covid-19 pandemic. Through a

well-deÔ¨Åned Business Continuity Plan and under the able

guidance of our Board and support from all stakeholders,

we are steering the business to a resilient position.

Allow me to walk you through some important business

developments for FY2019-20.

Your Company‚Äôs flagship bioenergy business improved

domestic market share even as overall volumes did not

register growth. We continued our focus on innovation

and launched several new solutions to address customer

challenges. We commissioned distillery having lowest

water footprint and are setting up India‚Äôs Ô¨Årst-of-its-kind

integrated bio-energy complex. This facility will produce

multi products such as ethanol, CBG and fertilizer from

bio-based feedstock while maintaining lowest energy and

water footprint.

Execution of four 2G bio reÔ¨Åneries is on course and we

expect to commission the Ô¨Årst by end-2021.

Your Company has set up India‚Äôs Ô¨Årst demo plant for

multi feedstock compressed biogas system. Praj‚Äôs CBG

technology is Ô¨Ånding favor for both transportation and

industrial application.

The international business environment during the Ô¨Åscal

year remained subdued due to geopolitical dynamics and

trade

wars.

Brazil

and

India

signed

a

biofuels

co-operation agreement and Praj strengthened its

presence in strategic global markets by forging alliances.

We partnered with Dedini S/A Ind√∫strias de Base of Brazil

to provide advanced technologies for ethanol production

for South America, and with Sekab E-Technology AB,

Sweden to commercialize technology to produce

advanced biofuels and bio-chemicals from forest residue.

Praj is expanding the scope of its collaboration with GEVO

through an innovative model, integrating India‚Äôs farming

sector to sustainable aviation fuel production.

Critical Process Equipment and Skids business has

progressed on establishing strategic relationships with

key customers. Brewery business built on its market

share,

developing

solutions

for

improving

energy

footprint and co products for customers. With water as an

essential resource our zero liquid discharge (ZLD)

solution continues to Ô¨Ånd increasing acceptance in the

market.

The PHS business is making strong inroads in vaccines

and injectables segments of pharma industry through

water and process solutions.

We are leveraging our expertise and knowhow in O&M and

digitalization, integrating our offerings, and providing

customers with a higher degree of plant reliability,

performance and OpEx beneÔ¨Åts.

We consider People as our most prized assets and we

take great pride in nurturing and growing talent to help

them realize their potential.

I am delighted to share that earlier in this year, Tilak

Maharashtra Vidyapeeth, Pune conferred the D.Litt. to our

founder and chairman Dr. Pramod Chudhari in recognition

of his pioneering contribution to bioeconomy globally. We

are conÔ¨Ådent that under his able leadership we will

continue to build sustainable solutions to make the world

a better place.

I acknowledge the guidance and direction I received from

the members of the Board. I thank my business partners,

team members and other stakeholders for support

extended. I thank you my: dear shareholders for your

continued faith in Praj‚Äôs vision and mission.

My team and I remain conÔ¨Ådent that we will continue to

build on this year‚Äôs performance and traverse the path to

a more promising future.
