Mr. Ashok Kajaria,

Dear shareholders,

It is with immense gratitude and

hope that we ink these sheets

with our thoughts. We hope that

you and your loved ones are safe

and doing well. Gratitude to all

those who have contributed to

build Kajaria to what it is today – a

robust business enterprise that has

overcome multiple challenges – yet

continued to deliver sustainable

performance. And hope for making

Kajaria increasingly resilient over

the coming years.

We lived upto our ethos of looking

at challenges in the eye. We

pushed harder even as strong

headwinds persisted. The big

positive of 2019-20 was that we

got back to winning ways towards

the tail end of the fiscal with a

spurt in sales volume, but then the

pandemic hit the Indian landmass.

The resilient India is not new to

challenges. It has faced them,

braved them and overcome them

with stature and poise. Concurrently,

the average Indian is braving the

odds to give the Indian economy

an all-out push. India’s backbone, its

rural economy, continues to thrive.

Harvest has been good. Rainfall has

been good. As a result, India has not

experienced any supply shortages

in farm produce or milk supplies.

As a logical fallout, consumption

in lesser-known towns has been

picking up.

Moreover, commercial activity is

happening. The services sector is

in overdrive. The urban Indian is

out on the streets. The people of

India have accepted the pandemic

as any other health ailment, which

is here to stay for some time.

Our simple barometer of

commercial activity is the GST

collection. In the first three months

of 2020-21, when the lockdown

was the most stringent, India

collected GST equivalent to its

historic two-month average. So,

when we look at this objectively,

India appears to have lost normal

business for a couple of months

at worst. In business, these things

happen.

India will resume its progressive

journey, with a stronger stride. This

is because the world is looking

at India as an important base in

the global supply chain cycle.

This intent promises to create

innumerable opportunities for

India Inc. both over the medium

and the long term.

Tiles sector has already been

struggling over the past 3-4

years on account of issues like

real estate sector slowdown,

demonetisation, adoption of

RERA, GST implementation and

the NBFC funding crisis. The

demand took a further hit in the

month of March 2020 with the

nationwide lockdown announced

by the Centre due to sudden

outbreak of Covid-19.

Exports have significantly opened

up for tile players since the mid

of the last financial year. This

is largely attributed to a) USA

imposing ADD on Chinese tiles

exports and b) anti-Chinese

sentiments. Further with Covid-19

impacting major exporters of

tiles i.e. China, Italy and Spain,

we believe the momentum in

exports is going to elevate further.

Moreover, the recent imposition

of anti-dumping duty by Gulf

Co-Operation Council (GCC) from

June 2020 has witnessed limited

impact so far.

Also, the pricing environment is

likely to remain stable with Morbi

players witnessing an increase

in costs driven by higher labour

costs due to labour migration post

Covid-19 breakout.

From Kajaria’s perspective,

we are back to business. The

company implemented necessary

procedures to ensure continuity

of operations with a safety-

first emphasis. In this uncertain

environment, our top priority

is the health and safety of our

people. Our plants are operating

at 85-90% utilisation. Almost

all our dealers are at work. Our

collections have been strong

enhancing our liquidity war chest.

Kajaria is a battle-hardened

warship. It is a company that has

delivered value to its stakeholders

even as it weathered the challenges

of a beleaguered real estate

ecosystem, the deepening NBFC

crisis and demonetisation for years.

The pandemic has presented a rare

but narrow window of opportunity

to reflect, reimagine and reset

our world. This health scare and

the social distancing has brought

to the fore digital transformation

which is now business imperative.

In aligning with the new normal,

we are investing in SAP S/4 HANA

Digital Core to streamline our

business processes and enable

knowledge-led decision-making

across various functions. As such,

even as we spread wide, we will

emerge as a more cohesive and

streamlined organisation.

While we have absorbed the reality

that our financial performance in

2020-21 will be marginally lower

than what it was in 2019-20, our

determination to surge ahead will

be in overdrive.

In closing, we would like to thank

the Board for guiding us to

execute our responsibilities in the

best possible manner. We would

like to extend our appreciation

to our team for their relentless

efforts in facing and overcoming

challenges to grow our respect

and stature in the business world.

Our deep appreciation to our

shareholders for their confidence

and support. We also place on

record our gratitude to our other

stakeholders – vendors, dealers,

retailers, customers, bankers and

Central and State government

authorities – for their consistent

support and assistance in our

journey. We solicit your continued

co-operation in helping Kajaria

move into a brighter future.

Warm regards

DIRECTORS’ PROFILE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Mr. Ashok Kajaria

(

Dear Shareholders,

Your Directors are pleased to present the 34th Annual Report together with the audited financial statements of your Company for the

financial year ended 31st March 2020.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STATE OF AFFAIRS OF

THE COMPANY

Kajaria shone as one of the bright stars in an otherwise lackluster

ecosystem for the tile sector. Our efforts to swim against the tide

arrested our decline – our revenue contracted by about 6% while

the Profit before Tax was a lower by 8%. Net profit, on the other

hand, upped by 13% owing to the introduction of the new tax

regime which reduced the Company’s tax liability.

The State of Affair of the Company is detailed in the ‘Management

Discussion and Analysis’ section which forms part of this report.

OUTLOOK

The onset of Fiscal 2020-21 has been anything but promising.

The pandemic has paused our fast paced world giving us a much

needed breather to rethink our part and to draw the contours of

a sustainable business strategy that encompasses all business

stakeholders.

The Government’s efforts to infuse liquidity into an otherwise

parched business world, has helped in improving sentiments.

Having said that, we remain hopeful that demand would

resurface as we near the festive season. Our optimism rests on the

reality that almost all our dealers are back in business. Volumes are

definitely resurfacing as every Indian has come to terms with the

coronavirus – as any other health issue which is here to stay. They

are already doing their bit to move the wheels of the economy.

Also, we are convinced that the unrelenting efforts the Indian

pharmaceutical world will, very soon, develop a solution that will

neutralize the adversities of this virus infusing fresh confidence

into the Indian populous.

We expect to sail through the subdued first half of the current

year comfortably. This is owing to our strengths namely our reach,

range, recognition and respect which will allow us to capitalise on

opportunities as and when they emerge.

Moreover, India’s medium-term prospects appear promising for

she is now being increasingly looked upon as a critical keg in the

global supply chain universe. This suggests that global majors

could consider establishing a base in India in the near term. This,

when it happens would brighten the prospects for real estate

sector and the domestic tile industry.
