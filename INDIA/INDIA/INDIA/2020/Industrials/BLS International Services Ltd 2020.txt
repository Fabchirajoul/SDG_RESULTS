prevailing macro environment has also

constantly delight customers with our

superior services, we have launched a

Mobile Biometric system, Prime Time

visa appointment facilities and other

allied services to seamlessly conduct

complex tasks and thereby, contribute

towards greater operational eloquence.

concerns, understand what they value

and accordingly, align our services to

Notes to the standalone

Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2020:

Managing Director

Mr. Nikhil Gupta: Managing

Managing Director: Managing

letter dated January 30, 2018. As per the terms

of contract, these Companies have to transfer the fixed assets

(hardware infrastructure) at the net block value (Procurement

price less depreciation as per provision of the Act) of the

fixed assets. The above mentioned three subsidiaries have

accordingly handed over the hardware infrastructure to the

authority and transferred these at the net block based on their

understanding of the master service agreement by taking the

life of these assets of 5 years and have accounted profit on

such transfer. The above mentioned three subsidiaries have

communicated the basis of computing net block of the assets

to the authority which is pending for final acceptance by them.

Pending final acceptance/ confirmation of the sale price of

fixed assets by the Authority, we cannot comment upon the

correctness of the amount receivable from the Authority.

The matter stated above were also subject matter of

qualification in our audit opinion on the consolidated financial

statements for the year ended March 31, 2019

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial

statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs)

specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities

under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s

Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial

Statements section of our report. We are independent of the

Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the

Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with

the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the

consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the

Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled

our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these

requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the

audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate

to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated

financial statements.

Emphasis of Matter

Without qualifying, we draw attention to

i.

Note 53 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,

the Company has considered internal and external

information upto the date of this report in respect of the

current and estimated future global economic indicators

consequent to the global health pandemic.

ii.

In earlier years, the Punjab Government has terminated

the master service agreement entered with three

Indian Subsidiaries namely BEServPL, BESoIPL and

BITPL vide its: letter dated January 30, 2018, which was

only the source of the revenue of these Companies.

However, the management is making efforts to secure

further contracts/business in these subsidiaries and

is able to achieve success in respect of one subsidiary

(Le, BEServPL) and is of the view that going concern

assumption is not affected. We have relied upon the

management's contention.
