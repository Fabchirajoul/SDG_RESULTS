Dear Shareholders, Ladies and Gentlemen,

On behalf of the Board of Directors of The Shipping Corporation of India Ltd., I am pleased to place before you, our esteemed shareholders, the

70th Annual Report of your Company for the financial year 2019-2020. The report enumerates exhaustively your Company’s performance for

the financial year ended 31st March 2020. I take this opportunity, however, to touch upon salient features of your Company’s achievements

during the last financial year.

When the going gets tough, the tough get going and the cliché seems more than apt to describe your Company at this juncture which has

displayed immense resilience, fortitude and dexterity in its operations, systems and functions during the crisis which struck us towards

the end of the year. Operations across all the sectors were impacted by the outbreak of the pandemic and its cascading effects were ably

sustained by your Company during these trying times in the backdrop of a well-documented “Business Continuity Plan” prepared in advance

to meet the eventuality of the lockdown imposed from 24/3. The consequent restrictive work scenario brought in its wake multifaceted

problems which your company braced well owing to its preparedness for such an eventuality. We pre-empted disruptions to the operations

in two phases, initially, by envisioning the modalities of an alternate Plan to deal with an anticipated confinement which seemed inevitable

yet unprecedented, and later, focusing on executing the Plan and realigning it as warranted to the ever-changing requirements. Actions were

taken to institute the Work From Home mechanism and implementing Shipboard Outbreak Management Plan and the situation on board all

owned and manned vessels was closely monitored by the Fleet and Operations Divisions. The challenges were formidable but an evolving

Plan held us in good stead and they were overcome. And it makes us proud to convey that your Company continued to ensure transportation

of essential supplies and uninterrupted trade flow requirements despite the constraints.:

letter and spirit.

Other developments

Your company on 1st of January 2020 smoothly and successfully transitioned to being compliant with IMO's 0.5% sulphur fuel regulation

and the vessels remained compliant and are being supplied low sulphur fuel oil since 1st January, 2020.

Your Company has the honour of continued association with the Indian Navy through deployment of SCI Sabarmati, offshore vessel, for

conducting Sea Acceptance Trials (SAT) for its new Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) equipment on the West and East Coasts of

India and is proud to serve the project of national importance.

Your Company continued to display courage and commitment when SCI’s offshore vessel m.v. ‘SCI Urja’ towed a distressed trawler with 18

fishermen during the severe tropical storm ‘KYARR’ of October 2019 to safety.

Your Company has been identified for strategic disinvestment by the Government of India and the Department of Investment and Public Asset

Management (DIPAM) of Ministry of Finance has appointed Transaction Advisors, Asset Valuers and Legal Advisors and the due diligence

process is in progress.

Your Company complies with the Government of India's Public Procurement Policy (PPP) for MSEs Order, 2012 as all its tenders have a

relevant clause giving the benefits and purchase preferences available to MSEs in the Order. During the Financial year 2019-20, the total:
