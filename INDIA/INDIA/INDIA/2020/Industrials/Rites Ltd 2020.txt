Bibhu Prasad Nayak

Parmod Kumar Narang

Chairman &: Managing

Managing Director has earmarked every alternate

Tuesday for hearing employees’ grievances.

WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY

RITES has a separate and well-structured Vigilance

Department, which deals with frauds or suspected

malpractices involving employees, contractors,

suppliers, consultants, service providers or those

doing business with the Company. Besides, a

whistleblower and fraud prevention policy is also in

practice to monitor and rein-in unethical activities.

CONTRIBUTION TO GOVT. OF INDIA INITIATIVES

The Company

has

always

been

proactively

supporting initiatives of the Government of India

such as Skill India, Swachh Bharat Mission, Start-up

India, Make in India, including MSMEs, Digital India,

promotion of Solar Ecosystem by formulating its

business or governance objectives in line with the

government plans.

ENVIRONMENT

PROTECTION

&

ENERGY

CONSERVATION

All Company offices across the country maintain

environment-friendly

work

processes

and

sustainability, providing clean, safe and healthy

working conditions to its employees. The Company

follows all conventional and technological methods

to conserve energy and resources and reduce

waste generation. It has installed sewage plants

solar plants and rain harvesting system at its office

campuses. Besides, the launch of e-office (apart from

its other benefits) is also in line with the Company’s

commitment to reduce carbon footprints.

PROMOTING MSMEs

During the year, the Company procured goods

worth ` 45.92 crore from Micro, small and Medium

Enterprises (MSMEs), including those belonging to

SC/ST and women categories.

Being a Central Public Sector Enterprise, the

Company procurement policies and practices are

guided by the government policies and practices.

These are based on transparent procurement

mechanisms, which promote procurement from

technically competent suppliers. However, care

is also taken for the interest of local suppliers

and contractors within the framework of CVC’s

guidelines. The Company has a special policy to

encourage MSMEs and those belonging to SC/ST

and Women categories. It has taken necessary steps

for implementing the public procurement policy for

procurement from MSMEs. Necessary provisions

have been incorporated in all tenders for materials

and services. In general, minimum 25% of the

requirement has been reserved for eligible MSMEs

in tenders. The Company has always encouraged

local suppliers to participate in its tendering process

and also promote them through training and hand-

holding programs. Our continued pursuit in this

direction has seen improved participation of small

and local players and socio-economic development

of communities in and around our operational

locations.:

No significant credit risk on cash and bank balances including clients’ funds amounting to ` 3631.45 crore

(previous year ` 3533.73 crore) is expected as holding company and its Indian Subsidiaries parks surplus funds

with Schedule Banks having good credit adequacy ratio and least NPA as determined by RBI and guidelines

of the respective companies. Holding Company and its Indian Subsidiaries has parked its owned funds in fixed

deposits of ` 1071.20 crore (previous year ` 1270.39 crore) with Schedule banks with negligible credit risks.

Non-Strategic Investments primarily include investments in liquid mutual fund units of `111.66 crore (previous

year Nil ) and tax free bonds of ` 120 crore (previous year ` 120 crore) issued by Public Sector Undertaking

where risk is minimal.

Company has given loans to employees and one of its joint ventures. House building, Multi-purpose loans etc.

to the employee are secured by way of insurance and mortgage of the house properties or hypothecation of

vehicles in line with the policies of the company. The loan provided to the joint venture is long term. The risk of

default in respect of these loans is considered negligible.

2.54.3 Liquidity Risk of Group

Group’s principal sources of liquidity are “cash and cash equivalents” and the cash flow that is generated from

operations. Group has outstanding bank borrowings of ` 40.26 crore (previous year ` 47.60 crore). Group has

a working capital of ` 2112.17 crore (previous year ` 1840.76 crore) including cash and bank balance (owned

funds) of ` 1110.35 crore (previous year ` 1302.24 crore) and current investment ` 111.66 crore (previous year

Nil). Outbreak of COVID-19 has slightly impacted the realisation from customers, however due to company’s

cash & bank balances position, Company does not foresee its impact on liquidity of company. Group believes

that the working capital is sufficient to meet its requirements, accordingly no liquidity risk is perceived by the

company.

In present circumstances, there is uncertainty regarding realization of revenue. As per company’s accounting

policies, when there is uncertainty as to realisability, recognition of revenue is postponed until such uncertainty

is removed.Therefore revenue amounting to ` 6.81 crore for the period 10.01.2017 to 26.04.2017 has been

postponed and not recognized. In this regard, a petition was filed in Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission

(RERC) for realization of the wind energy charges during this period (i.e. 10.01.2017 to 26.04.2017) as this

power was fed into the state grid. As per RERC order dt.05.11.2018, “The commission is of the considered view

that the petitioner (REMCL) is not entitled for Adjustment of energy wheeled from its CPP after termination of

WBA”. Accordingly petition was disposed off. Now, company has filed as appeal before APTEL on 20.12.2018

against this RERC order. The hearing is due on 20.08.2020.

Wheeling and Transmission charges payable to Rajasthan state utilities are directly paid by WCR and deduction

for the same is made by WCR in gross bill and only net amount i.e. after deduction towards wheeling & transmission

is paid to REMCL on monthly basis. Therefore Wheeling & Transmission charges for the corresponding period

i.e. 10.01.2017 to 26.04.2017which are payable to Rajasthan state utilities has not been recognized and shown

as contingent liability under note no.2.51.2.1.
