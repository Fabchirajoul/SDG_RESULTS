Ingersoll-Rand (India) Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

Welcome to the 98th Annual General Meeting of

your company. As we close another year of

pursuing excellence while driving sustainable

innovation, I would like to express my gratitude

on behalf of the Board of Directors, for the

persistent trust you have placed in us. It is this

trust that has helped us reach new milestones,

pioneer industry trends while remaining steadfast

in our commitment to reduce the world’s carbon

footprint.

On March 1, 2020, Gardner Denver and the

Ingersoll Rand Industrial Segment merged,

combining two companies with associated

cultures and creating a more comprehensive

portfolio of leading brands across technologies

and solutions with greater end-market balance

and enhanced scale and reach. This was a

milestone as we formed a new strong industrial

company with a talented global workforce,

powered by an entrepreneurial spirit, ownership

mindset and sustainability focus.

Our Purpose

Our Purpose barely days old, the newly formed

Ingersoll Rand Purpose – Lean On Us to Help

You Make Life Better – and our Values were put

to the test by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the

health and safety of our employees as our top

priority,

response

teams

were

formed

immediately and quickly implemented actions to

reduce the spread of the virus, launched an

organization-wide communication plan to engage

employees and empowered local leaders to make

quick decisions that were backed up by our global

health and safety team to ensure consistent

execution of best practices.

Ingersoll Rand’s businesses manufacture and

service mission-critical products that support

essential sectors on the front lines of minimizing

the spread and fighting the impact of COVID-19,

including the healthcare and public health, food

and agriculture. Our employees, customers and

partners are proud that our COVID-19 response

has been high in our Purpose, and know they can

lean on us to help make life better.

In 2019-20, the GDP growth rate is estimated to

be 5% as compared to 6.8% in 2018-19. The

overall industrial sector growth is estimated to be

2.5% in 2019-20 as compared to 6.9% growth in

2018-19. Manufacturing sector is estimated to

grow at 2.0% during 2019-20 Manufacturing

activities were subdued due to a decrease in

domestic demand for key sectors such as

automotive and pharmaceuticals. Exports of

labour intensive sectors such as jewelry, basic

metals, leather and textile also underperformed

during the current financial year. Liquidity crunch

due to reduced lending by NBFC also had an

adverse impact.

With an encouraging economic momentum as the

backdrop, Ingersoll Rand has not only sustained

its progress this year too, but has also further

strengthened its position as a market leader.

Delivering excellence and sustainability lies at the:

the carrying amounts of Receivables, Inventories and other assets / liabilities. In developing the assumptions

relating to the possible future uncertainties in the global economic conditions because of the pandemic, the

possible effects that may result from the current pandemic on its financial condition, liquidity and operations
