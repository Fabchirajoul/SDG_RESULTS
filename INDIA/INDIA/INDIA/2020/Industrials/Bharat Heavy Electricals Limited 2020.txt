NOTICE

337:

Dear Shareholders,

It is an honor and a privilege to present the 56th Annual

Report to our valued shareholders. I am writing to you at a

time when the entire world is combating with the Covid-19

pandemic, which has far reaching consequences on

societies, economies and businesses across the globe. The

pandemic has added yet another layer of complexity to an

already challenging business environment with falling global

GDP growth rates and decline in ordering of thermal power

projects. Now that the world is slowly coming to terms with

this unprecedented crisis, it is time for us to adjust to the

‘new normal’ and reorient ourselves accordingly.

Covid response & contribution

Your company has undertaken various steps to deal with

COVID-19 situation and responded with agility to minimize

the impact on its stakeholders. Business continuity &

preparedness has been ensured during the lockdown

through the ‘work-from-home’ mode, especially in areas

such as design and engineering, training, knowledge

sharing and other HR related activities, finance related

activities, etc. During the lockdown, work continued at

critical sites with the support of local authorities, which

resulted in recommissioning of 1x800 MW Kothagudem

thermal project and commissioning of Bhadradri Unit-1 in

Telangana.

Your company has also risen to the occasion to support

the national efforts on COVID-19 through monetary

contribution of ` 15.72 crore to PMCARES fund as well as

through development of multiple products for in-house

use and by various govt. departments/ municipalities and

has also provided support to local communities in every

possible way.

Key performance highlights

Even though the lockdown was imposed in the country from

25th March 2020, the impact on your company’s operations

was being felt much earlier, on account of disruptions in

material supplies from China, Italy, etc., which started: LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

Trading by Insiders and for Fair Disclosure, Director (Finance) is the

In addition, as a part of BHEL’s persisting endeavour to set a high

standard of conduct for its employees (other than those governed by

standing orders), ‘BHEL Conduct, Discipline and Appeal Rules, 1975’

is in place. This is augmented by Fraud Prevention Policy and Whistle

Act 2005, audit by Statutory Auditors and CAG audit under section

139 of the Companies Act, 2013.

BHEL has signed MoU with Transparency International India (TII) to

adopt ‘Integrity Pact’ to make procurement and contracting more

transparent by binding both the parties to ethical conduct. A panel

of two Independent External Monitors (IEMs) has been appointed to

oversee implementation of Integrity Pact in BHEL, with due approval

of Central Vigilance Commission. Within BHEL, accountability is well

defined for various functionaries through ‘Delegation of Power’.

Works Policy, Purchase Policy and other policy documents facilitate

transparency in BHEL’s working and commitment of highest order

of integrity. Eight representations received from suppliers during

2019-20 under Integrity Pact have been resolved by the IEMs.

The Company has a Stakeholders Relationship Committee specifically

to look into matters related to redressal of shareholders and investors

complaints. As reported by KFin Technologies Private Limited

(Registrar & Share Transfer Agent of the company), 949 complaints

were received from the shareholders during the year under review

and all complaints were redressed by 31st March, 2020.

In addition, a total of 258 public grievance complaints were received

from the general public under the Centralized Public Grievance

Redressal and Monitoring Scheme during the year 2019-20. All the

grievances were satisfactorily resolved.

Principle 2: Products Life Cycle Sustainability

BHEL is contributing to a greener environment through development

of environment friendly technologies and improvement in efficiency

of equipment. Continuous improvement in power cycle efficiency

and reduced emissions from coal based power plants have been

achieved over the time by evolution of technology from sub-critical

to supercritical. Attributes of BHEL supplied power plant equipment

such as lower auxiliary power consumption, higher plant efficiency,

lower design heat rate and higher operating availability help in

attaining lower life cycle cost.:

Managing Director

Managing Director in the MCM held on April 19, 2019 for excellent

7.2A Vigil Mechanism

Vigilance surprise checks & investigations have brought out cases

where the experience certificates issued to vendors by BHEL unit(s)

were being forged and submitted to other BHEL Unit(s)/ PSUs/

Govt. departments for participating in their tenders. As a preventive

vigilance initiative, and in order to eliminate such instances, an online

repository of QR incorporated Performance/ Experience Certificates

Annexure –VII A to the Board’s Report

issued to suppliers/ contractors, developed in-house by BHEL at the

instance of Vigilance Department, was inaugurated by Secretary, CVC

on 18th February, 2020. The online, centralized, pan BHEL system

enables any of the Units to log in and issue experience/ performance

certificates to suppliers/ contractors. The certificate so issued through

this system has a QR code which can be scanned using a mobile

camera/ QR code scanner app and compared and authenticated with

the certificate available in the central repository of BHEL 24x7, thus

reducing time taken for verification.

It was felt necessary that executives at the decision taking level should

be provided with a ready reckoner to help them take well-reasoned

decisions in line with company’s policies and guidelines in: letter and

spirit. Accordingly, the Do’s & Don’ts for following areas of operation

have been finalized with the concerned departments and notified:

• Procurement (with Corporate Sourcing Strategy & Policy

Department)

• Vendor Registration (with Corporate Sourcing Strategy & Policy

Department)

• Finance & Execution of Works and Purchase (with Corporate

Finance Department)

• Quality and Third-Party Inspection (with Corporate Quality

Department)

In order to sensitize employees about various vigilance issues

involved with decision making, 93 training programmes/ workshops

on preventive vigilance were organized for employees associated

with decision making process across the Units/Regions. Further, a

session on preventive vigilance has been added in all the General

Management Programmes/ Strategic Management Programmes/

Young Managers Programmes organized by Corporate Learning &

Development (CLD).

A two-day workshop for Material Management (MM) and Vigilance

Heads on ‘Public Procurement’ was also organized at BHEL, Bhopal

from 10th to 11th February, 2020 to bring uniformity in the working

among the BHEL Units with the CVC guidelines & share the best

practices of different PSUs. The sessions were taken by the Secretary,
