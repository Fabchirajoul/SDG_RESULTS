Dear Stakeholders,

Accelerating

shared prosperity

and value creation

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited:

Dear Stakeholders,

20

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited:

letter of the law, but

equally about the spirit for us, to

proactively understand regulations,

stay ahead of any unforeseen

violations and ensure transparency

in all that we do. A few highlights of

environmental metrics and targets

we set for FY25 include:

• Our existing renewable energy

consumption has already touched

19 MW. We are positioned to have

100% of all port cargo handling to

be renewable powered by FY25

• We currently recycle and reuse

1.50 million litres of water per day,

and this is expected to reach

10 million litres by FY25

• The mangrove cover we have

already achieved is a massive

3,000 hectare, which that we

intend to now increase by another

1,000 hectare till FY25

Overall, we are considered to be one

of the greenest port operators in

the world and we intend to further

accelerate our green contribution

and become the benchmark for

environmental stewardship.

In terms of addressing the social

component of ESG, we continue to

contribute significantly towards

doing our part to help the holistic

development of the several hundred

families that are part of our inclusive

community growth initiatives

across all our locations. We mostly

do this through our support of

Adani Foundation’s initiatives in

education, community health,

sustainable livelihood development

and community infrastructure

development that touches

several hundred thousand lives

all across India.

We continue to make governance

standards that we set for ourselves

increasingly stringent and have

already started seeing the benefits

as we increasingly tap into

international financial markets. Few

of the highlights of governance

initiatives include:

• Published policy on “Related Party

Transactions for Acquiring and

Sale of Assets”

• Consistent dividend and

shareholder return policy in line

with long term growth objectives

• Dividend payout or share buyback

or combination at 20% to 25% of

Profit After Tax (“PAT”)

• Capital allocation policy that

targets a project pre-tax IRR of 16%

for all new projects

• Formal Board member Evaluation

& Performance Plans (being

established in FY20)

• Establishment of Disclosure

Committee by December 2020

(being established in FY20)

Overall, we increasingly view a strong

ESG proposition as a lever to attract
