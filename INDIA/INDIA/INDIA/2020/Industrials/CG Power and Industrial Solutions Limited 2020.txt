Dear Shareholders,

Further to the commitment made by us for

raising capital to ensure that the Company can

run steadily thereafter, your Board created a

Committee to focus on this. To revitalize the

process, Arpwood Capital Private Limited, a

leading investment bank, was appointed to

generate interest amongst various types of

investors and advise the Board in selecting the

best possible option.

The Committee met frequently to assess

evolving situation and finally decided to zero in

on the non-binding offer (NBO) received from

the credible Murugappa Group and started

discussions/ negotiations with them to find the

best possible solution for the Company.

The Company simultaneously entered into

a Debt Resolution process with the lenders,

advised by SBI Caps, to find an optimal

solution to take care of the interest of all the

stakeholders.

Towards this, and with utmost delight, I am

happy to say that Tube Investments of India

Limited (Murugappa Group), your Company

and the lenders have agreed to a proposed

investment of I 650 crore as equity and I 150

crore of warrants along with a sustainable

debt in the books of the Company. I have no

doubts that all stakeholders will rejoice at this

momentous development.

further assessments in relation to certain

unauthorized transactions by some employees

and certain directors of your Company. The

Legal Firm submitted its Phase I Investigation

Report dated 5 August 2019 (‘Report’) to the

AC in its meeting held on 6 August 2019.

Basis the Investigative Report, inputs

the impact and all such information as may be

required to be included and disclosed, relating

to past transactions. Hence, the standalone

view.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS (Contd.)

•

The senior officials of the Company are engaging with varied regulatory bodies and authorities in India in relation to

investigations and cooperating and providing details as been requested by them.

(b) On 8 March, 2019, the Board of Directors had approved a Scheme of Amalgamation (‘Scheme’) of CGPSOL, a wholly owned

subsidiary of the Company with the Company. The Company filed the necessary application to the NCLT of Maharashtra, at

Mumbai for obtaining necessary approvals for the aforesaid Scheme.

On 12 November, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to call off the proposed merger given various issues

unwinding from the discovery of irregular transactions and other detailed verification during the course of investigation. In view

of the same, the Company had filed an application with NCLT for withdrawal of the said Scheme and NCLT has approved the

withdrawal of the said Scheme.

(c)

The Company had in January 2010, entered into a Brand License and support agreement with Avantha Holdings Limited (‘AHL’)

for use of ‘Avantha’ brand for a consideration which was based on a specified percentage of its annual consolidated net

operating revenues (‘ANOR’) as defined in that agreement (‘Royalty Agreement’) and which was amended from time to time and

till September 2018 the specified percentage was 1% of ANOR. Royalty was accrued until September 2018 and not thereafter.

The Company and AHL had terminated the Royalty Agreement and entered into a new Brand Royalty Agreement on 13 February,

2019 effective from 1 October 2018 (New Royalty Agreement). Further, during the quarter ended 31 December, 2019, the

Company has rescinded the New Royalty Agreement with AHL. Consequently, the New Royalty Agreement stands null and void.

Accordingly, the Company does not have liability towards payment of brand royalty and shall not have any liability of any nature

whatsoever towards AHL under or pursuant to the Royalty Agreement or the New Royalty Agreement. AHL has contested the

rescission of New Royalty Agreement, though it has directed the Company to discontinue the usage of Avantha brand, which

the Company has discontinued.

(d) The Company has issued recovery notices to 7 (seven) entities demanding repayment of a sum of ` 1314.78 crores owed by them

to the Company. 3 (three) notices sent by the Company (recovery amount of ` 452.12 crores) have been returned undelivered

(‘Undelivered Notices’). Besides the above, recovery notices for claims of ` 74.63 crores owed to the Company could not be sent

for want of requisite details including communication details (‘Unsent Notices’).

Out of the recovery notices sent by the Company, responses have been received from 2 (two) entities (recovery amount

of ` 108.85 crores) seeking for particulars of the claim made by the Company; from 1 (one) entity (claim amount of

` 685.31 crores) making counter claim of ` 525.21 crores with interest at 15.70% per annum from 30 April, 2019 and also seeking

for particulars of the Company’s claim of ` 685.31 crores; 1 (one) entity (claim amount of ` 68.50 crores which does not include `

0.08 crores of trade receivable) has stated there is no amount outstanding (‘Responses’). Based on the information available with

Company, the Management believes the responses received are untenable. The Company has filed certain recovery proceedings

and will continue pursuing further legal options, in consultation with legal counsels of the Company.

(e)

The Company has filed the following suits for recovery:

(i)

Civil Suit in the High Court of Bombay against BILT Graphic Paper Products Limited, Avantha Holdings Limited, and former

Directors connected with the promoter group and former KMPs for recovery of ` 811.23 crores (Principal amount of `

552.33 crores together with interest aggregating to ` 258.90 crores at the rate of 18% p.a.) towards the loss caused to the

Company’s subsidiary CGPSOL by unauthorised / illegal liquidation of its mutual funds.

(ii) Civil Suit in the High Court of Bombay against Solaris Industrial Chemicals Limited, Avantha Holdings Limited and

former Directors connected with the promoter group and former KMPs for recovery of ` 399.30 crores (principal

` 280.00 crores together with interest aggregating ` 119.30 crores at the rate of 18% p.a.) towards the loss caused to

CGPSOL due to unauthorised / illegal liquidation of its fixed deposits.

(iii) Civil Suit in the High Court of Bombay against Avantha Holdings Limited and former Directors connected with the promoter

group and former KMPs for recovery of ` 478.93 crores - (principal ` 320.91 crores together with interest aggregating `

178.02 crores at the rate of 18% p.a.) towards the loss caused to CGPSOL due to unauthorised / illegal transfer of funds

from CGPSOL.

In view of the national lockdown on account of COVID-19, the remaining recovery cases shall be filed upon normal functioning

of the Courts.

(f)

During the year, the Company has carried out the process for recovery of outstanding advances by issuing recovery notices to

various third parties. In the process, few notices were returned undelivered (‘Undelivered notices’) and few notices could not be

sent for want of requisite details (‘Unsent notices’). In view of the same, based on prudence, the Company has made a provision

for such outstanding amount due from third parties / unrelated parities aggregating to ` 266.40 crores in the standalone financial

statement for the year ended 31 March, 2020. However, the Company will continue with the recovery process for the said

receivables. In view of the national lockdown on account of corona virus outbreak, the remaining recovery cases shall be filed

upon normal functioning of the Courts.

(g)

In view of the reduction in the shareholding of the promoters in the Company to a negligible percentage, subsequent detection

of un-authorised transactions with the Group companies, leading to fraudulent transfers to the promoter company, Avantha

Holdings Limited and its related entities and consequent removal of Mr. Gautam Thapar as the Company’s Chairman, the

Company has vide its application dated 18 October, 2019 has sought for exemption from the conditions provided under

Regulation 31A(3)(b) of the SEBI (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended (‘Listing

Regulations’) for reclassification of promoters read with Regulation 102 of the Listing Regulations for reclassification of Avantha

UPDATE ON REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS (Contd.):

letter on 7 January, 2020 to stay the demand until disposal of appeal by Commissioner of

Income Tax (Appeals), hereafter ‘CIT(A)’. The Company had also filed an appeal before CIT(A) on 15 January, 2020 against the

demand raised by the Assessing Officer as the Company believes on the basis of grounds in the demand, the demand is not

tenable. The Company had also filed a: letter on 24 January, 2020 to CIT(A) requesting for early disposal of appeal. The assessing

officer has issued a letter on 6 February, 2020 in response to our stay application and rejected Company’s stay application. After

careful consideration of all facts, the Company has filed writ petition before Bombay High Court contesting against the demand

raised by the Assessing Officer as the Company believes on the basis of grounds in the demand, the demand is not tenable.

The Bombay High Court vide its order dated 13 March, 2020 had granted an interim stay until admission of appeal which was

scheduled to be heard on 12 June, 2020. In response to Company’s prayer, the CIT(A) scheduled a hearing on 16 June, 2020. In

view of COVID-19 situation, the office of CIT(A) is not functioning and the Company awaits further communication from CIT(A)

office and on next hearing date. Further in view of COVID-19 situation, the hearing scheduled on 12 June, 2020 before the

Bombay High Court could not be heard and therefore the Company awaits next hearing date for the admission of appeal from

the Bombay High Court.

(i)

Four suppliers due to non-payment of their dues have approached NCLT under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The Company

has received notices in respect of such applications in NCLT. One such claim is being contested by the Company due to a pre-

existing dispute (refer note 56) and for other claims the Company is in discussions with the claimants for an amicable settlement.

(j)

During the year, a loan from a particular lender was not rolled over, leading to a technical default of borrowing terms and

conditions with the lenders. All the lenders of the Company have formed a consortium, led by State Bank of India (‘SBI’). The

management is in discussion with the lenders of Company to work out a resolution plan. Further, the lenders to the Company

are in the process of signing the Inter Creditor Agreement (‘ICA’). As on the date of issuance of these standalone financial

statements, 11 out of the 14 lenders (by count) have signed the ICA while the Company is pursuing discussion with the rest of

the lenders along with lead banker.

As a part of the discussion with the lenders to the Company, subsequent to the execution of the ICA, the lenders have

commissioned various reports with respect to forensic, valuation, techno-economic feasibility and security structure, which are

expected to form the basis of the resolution framework between the Company and the lenders. The Company is not privy to

these reports.

The Company believes that following the signing of ICA, those lenders will not recall the loans during the ICA review period i.e.

up to 24 March, 2020 due to the current defaults and thus the Company has continued to classify such borrowings as Non-

Current. However pursuant to outbreak of COVID-19, the ICA stands extended up to 20 September, 2020 under the Reserve

Bank of India (‘RBI’) guidelines.

There were undisclosed transactions reported by the Company in the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31

March, 2019 in relation to borrowings aggregating ` 320.00 crores, availed by the connected parties from a financial institution

on the basis of Company’s Land and Building in Nashik and Kanjurmarg. Such borrowings availed by the connected parties

were extended to the Company and Company had further extended those borrowings to one of the promoter affiliate company

and to one of the other connected party. These transactions were done by certain identified persons (‘CIP’) of the Company,

as identified and defined in the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March, 2019. Further,

the Company disclosed that the

letter was unauthorisedly issued on behalf of the Company

by a CIP allegedly to discharge AHL’s pecuniary obligations. No disclosure was made in the financial statements of prior years. Certain

CIPs signed post-dated cheques (‘PDCs’) in violation of Rules of Procedure (‘ROPs’) and without the knowledge of the Board of Directors

and submitted for repayment purposes on behalf of AHL in accordance with the Comfort: Letter. The PDCs were replaced from time to

time by CIP on account of the previous cheques becoming time-barred / stale in violation of ROPs without requisite approvals. Last

PDC for ` 210.00 crores presented by the bank returned as dishonoured due to insufficient funds and the bank issued notice under

section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 dated 30 April, 2019 (‘Notice’) to the Company on account of the cheque being returned unpaid.

The Company responded to the Notice denying the existence of the alleged comfort letter and the fact that the PDC cheques were signed by

certain CIPs in violation of ROP and requisite approvals. However the Bank has filed a complaint against the Company and certain directors before

magistrate court and the company received all documents including the comfort letter together with the notice received from the Magistrate Court.

The Company is contesting the same and has also filed petition in before the Delhi High Court to quash the complaint. The above proceedings filed

are pending. However, considering the uncertainty involved in the matter, the Board having considered all necessary facts and based on its own

internal assessment, that no amount was received by the Company from these borrowings which could have led to an obligation on the Company

to repay, the Board has decided to disclose the same as a contingent liability amounting to ` 391.88 crores. AHL has ceased to be a related party

w.e.f. 9 October, 2019 and disclosed as promoter affiliate company.

24 January, 2020 to CIT(A) requesting for early disposal of appeal. The assessing officer has issued a letter on 6 February, 2020 in

response to our stay application and rejected Company’s stay application. After careful consideration of all facts, the Company has

filed writ petition before Bombay High Court contesting against the demand raised by the Assessing Officer as the Company believes

on the basis of grounds in the demand, the demand is not tenable. The Bombay High Court vide its order dated 13 March, 2020 had

granted an interim stay until admission of appeal which was scheduled to be heard on 12 June, 2020. In response to Company’s

prayer, the CIT(A) scheduled a hearing on 16 June, 2020. In view of COVID-19 situation, the office of CIT(A) is not functioning and the

Company awaits further communication from CIT(A) office and on next hearing date. Further in view of COVID-19 situation, the hearing

scheduled on 12 June, 2020 before the Bombay High Court could not be heard and therefore the Company awaits next hearing date

for the admission of appeal from the Bombay High Court.

(h)

During the year, CGPSOL has received assessment order u/s 143(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the financial year 2016-17

(Assessment Year 2017-18). Along with the order, the CGPSOL received notice u/s 274 read with section 270A from income tax

department for levy of penalty. However, in the absence of availability of any director or officer, CGPSOL could not attend the penalty

hearing and has not yet filed appeal before Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) contesting the order and penalty. Assessing officer

is updated about CGPSOL’s inability to file an appeal.

(i)

received notices in respect of such applications in NCLT. One such claim is being contested by the Company due to a pre-existing

dispute (Refer note 54) and for other claims the Company is in discussions with the claimants for an amicable settlement.

(j)

During the year, a loan from a particular lender was not rolled over, leading to a technical default of borrowing terms and conditions

with the lenders. All the lenders of the Company have formed a consortium, led by State Bank of India (‘SBI’). The management is in

discussion with the lenders of the Company to work out a resolution plan. Further, the lenders to the Company are in the process of

of credit (‘SBLC’) in favour of the aforesaid customer. Basis the SBLC and APSA entered, the customer had made advance

payment of ` 160.22 crores (EURO 20 million) to CGME on behalf PSBE in April 2019. Upon receipt of the said advance,

CGME remitted the payment of ` 144.20 crores (EURO 18 million) to Avantha International Assets (‘AIA’). AIA in turn remitted

the amount to CG Singapore which was utilised by CG Singapore for prepayment of instalment of its borrowing. The advance

received from customer is considered to be in the nature of financing arrangement and hence has been treated as borrowing in

the consolidated financial statements. Also, CGME has made payment of ` 15.22 crores (EURO 1.90 million) to an unknown third

party for which there appears to be no business rationale. The said transactions were carried out at the behest of an erstwhile

KMP.

•

The repayments of ` 53.54 crores (USD 7.5 million) for nine months were made to avoid a default on a loan booked in CGME.

The said loan has been investigated in Phase 1 and its determination as liability is yet to be made.

(n)

to PSBE amounting to ` 6.78 crores (USD 0.95 million) and CG Electric Systems Hungary Zrt. (‘ESHU’) amounting to ` 6.78 crores

(USD 0.95 million) for the purpose of business operations. Further, ` 22.41 crores (USD 3.14 million) was transferred by CGIBV to

CGME for repayment of certain borrowings.

(o)

As a result of the transactions disclosed by the Company in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March, 2019,

the Company has potentially not complied with the provisions of Section 185, Section 186 and certain other applicable sections of

the Companies Act, 2013. The Company also believes that there may be potential non-compliances Listing Regulations; Income

Tax Act, 1961 and other statutes and regulations. As described in Note 2.1 above, the Company is in the process of investigation

in respect of certain transactions and evaluating the implications of these potential non-compliances and the potential remedies

available.

The Company had on 24 January, 2020, informed the stock exchanges of the Board’s decision to apply to the Central Government

for removal of M/s K K Mankeshwar & Co, one of the Joint Statutory Auditors of the Company under section 140 (1) of the Companies

Act, 2013. Upon communication of the Board’s decision, M/s K K Mankeshwar & Co had on 25 January, 2020, sent their resignation.

In view of the same, the Company has sought clarification from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on filing of application under

section 140(1) of the Companies Act or treating the resignation of M/s K K Mankeshwar & Co as vacation of office of one of the Joint

Statutory Auditors. Since no response was received from MCA as an abundant precaution, the Company has filed application for

approval of the Central Government for removal of M/s K K Mankeshwar & Co as Joint Statutory Auditors of the Company.

CIP allegedly to discharge AHL’s pecuniary obligations. No disclosure was made in the financial statements of prior years. Certain CIPs signed

post-dated cheques (‘PDCs’) in violation of Rules of Procedure (‘ROPs’) and without the knowledge of the Board of Directors and submitted for

the existence of the alleged comfort letter and the fact that the PDC cheques were signed by certain CIPs in violation of ROP and requisite

approvals. However the Bank has filed a complaint against the Company and certain directors before magistrate court and the company received

all documents including the comfort letter together with the notice received from the Magistrate Court. The Company is contesting the same and

has also filed petition in before the Delhi High Court to quash the complaint. The above proceedings filed are pending. However, considering the

uncertainty involved in the matter, the Board having considered all necessary facts and based on its own internal assessment, that no amount

was received by the Company from these borrowings which could have led to an obligation on the Company to repay, the Board has decided to

disclose the same as a contingent liability amounting to ` 391.88 crores. AHL has ceased to be a related party w.e.f. 9 October, 2019 and disclosed

as promoter affiliate company.
