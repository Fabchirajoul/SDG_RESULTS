III. OTHER INFORMATION

1.

Possible reasons for loss or inadequate profits:

Members may note that the Company has reported a profit of ` 280.69 crore for the year ended on March 31, 2020.

However, the Board of Directors are of the view that the volatility in freight rates, the impact of Accounting Standard 21 (Ind AS 21) and

Accounting Standard 109 (Ind AS 109), as well as current uncertainty due to Covid-19 global pandemic (explained in detail as follows) may

result in decline in the Company’s profitability, and may even lead to losses in future.

Volatility in freight rates: Shipping freight rates have traditionally been very volatile, and this continues to be the case. While the Company

makes every effort to ensure that it can ride out the freight rate cycles, and even profit over the long term from the volatility, it cannot control

the impact of the freight rate fluctuations on the vessels in the spot market. Therefore it is possible that there can be years in which the

Company has inadequate profits, or even a loss, due to poor freight rates.

Impact of Accounting Standards: Since the Company’s revenues and assets are priced in US dollars, the Company has funded its ship

acquisitions either by borrowing directly in US dollars, or by borrowing in rupees and swapping the liability into US Dollars through use of

derivative instruments. As per the Indian Accounting Standard 21 (Ind AS 21), the effect of revaluation of foreign currency loans is to be

taken to the Profit and Loss account. Similarly, as per Indian Accounting Standard 109 (Ind AS 109), the change in the fair value of the

derivative is to be taken to the profit and loss account. Over the past few months rupee has depreciated substantially against the US dollar,

and hence there has been an adverse impact on the Profit and Loss account.

However, the corresponding positive effect on the assets side (i.e., the increase in the rupee value of the ships due to depreciation of the

rupee against the US dollar) is not taken to the Profit and Loss account. As a result, there is a very significant negative impact on the Profit

and Loss account when the rupee depreciates versus the US Dollar.

Uncertainty due to Covid-19 global pandemic: The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the uncertainty on the growth prospects of major

economies around the world. If economic growth is at a slower pace than before, it may affect the profitability of the Company, and could

even result in a loss.

2.

Steps taken or proposed to be taken for improvement:

The Company has an established track record in the shipping industry with an experienced and professionally qualified management. It has

also successfully managed many shipping cycles over the last seven decades.:

Executive

Chairman's Statement: Dear Shareholders,

Microbes have often shaped human history, and will do so again, though it is

difficult to speculate on exactly how. Countries across the world have failed

their people in public health, and consequently the world is facing one of its

most serious crises in living memory.

As news of the dangers of COVID–19 spread across the world, the first

priority for your Company’s management was to ensure the safety of its

people. We quickly put in place strict protocols to be followed in daily life,

and simultaneously supplied all the necessary protective equipment to keep

everyone safe. At the time of writing this letter to you all, I am glad to say

that we have been successful in protecting all our seafarers as well as our

shore personnel from the virus.

About a week before our government announced a nationwide lockdown,

your Company initiated ‘Work from Home’ (WFH) for its employees. I am

happy to report that during these over 90 days of WFH, the business has

been run efficiently and seamlessly.

I particularly wish to convey a special message of gratitude to all our

seafarers who have delivered under very challenging circumstances and

who, unfortunately, have been kept away from their loved ones due to the

travel restrictions.

VARIABLE PAY6

It provides a variable level of remuneration dependent on short-term performance of the individual as well as the Company vis a vis industry

performance globally. The test of performance by the Company is whether it is able to increase its profits when the industry environment is favourable

and whether it is able to minimise its losses when the environment is harsh. The Company believes that performance of each and every employee

of the Company contributes to its overall performance and hence should be rewarded suitably. Hence, the Company follows the policy of making

payment of variable pay to its executive directors annually.

Variable pay is decided based on performance of executive directors as well as the Company. Where possible, the Company uses quantifiable, hard

targets that can be factually measured and objectively assessed. The Company also reviews the underlying performance of the group in light of the

annual plan, competitors results, etc.

Variable pay may vary from time to time but shall be maximum four times of the Consolidated Salary. Executive directors with bigger operating

responsibilities may be entitled to more variable pay as compared to others.

PENSION

Pension recognises and appreciates the experience, expertise, advice, efforts and contribution provided and made by executive directors to the

Company during their long years of service with the Company and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries, whether in their capacity as executive directors

or otherwise.

The Company may provide pension (which includes providing perquisites) to its eligible executive directors upon their ceasing to hold office in the

Company in recognition of their past services in accordance with a scheme formulated by the Board of Directors.

REVIEW

Salary reviews consider both external competitiveness and internal consistency when determining if any increases should be applied.

Salary increases will be generally in line with all employee increases within the Company and other companies based in India and abroad.

Salaries are compared against other shipping and offshore majors, but the Company also monitors market practice among companies of a similar

size, geographic spread and business dynamic to the Company.

Salary increases are not directly linked to performance. However a base-line level of personal contribution is needed in order to be considered for a

salary increase and exceptional sustained contribution may be grounds for accelerated salary increases.

Specific measures and targets may be determined each year by the Committee. The principal measures of increments / bonus will be based on

value creation and may include financial measures such as operational efficiency, operating cash flow, operating profit, cost management, project

delivery, etc.
