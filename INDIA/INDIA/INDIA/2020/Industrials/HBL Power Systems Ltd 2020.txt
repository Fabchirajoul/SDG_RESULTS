Dear shareholders,

A

NOTHER eventful

year has passed by

and we are happy to share

our thoughts with you yet

again on our performance

and prospects through this

Annual Report.

Our performance in 2019-20

Financial year 2020 turned

out to be an engaging and

challenging year. It brought

with it a new wave of

opportunities and successes,

even as existing challenges

continued to test our

resilience and perseverance.

The general adverse

economic environment was

not the only impediment

facing us. The decline in the

performance of the telecom

sector continued unabated.

Since telecom batteries

account for a major share

in our revenue, decline

in demand from the

beleaguered telecom sector

impacted our business. As

such, revenue declined to

H 1,077 crore in 2019-20 from

H 1,261 crore in 2018-19; net

profit dropped from H 25

crore to H 22 crore over the

same period.

We continued to monetise

our surplus assets which

helped in optimising our
