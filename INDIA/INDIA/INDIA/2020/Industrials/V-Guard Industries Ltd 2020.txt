Managing Director and Whole-time Director and its Manager in any Financial Year may exceed 11% (eleven

per cent), and remuneration payable to any one Whole-time Director or: Managing

Managing Director and Whole-time Director(s) is expected to exceed 11% of the net profits

of the Company and the remuneration payable to Mr. Ramachandran V in the Financial Year may also exceed the

limit of 5% of the net profits of the Company.

The employee stock compensation expenses relating to the options vested had been taken into the Statement

of Profit and Loss in the respective years of vesting and there will not be any further impact neither on the

profitability nor on the cashflow for the Financial Year 2020-21 on account of proposed increase in the overall

managerial remuneration.

Accordingly, based on the recommendation of Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors

in their meeting held on June 01, 2020 considered the proposal to increase the overall limit of managerial

remuneration payable from 11% to 15% of the net profits of the Company calculated as per Section 198 of the

Act, and increase the limit of the remuneration payable to Mr. Ramachandran V, in excess of 5% of the net profits

of the Company, for the Financial Year 2020-21.

Your Directors recognize that pursuant to the current outbreak of COVID-19 in India and around the world,

the Government of India had announced a nationwide ‘lock-down’ from midnight March 25, 2020 till May 03,

2020. In the wake of the lock-down, business of several companies including this Company have been adversely

impacted. Accordingly, your Directors submit that the above mentioned increase in the overall limit of managerial

remuneration and the limit of remuneration payable to Mr. Ramachandran V have been proposed mainly to facilitate

Mr. Ramachandran V, to exercise the options vested to him pursuant to the grant made in the years 2013 and 2016

which, if not exercised are due to lapse in the coming financial years and not with a view to make any undue

remuneration to the managerial personnel during this time of crisis. No additional funds other than what have been

approved by your Directors and set out under item no. 4 of this Statement will be paid to Mr. Ramachandran V.

Your Directors recommend the Ordinary and Special Resolutions at item nos. 9 and 10 of the Notice of AGM

respectively to the Members for their approval.

Other than Mr. Ramachandran V, Director and his relatives, no other Director and Key Managerial Personnel of

the Company including their relatives are interested or concerned, financially or otherwise, in the resolutions set

out at item nos.9 and 10 of the accompanying notice.

Dear shareholDers,

The age-old adage ‘When the going gets tough, the

tough get going’ could never find a better proponent

than our very own company. In the face of adversity,

being challenged by a protracted economic slowdown and

an unprecedent storm of a pandemic, we at V-Guard have

braced and fortified ourselves, and placed ourselves at

a vantage point from where we can not only identify the

opportunities but have also positioned ourselves to make

good on them. Thereby creating our very own mantra

‘Rising with Resilience’.

All of our business moves are underpinned by financial

prudence: a strong balance sheet, net cash position,

and access to liquidity. This gives us the confidence and

ability to weather any storm.

As the economy re-opens, our internal response which

is based on three elements; safety protocols for our

people, and protective measures at manufacturing units

and better governance and oversight in the Company,

and it will combine with our external response which

includes working together with local, state, and national

authorities to ensure a cautious restoration of normalcy.

Built on the edifice of innovation and Excellence

With a clear vision and precise application, we have

built a strong foundation that has laid the path to build

a sustainable business. By being constantly attentive

to the ever-evolving consumer needs, we have always

endeavoured in creating products that not just enhance

the consumers experience but also their lifestyle. Armed

with best-in-class products with the right balance of

cost, quality and technology, we had embarked on a

transformational journey of excellence across the value

chain in the organization. And not just in manufacturing

but also with noteworthy initiatives like the Product

Lifecycle Management (PLM) Project which in turn will

also drive the R&D transformation. Its full implementation

will result in faster go-to-market, development and

production efficiency, better cost competitiveness and

greater sustainability.

a symbiotic relationship with society

Any good business organisation worth its salt will always

evaluate its success alongside the progress of the

society that it operates in. At V-Guard, we believe that

it is in giving that we shall receive, which is why our CSR

initiatives are planned around the communities and lives

that we touch, our sites, helping the underprivileged walk

towards a better life, and we shall continue on

this path. In the aftermath of the lockdown, these

initiatives become even more significant. Our focus will

continue on environmental sustainability as a major CSR

focus area.:

Note 52: Impact assessment of COVID-19

In March 2020, the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. Consequent to this, Government

of India declared a national lock down on March 24, 2020, which has impacted the business activities of the

Company. The spread of COVID-19 has severely impacted business operations around the globe including India.

As a result of the lockdown and consequent supply chain disruption, the sales volumes of the Company for the

month of March 2020 have been impacted. The Company has made a detailed assessment of its liquidity position

as at the date of approval of these standalone financial statements for the next one year and of the recoverability

and carrying values of its assets including Property, Plant and Equipment (including assets under construction),

Intangible assets, Trade receivables, Inventory and Investments as at the balance sheet date and has concluded

that there are no material adjustments required in the standalone financial statements. Management believes that

it has taken into account all the possible impact of known events and economic forecasts based on internal and

external sources of information arising from COVID-19 pandemic while making such assessment in the preparation

of the standalone financial statements. However, the impact assessment of COVID-19 is a continuing process given

the uncertainties associated with its nature and duration. The Company is monitoring the situation closely and is

resuming operations in a phased manner taking into account directives from the Government and will continue to

closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions and take actions as are appropriate based on

future economic conditions.
