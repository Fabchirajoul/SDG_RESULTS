Managing Director & CEO,

Mr. M.S. Unnikrishnan, his team and all

our employees for steering the company

through a challenging year. A big thank

you to all our employees and the entire

ecosystem for doing a commendable

job, working from home, working at our

manufacturing locations and sites, trying

to get our plants up and running along

with the highest priority of safety and

wellbeing. It’s not easy – we appreciate

your dedication and commitment. Our

gratitude to all our customers for their

understanding and continued support.

I would also like to express my sincere

appreciation to all my fellow Board

members for their time, dedication, and

prudent counsel.

It is time to bid adieu to our very own

M.S. Unnikrishnan, who retires on

31st August 2020 after tirelessly and

selflessly serving this organisation for

28 years. Unny (as he is fondly called)

Thermax Limited:

MANAGING DIRECTOR: Dear Shareholders,

Your company was headed for a record

revenue generation and improved

profitability, entering the last quarter of

FY2019-20, despite the slowing down of

international and domestic economies.

Right from early stages of the fourth

quarter, the effects of COVID-19 were

visible in all our relevant markets, with

customers delaying order conclusions

due to uncertainty and even pacing down

contract execution. With the contagion

reaching a pandemic proportion, the

Government of India, as well as those

of many other countries where we

have recognisable market presence,

imposed national lockdowns in quick

succession, leading to an abrupt halt in

economic activities. As a capital goods

manufacturer having a substantial

revenue recognition overhang towards

the last few weeks of a quarter, this

disruption has pulled down our revenue

and dented our profits and profitability.

With support from the Board, your

company’s management has taken

multiple initiatives, including work-from-

home, with the primary aim of protecting

life even at the cost of revenues. All

our manufacturing facilities in India

were closed down, while our overseas

factories continued operations, albeit

at 25-35 percent of their peak load. As

an input provider to essential services,

our three chemical factories were the

first to receive permission to restart

manufacturing, but at considerably

scaled-down levels of production.

Our engineering manufacturing

facilities received permission to reopen

progressively from early May, with

stringent restrictions on personnel

deployment. We have conceived and

implemented a comprehensive compliant

operating system applicable for our

entire workforce, keeping in mind

that human safety deserves primacy

above output and productivity. Even

before the onset of the lockdowns,

your management formed thirty task

forces, led by our promising talent, for

cost reduction in every part of our value

chain. To support our customers at a time

when travel freeze was underway, we

have resorted to remote diagnosis and

service support using IIoT platform. Our

team’s ingenuity and innovative spirit

has also enabled remote commissioning

of large capacity boilers at multiple

project sites.

With a severe liquidity crisis and non-

availability of labour - predominantly

migrant - our MSME-oriented supply

chain is expected to take at least a few

more quarters to regain normalcy, which

may be disrupted intermittently by bouts

of lockdowns. Majority of our customers

have resumed their operations, though

at lower levels of capacity utilisation,

enabling us to continue with project

execution as well as accrue revenue

from our Operation & Maintenance

contracts. Even under these challenging

scenarios, order conclusions in sectors

like pharmaceuticals, food processing,

FMCG, agro-processing and rubber

etc., strengthen our belief that the

consumption will progressively return

to original scale and expansions will

follow thereafter.

The capacity enhancement programmes

of our company continued during the

year. I am happy to share that our

modern manufacturing facility for

absorption chillers at Sri City, Andhra

Pradesh, has attained stability with

the establishment of local vendor base

and geared to meet global demand.

This highly automated facility based

on advanced Manufacturing Execution

System (MES) is enabling the production

of zero-defect chillers. With the

curtailment of the project business

line at Boilerworks, Denmark, focus on

profitable service business combined

with shifting of a substantial part of the

manufacturing activities to Poland, the

Danstoker group is well poised to turn

around its operations into profitability

in the year ahead. Our Indonesia facility

has progressed well, both in improving

operations as well as local customer

acquisitions. Our ramped up export

oriented chemical facility at Dahej,

Gujarat helped your company generate

higher revenue for this segment with a

major improvement in profit margins.

The year also witnessed the completion

Managing Director and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer as the

chief operating decision maker of the Company.

v.

Contingent liability

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made where there is a possible obligation that arises from past events and

the existence of which will be conﬁrmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future

events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from the past events where

it is either not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of

the amount cannot be made.

w.

Earnings Per Share (EPS)

The Company presents the basic and diluted EPS data for its equity shares. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the

net proﬁt for the year attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of

equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed by adjusting the net proﬁt for the year

attributable to the equity shareholders and the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving

basic EPS for the effects of all the equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential

equity shares (which includes the various stock options granted to employees).

x.

Dividends

Dividend to equity shareholders is recognized as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by the

equity shareholders. Interim dividends that are declared by the Board of Directors without the need for equity

shareholders' approvals are recognized as a liability and deducted from shareholders' equity in the year in which

the dividends are declared by the Board of directors.

3.

Signiﬁcant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of the Company's standalone ﬁnancial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates

and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying

disclosures and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the reporting date. However, uncertainty about these

assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets

or liabilities affected in future periods.

3.1 Judgements

In the process of applying the Company's accounting policies, management has made the following judgments,

which have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized in the standalone ﬁnancial statements:

i.

Revenue from contracts with customers

A signiﬁcant portion of the Company’s business relates to EPC contracts which is accounted using cost-based

input method, recognizing revenue as the performance on the contract progresses. This requires

management to make judgement with respect to identifying contracts for which revenue need to be

recognised over a period of time, depending upon when the customer consumes the beneﬁt, when the control

is passed to customer, whether the asset created has an alternative use and whether the Company has right

to payment for performance completed till date, either contractually or legally. The input method requires

management to make signiﬁcant judgements of the extent of progress towards completion including

accounting of multiple contracts which need to be combined and considered as a single contract.

ii.

Legal contingencies

The Company has received various orders and notices from tax authorities in respect of direct taxes and

indirect taxes. The outcome of these matters may have a material effect on the ﬁnancial position, results of

operations or cash ﬂows. Management regularly analyzes current information about these matters and

provides provisions for probable losses including the estimate of legal expense to resolve such matters. In

making the decision regarding the need for loss provisions, management considers the degree of probability

Notes to the standalone ﬁnancial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020

(All amounts are in Rupees Crore, except per share data and unless stated otherwise):

Managing Director and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer to assess performance and allocate

resources. The management has determined that some of the segments exhibit similar economic

characteristics and meet other aggregation criteria and accordingly aggregated into three reportable

segments i.e. energy, environment and chemical.

iv.

Non-current assets held for disposal and discontinued operations

As part of organisational restructuring, the Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on

February 8, 2019, had approved the transfer of its Boiler & Heater (B&H) business to Thermax Babcock &

Wilcox Energy Solutions Private Limited (TBWES) on a going concern basis through slump sale. This was also

approved by the Shareholders on March 27, 2019. The B&H business was transferred to TBWES w.e.f.

October 01, 2019. Accordingly, the results of B&H business have been classiﬁed as discontinued operations

in the standalone ﬁnancial results in accordance with Ind AS 105 upto the date of such transfer. The

management considered the business to meet the criteria to be classiﬁed as held for distribution under Ind

AS 105.

For more details on discontinued operations, refer note 29

3.2 Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date,

that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within

the next ﬁnancial year, are described below. The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters

available when the standalone ﬁnancial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about

future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the

control of the Company. Such changes are reﬂected in the assumptions when they occur.

Estimation of uncertainties relating to the global health pandemic from

:

the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

The Company has considered the possible effects that may result from the pandemic relating to COVID-19 on the

carrying amounts of its assets such as investments, loans, receivables, unbilled revenues and inventories.

In developing the assumptions relating to the possible future uncertainties in the global economic conditions

because of this pandemic, the Company, as at the date of approval of these ﬁnancial statements has used

internal and external sources of information including credit reports and related information, economic forecasts

and consensus estimates from market sources on the expected future performance of the Company. The

Company has performed sensitivity analysis on the assumptions used and based on current estimates expects

the carrying amount of these assets will be recovered. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's ﬁnancial

statements may differ from that estimated as at the date of approval of these standalone ﬁnancial statements.

Gratuity

The Company operates a deﬁned beneﬁt plan viz. gratuity for its employees. Under the gratuity plan, every employee who has

completed at least speciﬁed years of service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days (minimum) of the last drawn salary for each

completed year of service. The scheme is funded with an insurance Company in the form of qualifying insurance policy. The fund has

formed a trust and it is governed by the Board of Trustees.

The fund is subject to risks such as asset volatility, changes in assets yields and asset liability mismatch risk. In managing the plan assets,

Board of Trustees reviews and manages these risks associated with the funded plan. Each year, the Board of Trustees reviews the level of

funding in the gratuity plan. Such a review includes asset-liability matching strategy and investment risk management policy (which

includes contributing to plans that invest in risk-averse markets). The Board of Trustees aim to keep annual contributions relatively

stable at a level such that no plan deﬁcits (based on valuation performed) will arise.

Managing Director’s statement, Business Responsibility Report and

Director’s Report including annexure to the Director’s Report of the Annual Report of the Group, but does not include the

consolidated Ind AS ﬁnancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated Ind AS ﬁnancial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any

form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS ﬁnancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information

and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated Ind AS ﬁnancial

statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we

have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that

fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated Ind AS

ﬁnancial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated ﬁnancial position,

consolidated ﬁnancial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash ﬂows and consolidated

statement of changes in equity of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including

the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) speciﬁed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible

for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of

the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate

accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and

maintenance of adequate internal ﬁnancial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and

completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated Ind AS ﬁnancial

statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have

been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated Ind AS ﬁnancial statements by the Directors of the Holding

Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated Ind AS ﬁnancial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the

Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters

related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the

Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the ﬁnancial

reporting process of the Group.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated Ind AS ﬁnancial statements as a whole are

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will

always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material

if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the

basis of these consolidated Ind AS ﬁnancial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism

throughout the audit. We also::

Contingent liability

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made where there is a possible obligation that arises from past events and

the existence of which will be conﬁrmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future

events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from the past events where it is

either not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the

amount cannot be made.

x.

Earnings Per Share (EPS)

The Group presents the basic and diluted EPS data for its equity shares. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the net

proﬁt for the year attributable to the equity shareholders of the Parent by the weighted average number of equity

shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed by adjusting the net proﬁt for the year attributable to

the equity shareholders and the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic EPS for

the effects of all the equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity

shares (which includes the various stock options granted to employees).

Managing Director and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer to assess performance and allocate

resources. The management has determined that some of the segments exhibit similar economic

characteristics and meet other aggregation criteria and accordingly aggregated into three reportable

segments i.e. energy, environment and chemical.

vi.

Segregation of lease and non-lease components of the consideration

The Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling

price basis by determining the stand-alone selling price at contract inception of the distinct good or service

underlying each performance obligation in the contract and allocates the transaction price in proportion to

those stand-alone selling prices. Since the consideration is inclusive of the lease component, the stand-alone

selling price is not directly observable. Hence, the Group estimates the standalone selling price by

considering all the information (including market conditions, entity-speciﬁc factors and information about

the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available to the Group.

3.2 Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date,

that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within

the next ﬁnancial year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters

available when the consolidated ﬁnancial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions

about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond

the control of the Group. Such changes are reﬂected in the assumptions when they occur.

Estimation of uncertainties relating to the global health pandemic from Corona virus Disease (COVID 19):

The Group has considered the possible effects that may result from the pandemic relating to COVID-19 on the

carrying amounts of its assets such as investments, loans, receivables, unbilled revenues, inventories, goodwill and

intangible assets. In developing the assumptions relating to the possible future uncertainties in the global

economic conditions because of this pandemic, the Group, as at the date of approval of these ﬁnancial statements

has used internal and external sources of information including credit reports and related information, economic

forecasts and consensus estimates from market sources on the expected future performance of the Group. The

Group has performed sensitivity analysis on the assumptions used and based on current estimates expects the

carrying amount of these assets will be recovered. The impact of COVID-19 on the Group's ﬁnancial statements

may differ from that estimated as at the date of approval of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

ordinary course of business, the amounts involved in such matters are currently not quantiﬁable. However, based on

managements assessment under Ind AS 37 "Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets" , that claims are not

tenable / probability of ﬁnal outcome against the Group is low and therefore not disclosed as contingent liabilities.
