Dear Shareholders

Fiscal year 2019-20 was a milestone

year for us at IRCTC. Our IPO received

spectacular

response

and

we

are

absolutely thrilled to share our very first

annual report after our successful listing at

BSE and NSE. One of the most successful

IPOs in over 20 months, it was subscribed

more than 112 times. We believe, our agile

and dynamic business model, our ability

to constantly innovate and expand our

operations played a crucial role to instil

faith and trust in our company, projecting

us as a reliable entity among the investor

community.

Trade conflicts and political uncertainties

resulted in significant economic volatility

and considerably affected global trade

and investor confidence in the last fiscal.

This, coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic

in early 2020, severely impacted growth

of the Indian as well as global economy.

The virus outbreak wreaked havoc

across the world as lives were lost and

job losses became rampant. Economic

activity too came to a complete halt due to

substantial disruptions to production and

supply chains around the world. In a post-

pandemic world, we continue to grapple

with the realities of a new world as threats

of a recession loom large over major

advanced and developing economies.

As travel restrictions became rampant,

the global travel and tourism industry

emerged as one of the worst hit sectors. In

difficult times such as this, what mattered

was our ability to rethink the future

together and take strides to achieve our

goals despite challenges.

While the world is embracing a ‘new

normal’, we at IRCTC have been working

relentlessly to resume operations. We

have adopted preventive measures to

follow safety protocols and have provided

adequate training to all our employees,

prioritizing their safety and well-being

while

ensuring

business

continuity.

Further, a detailed Standard Operating

Procedure (SOP) is being prepared with

a strong emphasis on automating manual

processes.

In a dynamic and fast-paced environment,

we recognize the need to be future-

ready and rely on advanced technology

to ensure smoother and seamless

operations. We have also adopted AI

(Artificial Intelligence) powered chatbots

to

redress

customer

grievances.

Further, we intend to introduce robotic

process automation to simplify repetitive

and complex processes like Invoice

Generation, MIS Reports (daily, weekly and

monthly) and PRS & Bank reconciliation.

To improve user experiences on our

website and mobile applications, we are

constantly improving the user interface.

Further, to check inadvertent booking of

Tatkal tickets, we plan to adopt Google

reCaptcha software. We also realize that

our digital infrastructure is constantly at risk

and have therefore, resorted to security

systems to protect our IT infrastructure

from Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)

attacks. Accordingly, on-premise DDOS

mitigation devices will be deployed in our

data centre to tackle cyber threats. Aimed

at increasing overall efficiency, reducing

errors and driving cost synergies, these

digital transformations are anticipated to

revamp IRCTC’s image and pave the way

for a future focused company.

During the year under review, our zest

to drive sustainable business growth

continued undettered. We remained

focused on strengthening our market

share across segments, driving innovation

and capitalizing on opportunities to deliver

differentiated services. We also launched

the first corporate train in FY 2019-20, the

first company to introduce this service on

the Indian Railways network.

To improve our catering & hospitality

business, we have planned strategic

interventions

that

are

designed

to

facilitate customer convenience. While

we

introduced

biodegradable

meal

trays to serve food in premium trains like

Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto and Tejas,

we have also inducted Train Hostesses

from recognised Air Hostess Institutes

to efficiently serve passengers. In an

endeavour to promote transparency in

our meal services, we have introduced

QR codes on meals boxes supplied from

IRCTC kitchens. It allows passengers to

obtain vital information pertaining to its

preparation, name of the kitchens and

links to live feeds from IRCTC’s base

kitchens. We have also upgraded the

infrastructure of 46 base kitchens to

enable live streaming of operations on

Rail Drishti and IRCTC web portal.

We launched the

first corporate

train in FY 2019-

20 making us the

first company

to do so in the

Indian Railways

network.
