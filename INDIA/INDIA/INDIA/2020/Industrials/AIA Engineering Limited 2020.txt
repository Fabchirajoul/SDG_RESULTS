Letter from: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

We are in the middle of the biggest crisis we have seen

in our lifetimes. The Covid-19 pandemic has created an

unprecedented socio-economic disruption and a tragic

loss of human lives. The exit path remains a vaccine

and untill then, it is likely to be a ride with a continuous

stop-start rhythm and strict health protocols.

At AIA, we are hopeful that like all other previous crisis,

this too shall pass. The testing times brought us all

together and gave the courage to face the challenges.

During the first phase of lockdown, we had shut down

our offices and facilities and quickly adapted the

‘Work from Home’ practice. We started operating our

manufacturing facilities post Government clearance

in the subsequent lockdowns. We ensured complete

safety of our people through adequate checks and

social distancing norms.

On the performance front, I am glad to state that

we are now running at 80% to 90% of our pre-Covid

capacity. We have steadily progressed towards

achieving our long-term goals. During the year, we

successfully completed our first SAG mill liners trial for

a large gold mine in Africa. The long-term optimism for

the mining, cement and power industries continue to

hold true even on this date. Going ahead, our strategic

priorities would involve increasing R&D focus to

further strengthen our total solutions capabilities.

Besides, our perspective towards regular operations

will now be highly directed towards improving

productivity, strengthening employee morale and their

preparedness to adapt with the evolving times.

With this note, I would like to thank all our stakeholders,

investors, customer, suppliers and Government/

Regulatory Bodies for being with us amidst tough

times. I also acknowledge the efforts of our team

members for their commitment and dedication. We

value the passion and enthusiasm they bring to their

work. We are committed to building an organization

that is sensitive, vibrant and geared towards building a

better tomorrow.

Best wishes,

Maintenance of Secretarial record is the responsibility of the management of the Company. Our responsibility is to express an

opinion on these secretarial records based on our audit.

2.

We have followed the audit practices and process as considered appropriate to obtain reasonable assurance about the

correctness of the contents of the Secretarial records. The verification as done on test basis is to reasonably ensure that

correct facts are reflected in secretarial records. We believe that the processes and practices, we followed provide a

reasonable basis for our opinion.

3.

In respect of Laws, Rules and Regulations other than those specifically mentioned in our report above, we have limited our

review, analysis and reporting up to process and system adopted by the Company for compliance with the same and have

not verified detailed compliance, submissions, reporting under such Laws etc. nor verified correctness and appropriateness

thereof including financial records and books of accounts of the Company.

4.

Wherever required, we have obtained the Management representation about the compliance of Laws, Rules and Regulations

and happening of events etc.

5.

The compliance of the provisions of Corporate and other applicable Laws, Rules, Regulations, Standards and its proper and

adequate presentation and submission in prescribed formats is the responsibility of management. Our examination was

limited to the verification of procedures on test basis and not its one to one contents.

6.

The Secretarial Audit report is neither an assurance as to compliance in totality or the future viability of the Company nor of

the efficacy or effectiveness with which the management has conducted the affairs of the Company.

7.

Considering the limitations prevailing on account of global pandemic COVID - 19 Lockdown and semi-lockdown situation, we

are not able to verify all the information physically as well as in detail, and, therefore, in respect of some of the matters, we have

relied up on the information and explanations as provided by the Company, its officers, agents and authorized representatives.

(i). Most of the issue of litigation pertaining to Central Excise/ Service tax / Income tax (including transfer pricing matters) are

based on interpretation of the respective law & rules thereunder. Management has been opined by its counsel that many of

the issues raised by revenue will not be sustainable in law as they are covered by judgements of respective judicial authorities

which supports its contention. Further, in several matters, the management has successfully defended their case at lower

forums of adjudication. Accordingly, the management do not envisage any material impact on the consolidated financial

statements of the Group.

(ii). Sales tax/Central Sales tax related litigation/demand primarily pertains to non submission of required declaration forms in

time due to non-receipt of the same from customers and / or some interpretation related issues. However in most of the

cases, required documents are being filed and given in minor impact if any, shall be the year of final outcome of respective

matter in appeal.

(iii). As on 31 March 2019, the Group carried an amount of INR 2,830.10 lakhs in its books as contingent liability that may occur in

the future as a result of pending indirect tax litigations between the tax authorities and respective Group companies. During

the year, the Holding Company has applied in Sabka Vishwas (Legacy Dispute Resolution) Scheme (SVLDRS) for full and final

settlement of indentified matters involving INR 2,523.04 lakhs. Accordingly, the Holding Company has paid INR 1,090.38 lakhs

(including earlier payments of INR 887 lakhs) towards various tax demands and has received discharge certificates amounting

to INR 1,090.38 lakhs. The said amount is shown as Excise expense in Note 39.

(iv). The proposed Social Security Code, 2019, when promulgated, would subsume labour laws including Employees’ Provident
