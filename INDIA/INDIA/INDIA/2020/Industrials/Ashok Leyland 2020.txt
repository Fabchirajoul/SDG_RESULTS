CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE

medium & heavy range alongside the introduction of innovative i Gen

BS VI emission technology. Both are individually major technical

challenges along with a mandated timeline to be met. It is, indeed, a

proud moment for the Company when the design, cost and time

targets were achieved indigenously and innovatively. In addition, we

are now ready with an in-house developed new LCV range and the

launch had to be deferred due to the COVID-19 crisis. The

introduction is expected to be a game changer just as DOST did,

further reinforcing our product range. Your Company is also making

inroads into the electric vehicle segment in buses locally here as well

as in the London market through the Optare range. We are moving

fast in the learning curve in this realm, keeping pace with global

trends and are poised for major strides soon.

As always, there have been new product introductions and upgrades

last year to freshen up the product lines. 10x4 Tipper, Sunshine LX

model for ICV School segment, 12m i EGR Bus for intercity segment

and 11m FE CNG for intracity segment were launched in M&HCV

segment evoking positive customer response. The ICV and MDV

range were strengthened with the addition of the New Guru 1010,

Boss 1616, Boss 1916, and the TF2312. The A.C. Midi Oyster bus

was successfully launched at Prawaas 2019.:

CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE

There were some recognitions:

Dost+ and Guru1010 respectively won the Pick-up of the Year,

and the Promising Debut of the Year awards.

Dost won Pickup of the Year and SCV of the Year at the ET

NOW Global Awards.

Best Employer of 2019 by AON.

At the 8th Manufacturing Today Awards, the CSR initiatives

were adjudged the "Winner in the award category - Excellence

in CSR" for the second consecutive year.

Winner of "Golden Peacock Award for Risk Management" in

the category of "Automotive" for the year 2019, second year

in a row.

In addition, the Ashok Leyland corporate office is the first office in

India and fourth in the world to receive LEED v4.1 Platinum

certification which is the benchmark for Green building.

Our CSR initiatives under the Road to School drive expanded the

coverage by introducing the breakfast scheme, brought out new

avenues of health, hygiene, nutrition and sports initiatives for the

children. We now cover 55,000 children up from 20,000 in the

previous year and have ambitious plans to scale up every year

widening the scope as well.

Looking ahead, our long-term outlook for the sector continues to

remain positive, with the current phase seen only as an aberration.

As the governmental measures to reactivate the commercial sector

are awaited, the management has taken the opportunity of the last

few months to re-examine the business and operating models

without any presumptions. Upon a clinical assessment of the short

term and long-term prospects, a series of initiatives have been set in

motion to reconfigure the Company aimed at sustainable growth

while minimising the adverse impact of economic cycles.

I strongly believe that now is the opportune time for Indian OEMs

like Ashok Leyland to move, without inhibition, and seek a global

position by showcasing our manufacturing prowess and

demonstrating the products of global standards of quality and

reliability. With AVTR and the upcoming LCV range, I would like to

mention with reasonable confidence that your Company is ready to

expand its presence in India and multiple overseas markets. Another

thrust area for the Company is Defence. Being one of the largest

providers of logistic vehicles to our armed forces, we will continue

to position mobility products and solutions in an accelerated

manner. We should be seeing the benefits of our plans and efforts

before long.

As you know, we have in our midst a new leader, Mr. Vipin Sondhi,

who joined us last year as the MD & CEO. He comes with a rich and

diversified experience in the Auto sector and I would like to

welcome him to the Ashok Leyland family and wish him well to

steer the Company to even greater heights.

In the travails of the past and in the new paradigm we are

envisaging for the future, our constant source of strength is the

indefatigable spirit of our employees and I would like to thank them

for their commitment, patience and hard work.

I would also like to thank our extended family of dealers, suppliers,

financial institutions, strategic partners, and customers for their

continuing faith in us.

Thank you,

Yours sincerely,

Dheeraj G Hinduja
