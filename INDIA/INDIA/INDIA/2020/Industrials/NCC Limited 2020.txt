Dear Shareholders,

FY20 has been a challenging year

for NCC Ltd. The year ended with a

global pandemic spreading the entire

world and India is one of the most

impacted.

Challenges and difficult times are not

new to NCC. In our over 40 years of

history we have gone through many

challenges yet we emerged stronger

year after year. We have proven risk

mitigating capabilities as we adhere

to continuous learning which is a

core element in our vision. We will

never deviate from our core values

which encompass trust and integrity.

We will continue to build the much

needed infrastructure facilities for the

holistic development of our nation.

I am delighted that during the year

NCC Management honored

Deendayal Research Institute with

“NCC Samashti Seva Puraskar”, for

their pioneering work in the field of

rural development. We also constructed

a skill development centre at

Antarvedipalem, East Godavari, Andhra

Pradesh for empowering people in

various skills from the nearby areas.

Going forward few more months are

expected to be difficult. I am sure we

all will exhibit the necessary survival

30th Annual General Meeting

Friday the 25th September, 2020

at 3.00 p.m. IST through Video

Conferencing (VC) / Other Audio

Visual Means (OAVM):

Dear Shareholders

This year my annual address on

behalf of the board of directors of

the company is at a very unusual

time. Covid 19 has caused unforeseen

damage to the lives of the people

and the economies of most of the

countries. With per capita income

contracting after the pandemic,

most countries are heading to an

economic downturn in 2020. World

Bank estimate in June 2020 points

to a 7% contraction in advanced

economies. That weakness is spilling

over to the emerging markets and

developing economies, where growth

is expected to contract by 4-5%

as they also cope with their own

domestic outbreaks of the virus.

The economic impact of the COVID-19

in India has been substantial and

broad-based. All indicators point to a

sharp decline in economic activity, as

reflected in the industrial production,

business sentiment, consumer

confidence and trade.

An analysis and data based prediction

on the exact point of inflection for

global economic recovery will not be

possible at this juncture, since the

spread of pandemic is not showing

any signs of flattening. Many

economists envisage a V-shaped

recovery from Q3 of CY2020 with

over $10 Trillion fiscal and monetary

stimulus which is likely to increase

further. However this expected

recovery, can be adversely impacted if

further lockdowns are imposed.

India announced a ` 20 Lakh crore

stimulus package for overcoming

the covid impact. The stimulus

package predominantly is a set of

financial packages for lowering the

Covid impact among businesses is a

mix of fiscal and monetary support

mostly routed through banks. This

impetus to ease financial pressure on

businesses and to sustain the liquidity

position is a strategically appropriate

step.

The government initiative to infuse

investments in infrastructure is going

Construction majors

like NCC are key

stakeholders in building

the nation.:

MANAGING DIRECTOR

THE NEED OF THE HOUR

At the outset let us all remind

ourselves that the relaxation of

lockdown is for getting on with our

lives and businesses but we need to

take the safety norms more seriously

with the number of Covid-19 cases

rising exponentially in our country.

Let us all stay safe and take a pledge

that we will do our best to break the

Covid-19 transmission chain.

At our corporate office, regional

offices and construction sites we

have taken all necessary precautions

to make our people and contract

workers safe.

ON KEY DRIVERS OF THE BUSINESS

India’s spend on infrastructure

development as a percentage of

GDP has been coming down since

2012. From a desirable level of 7-8%

of the GDP for infra-construction it

has come down to 5% in FY18 and

FY19. As cited by our chairman in

his: letter to the shareholders, the

slowdown in infra spend is due to

slowdown in economic growth,

issues in land acquisition and delay in

environmental and forest clearances.

Despite this slowdown in spending,

India continues to implement one of

the largest infrastructure programmes

in the world, with an estimated

infrastructure investment of about

$140 billion in FY19, and occupies

the second position in the developing

world both by the number of PPP

projects as well as the associated

investments.

In a major pro-active initiative, the

government drew up the NIP

(National Infrastructure Pipeline)

with an ambitious plan to invest

` 111 lakh Crores (about $1.5 trillion)

on infrastructure in the period up to

FY25, roughly planning to double

the annual infrastructure investment

compared to what has been achieved

in recent years. As per estimates in

the NIP Task Force Report, about 80%

of the required investment would

come from the Centre and the state

governments.

At NCC we have

sufficient operational

and financial capabilities

to sustain. We are

closely watching the

turnout of events and

will show the much

needed strategic

and operational

agility during these

difficult times.
