Effect of Amalgamation in the Financials

During the year under review, the Board of Directors had approved the Scheme of Amalgamation (‘Scheme’) of Cimmco

Limited (‘Cimmco’) and Titagarh Capital Private Limited (‘TCPL’) - two subsidiaries of the Company, with the Company. The

Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata Bench (‘NCLT’) by an order dated 30th September, 2020 (‘Order’) has

sanctioned the Scheme. The Appointed Date as per the Scheme being 1st April, 2019, the effect of amalgamation has been

considered in the books retrospectively (the ‘Effect’) and accordingly, the figures for the year ended 31st March, 2020 include

the results of the Company and its two erstwhile subsidiaries namely Cimmco and TCPL and further the figures for the

corresponding year ended 31st March, 2019 have been restated giving the effect from the beginning of the comparative

period in the financial statements, i.e. 1st April, 2018 as per the requirements of IND AS 103 as per the accounting treatment

specified in the Scheme.

The Scheme was approved by the respective Board of Directors on August 14, 2019 and after receipt of no-objection from the

Stock Exchanges it was filed with NCLT in January, 2020. Approval by the shareholders & creditors of the Company was

accorded at their respective meetings convened on April 29, 2020 pursuant to the direction of NCLT and although the petition

for confirmation of the Scheme was filed by the Company on May 11, 2020, after persistent follow up, the matter was listed by

NCLT for hearing on August 17, 2020 only and finally heard on September 07, 2020 when the order for sanctioning the

Scheme was reserved. The NCLT passed the final order dated September 30, 2020 sanctioning the Scheme. As per the

Scheme, the shareholders of Cimmco shall be entitled to 13 equity shares of Rs. 2/- each fully paid up for every 24 equity

shares of Rs. 10/- each fully paid held by them on a record date as may be determined, to be issued and allotted by TWL. No

consideration is payable in case of amalgamation of TCPL (wholly owned subsidiary) as the shares held by your Company

therein shall be cancelled. The Company had no option but to wait for the Order from NCLT to ensure that the financials are

reported after giving effect to the Scheme for the ultimate benefit of shareholders/stakeholders with regard to clarity thereof.:

Managing Director & Vice

Director's Report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's

report thereon.

8.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of

assurance conclusion thereon.

9.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and,

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed

and the reports of the other auditors as furnished to us (Refer paragraph 18 below), we conclude that there is a material

misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

10.

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial

statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated

financial performance and consolidated cash flows and changes in equity of the Group including its joint ventures in accordance

Key audit matter

Assessment of impairment of Property, Plant and

Equipment of the Holding Company

(Refer to Note 2.2 - "Property, Plant and Equipment", Refer

Note 2.33 - "Critical Estimates and Judgements - Estimation

of Expected Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment

and Intangible Assets", Note 3.1 - "Property, Plant and

Equipment")

Property, plant and equipment of the Holding Company

represents 39% of total assets on the standalone balance

sheet. If these were to be impaired, it would have a

significant impact on the reported loss and the balance sheet

position of the Company.

Impairment assessment requires judgements and estimates

towards future results of business including key

assumptions like discount rate, growth rate etc.

The carrying value of assets of the Holding Company is

considered to be a key audit matter as the amount involved

is significant and judgements inherent in impairment review.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our audit procedures in respect of the Holding Company

included the following:

•

Understanding and evaluating the design and operating

effectiveness of controls for identification and

assessment of any potential impairment, including

determining the carrying amount.

•

Assessed the appropriateness of the methodology

used in the impairment model, and the underlying

assumptions used such as future levels of operations,

discount rate etc and considered historical performance

vis-à-vis budgets. In doing this assessment, we have

involved auditors' experts, as appropriate.

•

Checked the mathematical accuracy of the impairment

model.

•

Performed sensitivity analysis and evaluated whether

any reasonably foreseeable change in assumptions

could lead to impairment of Property, Plant and

Equipment; and

•

Evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures made in

the consolidated financial statements.

Based on the above procedures performed, we noted that

the Holding Company's assessment of impairment of

property, plant and equipment is reasonable.:
