Dear Shareholders,

At the outset, let me wish you all a healthy year and let’s hope that

before the year 2020 ends, the world gets rid of the devastating

pandemic.

Overall, the year 2019-20 was a challenging year across the globe.

Though Indian economy had begun to regain momentum towards

the end of quarter 3 of 2019-20, a country-wide lockdown since late

March, 2020 due to outbreak of COVID – 19 impacted the Indian

Economy. The COVID-19 pandemic saw the world grappling with

its widespread impact on the economy. Businesses across sectors

and geographies were disrupted due to mobility suspension. In

this challenging environment, Blue Dart worked closely with the

coronavirus task force of its parent company, Deutsche Post DHL, to

minimise potential impacts and risks to the business. The task force

provided vital updates and necessary information which helped in

planning, communicating and engaging effectively with the customers

and employees on precautionary measures and permissible guidelines

to operate across geographies during the lockdown.

The nation went into a Lockdown that impacted the economy and

disrupted the supply- chain. It is estimated that the economy in Apr

– June quarter is expected to contract by 40 – 45 %. Our business

from sectors such as BFSI, e-commerce, Automotive was impacted,

in other sectors like Pharmaceuticals, Medical Equipments, Consumer

Electronics, we did well.

Your Company drives market leadership through its motivated people,

dedicated air and ground capacity, cutting-edge technology, wide range

of innovative, vertical specific products and value-added services

to deliver unmatched standards of service quality to its customers

through strong operational execution. Guided by these principles the

“Blue Dart Way”, led us to maintain our market leadership position in

the industry.

In these challenging circumstances, the entire team of 12,000+

employees are working together “As One” and making daily incremental

improvements within the company, its policies and procedures. This

winning culture continues to positively transform your organization in

innumerable ways.

Despite such a challenging scenario, Income from operations for the

financial year ended March 31, 2020, stood at ` 3,16,639 Lakhs. Your

Company posted loss before tax of ` 4,720 Lakhs for the financial year

ended March 31, 2020 on account of exceptional items in respect of

implementation of Ind AS 116 related to Lease Accounting (` 6,662

lakhs), organization right sizing/restructuring (` 6,411 lakhs) and

adverse impact of Covid-19 (` 5,420 lakhs) aggregating to ` 18,493

lakhs. Your Company carried over 2,403 Lakhs domestic shipments

and over 8 Lakhs international shipments weighing more than 769,490

tons during the financial year ended March 31, 2020.

Considering overall performance for the current year, emerging

challenges consequent to COVID-19, uncertain economic environment

and with an objective to conserve cash and ensure sufficient liquidity for

operations, your Directors do not recommend dividend for the financial

year ended March 31, 2020. Even as this Annual Report gets published,

the COVID-19 situation continues to be fluid and unpredictable. Over

the years, your Company has built a strong foundation and best-

in-class processes through ‘Business Contingency and Continuity

Planning’ (BCCP) ensuring business operations run seamlessly

during any unforeseen event. The emergency caused by coronavirus

highlights both the challenges and the importance of building a holistic

management process.

Your Company, enacted procedures to protect its employees,

customers and communities, as their safety is paramount. Blue Darters

utilized remote-work capabilities to stay connected and ensured to

keep the trade engine running. It was a proud moment to work with the

Indian Government and private healthcare companies, supporting the

company’s mission to ensure ‘continuity of the essential supply chain’

for the nation in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Blue Dart’s

dedicated six Boeing 757 freighters had been deployed to fly between

Indian cities supporting critical shipments of pharmaceuticals and

medical supplies. The efforts were acknowledged by the Government

authorities.

However, with COVID-19 accelerating, the growth of the national

economy will be impacted through reduced demand, and further

compounded by supply chain disruptions. India's gross domestic

product (GDP) growth during calendar 2020 has been revised to 2.5

per cent from an earlier estimate of 5.3 per cent, in the wake of the

lingering impact of the coronavirus pandemic and later, on May 8,
