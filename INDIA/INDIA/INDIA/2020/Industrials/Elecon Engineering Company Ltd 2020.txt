Managing Director

Gear Division has traditionally been a performer and the ﬁnancial year 2019-20 was

no exception. FY20 showed a considerable growth in infrastructure sector pushing

Gear business to a reasonable status through Steel, Cement and Thermal Power

sectors. Gear Division ended the ﬁscal with a comfortable order backlog giving

some breather for FY21 to start with.

Covid-19 heavily disrupted couple of months in Indian economic calendar. However,

it is not mammoth enough to jeopardize either fundamentals of Indian Economy or

the foundations of Elecon Gear Division.

Indian economy soon started showing its restlessness towards growth with

emerging new business and adequate cash from operation. Although early sign, but a distinct business growth is

already visible in the market place and again it’s the Iron & Steel Sector as well as Government spending pulling

the chariot.

Difﬁcult business time comes as the greatest lesson and Elecon has capitalized that with strong cost control

measures together with elevation in operational efﬁciencies. Quite a few internal projects are “ON” which are

poised to produce catchy results in short and medium term.

M M Nanda - Head Gear Division

Material Handling Equipment (MHE) division remained focussed on proﬁtable

products business, cost control and receivables management. Despite muted

industrial growth in certain segments of operations during the year and disruptions

caused by Covid-19 towards the end of ﬁscal year, the division had a healthy order

inﬂow.

We have noticed renewed government policy initiatives and thrust in the mining

sector, the Company hopes to beneﬁt from our well established product range in

this segment.

Improving execution capabilities and streamlining our work processes continue to

remain our thrust areas which will signiﬁcantly contribute to company’s growth in

the long-term. Organizational restructuring, cost optimization initiatives, improved receivables management and

timely completion of ongoing projects will surely help in enhancing overall shareholder value.
