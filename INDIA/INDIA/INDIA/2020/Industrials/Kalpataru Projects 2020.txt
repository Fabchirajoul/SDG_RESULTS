Note- The above table does not include liability on account of future interest obligation.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market

interest rates. The group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the group’s long-term debt

obligations with floating interest rates.

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis

For the year ended 31st March, 2020 and 31st March, 2019, a 100 basis point increase / decrease in interest rate on floating rate

liabilities would impact group's profit before tax by approximately 4.09 % and 2.71 % respectively.
