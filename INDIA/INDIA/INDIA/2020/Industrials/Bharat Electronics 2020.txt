available for the task

4.

It is planned to be done within next 6 months

5.

It is planned to be done within the next 1 year

6.

Any other reason (please specify):

letter issued by MDL on 23 March

2020 and inspection notes issued by the Inspection

authorities.

As the customer has not amended the provisions of

the contract relating to transfer of risk & rewards and

not accepted the billing by the Company, accounting

of the same under Bill and Hold is not correct and

is in contravention of Ind AS 115 requirement. The

Company has also not satisfied all the conditions of

the Accounting Policy No. 5(A) (iii) (b) relating to

Revenue (Performance Obligation at a point of time).

The conditions for the customer having obtained

control of the products have not been met, which is

a prerequisite in a Bill and Hold arrangement (Ind AS

115 Para B81).

Further, the clarification issued by ICAI (FAQ 28)

considering COVID pandemic on such sales states that

the control is not passed on to the customer if the

seller is paying for the cost of storage and insurance

on the goods during the period the goods are held

by it. It also states that in situations where control

is transferred only when the product is delivered to

the customer’s site, it would not be appropriate to

recognize revenue on the Bill and Hold basis.

In all the three contracts with MDL, the cost of

insurance and storage is borne by BEL till the goods

are delivered at the port of destination and the control

was not transferred since the goods were not delivered

to the customers’ site.

The Revenue of ` 140.36 crore has been recognised under the

criteria of “Performance obligation being satisfied at a Point

in Time”. The principal criteria specified in Para 38 (read with

Para 33) of Ind AS 115 for determination of the point in time

when performance obligation is satisfied is determination of

the time when the “Customer obtaining control of the Asset”.

Further as per Para 38(e) read with Para B81 to B83 of Ind

AS 115, customer acceptance of the item is a criteria for

determination of “Customer having obtained control”.

The customer has accepted these items after Inspection, (as

per contractual terms) and the items have been unconditionally

appropriated to the contract as on 31 March 2020. The relevant

items have been made as per customer specifications and on

unconditional appropriation to the contract the customer only

has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all

the remaining benefits of the Asset.

Since the item had been accepted by the customer but could

not be dispatched, due to pandemic situation (COVID-19),

the revenue was recognized on Bill and Hold basis based on

“Retention letters” issued by the customer for holding the

items till the pandemic situation improves. This is in line with

ICAI clarification that “where goods are ready but could not

be dispatched due to lockdown conditions imposed by the

government, revenue can be recognized if conditions of Bill

and Hold Criteria are met”.

In respect of the sale recognized, the criteria laid down in Para

B81 for “Bill and Hold Sales” has been satisfied as elaborated

below:

How met

The reason for bill-and-

hold arrangement must

be substantive.

Notes to Accounts

(` in Lakhs):

Letter of Credit established by the customer thereby reducing the credit risk.

In a few cases credit is extended to customers based on market conditions after assessing the solvency of the

customer and the necessary due diligence to determine credit worthiness. Advance payments are made against bank

guarantee which safeguards the credit risk associated with such payments. Impairment losses on financial assets

(representing mainly liquidated damages leviable for delayed deliveries and other disallowances) have been made

after factoring contractual terms, etc and other indicators.

The cash and cash equivalent with banks are in the form of short term deposits with maturity period of upto 1 year.

The Company has a well structured Risk Mitigation Policy whereby there are preset limits for each bank based on its

net worth and earning capacity which is reviewed on a periodic basis. The Company has not incurred any losses on

account of default from banks on deposits.

The credit risk in respect of other financial assets is negligible as they are mostly due from Government department / parties.

Loan of ` 1,653 (` 2,987) is outstanding [as on 31.03.2020] from BELOP [100% subsidiary company]. The subsidiary

company has been regular in repayment of its dues (Interest and Principal) and no credit risk is expected in terms of

repayment of the loan amount.

x) Capital Management

The Company’s Capital Management objective is to maintain a strong capital base to provide adequate returns to the

shareholders and ensure the ability of the company to continue as a going concern. The Company has a conservative

approach for raising capital through debt but reserves the right to leverage this alternative at an appropriate time to

fuel growth and maintain optimal capital structure.
