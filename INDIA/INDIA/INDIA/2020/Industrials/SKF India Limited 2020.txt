Letter to shareholders: Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board, I present to you SKF India’s Annual

Report that encapsulates our performance and journey, while

also giving you a glimpse of our near-term strategies. Despite

the year 2019-20 being marred by uncertainties and volatilities,

we continued working closely with our customers – helping them

mitigate all the ambiguities around their rotating equipment.

During the year, we launched new and timely business models,

creating more room for ‘Digitalization’ than ever before. We

navigated through the challenging situation with our prompt

and decisive actions while constantly delivering value for all our

stakeholders.

SKF Stronger

This year’s Annual Report theme ‘SKF Stronger’, captures our

inherent strength and strategic objectives that add to our agility.

We believe, growth is only powered by a sound strategy in

motion. Our ‘SKF 2025’ strategy revolves around six focus areas

– Digitalization, New business models, Innovation, World-class

manufacturing, Cleantech, and Future workforce.

SKF considers sustainability as one of its key pillars of

propositions. By reducing friction and enabling reliable

rotation, our products help customers increase efficiencies and

productivity. Through Rotating Equipment Performance (REP)

and remanufacturing, we assist our customers to transition

towards a circular economy, while also reducing the carbon

footprint from both SKF’s factories and supply chain.

The year was further highlighted by our acquisition of RecondOil,

in alignment to our strategic objectives. It develops chemical

filtration and rejuvenation processes for industrial lubrication oil.

Performance

Amidst a difficult industry environment, 2019-20 was another

year of focused execution and operational responsiveness. Sales

were recorded at `27,959 million, as compared to `29,960

million in the previous year. Operating margins were recorded at

12.9% and profit after tax stood at `2,890 million, witnessing a

dip of 14% owing to muted economic and manufacturing activity.

However, I am pleased to inform that the Board of
