Dear Shareholders,

I hope you and your families

are keeping safe during these

challenging times. We hope that

this situation normalizes soon,

and we all come out stronger.

The FY 2019-20 turned out to be a

difficult year for businesses across

sectors as the year was fraught with

many challenges for the global as

well domestic economy. For the

first time in more than a decade,

the Indian economy recorded a

sub-5% growth. The infrastructure

sector saw project delays for a

multitude of reasons during the

year and further the outbreak of

COVID-19 has created disruptions

in our day to day activities. Despite

these turbulent times, FY 2019-20

was yet another year where we rose

above the challenges and recorded

profitable growth.

INFRASTRUCTURE – INDIA’S

CORE

During the year, tendering and

awarding of projects of NHAI

has been subdued, due to lower

government spending, delays

in land acquisition and delays in

granting of appointment dates.

Furthermore, the ordering activity

during the end of the year had

come to a halt on account of the

nationwide lockdown due to the

outbreak of COVID-19.

The Central Government has

implemented several measures in

order to improve support for the

infrastructure sector and provided

relief in view of the prevailing

situation, such as enabling three

to six months’ extension of the

project period in existing contracts,

releasing due payments within

the stipulated timeframe, releasing

pro rata bank guarantees till

the project work is completed,

allowing moratorium period for

the repayment of loans and

deferment of interest payments

and reduction in interest rates,

among others.

Road infrastructure has always

been a key economic priority and

will continue to be so in a post

COVID world to ensure progress

and revive India’s growth phase. To

give further benefits and encourage

construction, the Government

has introduced several initiatives,

such as the National Infrastructure

Pipeline, an investment plan with an

outlay of H111 Lakh Crores, of which

road sector constitutes around

H20 Lakh Crores, the Bharatmala

Pariyojana Phase 1 with an outlay

of H5 Lakh Crores that will bridge

critical infrastructure gaps and

boost highway development,

among others. These initiatives are

expected to significantly increase

awarding activity in the months to

follow.

OUR PERFORMANCE – FY20

At no time in our recent past was

the effectiveness of our long-term

approach more visible than during

the year under review. Amidst a

turbulent economic environment,

we reported revenue of H21,961

million in FY20, a growth of 9.3%

over the previous year. I’d like to

mention here that we had initially

provided a guidance of H25,000

million for this financial year,

however, we fell short of achieving

this target due to the following

reasons – an extended monsoon

season which caused delays at

project sites, the Supreme Court

ban on construction activities in

the Delhi – National Capital Region,

and lastly the lockdown disruptions

We would like

to see the year

under review as a

watershed in our

existence, as it

helped us realise

the true potential

of a good team.

Managing Director of the Company has been identified as CODM and he assesses

the financial performance and position of the Company, and makes strategic decisions. Refer note 39 for segment

information.

(e) Foreign currency translation

(i) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the standalone financial statements of the entity are measured using the currency of the

primary economic environment in which the entity operates (`the functional currency’). The standalone

financial statements are presented in Indian rupee, which is Companies functional and presentation currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates

of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and

from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange

rates are generally recognized in profit or loss.

(f) Revenue recognition

The Company derives revenue principally from following streams:

•

Construction contracts

•

Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)

•

Sale of products (Revenue from sale of processed aggregates)

(i) Construction contracts

The Company recognises revenue from engineering, procurement and construction contracts (‘EPC’) over the

period of time, as performance obligations are satisfied over time due to continuous transfer of control to the

customer. EPC contracts are generally accounted for as a single performance obligation as it involves complex

integration of goods and services.

The performance obligations are satisfied over time as the work progresses. The Company recognises revenue

using input method (i.e percentage-of-completion method), based primarily on contract cost incurred to date

compared to total estimated contract costs. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recognised

in the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level. If the consideration in the contract

includes price variation clause or there are amendments in contracts, the Company estimates the amount of

consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for work performed.

Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the performance obligations, the estimation

of total revenue and cost of completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment.

Variability in the transaction price arises primarily due to liquidated damages, price variation clauses, changes

in scope, incentives, if any. The Company considers its experience with similar transactions and expectations

regarding the contract in estimating the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled and

determining whether the estimated variable consideration should be constrained. The Company includes

estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative

revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

The estimates of variable consideration are based largely on an assessment of anticipated performance and all

information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available.:

managing director who is identified as the chief operating decision maker of the Company, examines

the performance of the business and allocates funds on the basis of a single reportable segment i.e. 'EPC business'.

The Company has no other reportable segment. The Company does not have any reportable geographical segment as

it caters to the needs of only the domestic market.

Accordingly, the segment revenue, segment results, total carrying amount of segment assets and segment liability,

total cost incurred to acquire segment assets and total amount of charge for depreciation during the period, is as

reflected in the Financial Statements as of and for the financial year ended March 31, 2020.

Non-current assets excluding financial assets, deferred tax assets amounts to Rs. 4,989.75 Millions ( March 31, 2019 Rs.

4,837.50 Millions ) are located entirely in India.

Information relating to major customers

Revenue of approximately Rs. 11,700.32 Millions (for the year ended March 31, 2019 - Rs. 13,088.33 Millions ) was

derived from external customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of the total revenue.

Managing Director of the Holding Company has been identified as CODM and he

assesses the financial performance and position of the Holding Company, and makes strategic decisions. Refer

Note 39 for segment information presented..

(e) Foreign currency translation

(i) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group are measured using the currency of the

primary economic environment in which the Group operates (`the functional currency’). The consolidated

financial statements are presented in Indian rupee, which is Group’s functional and presentation currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates

of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and

from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange

rates are generally recognized in profit or loss.

(f) Revenue recognition

The Group derives revenue principally from following streams

•

Construction contracts

•

Service concession arrangement

•

Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)

•

Sale of products (Revenue from sale of processed aggregates)

(i) Construction contracts

The Group recognises revenue from engineering, procurement and construction contracts (‘EPC’) over the

period of time, as performance obligations are satisfied over time due to continuous transfer of control to the

customer. EPC contracts are generally accounted for as a single performance obligation as it involves complex

integration of goods and services.

The performance obligations are satisfied over time as the work progresses. The Group recognises revenue

using input method (i.e percentage-of-completion method), based primarily on contract cost incurred to date

compared to total estimated contract costs. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recognised

in the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level. If the consideration in the contract

includes price variation clause or there are amendments in contracts, the Group estimates the amount of

consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for work performed.:

managing director who is identified as the chief operating decision maker of the Group,

examines the performance of the business and allocates funds on the basis of a single reportable segment i.e. ‘EPC

business’. The Group has no other reportable segment. The Group does not have any reportable geographical segment

as it caters to the needs of only the domestic market.

Accordingly, the segment revenue, segment results, total carrying amount of segment assets and segment liability,

total cost incurred to acquire segment assets and total amount of charge for depreciation during the period, is as

reflected in the Financial Statements as of and for the financial year ended March 31, 2020.

Non-current assets excluding financial assets, deferred tax assets amounts to Rs. 5,040.22 Millions ( March 31, 2019 Rs.

4,837.50 Millions ) which are located entirely in India.

Information relating to major customers

Revenue of approximately Rs. 16,963.30 Millions (for the year ended March 31, 2019 - Rs. 13,088.33 Millions ) was

derived from external customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of the total revenue.:
