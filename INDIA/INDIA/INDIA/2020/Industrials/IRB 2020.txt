About IRB Infrastructure

Developers Limited (IRB)

IRB is one of India’s

leading infrastructure

development companies

specialising in roads

and highways in the

Build-Operate-Transfer

(BOT) space. Over the

years, the Company has

established a strong

track record of delivering

large, technically complex

projects across India,

on difficult terrains and

in a tough industry

environment.:

Message from the Chairman

Rising through

challenges: Dear Stakeholders,

At the end of a challenging and volatile financial year, I am

filled with a sense of immense pride and satisfaction to share

that IRB has emerged stronger than before. Even as the

market remained difficult and new opportunities were scarce,

our focus was on implementing solutions to create value

while enhancing growth for the business.

Performance review FY 2019-20

FY20 was a milestone year for your Company, marked by two

significant accomplishments:

1.

We joined hands with one of the largest Global

Sovereign Funds, GIC (Government of Singapore

Sovereign Fund) to launch a Private Infrastructure Trust

(IRB Infrastructure Trust) with 51:49 ownership between

IRB and GIC Affiliates.

2.

Secured the largest and one of the most prestigious

TOTs in India – Mumbai Pune Expressway project, for

a fee of ` 8,262 Crores to be paid in four instalments

till March 2023 for concession tenure of 10 years

and two months.

Private InvIT transaction

This transaction involves GIC Affiliates committing ~` 4,400

Crores for 49% stake in the Trust with ownership of 9 BOT

assets (transferred from IRB) and incrementally exploring

future opportunities together. Out of the first tranche of

` 3,750 Crores investment, ` 3,000 Crores has been used to

part deleverage the 9 SPVs, while the balance is earmarked

towards equity contribution for under construction projects.

With lower debt to be serviced, the portfolio becomes

cashflow positive and self-sustainable, even during the initial

years of concession. Accordingly, financial liabilities for IRB

are now limited to its wholly owned projects and businesses

– and you would find that we are moving to partial

consolidation of our business segments to reflect the same.

As a result, your Company now has an encouraging net D:E

of 0.76x and is poised for taking up growth opportunities

with a bigger appetite as well as stronger balance sheet.

Following these developments, India Ratings has re-affirmed

the Credit Rating of A+ for the Company.

Mumbai-Pune Expressway TOT

Winning country’s largest road TOT concession for the

second time in a row has been nothing less than a roaring

success of our efforts and strategy. A lighter balance sheet

with reduced debt on books, enabled the necessary

headroom for us to take up the commitment of a large fee of

` 8,262 Crores for this concession. Given the merits of this

project, driven by it being only road connectivity between

the twin cities of Mumbai and Pune, we expect a promising

equity IRR from the project. We have experienced the same

while managing this project for 15 years earlier as well.

During the year, we also achieved Provisional Commercial

Operation Date (PCOD) for Karwar Kundapura project; with

this, all projects in our BOT portfolio are now tolling, including

5 of our 4 to 6 laning projects – that are under various

stages of construction. Around the end of February 2020,

we were relishing the business momentum of the Private

InvIT transaction closure, Mumbai-Pune concession win,

strong pick-up in traffic registering a comfortable double-digit

y-o-y growth in collections, when the world was hit by the

unprecedented pandemic - COVID-19. The month of March
