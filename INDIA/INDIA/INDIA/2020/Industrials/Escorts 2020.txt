letter of credit from customers where

credit risk is high and taking insurance cover for receivables. The Company closely monitors the credit-worthiness of the

debtors through internal systems that are configured to define credit limits of customers, thereby, limiting the credit risk

to pre-calculated amounts. In case of trade receivables, default is considered to have occurred when amounts receivable

become one year past due.

Other financial assets measured at amortised cost

Other financial assets measured at amortised cost includes loans and advances to employees, security deposits and

others. Credit risk related to these other financial assets is managed by monitoring the recoverability of such amounts

continuously, while at the same time internal control system are in place ensure the amounts are within defined limits.

b)

Expected credit losses for financial assets

i)

Financial assets (other than trade receivables)

Company provides for expected credit losses on loans and advances other than trade receivables by assessing individual

financial instruments for expectation of any credit losses.

• For cash & cash equivalents and other bank balances - Since the Company deals with only high-rated banks and

financial institutions, credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances and bank deposits is

evaluated as very low.

• For loans comprising security deposits paid - Credit risk is considered low because the Company is in possession of

the underlying asset.

• For other financial assets - Credit risk is evaluated based on Company’s knowledge of the credit worthiness of those

parties and loss allowance is measured. Since this category includes loans and receivables of varied natures and

purpose, there is no trend that the Company can draw to apply consistently to entire population. For such financial

assets, the Company’s policy is to provide for 12 month expected credit losses upon initial recognition and provide for

lifetime expected credit losses upon significant increase in credit risk. The Company does not have any expected loss

based impairment recognised on such assets.

ii)

Expected credit loss for trade receivables under simplified approach

The Company recognises lifetime expected credit losses on trade receivables using a simplified approach, wherein

Company has defined percentage of provision by analysing historical trend of default (net of any recoveries from the

insurance companies) relevant to each business segment based on the criteria defined above and such provision

percentage determined have been considered to recognise life time expected credit losses on trade receivables (other

than those where default criteria are met in which case the full expected loss against the amount recoverable is provided

for). Trade receivables amounting to ` 56.80 crores (31 March 2019: 87.27 crores) are secured by way of security

deposits from customer and: letter of credit issued by banks. The letter of credit are issued by reputable banks and their

credit risk is assessed to be low.

letter of credit from customers where

credit risk is high and taking insurance cover for receivables. The Group closely monitors the credit-worthiness of the

debtors through internal systems that are configured to define credit limits of customers, thereby, limiting the credit risk

to pre-calculated amounts. In case of trade receivables, default is considered to have occurred when amounts receivable

become one year past due.

Other financial assets measured at amortised cost

Other financial assets measured at amortised cost includes loans and advances to employees, security deposits and

others. Credit risk related to these other financial assets is managed by monitoring the recoverability of such amounts

continuously, while at the same time internal control system are in place ensure the amounts are within defined limits.

b)

Expected credit losses for financial assets

i)

Financial assets (other than trade receivables)

Group provides for expected credit losses on loans and advances other than trade receivables by assessing individual

financial instruments for expectation of any credit losses.

- For cash & cash equivalents and other bank balances - Since the Group deals with only high-rated banks and

financial institutions, credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances and bank deposits is

evaluated as very low.

- For loans comprising security deposits paid - Credit risk is considered low because the Group is in possession of the

underlying asset.

- For other financial assets - Credit risk is evaluated based on Group knowledge of the credit worthiness of those parties

and loss allowance is measured. Since this category includes loans and receivables of varied natures and purpose,

there is no trend that the Company can draw to apply consistently to entire population. For such financial assets, the

Group policy is to provide for 12 month expected credit losses upon initial recognition and provide for lifetime expected

credit losses upon significant increase in credit risk. The Group does not have any expected loss based impairment

recognised on such assets”

ii)

Expected credit loss for trade receivables under simplified approach

The Group recognizes lifetime expected credit losses on trade receivables using a simplified approach, wherein Group

has defined percentage of provision by analyzing historical trend of default (net of any recoveries from the insurance

companies) relevant to each business segment based on the criteria defined above and such provision percentage

determined have been considered to recognize life time expected credit losses on trade receivables (other than those

where default criteria are met in which case the full expected loss against the amount recoverable is provided for). Trade

receivables amounting to ` 56.80 crores (31 Mar 2019 : ` 101.04 crores) are secured by way of security deposits from

customer and: letter of credit issued by banks. The letter of credit are issued by reputable banks and their credit risk is

assessed to be low.

FY 2019-20). At a time

when the world grapples with several uncertainties, we are among those who have realized that

ushering in sustainability as a culture is now more critical than ever. While ideas that promote shared

prosperity have always been a part of our fabric, we are now embarking upon a well-defined

sustainability journey with clear goals for the future. The publication of this report serves as an

important first step.

farmers, who toil for hours on farms across

the country to ensure national food security; railway passengers, who travel across the country with

their dreams and goals; user of our construction machinery and occupants of the building made then

after, who yearn for the familiarity of their homes or offices each day. But as we keep evolving, we

seek to formalize our approach and monitor our actions closely to ensure that we create positive

impact on society and the environment through all our activities.

Escorts was founded seventy-five years ago, and ever since, we have managed to establish a niche

for ourselves in the markets we serve for instance, currently we hold a 11.6% share in the domestic

tractor industry and 40% market share in pick & carry cranes. The position we have built for ourselves
