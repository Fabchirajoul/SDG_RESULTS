Dear Shareholders,

I hope this: letter finds you and your

loved ones healthy and safe.

Although the COVID-19 crisis emerged

as FY 2019-20 was drawing to a

close, it has inevitably influenced my

reflections on the past year. The virus-

induced disruptions have compelled

businesses worldwide to rethink on

sustainable value creation. At Techno

Electric, responsible and purpose-led

decision-making has always been

key to crafting the future roadmap.

Now, more than ever, we rely on our

sense of purpose to guide critical and

decisive actions.

At Techno Electric, we share

the Government of India’s

determination to transform

the energy mix and build the

advanced electricity network this

country needs – illustrated by our

consistent endeavour to collaborate

with global manufacturers and

technology leaders and bring

the world’s best capabilities to

domestic shores.

I am proud of the way in which the Company has

risen to the task of supporting our customers and

the society at large during the pandemic. I express

my gratitude to all our people for helping us stay

agile, responsive and on track.

A year of resilient performance

Our financial performance in FY 2019-20 was

marginally weaker compared with the previous

year, which can be partly ascribed to a tough

macroeconomic environment and subdued

industrial activities. Capacity underutilisation of

thermal power plants, slow growth in the market

for renewable energy sources, and financial stress

at distribution companies weighed heavily. At a

consolidated level, our revenue from operations

for FY 2019-20 stood at ` 8,762 million, while

profit after tax was at ` 1,802 million.

Progress in the age of disruption

Mr. P. P. Gupta

Managing

distribution companies

Treating of: Letter of Comfort (undertaking)

issued by state-run firms such as Power

Finance Corporation (PFC), Rural Electrification

Corporation (REC) and Indian Renewable

Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA),

at par with bank guarantees to reduce

procedural delays for bidding in clean energy

projects

In addition, the government urged states to

implement smart meters across all households in

three years, giving consumers the right to choose

their power provider. It also advised utilities

operating thermal power plants to pay heed to the

National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).

Further, the government launched a pan-India

Real-Time Market (RTM) in electricity, to help

distribution companies manage their PPA portfolio

optimally and serve consumers with reliable supply

as any last-minute requirement of power can

easily be bought from the RTM. Other key reforms,

including the Atal Distribution System Improvement

Yojana (ADITYA), and the Electricity (Amendment)

Bill, 2020, are expected to address recurring issues,

promote higher participation of private players in

the generation, distribution and transmission of

electricity, and boost the commercial viability of

distribution companies.

Looking ahead

While the above augurs well for Techno Electric and

I am certain that we are fundamentally

well-placed for future, success is never a given. We

have to demonstrate continually that we have the

business acumen, skillset and capacity to translate

the emerging opportunities into long-term value for

our stakeholders. That we have the ability to, and an

appetite for, change.

We also have to make good on our social contract,

by operating our infrastructure responsibly, investing

in the transition to a greener and more sustainable

world, making a positive economic contribution, and

partnering the development of communities.

As I look around the Company, I am reassured that

we have what it takes to succeed in this age of

disruption. On behalf of the Board of Techno Electric,

I thank our shareholders, employees, partners,

clients, associates and various other stakeholders

for their support.

Warm regards,

P. P. Gupta

Removal of tariff cap on solar and wind power

auctions

In addition, the Union Budget 2020-21, tabled in

the Parliament in February 2020, encouraged state

governments to implement smart meters across

all households in three years, which will give the

consumers the right to choose their power provider

and allow DISCOMs mitigate power theft. The budget

outlay towards the power and renewable sector was

set at ` 22,000 crores. This includes an allocation of

` 4,500 crores for DDUGY, ` 5,300 crores for IPDS,

` 40 crores for smart grids, ` 33 crores for green

energy corridors and ` 110 crores for energy

conservation schemes, among others. The

government also stated that utilities operating

thermal power plants that are in violation of the

National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), will be

advised to close down and that land will be used

for alternative energy purposes. This will incentivise

the market for Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD)

plants, which help thermal power plants reduce

sulphur emissions.

In June 2020, the government’slaunched a pan-India

Real-Time Market (RTM) in electricity. The RTM will

help the DISCOMs manage their power purchase

portfolio optimally without needing to tie up excess

capacity. It will lead to cost optimisation of power

purchase and serve consumers with reliable supply

as any last-minute requirement of power can

easily be bought from the RTM. It will thus help

mitigate challenges to grid management due to the

intermittent and variable nature of renewable energy

generation and by extension, help integrate higher

quantum of renewable energy resources into the

grid. Overall, the RTM will result in a shorter bidding

time, faster scheduling, and defined processes

to enable the participants access resources

throughout the all-India grid promoting competition.

Other key reforms such as the UDAY 2.0 or the

Atal Distribution System Improvement Yojana

(ADITYA) and the Electricity (Amendment) Bill,

2020, are expected to address recurring issues,

promote higher participation of private players in

the generation, distribution and transmission of

electricity, and improve DISCOMs’ operational

and financial health.
