remuneration package of the industry.

measured against Company’s targets fixed in the beginning of the year.

Stock Options: In addition to normal/regular remuneration package, Employees Stock Option Schemes (“ESOS”) and Employees Stock

Appreciation Rights (ESAR) Plan (“ESARP”) are also in place for SMP and other employees of the Company, which are in compliance with the
