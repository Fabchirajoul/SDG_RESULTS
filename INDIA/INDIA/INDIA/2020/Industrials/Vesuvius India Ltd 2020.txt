In case the Company has failed to spend the two

shall provide the reasons for not spending the

amount in its Board report.

:

Vesuvius is committed to positively contribute to the future of the planet by

supporting education opportunities for children and youth, as well as those

coming from disadvantaged background and especially encouraging more

women into scientific / technical fields of education and extending support

in healthcare, hunger/ poverty eradication and their welfare and such

other activities covered under CSR Policy. These CSR initiatives should

be sustainable and with the long term purpose of improving the quality of

living for the less privileged and for increasing social assets. The Company

has progressively increased its CSR Spend during the year on education,

healthcare and welfare on existing CSR Projects and also added new projects

approved by the Committee. Due to the Covid situation, the Company could

not finalise and execute few of the projects falling within the Company’s

CSR Policy and hence total amount earmarked for the purpose could not be

spent. There are several new projects finalised and justifiable on the basis

of needs, sustainability and the capability of these projects to improve social

assets. The Company remains committed and is better prepared to meet its

obligations related with CSR spend during the next financial year 2021.
