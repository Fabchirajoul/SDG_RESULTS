Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present

before you the 39th annual

report of your company.

During FY 2019-20, the

global economy, as well

as the Indian economy,

were impacted by factors

which resulted in an

overall slowdown.

Your company’s markets

were also impacted

by these forces which

resulted in agricultural

distress, slow growth

of infrastructure and a

consequent impact on the

growth rate of the Pipes

and Fittings business.

These challenges have

only reinforced our intent,

vision and focus.

All of us are aware of

the magnitude of the

disruption caused by the

https://www.finolexpipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Results-Presentation.pdf

unforeseeable COVID-19

pandemic which has

swept across the world in

2020. The stark realities

and consequences are for

all to see and perceive.

In these circumstances,

your company has

worked tirelessly to

address the challenges.

We have learnt

from them, made

structural changes and

implemented the reforms

needed to succeed and

evolve your business.

Your company and its

dedicated workforce has

been quick to accept this

new reality and find ways

to reconcile the novel

constraints with their plans.

These plans are naturally

being monitored on a

regular basis to ensure a

progressive return to the

desired growth rates.

Innovative approaches

ensured the absolute

safety of the workforce. In

addition, we placed the

utmost importance on

staying and remaining

connected, informed

and motivated. I thank

everyone for facing these

obstacles united as one

family always. I am happy

to inform you that our

operations are accelerating

towards our targets faster

than projected.

The safety of your

personnel and the

stakeholders’ interests

remained and will

continue to remain this

company’s imperative

guiding principle.

Customers are the very

reason for our existence.

Your company worked

diligently to ensure that

its policies and strategies

continue to place our

customers interests at

the heart of our decision-

making process.

In life, as in business,

credibility is the only

viable currency. Therefore,

it gives me great pleasure

to inform you that your

company’s ongoing

efforts and actions have

resulted in a significant

increase in credibility

capital as reflected in the

swiftness of our return

to normality of business

Annual Report 2019-20

119:

Managing Director and Chief

Financial Officer have furnished a

compliance certificate to the Board of

Directors under Regulation 17(8) of the

SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure

Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

5) Policy

for

determining ‘material’

subsidiaries

Pursuant to Regulation 16 (1) (c) of

the SEBI (Listing Obligations and

Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,

2015, the Company has formulated

a policy on material subsidiaries. The

policy is available on the Company’s

website https://www.finolexpipes.com/

investors/policies-code-of-conduct/

6) Disclosure of commodity price risks

and commodity hedging activities

For the pipes and PVC industry, the

prices and costs are linked to and are

dependent on:

a. same underlying commodity (crude

oil) and

b. demand supply for each component

in the value chain.

Due to strong interdependence, any

major change in the price of one input

or output, affects the price of the rest

of the components in the value chain,

albeit with a short time lag. Due to this,

margins are only temporarily affected

whether positively or negatively, until the

price reaches an equilibrium. Generally,

over a period of time, the impact of this

price movement gets compensated,

and results in normal margins. The

commodity price movements are a

temporary risk which can result in

margin risk but do not pose a material

risk to financial health of the Company.

Hence, Company does not resort to any

commodity hedging. Further, though

hedges are available and actively traded

for underlying commodity (crude oil) but

the price of all inputs are not linearly

related to price of crude and hedges on

all inputs are not easily available.
