liability.

be accessible to the company. The fair value of an

asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions

that market participants would use when pricing the

asset or liability assuming that market participants

act in their economic best interest. The company

uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in

the circumstances and for which sufficient data are

available to measure fair value maximizing the use

of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use

of unobservable inputs.

2.22 Fair Value Measurement

Group measures financial instruments at fair value

at each reporting date. Fair value is the price that

would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer

a liability in an orderly transaction between market

participants at the measurement date. The fair value

measurement is based on the presumption that the

transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability

takes place either:

•

in the principal market for the asset or

liability, or

•

in the absence of a principal market, in the most

advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must

be accessible to the company. The fair value of an

asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions

that market participants would use when pricing the

asset or liability, assuming that market participants

act in their economic best interest. The company

uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in

the circumstances and for which sufficient data are

available to measure fair value, maximizing the use

of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use

of unobservable inputs.

flows and
