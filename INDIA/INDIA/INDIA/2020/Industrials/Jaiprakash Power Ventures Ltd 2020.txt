Date: 26th May, 2020

DECLARATION BY THE: MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO AS PER REGULATION 34 OF THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA (LISTING OBLIGATIONS AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS) REGULATIONS, 2015

I hereby confirm that the Members of Board of

letter dated 30.05.2018

has decided that such costs shall be considered for being

made pass through in tariff by Regulatory Commission in

accordance with the law.

•

To encourage increased purchase of Power, following

measures have been taken:

o

Power For All (PFA) initiative with States and UTs

for bringing uninterrupted supply of quality power

to each household, industry, commercial business,

small & medium enterprises, etc. In this respect,

the Govt of India has launched a scheme named

SAUBHAGYA – Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar

Yojana to provide last mile connectivity in rural and

urban areas.

o

Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) for

strengthening of sub-transmission and distribution

networks in the urban areas; Metering of distribution

transformers / feeders / consumers in the urban

areas and IT enablement of distribution sector.

o

Augmenting Transmission capacity to remove

transmission constraints.

o

Flexibility in utilization of domestic coal for reducing

the cost of power generation.

•

The Indian Railways also plans to introduce 16,000 km of

new lines, besides the doubling the existing lines of 6,900

km. This would be a key supply driver of coal in the next

decade.

•

Make in India: This initiative, which aims to boost

manufacturing’s share of GDP from 16% to 25% by

2022, would also lead to substantial growth in electricity

demand.

•

Reduction of aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C)

losses: Programs for reduction of AT&C losses like Ujwal

DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), Integrated Power

Development Scheme (IPDS) and Deendayal Upadhyaya

Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) have been implemented

by the Government. The target is to reduce AT&C losses

to about 13% by the year 2021–22 on an all-India basis,

which would lead to reduction in electricity demand.

•

Demand-side management (DSM), energy conservation

and efficiency improvement programmes: Programmes

for DSM, improvement of energy efficiency and energy

conservation measures like standards and labelling,

the Perform-Achieve-Trade (PAT) scheme in industries,

energy-efficient lighting solutions and the Super-Efficient

Equipment Programme would reduce power demand.
