Risk Management

The management and members of the Board review the business periodically to identify ongoing factors that affect the

business and also changes in external environment, which are likely to impact the Company. The management has

foreseen certain risks and took steps to mitigate the risks. The following are the key risks and the mitigation approach.

Cyclicality of the commercial vehicle industry - The demand for tippers is closely linked to overall industrial growth and is

vulnerable to cyclicality in the commercial vehicle industry. In addition to rationalizing the production capacities (as

already mentioned), the company is focusing on increasing the revenue from other businesses such as Railway wagons,

heavy fabrication for power plant, water tankers and load bodies for automotive vehicle used by defense.

Raw material costs – Steel accounts for major portion of the raw material costs. The company has centralized the steel

procurement function with the objective of leveraging the volumes to get better prices and is focusing on other cost

control measures.

Competition – The Company depends on tippers and other load body business from certain OEM customers. These OEMs

have developed more than one supplier to minimize their risk. There is risk of change in OEM policy of with reference to

suppliers. The company follows a policy of working closely with select OEMs to enhance its share of business. Further, the

company continues to focus on orders from certain dealers.

Irregular order flows from heavy fabrication business– The Company will get affected in case there are irregular order

flows from capital goods industries requiring heavy fabrication. However, the Company’s plant is fungible and can be used

for the manufacture of other products.

Increase in interest rate/cost: Any increase in interest rate will adversely affect the company. The company is exploring

ways and means to tighten its working capital in order lower working capital finance.

Delay in execution of orders:Delays in execution of orders (particularly orders obtained through competitive tenders) can

have a negative impact on profitability. The Company continues to monitor closely the execution of orders.

Performance at glance

During the last financial year 2018-19, debt restructuring along with change in ownership took place. With these positive changes,

the company started the activities with vigor.

The company re-registered the wagon manufacturing facility and was qualified for G-105Registration. With this, the Company has

given renewed focus to Railway Wagon business.

The total sales during the year were Rs 125.8 crores as compared to 215.8 crores for last year. The reduction is mainly attributable

to significant slowdown in commercial vehicle industry affecting the tipper orders from OEMs. This was partly compensated by

Railway Wagon shipment.
