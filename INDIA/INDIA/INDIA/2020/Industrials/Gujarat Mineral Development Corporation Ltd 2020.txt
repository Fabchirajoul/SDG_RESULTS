letter dated 27th December, 2012 due to non-compliance of some terms

and conditions of Naini Coal block allocation. The Company had discharged its liability of

1,625 Lakh

Ltd. Total provision for impairment made for advances to Naini Coal Company Ltd. amounts to

1,625

Lakh (2018-19:

1,625 Lakh).

The Company filed special civil application before the Hon'ble High court of Gujarat against arbitrary

the Hon'ble High court of Gujarat, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has cancelled all the coal blocks. Therefore,

of 1,625 Lakh only. The Hon'ble High court of Gujarat vide its judgement and order dated 31st July,2019

has rejected the relief sought by the Company for seeking refund of Bank Guarantee.

In view thereof the company has prefered civil suit before Ld. Small Cause Court, Ahmedabad for recovery

of 1,625 Lakh given as Bank Guarantee. The suit is subjudicial before the above court at Ahmedabad.
