LETTER FROM CHAIRMAN AND: MANAGING DIRECTOR

Dear Fellow shareholders,

Hope you and your family members are safe and healthy in this unprecedented times.

The 2020 started as a promising year on all fronts and we were on track to achieve the expected growth in our

performance. However, due to various external factors and spread of Covid-19 Pandemic in the last quarter, the

performance has been impacted. In this environment, I am writing this letter with a sense of pride by sharing the

economic and business outlook and consistent achievements of your Company.

As per report of IMF, the global economy grew at 2.9% during the year 2019, whereas the GDP in India grew at

4.2%. The global growth is projected at (–)4.9% in 2020, 1.9% points below the April 2020 World Economic

Outlook (WEO) forecast. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a more negative impact on activity in the first half of

2020 than anticipated and the recovery is projected to be more gradual than previously forecast.

In order to give a boost to the economic growth in the country, our Government has always been addressing the

issues through its policies and structural initiatives regularly. In this direction, some of the commendable steps are

integrating ‘Make in India’ with an ‘assemble for the world’ plan, Digital India, creation of Infrastructure, banking

reforms, Sagarmala Project, GST, merging of banks, IBC, agricultural reforms, promotion of MSMEs, policies for

Atmanirbhar Bharat, etc.

Year 2019-20 was yet another year of low growth rate of global economy, the geopolitical uncertainties and

environment of trade restrictions among major economies in the world coupled with COVID-19 in last quarter has

disrupted global supply chain. Due to widening gap in import and export and slow growth of import, logistics

services for EXIM trade has been impacted. In-spite of this kind of adverse environment, I am more than satisfied

with the performance of your Company as it has done well on all fronts.

Aatmnirbhar Bharat as a concept has been the objective of your Company ever since its inception, for which it has

created an eco-system in the logistics sector in the country thereby facilitating trade in both EXIM and domestic

sectors. In this direction, it has created a robust infrastructure in the field of logistics with a large network of

terminals across the country.

Indian Railways registered a marginal drop of 1.04% in originating loading of cargo from 1,223.17 million tonnes

in 2018-19 to 1,210.46 million tonnes in 2019-20. The originating containerized cargo transported by rail increased

from 60.14 million tonnes in 2018-19 to 61.22 million tonnes in 2019-20, reflecting an increase of 1.80%. The

containers handled at all ports of the country registered a growth of 6.76% from 15.41 million TEUs in 2018-19 to

16.45 million TEUs in 2019-20. In this challenging scenario faced by the trade, CONCOR has handled 3.75 million

TEUs and transported 40.43 million tonnes of cargo volume by rail in 2019-20, a marginal drop of 2.13% and

7.05%, respectively over the preceding year. There was marginal drop of 2.79% and increase of 1.54% in the

physical volumes of EXIM and domestic segments of businesses respectively. As a part of new initiative, the

Company had completed one full year of operations in Coastal Shipping in which it achieved 28186 TEUs of

volume. During the year, it achieved a gross turnover and net profit of Rs.6,754 crores and Rs.376 crores

respectively and the net worth of the Company was Rs.10,064 crores as on 31.03.2020. The profitability was

impacted mainly due to a one-time charge on account of provisioning for SEIS benefit and impairment of

investment in one of the subsidiary company.

During the year, around Rs.1,069 crores was spent toward capital expenditure mainly on development/expansion of

terminals, acquisition of wagons, handling equipments and IT Infrastructure, etc. The Company has further

strengthened its existing Terminal Network to provide efficient services to its customers. Phase wise

commissioning of three facilities / MMLPs at Mundra, Dahez (Gujrat) and Jajpur (Odisha) in FY 2020-21 are being

planned. In order to have a focused business approach towards First Mile and Last Mile (FMLM) connectivity,

another wholly owned subsidiary was incorporated in January, 2020 with the name of CONCOR Last Mile

Logistics Limited (CLMLL). This Company will tap huge potential in areas of providing seamless FMLM services,
