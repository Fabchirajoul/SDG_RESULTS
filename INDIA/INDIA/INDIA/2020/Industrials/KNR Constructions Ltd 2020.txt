Dear Shareholders,

As I pen down my thoughts for this year’s report,

I still see the world suffering from the outbreak of

the COVID-19 pandemic. While India was already

navigating through challenging macro-economic

environment, the emergence of pandemic in the

last few weeks of the ﬁ nancial year, made the

situation even worse. I heartily appreciate the

containment efforts of the Governments and

the untiring efforts of the health professionals to

manage the outbreak of such a large scale.

At KNR, we selflessly undertook a series of

measures to ensure safety and well-being of our

employees and communities. We also focussed

on conserving and augmenting our liquidity

position through cost rationalisation and avoiding

non-critical spends. Your Company’s continued

commitment to engineering excellence in

construction ushered in sustained growth in

construction segments such as Highways,

Irrigation and Flyovers.

Performance snapshot

Your Company clocked an annual standalone

revenue of ` 22,442 Mn as against ` 21,373

Mn, a growth of 5% on year-on-year basis. The

standalone net worth stood at ` 16,239 Mn

reflecting a good ﬁ nancial health of the Company.

of GDP. They are the backbone for economic

Annual Report 2019-20

Dear Shareholders,

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a huge toll on lives and

livelihoods across the world. On behalf of all of us at KNR, I

want to extend our sincere appreciation and gratitude to all

those who are in the frontline, working to keep us safe and

healthy. Our heartfelt sympathy to all who are battling the virus

or have someone close to them who is. While India managed

to control the speed of infection spread by imposing series of

lockdowns, it also ensured uninterrupted supply of essential

services.

The challenge of keeping the operations running was a

demanding task for us. The disruption by way of COVID-19

and the nationwide lockdown impacted the Company’s

construction activities at the project sites in the last week

of March 2020 and during April, May and June 2020 in the

ﬁ nancial year 2020-21. All possible steps are taken to protect

the workforce and to minimise the spread of the infection.

Our strategic principle of quoting projects with reasonable

EBITDA and avoid accumulating projects with sound

planning and timely execution has resulted in mitigating

risks and strengthen bottom line. The Government of India’s

massive push to the transport infrastructure, combined with

prestigious Bharatmala Pariyojana Scheme, Kaleswaram

Irrigation Projects and multi-level flyover projects, KNR is

perfectly poised to gain from these developments.

Projects review

Our present order book of ` 78,489 Mn includes four NHAI

HAM projects and one HAM project from KSHIP. The

construction work is progressing as per schedule in all the

four HAM projects and appointed day is awaited for one

NHAI HAM project. We successfully completed two BOT Toll

(NHAI) projects and two annuity (NHAI) projects. Our foray

into irrigation paid rich dividends as the Company bagged two

more projects in JV to the tune of ` 23,300 Mn.

Way forward

KNR continued to enjoy strong credit rating of AA- on account

of lower dependence on external borrowing, adequate working

capital cycle and ﬁ nancial risk remaining strong. With adequate

orders on hand, efﬁ cient and qualiﬁ ed manpower and large

fleet of modern construction equipment, the performance of

the Company is set to excel.

Before closing, I would like to thank our management team

and our employees for their hard work and contribution. I

would also like to acknowledge our Board Members for their

continuous mentoring and support. We will be delighted to

have your continuous faith on us while we move forward

towards building a strong and resilient organisation.

Best wishes,

K. Jalandhar Reddy
