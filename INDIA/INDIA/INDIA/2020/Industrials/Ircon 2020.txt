Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to present to you the

44th Annual Report of your Company.

I am proud to say that IRCON is on a steady

Growth path, and continues to perform above

the industry average in India. Since 1985, we have

actively worked towards becoming a diversified

infrastructure player, both in terms of sectoral and

geographical coverage. We have progressively

diversified into providing an entire gamut of

construction activities and infrastructure services.

We are a strong footed, that has achieved significant

milestones in executing challenging projects across

the world. So far, we have delivered over 128

projects in 25 countries across the globe and over

390 projects in India. As per the 2020 edition of

the USA’s Engineering New Record (ENR), IRCON is

the only Indian PSU to make it to the list of top 250

international contractors.

OUR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE

During FY2020, the Railway sector contributed

80.98% to our total revenue. Our primary focus

and strengths have consistently remained deeply

rooted in the railway sector. However, we are also

increased to approximately 18.32% as compared to

12.56% of the last year’s share and share of electrical,

continue to actively participate in new projects in

foreign countries, including our ongoing project in

Bangladesh, Algeria, Sri Lanka, Nepal & Myanmar. By

continuing to diversify our business and geographical

focus, we strive to secure a broader range of projects

to maximise business volume and profit margins.

secure project contracts in Thailand, Turkey, Ghana,

Mozambique, Rwanda, UAE, Malaysia, Oman, and

from individual projects to collaborated projects

in partnership by forming joint ventures with local

companies. We believe that this strategy will enable

us to generate revenue and profits on a sustained

basis.

SHRI SUNIL KUMAR CHAUDHARY,

Chairman and: Managing

Managing Director

Place: New Delhi

(DIN: 00515672):

Dear Shareholders,

At IRCON, we recognise that economic progress

comes with the development of the communities in

which we live and work. Our Company is a leading

infrastructure player in the industry with a proven

track record of delivering remarkable projects in

domestic as well as international markets. But what is

even success if it does not benefit society? Therefore,

since the very beginning, we have believed in sharing

a mutual goal with our communities.

IRCON’s CSR efforts emphasise on expanding

its reach to impact several lives in the country

while providing opportunities and improving the

standards of living. As a responsible Company, we

work with the larger society that we are a part

of. We encourage our people to become reliable

citizens and do their bit towards the betterment of

the community. I am humbled by the commitment of

our employees who go the extra mile to participate

and ensure the successful implementation of our CSR

activities. We have an efficient CSR & Sustainability

Committee that proactively frames various initiatives

in different fields of concern such as education,

cleanliness, sanitation, and employment, amongst

others. Furthermore, it monitors the implementation

and outcomes of all our activities. We have also

formed strategic partnerships with various non-profit

institutions in the country. It is because of these

organisations that IRCON can reach to the remotest

areas of India and shape the lives of those who are

unserved and underserved.

During FY2020, IRCON’s CSR arm has touched

the lives of hundreds of people through its many

initiatives. The unprecedented emergence of

a pandemic ‘COVID-19’ is a human tragedy that

has affected hundreds and thousands of people

while also posing a growing impact on the global

economy. Similar to other countries, India has also

geared up to combat with the pandemic through

proactive measures and supporting policies. In

the unifying spirit of participation, IRCON has also

contributed `4.50 crore during 2019-20 towards

the PM Cares Fund to support the relief efforts

against the coronavirus outbreak. In the year

2020-21 also, IRCON has contributed an additional

amount of `15.50 crore in PM CARES Fund.

Our 44-year history has taught us that being at the

forefront of change and driving improvement in

society is fundamental to the inclusive growth of

the business and economy. For us, CSR is not just

a statement but an integral part of our Company.

It makes me proud to be a part of an organisation

where people live and propagate such belief. I am

confident that IRCON will continue to work along

with the community to expand the reach of its

CSR efforts and impact as many lives as possible.

Regards,

Shri S. K. Chaudhary

started a new vertical in the country by taking

up 5 stations on Integrated Facility Management.

(for Bangalore), BVG (Bharat Vikas Group) (for

Pune) and UDR (Updater Services) (for Anand

engaged in the “management Contract” model

prevalent in the hotel industry, which IRSDC has

specially adapted for railway stations. IRSDC has

challenges are being faced on revenue front as

process. Presently due to COVID 19 pandemic,

Force Majeure clause of the EPC contract has

been evoked by IRSDC and the contractors have

been asked not to do any work at these three

stations and simultaneously land monetisation

tenders have been called on January 03, 2020.

Pre-bid meetings with prospective bidders have

also been done during this period. The land

monetisation bids will be opened in FY 2020-21,

once the market is favourable for real estate.
