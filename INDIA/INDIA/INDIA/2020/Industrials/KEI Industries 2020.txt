Letter From the Chairman-cum-: Managing

Letter from the

Chairman-cum-: Managing director

Dear ShareholDerS,

as I prepare this year’s letter, the world is tackling

an unprecedented crisis with the outbreak of the

coronavirus pandemic. In this unusually changed

landscape, we, at KeI, renew our commitment

towards partnering the vision of self-reliant India

and demonstrating business resilience. led by our

unflinching resolve to create better stakeholder

value, our focus will be on navigating this acute

phase of uncertainty while ensuring that we stay well-

positioned for growth acceleration once the world

recovers from the pandemic.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Reviewing the year gone by, I take great satisfaction

in reporting that your Company has delivered a robust

performance. The results are even more commendable

as they have been achieved against a tough operating

backdrop. India was already facing a protracted economic

slowdown even before the coronavirus pandemic took

us all by surprise. The nationwide lockdown in the last 10

days of March significantly dented our revenue collections,

particularly for our Retail segment as that is when a

significant part of the invoicing for the fourth quarter

takes place at the dealer level. Despite these challenges,

we generated ` 4,884 Crores in Net Sales in FY 2019-20

as against ` 4,227 Crores in the previous year, a growth of

15.5%. We also delivered strong margins with Profit After

Tax (PAT) growing by 40.3% to stand at ` 255 Crores, as

against ` 182 Crores in the previous year.

Another highlight of the year was that we successfully

raised ` 500 Crores through the Qualified Institutional

Placement (QIP) route. With this, our Company’s share

capital has increased from ` 15.9 Crores comprising 7.95

Crore equity shares to ` 17.9 Crores comprising 8.95 Crore

equity shares. The proceeds of the QIP have been utilized

for repayment or prepayment of debts, meeting working

capital requirements and general corporate purposes. This

has further strengthened our balance sheet and improved

our net cash position.

SEGMENT-WISE REVIEW

As mentioned earlier, our Retail segment was adversely

impacted by the CoVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown

that ensued. Dealer network sales in the fourth quarter

of FY 2019-20 was ` 321 Crores as compared to ` 405

Crores for the corresponding period in the previous year.

This lower than expected fourth quarter results made its

impact felt on our full-year retail sales which registered a

flat year-on-year growth. over the next few months, this

segment is likely to continue facing challenges with slower

offtake by the real estate sector and consumers deferring

non-essential purchases. To ensure that we can scale-up

our retail sales once the external situation improves, our

focus remains on growing our dealer network. We will also

continue to deepen our engagement with our channel

partners and influencers to widen our customer base.

The Institutional segment reported a solid performance

for the year under review. We have commenced

FY 2020-21 on a strong footing as well as we recently

bagged a landmark order for the execution and supply

EHV cables of 400kV. KEI is amongst the few international

players in the industry to manufacture and supply cables

of 400kV and this is the largest single order we have

received till date for 400kV cables. As the nation is trying to

emerge from the shadows of the CoVID-19 pandemic, the

Government is strongly pushing for a self-reliant economy

by promoting local manufacturing. With our world-class

capabilities in EHV cable manufacturing, we are proud and

determined to contribute to our nation’s vision. Further,

EHV cables are being increasingly used in underground

power transmission and hydropower projects due to its

inherent advantages of security and reliability. These

dynamics combined with the Government’s thrust on
