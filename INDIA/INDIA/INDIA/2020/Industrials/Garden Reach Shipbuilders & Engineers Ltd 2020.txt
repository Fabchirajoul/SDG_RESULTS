Goliath Crane Incident

The shipbuilding infrastructure at Main Works Unit of GRSE

was modernized and commissioned during 2013 at a cost of

`605.85 crore. The modernized facilities have enabled GRSE

to adopt the modern ‘Integrated Construction Methodology’

wherein large hull blocks could be constructed with

significant pre-outfitting at the hull fabrication stage.

On 17 Apr 2018, a ‘Near Cyclonic Storm’ hit Kolkata, and the

entire structure of the 250 Tonne Goliath Crane collapsed,

resulting in damage to the Module Hall, New Dry Dock,

Inclined Berth and a part of the Stores Complex located in

the Main Works Unit of the Shipyard. Based on assessment

of Insurance Surveyors, Insurance Company M/s Reliance

General Insurance Company Ltd. has settled the claim at

`112.69 crore, admitting a claim for `96.78 crore against

Book Value of Assets of `107.39 crore. Loss on Insurance

Claim for `10.61 crore has been booked in Statement of

Accounts under the head “Exceptional Items”.

The admitted claim amount of `112.69 crore has been

received from the Insurer in June 2020.

The damaged Module Hall was built from the funds

allocated by Indian Navy and this asset was not appearing

in Company Books. Your Company being custodian

of this asset, had taken insurance coverage for the same.

Surveyors had admitted a claim of `15.90 crore for the

damage to this asset out of total amount of settlement of

`112.68 crore. The tendering process for repairs to Module

Hall is underway.

Impact of ‘COVID-19’

Consequent to the lockdown restrictions imposed by Central

and State Governments, due to the Covid-19 pandemic,

your Company implemented a complete lockdown and

Work from Home with effect from 23 Mar 2020. After

in order to compliance of Social Distancing norms & COVID

Protocols.

Due to the complete and compulsive cessation of all

letter of 07 August, 1999 raised a claim for a 30 year lease effective from 01.04.1996 of ` 1488 Lakh as one-time premium

and a sum of ` 148.8 Lakh p.a. being 10% of the said premium as annual lease rent which GRSE repudiated. During April, 2013, HEC

unilaterally referred the disputes to PMA, DPE, Govt. of India for arbitration and subsequently inter alia prayed before PMA for directing

GRSE to enter into lease agreement for totally baseless, frivolous and absurd lease rent and premium with interest for further period and

to declare GRSE as “unauthorized occupant” etc. GRSE raised preliminary objection regarding maintainability and sustainability of the

alleged reference of HEC and rejection of claim as the same are not sustainable on facts as well as in law. The matter was under adjudication

before Smt. Zoya Hadke, Sole Arbitrator, PMA who after hearing both the parties at length, vide Order dated 30.6.2015 held that in

absence of any agreement between the parties, the Arbitral Forum lacks jurisdiction to settle the dispute and rejected the reference of HEC.

Accordingly, the arbitration- matter stood disposed off. No appeal filed by HEC.

GRSE has also filed a Civil Suit (TS- 117 of 2014) in March, 2014 before a competent Civil Court at Ranchi, HEC and the Govt. of

Jharkhand being the defendants, with prayer for declaration by the Court that GRSE has acquired irrevocable licence coupled with interest

in the subject-land by setting up Diesel Engine Plant permanently thereon free of cost in accordance with the law of the land and for

permanent injunction restraining HEC from interfering with the possession of land by GRSE and running industry thereon. Hearing of

the case is in progress.
