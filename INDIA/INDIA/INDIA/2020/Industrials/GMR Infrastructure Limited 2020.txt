concession agreement in June 2020 for the same.

As part of exclusivity under Hyderabad airport’s

concession, we have also been awarded contract

of operation and management of Bidar Airport

in Karnataka for a period up to 2033. The airport

commenced operations from 7th February 2020.

Further, in pursuit of our long-term strategic vision to

develop and expand our footprints in several part of

the airport business value chain, the Group has won the

concession for the Duty Free business at Kannur Airport

in Kerala for a period of 7 Years, extendable by a further

period of three years. The operations are expected to

begin in FY21 and will mark the first duty free concession

to be operated by us outside the GMR network.

The above wins will further strengthen our position

as a leading global Airport company, and expand our

footprint in India. Further, the strategic partnership

with Groupe ADP strengthens our credentials and

capabilities further. While we continue on our growth

trajectory, we acknowledge the ongoing challenges

and are committed to respond with utmost agility and

efficiency.

While the Covid-19 impact hit us towards the end of FY20,

I am very happy to inform you of the strong response of

our teams to deal with this situation. In order to counter

the current challenge, we at GMR have looked at

business continuity from various perspectives. We have

focused on sustaining the operational aspects, wherein

our Airport teams continued to work ceaselessly during

the entire lockdown period to systematically prepare

for a Safe and Reliable experience post-lockdown. It is

testament to the relentless efforts of our employees

& stakeholders that our Delhi and Hyderabad Airports

have emerged as nodal points for distribution of medical

supplies and relief materials during the lockdown period.

Given the importance of passenger safety during this

pandemic, our teams have taken safety standards as a

top priority and implemented various safety measures

and practices with the help of technology on various

fronts to ensure uncompromised safety levels for both

passengers and airport staff. We are hopeful that these

steps taken by us will help restore flyer confidence and

thus facilitate faster recovery of air traffic.

While focusing on such operational aspects, we also

continue to ensure financial stability of the Group. Our

Teams have been focused on cash conservation and

cost reduction through various interventions to our

capital and operating expenditure in order to better

manage liquidity. Further, to guarantee organizational

resilience during this period of crisis, our teams have

worked seamlessly to introduce new systems and

processes to ensure that the organization continues

to perform optimally while ensuring safety and well-

being of the employees and other partners of the

organization.:

efforts on regulatory orders in APTEL and CERC. Efforts

Bajoli Holi hydro project, which was affected due to

natural force majeure reasons, is now in the last leg of

construction and we expect it to be operational by first

quarter of next financial year.

letter of award and subsequently signed the

concession agreement in June 2020 for Bhogapuram International Airport

in Andhra Pradesh, with the concession period being 40 Years, which can be

extended by further 20 years thereby paving the way for further activities.

As part of exclusivity under Hyderbad airport’s concession, we have also

been awarded contract of operation and management of Bidar Airport in

Karnataka for a period up to 2033 and the airport commenced operations

from February 7, 2020. The above wins will further strengthen our position

as a leading global Airport company, while expanding our footprint in India.

Subsequent to the signing of the Concession Agreement last year, we

along with our Greek partner TERNA Group, have achieved the Concession

Commencement Date for the New Heraklion Airport at Crete, Greece on

February 6, 2020.

Further, in pursuit of our long-term strategic vision to develop and expand

our footprints in the airport adjacencies business, Group won the concession

for Duty Free business for Kannur Airport in Kerala for a concession period

of 7 Years, extendable by further 3 years. The operations are expected

to begin in FY 2020-21 and will mark the first duty free concession to be

operated by us outside the GMR network.

We believe that Airport business has huge underlying attractiveness and

will continue to be the growth engine for the Group. We are actively pursuing

suitable airport opportunities in India as well as globally. Our strategy is to

increase the capacity of our existing airports and improve the performance

of our operating assets, maintaining a focus on operational excellence while

continuing to build potentially higher margin revenue streams arising out

of these assets. We also intend to add assets inorganically by bidding for

suitable airport opportunities in India as well as globally and further develop

certain key non-aeronautical operations and businesses including duty free

retail and cargo services.

Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) – Delhi Airport operated by

DIAL

Focus Areas for FY 2020-21

Despite the various issues impacting the aviation sector, in FY 2019-20 IGI

handled 67.3 Mn passengers and 0.96 MMT of cargo with a minimal de-

growth over last year. IGI Airport would continue to be the leading Airport

among all Indian airports in both passenger traffic and cargo handled. DIAL

was once again recognized as the Best Airport for service quality in the

region by ACI and Best Airport in Central Asia by Skytrax.

However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has taken the world by surprise and

businesses have been impacted. Like others, DIAL’s traffic has been heavily

impacted by the travel restrictions imposed by the government and the fall

in travel confidence, given the severe measures being undertaken by the

government. Even though there will be a severe impact of the pandemic in

this fiscal, we are looking forward to an increase in traffic post resumption

of air services. It is important to note that there is no fundamental change

in the value drivers of the business. The impact from the COVID 19 outbreak

on the business is expected to be a short to medium-term blip followed by a

gradual recovery once the spread is contained.

To overcome the crisis, DIAL has been putting efforts on various fronts

such as Safe Flying and Passenger Experience, financial resilience,

stakeholder engagement and employee health & safety. DIAL has been

continuously engaging with the state and regulatory authority for several

support measures and policy interventions and we look forward to their

consideration of these requests.

To repose faith in flying for passengers, DIAL has taken every necessary

action and will continue to do so. A recent survey at Delhi Airport tells 9

out of every 10 passengers traveling to or from Delhi Airport, felt absolutely

safe. Although, traffic level currently is well below the Pre-COVID level, DIAL

has witnessed nearly 3 times passenger traffic compared to the 2nd busiest

airport in India for the month of June 2020.

DIAL will also continue with the necessary parts of expansion of its

airside infrastructure and terminal capacity as per the approved Master:

Letter of Credit for all the

power being bought as a payment security mechanism. Post that, all

Discoms have opened LCs as per the PPA provisions.

•

Solar Energy Corporation of India had asked for Expression of Interest

from generators to supply bundled RTC power. Inexpensive renewable

power is to be bundled with expensive thermal power to offer a RTC

power to Discoms at cheaper rate. It has now issued RfS document for

purchase of 5,000 MW bundled power.

•

Power Trading Corporation of India Limited (PTC) conducted a bid for

purchase of 2,500 MW coal power for Medium Term under Aggregator

model.

•

Coal India Limited (CIL) continued its SHAKTI auctions of last year and

offered linkage coal to power plants having no LoA and no PPAs under

SHAKTI B(III) Scheme of MoC. More such auctions are accepted during

FY 2020- 21.

•

Coal production in India remained at levels similar to FY 2018-19 with

an All India production of 729 MT as against 728.72 MT last year.

The Company demonstrated outstanding resilience during one of the most

challenging and volatile periods being faced by energy sector. Our focus

over last year has been on stabilizing our existing assets, improving their

profitability and achieving operational excellence.

For the first time since commercial operations, GMR Warora Energy Limited

(GWEL) has achieved normative availability for all its PPAs with no loss in

capacity charges. The linkage materialization has been 99% for FY 2019-

20. GWEL also won the most coveted award in HSE practices – the British

Safety Council Sword. We have been able to enhance fuel security at GMR

Kamalanga Energy Limited (GKEL) with a successful bid for 0.4 MTPA coal

under SHAKTI B III Scheme of the GoI. GKEL has also bid successfully for

a power sale bid for 150 MW conducted by PTC during Q4 of FY 2019-20

and is awaiting LoA. We continued to get positive results for our efforts

on regulatory orders in APTEL and CERC. Our focus continued to be on

the liquidation of regulatory receivables during FY 2019-20 and we have

succeeded to a significant level.

However, due to the non-availability of domestic gas and high price of

imported gas, we have been facing challenges in securing gas for our

operational gas plants. After the unexpected order of the Supreme Court

against GMR Vemagiri Power Generation Limited (GVPGL), we have got

a positive order from CERC wherein Deepwater gas has been declared a

domestic gas and availability declaration has been upheld. We are working

to realize our dues from the Discoms.

Battling water ingress, tough geography and adverse weather conditions,

our project team at GMR Bajoli Holi Hydro Power Limited (GBHHPL) has

managed to tunnel through the tough terrain. With more than 90% of the

Project being completed, we are expecting to commission the plant during

Q1 of FY 2021-22.

Efforts put in by GMR Upper Karnali Hydropower Limited (GUKHPL) have

borne fruit with Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) issuing LoA

for 500 MW PPA. PPA is currently in draft stage and will get signed during

H1 of FY 2020-21.

To mitigate the stress on energy business due to pandemic, we have taken

several policy advocacy measures such as Usance LC for coal payments to

CIL, usage of linkage coal for sale of power in short term markets, relaxation

in FGD timelines, approval of Hydro Power Obligations for states, etc.

Many initiatives were taken to safeguard employee heath during pandemic

such as temperature scanning at entry and exit gates, compulsory wearing

of nose mask, scheduled sanitization of plant, launch of COVID-19 Warriors

with responsibilities such as creating awareness in work area, ensuring

usage of PPEs, ensuring social distancing, visitor management, etc.

Going forward, our strategy in the Energy sector will mainly be on improving

operational efficiencies and focussed efforts towards ensuring realization

of benefits under the regulatory measures announced . We will also build

on the existing platform to pursue growth opportunities in this sector that

are asset light and/ or through partnership model, while monetization

/ divestment of assets on a selective / opportunistic basis would still be

considered

Mining assets

International coal prices have shown moderate recovery since beginning of

2019. The prices of mid CV coal have touched a peak around March 2019 and

remained rangebound during remaining part of the year. Currently, global

outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted the manufacturing activities across the:

Letter of

Award for brownfield Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport, Nagpur

in March 2019. However, Mihan India Limited. has cancelled the contract

in May 2020. In response, GMR Airports has filed petition challenging

the cancellation of contract. It has also emerged highest bidder for the

proposed Bhogapuram International Airport in Andhra Pradesh. In addition,

the Group has interests in 7 operating energy assets in Tamil Nadu, Andhra

Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Odisha. The Group has 1 project under

construction (Hydro based plant in Himachal Pradesh) and 2 other plants in

Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh which are under development. It has 4

highway assets with a balanced mix of toll and annuity at various locations

in India - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab and Tamil Nadu.

letter dated 22 January

2020 issued by “the Ministry of Finance Male, Republic of Maldives,

the amount of tax assessed by the MIRA relating to the final arbitration

award is only USD 0.58 crore and this amount should be paid by

whom the payment was settled to GMIAL in the event of any tax

payable by GMIAL. Further the: letter also confirms that GMIAL is not

liable to pay for the taxes assessed by MIRA on the arbitration sum

and the Government of Maldives have initiated communication with

MIRA to settle the taxes and fines payable on the arbitration award”.

Accordingly, the ultimate outcome of the business tax assessment

sent by the MIRA cannot be determined and hence, the effect on the

financial statements is uncertain. Accordingly, the Group has not made

any provision in these financial statements. Our opinion is not modified

in respect of this matter.

The above matter has also been reported as an emphasis of matter in

the audit report dated 18 June 2020 issued by other firm of chartered

accountants on the standalone financial statements of GMIAL for the

year ended 31 December 2019.

We draw attention to note 45(xvii) to the accompanying consolidated

financial statement for the year ended 31 March 2020, with respect to

completion of sale of 49% stake by the Group in GAL to Aerport De

Paris SA on 7 July 2020 with certain modifications to the earlier signed

share subscription and share purchase agreement, the details of which

are described in aforesaid note. Our opinion is not modified in respect

of this matter.

Key Audit Matters

9.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment

and based on the consideration of the reports of the other auditors on

GEL had entered into a Power Purchase Agreements ('PPAs') with Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited for supply of energy

during the period December 15, 1997 to July 7, 2008. GEL had a Fuel Supply Agreement (‘FSA’) with a fuel supplier towards purchase of

Naphtha for generation of electricity during the aforementioned period. The FSA provided for payment of liquidated damages to the fuel

supplier in the event there was a shortfall in the purchase of the annual guaranteed quantity.

During the year ended March 31, 2013, GEL received a demand towards liquidated damages amounting to ` 296.16 crore along with an

interest of ` 5.55 crore towards failure of GEL to purchase the annual guaranteed quantity for the period from November 21, 2001 to June

6, 2008 under the erstwhile FSA. GEL had disputed the demand from the supplier towards the aforementioned damages. Further, GEL has:

letter dated April 17, 2018, proposed to extend the EC granted to

GBHPL for a period of 3 years, subject to the final outcome of the matter pending before the Court. Based on its internal assessment and a

legal opinion, the management of the Group is confident of obtaining the requisite clearances and based on business plan and a valuation

assessment carried out by an external expert during the year ended March 31, 2020, the management of the Group is of the view that the

carrying value of net assets of GBHPL by GEL as at March 31, 2020 is appropriate.

vii)

GWEL is engaged in the business of generation and sale of electrical energy from its coal based power plant of 600 MW situated at Warora.

the claims including interest on such claims is substantially pending receipt. Based on certain favourable interim regulatory orders, the

management is confident of a favourable outcome towards the outstanding receivables. Though the net worth of GWEL is substantially

eroded, the management of GWEL expects that the plant will generate sufficient profits in the future years and will be able to recover

the receivables and based on business plans and valuation assessment by an external expert during the year ended March 31, 2020, the

management of the Group is of the view that the carrying value of the net assets in GWEL by GEL as at March 31, 2020 is appropriate.

i.

The Group has a receivable (including unbilled revenue) of ` 226.85 crore as at March 31, 2020 (March 31, 2019: ` 348.41 crore) from Air India

Limited and its subsidiaries namely Indian Airlines Limited, Airline Allied Services Limited and Air India Charters Limited collectively referred

as ‘Air India’. In view of continuing ‘Airport Enhancement and Financing Service Agreement’ with the International Air Transport Association for

recovery of dues from Air India and Air India being a government enterprise/undertaking, the Group considers its dues from Air India as good and

fully recoverable. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Group has recognized receivable of ` 28.90 crore (March 31, 2019: ` 165.85 crore)

(including GST) and received ` 8.41 crore (year ended March 31, 2019: Nil) (including GST) towards interest agreed to be paid by Air India Limited.

In view of payment and continuous reduction in the overdue quarter on quarter backed by continuing “Airport Enhancement and Financing

Service Agreement” with International Air Transport Association (‘IATA’) for recovery of dues from Air India and considering the fact that Air India

being a government enterprise/ undertaking, the Group considers its due from Air India as good and fully recoverable. As agreed in 13th OMDA

Implementation Oversight Committee (OIOC) meeting, the Group has not paid revenue share on ` 27.97 crore (March 31, 2019: ` 135.76 crore)

recognised as interest income on delayed payment by Air India.

ii.

As at March 31, 2020, GGAL (earlier GPCL now merged with GGAL) has receivables from TAGENDCO aggregating to ` 114.12 crore (March 31, 2019:

` 114.12 crore). Based on an internal assessment and various discussions that the Group had with TAGENDCO, the management of the Group is

confident of recovery of such receivables and accordingly, no adjustment has been made in these consolidated financial statements of the Group.

Matters related to certain airport sector entities:

i.

DF Order

AERA DF Order No. 28/2011-12, 30/ 2012-13 and AERA tariff order No. 03/2012-13 on determination of Aeronautical Tariff was issued on November

14, 2011, December 28, 2012 and April 24, 2012 respectively.

a)

DIAL had accrued Development Fee (DF) amounting to ` 350.00 crore during the year 2012-2013 earmarked for construction of Air Traffic Control

(ATC) tower. During the financial year 2018-19, ATC construction work has been completed and DF amounting to ` 350.00 crore has been adjusted

against the expenditure on construction of ATC tower.

The total expenditure incurred on construction of ATC tower is ` 398.69 crore which exceeds the earmarked DF of ` 350.00 crore, as the

construction got delayed due to security reasons and additional requirements from time to time.

As per the approval in DIAL Board Meeting held on May 11, 2017, DIAL has written a: letter to AAI for reimbursement of additional expense.

However, AAI vide its letter dated November 29, 2018 has mentioned that there was no approval of additional cost incurred by DIAL on ATC and

therefore the additional cost would not be met out of DF. Accordingly, during the year ended March 31, 2019, DIAL has capitalized the ATC tower

at net cost of ` 48.69 crore after adjusting DF of ` 350.00 crores.

b)

AERA has passed an order vide Order No 30/2012-13 dated December 28, 2012 in respect of levy of Development fee at Delhi Airport. As per the

said order, the rate of Airport Development Fee (ADF) has been reduced from ` 200 to ` 100 and from ` 1,300 to ` 600 per embarking domestic

and international passenger respectively. Further, as per the said order, such revised rates have come into force with effect from January 1, 2013

and estimated DF collection period has been extended up to April 2016. Further, AERA issued Order No. 47/2015-16 dated January 25, 2016,

restricting cut-off date for collection of ADF upto April 30, 2016. As per the order, AERA has granted AAI six months’ time after cutoff date (i.e

April 30, 2016) to reconcile and arrive at the over recovery / under recovery of ADF. However, the same is pending finalization. The over / under

recovery will be accounted on final reconciliation of ADF with AAI. However, DIAL has collected the DF receivable in full and settled the DF loan

on May 28, 2016.

letter number AV/13024/047/2003-SS/

AD dated January 19, 2009 issued by MoCA, GoI.

b) The consolidated financial statements of the Group do not include billing to Airlines for DF by DIAL, as the management of the Group believes

that DIAL's responsibility is restricted only to the billing on behalf of AAI in accordance with the provisions of AAI (Major Airports) Development

Fee Rules, 2011 and DF SOP.

viii.

DIAL made an internal assessment on computation of Annual Fee payable to AAI and is of the view that the Annual Fee has been paid to AAI on

Gross Receipts credited to the consolidated statement of profit and loss (with certain exclusions) instead of on the “Revenue” as defined under

OMDA. The legal opinion obtained in this regard made it clear that there were excess payments of Annual Fee by DIAL by mistake from time

to time to AAI. Accordingly, as per the decision taken by the Board of Directors of DIAL a claim for return of excess Annual Fee paid to the AAI

was raised on 26.12.2016. AAI has not agreed to the claim and insisted DIAL to continue to pay Annual Fee 'on the same basis, which DIAL is

paying under protest. Accordingly, the dispute arose under OMDA but same could not be resolved amicably leading to the initiation of arbitration

proceedings, which have commenced from December, 2018. DIAL has submitted its statement of claim in respect of which, AAI has filled its

Statement of Defense (SOD). Pleadings are complete and issues has been framed by Arbitral Tribunal. The matter is on stage of cross examination

of DIAL’s witnesses. The matter is listed for completion of cross examination of DIAL's witnesses from June 20, 2020 to June 22, 2020 and

arguments will be heard on 8th, 9th, 22nd and 23rd of August 2020.

ix.

The Comptroller and Auditor General of India ('CAG') had conducted the performance audit of Public Private Partnership ('PPP') project of AAI at

Delhi Airport for the period 2006 to 2012. CAG had presented its report before the Rajya Sabha on August 17, 2012 wherein they had made certain

observations on DIAL. The Public Accounts Committee ('PAC'), constituted by the Parliament of India, has examined the CAG report and submitted

its observations and recommendations to Lok Sabha vide its ninety fourth report in February 2014. The management of the Group is of the view

that the observations in the CAG report and the PAC report do not have any financial impact on these consolidated financial statements of the

Group.

x.

In case of DIAL and GHIAL, as per the Operations, Management and Development Agreement (‘OMDA’) / Concession Agreement, DIAL and GHIAL

are liable to pay a certain percentage of the revenue as Monthly Annual Fee (‘MAF’) / Concession Fee (‘CF’) to Airport Authority of India / Ministry

of Civil Aviation respectively. The management is of the view that certain income / credits arising on adoption of Ind AS, mark to market gain

on valuation of Interest Rate Swap, gain on reinstatement of 4.25% Senior Secured Notes and Scrips received under Services Export from India

Scheme (‘SEIS’) in the nature of government grant, interest income from Air India, etc were not contemplated by the parties to the agreements

at the time of entering the agreements and these income / credit do not represent receipts from business operations from any external sources

and therefore should not be included as revenue for the purpose of calculating MAF / CF. Accordingly, DIAL and GHIAL based on a legal opinion,

has provided for MAF / CF on the basis of revenue adjusted for such incomes/ credits. Detail of such incomes / credits for the year ended March

31, 2020 and March 31, 2019 are as under:

letter dated April 1, 2015, had exercised the call option to buy the CCPS A, subject to obtaining the requisite regulatory

approvals. However, Investors had initiated arbitration proceedings against GAL and the Company, seeking conversion of CCPS A.

The Company together with GAL had executed a settlement agreement dated August 13, 2018 with Investors to amicably settle all outstanding

disputes pertaining to the matters which were the subject of the aforesaid arbitration. As per the settlement agreement, the Company through

its wholly owned subsidiary, GISL, had purchased 2,714,795 CCPS A of GAL for an additional consideration of ` 3,560.00 crore from the Investors

and balance 932,275 CCPS A have been converted into equity shares representing 5.86% shareholding of GAL in the hands of the Investors with

a put option given by the Group to acquire the same at fair value.

However pursuant to the definitive agreement dated July 04, 2019 with TRIL Urban Transport Private Limited, a subsidiary of Tata Sons, Solis

Capital (Singapore) Pte. Limited and Valkyrie Investment Pte. Limited, the management had considered the aforesaid additional obligation of `

3,560.00 crore as recoverable and had recognized the same as a financial asset in it consolidated financial statements for the year ended March

31, 2019. This agreement was cancelled during the year ended March 31, 2020.

As detailed in note xvii below, pursuant to the transaction with ADP appropriate adjustments have been made to reflect the above transaction and

the financial asset of ` 3,560.00 crore has also been adjusted with other equity as a consequence of the receipt of the above consideration..

xii.

Subsequent to balance sheet date on June 15, 2020, Delhi Cantonment Board (‘DCB’) has passed the order on DIAL, contradicting its own previous

demand and acted in contravention of Cantonment Act, 2006 and the HC order dated December 02, 2019 has sought to retrospectively enhance

the rate of property tax leviable on the DIAL on the pretext of purported errors in calculation , determining the property tax payable by the DIAL

for the assessment period i.e. 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 to be ` 2,589.10 crores. DIAL has thus challenged the assessment and demand by way of

writ petition before Hon’ble Delhi High Court and sought stay against the assessment and demand. The Hon’ble Court has passed the order and

asked DCB to justify its assessment and demand. If DCB tries to take any precipitative steps during this time, liberty has been granted to DIAL to

approach the court for interim relief.

xiii.

DIAL had entered into ‘Development Agreement’ and the ‘Infrastructure Development and Service Agreement’ with Silver Resort Hotel India

Private Limited (hereinafter referred as ‘Developer’) on February 26, 2010 for development and operation of commercial property area located in

Aerocity for a period of 30 years; further extendable to another 30 years. As per term of agreements, Developer was required to pay the License

fee and other charges to DIAL on annual basis. On July 16, 2015, DIAL issued termination notice on account of failure by the Developer to pay

the License Fees and other charges, required to be paid under the agreements executed between DIAL and the Developer. Consequently, the

Developer has invoked the arbitration process as per Infrastructure Development and Service Agreement.

During the year ended March 31, 2018, the Arbitral Award was passed by the Hon’ble Arbitral Tribunal in favour of DIAL thereby granting ` 115.89

crores award to DIAL and directing it to settle the award against security deposits of ` 192.88 crores lying with DIAL and pay the balance ` 76.99

crores to the Developer.

Accordingly, DIAL has deposited payment of `76.13 crore (net of recovery of arbitration cost of ` 0.86 crore) in the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi as

per arbitration award.

Further, Silver resort has filed an appeal against the arbitration award before the Hon’ble High court. The matter was heard for arguments on

April 26, 2018 and the judgment was pronounced on May 8, 2018 in favour of DIAL.

Pursuant to the above order, the Developer has preferred an appeal before Double Bench of Delhi High Court which was heard on July 4, 2018.

Both the parties agreed for settlement and accordingly the matter has been settled vide Hon’ble High Court order dated November 7, 2019

according to which DIAL has paid ` 54 crores to the developer as final settlement including outstanding ADC of ` 32.61 crore.:

letter dated April 17, 2018,

proposed to extend the EC granted to GBHPL for a period of 3 years, subject to the final outcome of the matter pending before the Court. Based on its

internal assessment and a legal opinion, the management of GBHPL is confident of obtaining the requisite clearances and based on business plan and a

valuation assessment carried out by an external expert during the year ended March 31, 2020, the management of the Company is of the view that the

carrying value of the investments in GBHPL by GEL as at March 31, 2020 is appropriate.:

letter dated January 22, 2020 received from Ministry of Finance Male', Republic of Maldives (the "Ministry"), the amount of tax

assessed by MIRA relating to the final arbitration award is USD 0.59 crore and in the event of any tax payable by GMIAL on the same shall be borne by

whom the payment was settled to GMIAL, without giving any workings / break-up for the same. As such the Ministry has confirmed that GMIAL is not

liable to pay for the tax assessed by MIRA on the final arbitration award.

Subsequent to the year end, GMIAL has obtained the statement of dues from MIRA on June 1, 2020 and as per the statements of dues as at June 1, 2020,

GMIAL is required to settle business profit tax amounting to US$ 0.72 Crore and fines on business profit tax amounting to US$ 0.58 crore and GMIAL

is required to settle withholding tax amounting US$ 0.29 crore and fines on withholding tax amounted to US$ 0.31 crore (withdrawing the interim tax

liability claim of US$ 0.72 crore).

Considering the entire tax liability pertaining to the business profit taxes is relating to the Arbitration Award Sum, the management of the Company is

of view that GMIAL will be able to successfully defend and object to the notice of tax assessments and accordingly, no additional provision is required to

be recognized in these financial statements. Further, in respect of the matters pertaining to the withholding taxes and the fines thereon, the Company,

believes that since these pertain to the aforementioned matter itself, the tax demand on these items is not valid and based on an independent legal

opinion, no adjustments to the books of account are considered necessary.

15

The Company through GIML has an investment in GMR Infrastructure (Cyprus) Limited, a subsidiary of GIML. GICL has fixed deposits of ` 107.08 crore

(USD 1.50 crore) with Eurobank, Cyprus. The Republic of Cyprus is presently facing economic difficulties. During the period ended December 31, 2019,

the bank has released USD 0.5 crore and the management of the Company is of the view that despite such economic difficulties, the amount held as

fixed deposit with Eurobank is good for recovery, though withdrawal of the amount from the Republic of Cyprus would be subject to restriction as may

be imposed by the Central Bank of Cyprus.

16

The Company does not hold any shares in these entities. The value of investment represents investments in additional equity on account of financial

guarantees.

Bank borrowings are generally considered to be financing activities. However, where bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand form an integral

part of an entity's cash management, bank overdrafts are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents. A characteristic of such banking

arrangements is that the bank balance often fluctuates from being positive to overdrawn. Accordingly, the Company has considered only such bank

overdrafts which fluctuates from being positive to overdrawn often.:
