The Novel Corona virus (COVID-19) is a Global Pandemic and is rapidly spreading throughout the world. With

effect from March 23, 2020, the Group had shutdown all plants and offices in adherence to nationwide

lockdown, as declared by Government of India to prevent and contain the spread of Corona virus outbreak. The

Group resumed its operations across India in a phased manner as the Government of India progressively relaxed

the lockdown. The Management has made an assessment of liquidity, recoverable values of its financial and non-

financial assets and has concluded that there are no material adjustments required in the financial statements.

However, the impact assessment of COVID-19 is a continuous process, given the uncertainties associated with

its nature and duration. The impact of global health pandemic might be different from that estimated as at the

date of approval of these financial statements. The Group will continue to closely monitor any material changes

to future economic conditions.

Refer to note 40 (b) (ii) for the final dividend recommended by the directors which is subject to the approval of

shareholders in the ensuing general meeting.

Previous year's figures have been regrouped / reclassified wherever considered necessary to conform current
