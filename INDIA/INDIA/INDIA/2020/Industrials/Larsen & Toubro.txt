Dear Shareholders

A.M. NAik

Group Chairman

i am addressing you at a time when

the nation is grappling with a global

pandemic, while simultaneously

gearing itself for a phased reopening

of the economy, and preparing

for life beyond Covid-19. Further,

simmering tensions along our

northern border have precipitated

an anti-China sentiment within the

country. The world too is witnessing

a growing groundswell of opinion

against China, and seeking viable

alternative sources of supply. i believe

this is the opportune moment for

the Government of india and indian

industry to act in unison to minimise

our external dependencies and

enhance self-reliance.

our hon’ble prime minister’s call

for ‘aaatma nirbhar Bharat’ has

resonated across the country. To

ensure that the pm’s thrust on

self-dependence achieves the desired

outcomes swiftly, it is essential

for the Government to introduce

much-needed reforms in several

areas including Land acquisition,

Competency & Skill Building. in

tandem, the administration would

do well to streamline processes

and accelerate the pace of decision

making.

We are confident that if these

measures are adopted and if

the nation remains united, our

determination and resolve will enable

us to overcome the challenges ahead.

Your company, as always, stands by

the country and its leadership in this

hour of need.

right from the onset of the

pandemic, L&T adopted stringent

safety measures to ensure the safety

and wellbeing of its people and

stakeholders. as a good corporate
