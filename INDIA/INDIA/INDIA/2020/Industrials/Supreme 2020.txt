Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial

instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange

rates, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk

sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.

A. CREDIT RISK

Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter party may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this,

the Company periodically assess financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current economic

trends, and analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly.

The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant

increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis through each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in

credit risk the Company compares the risk of default occurring on asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the

date of initial recognition. It considers reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information such as:

i)

Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business

ii) Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty

iii) Financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty’s ability to meet its

obligations

iv) Significant increase in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same counterparty

The company catogarises financial assets based on the assumptions, inputs and factors specific to the class of financial assets

into High-quality assets, negligible credit risk; Quality assets, low credit risk; Standard assets, moderate credit risk; Substandard

assets, relatively high credit risk; Low quality assets, very high credit risk; Doubtful assets, credit-impaired.

Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectations of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a

repayment plan with the Company. The Company categorises a loan or receivable for write off when a debtor fails to make

contractual payments greater than one year past due. Where loans or receivables have been written off, the Company continues

engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognized in

profit or loss.
