Dear Shareholders

Last few months have seen the world undergone

unbelievable transformation. We have witnessed

unprecedented challenge as the world came to a grinding

halt and the basic existence of humankind came under

severe threat due to Covid 19. Gloom and doom overtook

the entire globe leaving very little hope in each one of us.

But we have fought back and every passing day promises a

brighter tomorrow rekindling optimism once again.

As a nation we did an incredible job in the face of this

adversity. Dynamic and bold leadership of the honourable

Prime Minister motivated each one of us to ﬁght back with

social distancing, wearing masks and washing hands. Once

again the exemplary courage and sacriﬁce displayed by

fellow countrymen marked the true Indian spirit. We should

all be proud of ourselves and make sure that we do not

lower our guard as the threat of Covid 19 still looms over

our heads.

Executive Chairman’s Statement:

Managing Director

Message from: Dear Shareholders,

I hope the current crisis with the COVID virus causing large scale illness

and inconvenience to people in India and around the world, is managed

and contained in your lives through careful management of your

lifestyles as guided by our central Government.

The Indian government has been instrumental in containing the

pandemic in our country through prudent practices and general policy

guidelines on lockdown of public gatherings wherever applicable. This

delicate balance between working in isolation and meeting people

wherever essential, and also use of technology for e-meeting and

e-conference to get things done and also avoid spread of the virus, are

helping to contain this pandemic.

India, despite having more than 130 crore people, has been able to

contain the per capita infection as compared to other countries like

United States where it is much higher. I congratulate the Central

Government and the people of India for the enormous effort in this

direction and hope we shall together eradiate this epidemic and make

this World a lot safer for our children and coming generations.
