Managing Director’s statement

Navin Fluorine achieved three important milestones in FY ’20,

The Company crossed revenues of H1,000 crores

The Company clocked record operating margins from core operations

The Company signed a US$410 MM material supply agreement

Each of these milestones is as much a validation of our rich past as it is a

vote of confidence in the prospects of our Company.

In 2019-20, the Company’s revenues

reported 7% growth from H955 crore in

2018-19 to H1,022 crore, while EBITDA grew

15% from H253 crore in 2018-19 to H292

crore in 2019-20. PBT strengthened 13%

from H227 crore in 2018-19 to

H257 crore in 2019-20. Prudent cost and

product management helped improve our

EBITDA margin by 217 bps to 28% in 2019-

20. Navin Fluorine stands strong to face

any unforeseen and unexpected realities

on the one hand while being equipped to

capture new upside opportunities on the

other.

Partnerships, our true test

At Navin Fluorine, true partnerships mean

a lot more than a mere source of revenue

streams. These partnerships with like-

minded companies generate direct and

indirect benefits. Prior to the formation

of formal relationships, these companies

typically conduct exhaustive due diligence

of our ESG (Environment, Social and

Governance) capabilities. A similar detailed

study is conducted of our technical,

operational and financial strengths. When

these partnerships materialise, they are

a true testament of our capabilities and

values.

While providing visibility into future

earnings and growth, these partnerships

also help us gain access to advanced

technologies, which, in turn, help

us develop innovative products and

platforms. These products and platforms

drive more partnerships, creating a strong

snowball effect.

One example of such a partnership was

our signing of a $410MM multi-year

contract with one of our global partners

to manufacture and supply a new High

Performance Product (HPP). Our Board

of Directors approved the investment

of approximately H500 crores to set up a

new greenfield plant in Dahej, Gujarat,

India. The strength of our Balance Sheet

and strong cash flows provides us the

confidence to manage this investment

primarily out of our internal accruals.

Strengthening organizational

capabilities

To be able to deliver on these partnership

opportunities, it is critical that we

continue to strengthen our organizational

capabilities. During the past year, we

significantly strengthened certain critical

functions like Technology & Design, R&D

and Projects. A good team, driven by

strong sense of purpose, is the hallmark

of a great organization. We believe we

are now getting ready to build a robust

foundation, which will help us realize new

opportunities and propel us into the next

orbit of profitable growth.

Facing the challenges;

preparing for Covid-19

We started 2019-20 with a few business

challenges. We had limited headroom

Governance: People

over profit

At Navin Fluorine,

governance not only means

complying with the laws

of the land but also honest

stakeholder communication.

Even as the Dewas plant

was not required to stop

manufacturing following

the pandemic outbreak,

the Company selected to

temporarily shut operations

to maximise employee safety.

It empowered the EHS team

to review and validate plant

re-opening with no room for

compromise. The Company

apprised local authorities

on the comprehensive

safety protocols taken. The

proactive shut down and

programmed resumption

underlined the Company’s

commitment to governance

– putting people above

profit.:
