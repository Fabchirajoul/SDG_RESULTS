Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present you with our 62nd Annual Report, which looks

back on a particularly eventful financial year for Bayer CropScience

Limited in 2019-20.

On September 16, 2019, the India integration of Monsanto India

Limited with Bayer CropScience Limited was completed, following

a lengthy and intensive regulatory process. This marked a strategic

milestone in Bayer’s 125-year-old history in India. As of March 31,

2020, the integration is well on track and the Company has started

seeing good first contributions arising from the consolidation of

employee talent, product portfolios and business operations.

With the integration, we will be able to provide Indian farmers a

strong portfolio of innovation-led agricultural solutions. Our long-

term goal is to unlock the growth potential of Indian agriculture as a

global producer and exporter of food, feed & fibre.

In the financial year 2019-20, Bayer CropScience Limited

registered Revenue from Operations of ` 36,094 million and

Profit Before Exceptional Items & Tax stood at ` 7,133 million.

The Company successfully launched one new product in the

Crop Protection segment, four in Hybrid Seeds and one in

Environmental Science. Through projects such as ‘Food Chain

Partnerships’ and ‘Better Life Farming’, the Company is working

on providing tailored solutions that meet the specific local needs

of Indian farmers.

With greater focus on agriculture and its contribution to rural

livelihoods, agriculture will see increased investment from the private

sector and support from the Government through agri-reforms and

supporting policies. Farmers will invest in quality agri-inputs for

achieving higher and better-quality yields and a more favorable

return on investment. With increasing labor shortage, there will be a

push for mechanized and digital solutions in agricultural operations.

All these factors will enable good growth opportunities for Bayer

CropScience Limited.

As we look ahead, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I take this

opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to our Shareholders,

Banks & Financial Institutions, Employees, Distributors and Farmers

for your support and trust. I seek your continued support to grow

and progress our Company to greater heights.

Best wishes,

Pankaj Patel

Message from our Chairman

Pankaj Patel

Bayer CropScience Limited

06:

Dear Shareholders,

Agriculture is the backbone of rural India, with millions of smallholder

farmers relying on agriculture for their livelihood. Many of these

smallholders have limited access to modern agricultural inputs,

advisory and technologies. Yet, they cater to 80% of India’s food

requirement and help our nation to be self-reliant in food production.

Towards late March in the financial year 2019-20, the Covid-19

global pandemic disrupted operations across all industry sectors.

With the Government declaring agricultural operations ‘essential’,

farmers continued to toil hard to ensure adequate food production.

For us, at Bayer CropScience Limited, this was not just an allowance

to operate and support farmers with essential seeds and crop

protection products… it was much more. It was an obligation we

owed to farmers – to serve them and support in every way possible.

This meant thinking beyond mere sale of products and going the

extra mile to support farmers with market linkages, capacity building

for transfer of new technologies, help with harvesting, facilitating

cash liquidity and setting up new business models that enabled

digitalization of agriculture.

Currently, Indian agriculture is in a phase of unprecedented

transformation. With the recent agri-reforms introduced by the

Government, we have a golden opportunity to collaborate across

the agri value chain and help Indian farmers increase crop

productivity, farm profitability and progress from subsistence

farming to commercial farming.

When smallholders will earn higher farm incomes, it will support

rural job creation and increase the contribution of agriculture to

India’s economic growth. This in turn will make farming an attractive

profession for future generations and bring more investment to the

industry. It will also bring alive the Government’s vision of doubling

farmers’ incomes and help place India in the league of the top five

agricultural nations worldwide.

Bayer CropScience Limited is committed to fulfil Bayer’s promise

of ‘Science for a better life’ by improving the lives of farmers and

consumers with access to safe, nutritious and affordable food

and ensure ‘Health for all, Hunger for none’. We look forward to

collaborating with farmers, the government, industry and the

broader society to help us achieve this mission and create value for

all our stakeholders.

Best wishes,

D Narain

Managing Director and Senior

Leadership. Feedback is encouraged and is supported

by a Group-wide performance management system,

whose assessment determines a significant portion of

the employees’ variable compensation. ‘WeSolve’ is

an internal crowdsourcing platform for employees to

post their questions relating to internal activities in the

organisation. Employees are also involved in business

processes through active dialogue and prompt

information about upcoming changes.

Culture of fairness – In line with its Corporate Policy

– “Fairness and Respect at Work”, the Company

stringently adheres to the Group-wide standards of

conduct, focussed on protecting employees from

discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Training

videos and the Company website provide relevant

guidelines and training for employees to imbue

these principles. Child and forced labour are strictly

prohibited at BCSL, in accordance with the core labour

criteria of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

This prohibition is set out in Bayer’s binding Human

Rights Policy and applies across the Group.

Attractive working conditions – The Company

has a well-crafted compensation policy, based

on continuous benchmarking and evaluation, and

voluntarily pays employees on permanent employment

contracts in excess of the statutory minimum wage.

The compensation concept also includes variable

one-time payments. Flexible working hours, option

to work from home, and support in childcare beyond

the statutory requirement combine to provide a

healthy work-life balance to employees. To promote

good health and ensure safe working conditions, the

Company has, since the last 2 years, been following a

global framework concept to promote employee health

and quality of life (BeWell@Bayer). It also strives to

provide employees with access to affordable health

offerings, such as regular medical check-ups, sports

programmes and on-site medical care. An “Employee

Assistance Program” – a fully confidential support

system for requirements in the areas of psychological,

marital, financial and legal advice in personal matters,

further helps nurture the well-being of the employees.

Awards & Recognition:

The Company has been recognised, for the third time

in row, as Best Employer by AON, based on a study

backed with engagement research of over 6,400

global organisations, including 2,300 in the region, and

covering 800,000 employees’ opinions. This makes it

one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind in the

Asia-Pacific region. The study methodology involved a

nine-month long rigorous process, vetted by a panel

of external, independent jury members, representing

eminent business leaders and academicians. BCSL

has always been committed to creating a culture

conducive for everyone to continuously innovate,

perform and develop. Awards such as this are a

shareholders. They further noted that the integration will

successfully take forward the Company’s purpose of
