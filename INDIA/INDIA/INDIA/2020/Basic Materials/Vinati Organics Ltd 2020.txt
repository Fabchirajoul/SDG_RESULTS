Dear Shareholders,

It is a pleasure to share Vinati Organics’

performance in FY 2020 as we delivered

a strong performance despite weak

economic sentiments across the globe.

We maintain relentless focus on quality

with patented process innovations

that has helped us gain the trust and

commitment of our clients over the years

and contributed in making us a leading

specialty chemicals manufacturing

company.

With multiple challenges plaguing the

economy, including trade wars among

major countries, uncertain trade policies

and the recent COVID-19 pandemic,

almost every sector witnessed a

significant slowdown in FY 2020. Despite

these headwinds, Vinati Organics has

maintained a firm footing in the industry

and we continued to retain our market

leadership. The Company recorded a net

income of 21073 crore and the operating

income stood at 21029 crore. ROE for the

year was 26.09% and net profit grew to

2334 crore in FY 2019-20, from 2282 crore

in FY 2018-19.

In trying circumstances such as this, our

ability to deliver exceptional products

enable us to secure our market leadership

in a niche segment, instilling agility and

confidence to set global benchmarks. We

now endeavour to successfully design

a future-ready organization and build

new frontiers to sustain growth through

relentless excellence.

We have been using surplus cash to

fund growth through advanced research

and development programs to launch

new products that allow us to retain

an edge over our peers. Our team’s

focus on developing a new process for

manufacturing butylphenol is another

milestone in our journey. We are the sole

manufacturer in India and believe, it can

result in incremental revenues of 2400

crore a year, within the next three years.

The company has about a dozen other

chemicals in research and development

(R&D) phase, which could contribute

immensely to the growth of our company.

Moreover, macroeconomic factors

appear to be quite promising for India as

China’s market continues to shrink and

companies from around the world are

looking at alternate channels for procuring

varied products. The coming years are

likely to be crucial for the Indian Chemical

industry as it continues to rapidly expand

its market share, gradually moving to

capitalize on China’s potential losses. At

Vinati, we look ahead with enthusiasm and

will be focusing on efficiently expanding

our capacity while adding innovative and

cutting-edge products. Therefore, our R&D

efforts are likely to be scaled up further as

we stand at the cusp of an opportunistic

industry landscape.

We would like to take this opportunity

to express our heartfelt gratitude to the

Board of Directors, the Management

and all our employees for their sincere

efforts, relentless focus and enduring

commitment towards the growth and

success of our organization. It is also

time to extend our appreciation for our

valued shareholders, customers, and

suppliers for constantly supporting and

standing by us and motivating us to set

new benchmarks.
