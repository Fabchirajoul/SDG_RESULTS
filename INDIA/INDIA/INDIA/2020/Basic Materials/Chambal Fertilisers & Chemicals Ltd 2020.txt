letter in an earlier

year from GAIL (India) Limited, informing about the possibility of levy of Central Sales Tax. The Parent Company has

been taking the delivery of Gas in the State of Rajasthan and has been accordingly paying Rajasthan Sales Tax on the

supply. Therefore, the Parent Company feels that no Central Sales Tax is payable by it. Further, the amount of such levy

is not ascertainable. However, in the event of its levy, it is reimbursable by FICC under Subsidy Scheme.

(viii) Under the Jute Packaging Material (Compulsory use of Packing Commodities) Act, 1987, a specified percentage of

fertilisers dispatched were required to be supplied in Jute bags up to August 31, 2001. The provisions of the said Act

were challenged in the Supreme Court, which upheld the constitutional validity of this Act in its judgment in 1996.

In spite of making conscious efforts to step up use of jute packaging material, the Parent Company was unable to

adhere to the specified percentage, due to strong customer resistance to use of jute bags. The Parent Company had

received show cause notice from the Office of the Jute Commissioner, Kolkata, for levying a penalty of Rs.73.80 Crore

(Previous Year: Rs.73.80 Crore) for non compliance of the provisions of the said Act. The Parent Company has obtained

a stay order from Delhi High Court against the above show cause notice and on the basis of the stay order the Parent

Company is of the view that the said levy is not tenable in law and accordingly no provision has been considered.

Based on favorable decisions in similar cases, legal opinion taken by the Parent Company, discussions with the

solicitors, etc., the Parent Company believes that there is fair chance of decisions in its favour in respect of all the

items listed in (i) to (viii) above and hence no provision is considered necessary against the same.

(b) In respect of Subsidiaries :

Claims lodged / suits filed against Subsidiary of the Parent Company by customers are as given below.
