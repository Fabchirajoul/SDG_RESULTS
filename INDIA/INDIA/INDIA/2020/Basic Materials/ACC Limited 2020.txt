Dear Stakeholders,

I wish you all good health in these

trying times. Adversity, they say, is a

true test of character. At ACC, despite

the unprecedented nature of the

challenges we faced during the year,

we delivered on the expectations of

our stakeholders, thus cementing

our relationship with them. We will

continue to drive value creation with

focus on sustainability, innovation,

and inclusivity. We will continue to

communicate our efforts on these

three aspects as part of shaping the

Managing Director and CEO’s message

ACCelerating value creation

During the year, our

core focus remained on

‘Health, Cost and Cash’.: Dear Stakeholders,

I take pride in leading an organisation

that continues to play a pivotal role in

nation-building. It reflects the positive

impact our teams continue to make in

the face of unprecedented challenges.

During the year, we ensured the health

and safety of our people. We connected

more closely with our customers and

reinforced our market leadership with

value added products and services.

We also optimised our operations for

greater efficiency and strengthened

our commitment to sustainability by

driving focused efforts in the area.

MACRO DYNAMICS ARE

TURNING FAVOURABLE

The government’s focus on

infrastructure and affordable housing

is expected to bolster cement demand.

Affordable housing initiatives are

expected to pick up pace under the

Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)

with enhanced budgetary allocations.

The Government spending on housing

and infrastructure projects is expected

to increase demand for cement and

building materials. Good monsoon

has helped to improve the agricultural

output which also augurs well for

increased cement demand.

As per the November 2020 India Brand

Equity Foundation (IBEF) Report on

Cement Industry, cement demand is

expected to reach 550-600 MTPA by

2025, thanks to a gradual upswing in

housing, commercial and industrial

construction.

PERFORMANCE IN PERSPECTIVE

During the year, we reported net sales

of `13,487 Crore and consolidated net

profit of `1,430 Crore. We could ensure

healthy cash flows due to rigourous

working capital management.

On the project front, we completed

and commissioned the new grinding

unit at Sindri in the state of Jharkhand,

which is one of the fastest capex

projects to be implemented despite

the challenges posed due to COVID-19

and other restrictions. The new facility

will add 1.4 MTPA of cement capacity

to its existing 3 MTPA unit at this site.

The foundation stone for Sindri grinding

unit Phase-2 was laid in December

2019 with the objective to service the

expanding market, strengthen presence

in the eastern region and add value to

the overall business.

A sharp focus on sustainable

development embodies safety,

conservation of energy and natural

resources, preserving environment and

letter and spirit

With a decision-making process based on decentralisation, empowerment and meritocracy,

we remain custodians of a strong stakeholder stewardship. Our governance practices are

Good governance, comprehensive risk management and operational excellence are integral to our business and

Board and its Committees to deliver on strategy, risk management and long-term value creation. The Executive Committee

and management is responsible for delivering in terms of business performance ensuring transparency, fair play and

(‘LOI’) for the grant of a mining lease, such LOI should be

converted into a mining lease.

Wherever the Company is of the view that it had an LOI,

it has taken up the matter in the respective High Court,

seeking a direction to issue the mining lease. Currently, these

matters are sub-judice. The Company is also participating in

auctions to secure new mining leases for its existing plants

as well as for its expansions at different locations.

As limestone is a gradually depleting natural resource,

to ensure prudent usage of the mineral in cement

manufacturing, a higher percentage of additives are added.

This helps to make use of the low-grade limestone without

compromising on quality, thereby conserving the mineral

and increasing the life of the mine.

Environmental clearance, forest and wild life clearances are

a pre-requisite for mining activities wherever applicable.

Besides, land acquisition is also becoming more challenging

and expensive. The management is taking adequate

steps to put in place robust processes for obtaining fresh

environmental clearances, wherever necessary.

Market competition

The cement industry is witnessing an imbalance in installed

capacity and its utilisation. Despite excess production

volumes in the industry, expansion programmes continue,

resulting in intense competition and adverse impact on the

Company’s market share, sales volume and profitability.

Efforts are also being made by the Company to widen its

product portfolio by increasing the share of its premium

products in the retail segment, application-based products,

value-added products and services to the B2B segment.

Cyber security

In the last few years, technology has evolved manifold and

so have the risks attached to it. The proliferation of business

Board’s Report (Contd.):

The Company’s compensation philosophy for the CEO &

guided by the fact that the Company gains a competitive

advantage in attracting, retaining and motivating talent.

This can be ensured by providing a remuneration structure

which when benchmarked with comparable companies

within the industry/sector compares favourably so as to

attract talent. At the same time the reward proposition

This Policy is called “ACC Limited – Dividend Distribution Policy”

(hereinafter referred to as “the Policy”). The Policy is framed

pursuant to Regulation 43A of Securities & Exchange Board

of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)

Regulations 2015 for the time being in force. The Policy shall

come into effect from the receipt of the Board’s approval

(Effective Date).

The Policy lays down the broad criteria which the Company

would take into consideration for the purpose of ascertaining

the amount of dividend to be declared keeping in mind the

need to maintain a balance between the payout ratio and

retained earnings, in order to address future needs of the

Company. The policy serves as a guideline for the Board of

Directors and the decision of the Board of Directors with

respect to the amount of dividend declared for any given

period will be final and shall not be open to challenge by any

person on the basis of the Policy.

Dividend would continue to be declared on per share basis

on the Ordinary Equity Shares of the Company having face

value `10 each. The Company currently has no other class of

shares. Dividend other than interim dividend shall be declared

at the annual general meeting of the shareholders based on

the recommendation of the Board of Directors. The Board of

Directors has the authority to declare interim dividend.

Subject to the provisions of the applicable law, the Company’s

dividend payout will be determined based on available

financial resources, growth/investment requirements and

fair shareholder return. The Company will broadly take into

consideration the following financial parameters and/or

internal and external factors to determine whether or not to

declare dividend or to determine the quantum of dividend to

be declared.

INTERNAL FACTORS

y Profits earned during the financial year and the retained

profits of the previous years in accordance with the

provisions of Section 123 and other applicable provisions of

the Companies Act, 2013 read with rules framed thereunder;

y Cash flow position of the Company and the debt: equity

ratio;

y Projections with regard to the performance of

the Company;

y Fund requirement to finance Capital Expenditure;

y Fund requirement to finance any organic/inorganic growth

opportunities or to finance working capital needs of the

Company;

y Opportunities for investment of the funds of the Company

to capture future growth;

y Dividend payout history.

EXTERNAL FACTORS

y Cost of external financing;

y Changes in the Government policies, rate of inflation and

taxes structure etc.;

y Quantum of dividend payout by other comparable

concerns etc.

The Company may recommend additional special dividend in

special circumstances.

In the event of a loss or inadequacy of profits in a given year,

Company may, taking into consideration the shareholder

expectations, past dividend payout history etc., declare

payment of dividend out of its reserves as may be permitted

by the law.

Likewise, in the event of challenging circumstances such

as adverse economic cycles and industry projections, the

performance of the Company in the coming years, pressure on

cash flow on account of various factors such as higher working

capital requirements, etc., the Company may, decide not to

declare a dividend even when in a given year, the Company

had generated profits.

In case it is proposed not to declare dividend during any

financial year, the grounds thereof and the information on

the manner in which the retained profits of the Company, if

any, are being utilised shall be disclosed to the Members in

the Board’s Report forming part of the Annual Report of the

Court challenging the stand of the Government, which is admitted and pending before the High Court for hearing

on merit. The Company is of the view and has been advised legally, that the merits are strongly in its favour.

d)

The Company had set up a captive power plant (‘Wadi TG 2’) in the year 1995-96. This plant was sold to Tata Power Co

Ltd, in the year 1998-99 and was subsequently repurchased from it in the year 2004-05. The Company had purchased

another captive power plant (’Wadi TG 3’, set up by Tata Power Co Ltd in the year 2002-03) in 2004-05. Both these

power plants were eligible for tax holiday under the provisions of Section 80-IA of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The

Income tax department has disputed the Company’s claim of deduction under Section 80-IA of the Act, on the ground

that the conditions prescribed under the section are not fulfilled. In case of Wadi TG 2, in respect of the demand of

`56.66 Crore (net of provision) (Previous year – `56.66 Crore), the Company is in appeal before the ITAT and in case of

Wadi TG 3 in respect of the demand of `115.62 Crore (Previous year – `115.62 Crore), which was set aside by the ITAT,

the Department is in appeal against the decision in favour of the Company. The Company believes that the merits

of the claims are strong and will be allowed.

e)

One of the Company’s cement manufacturing plants located in Himachal Pradesh was eligible, under the State

Industrial Policy for deferral of its sales tax liability arising on sale of cement manufactured at that plant. The Excise

and Taxation department of the Government of Himachal Pradesh, disputed the eligibility of the Company to such

deferment on the ground that the Company also manufactures an intermediate product, viz. Clinker, arising in the

manufacture of cement, and such intermediate product was in the negative list. A demand of `82.37 Crore (Previous

year – `82.37 Crore) was raised. The Company filed a writ petition before the Hon’ble High Court of Himachal Pradesh

against the demand. The case has been admitted and the hearing is in process. The Company believes its case is

strong and the demand is unlikely to sustain under law.

f)

The Company was contesting the renewal of mining lease in state of Jharkhand for two of its quarries on lease.

There was an unfavourable order by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in judgement on Goa Foundation case, restricting

the “deemed renewal” provision of captive mining leases to the first renewal period. The Company received demand

from District Mining Officer for `881 Crore as penalty for alleged illegal mining activities carried out by the Company

during January 1991 to September 2014.

On January 2, 2015, the Central Government promulgated the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation)

Amendment) Ordinance, 2015 [subsequently enacted as Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation)

(Amendment) Act, 2015 in March 2015] amending mining laws with retrospective effect, and decided that all leases

granted prior to ordinance will deemed to have been automatically renewed until prescribed period therein.

The Company then filed a writ petition with High Court of Jharkhand, challenging the aforesaid memos from the State

Government for directing the State government to renew both the leases up to March 2030 as per the Ordinance.

On October 31, 2015 the High Court passed an interim order in terms of Section 8A(5) of the Ordinance for quarry

II extending the lease up to March 2030 permitting the Company to commence mining operations after depositing

`48 Crore, being assessed value of materials dispatched between April 2014 to September 2014 (being the alleged

period of illegality) subject to the outcome of the petition filed by the Company.

The Company’s assessment coupled with legal advice is that the case shall not stand the test of judicial scrutiny basis

the automatic renewal.
