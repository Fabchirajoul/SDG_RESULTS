MANAGING DIRECTOR’S

OPERATIONAL REVIEW

Overview

I am pleased to present the performance

of the Company during the year under

review.

The Company’s sales volumes grew 6%,

revenues strengthened 1% while EBITDA

declined from C455 Crore to C424 Crore

and profit after tax declined from C299

Crore to C285 Crore in FY 19-20.

The Company’s performance was

creditable on account of the sluggishness

within the Indian economy and the

national lockdown imposed in late March

2020, which resulted in a loss of nearly ten

operational days. The imposition of the

lockdown increased field costs, affecting

profitability. Besides, the last fortnight

of the financial year is usually a period

of high offtake when buyers accelerate

offtake to complete their annual

procurement quota for that financial year.

The result is that the lockdown eroded

nearly 1 Lakh tonnes of projected offtake

that moderated profits by an estimated

C18-20 Crore. Had the lockdown not taken

place, the performance of the Company

would have been better. The profit

decline is also attributed to increased fuel

costs.

Challenges

The Company encountered a number of

challenges in addition to the lockdown.

The Indian economy weakened during

the course of the year, affecting cement

offtake. GDP growth declined from 6.1%

in FY 18-19 to 4.2% in FY 19-20; during the

last quarter, GDP growth declined to 3.1%,

one of the lowest in years.

During the year under review, there was

a ban on coal mining in Meghalaya. The

erstwhile practice of local coal sourcing

was discontinued and replaced with coal

imports or domestic purchase from Coal

India Ltd & its subsidiaries during the

year under review. The increased cost

of delivered coal increased the cost of

generating power and clinkerisation cost.

A flood in the North East in August 2019

affected operations, moderating offtake.

Counter-challenges

At Star Cement, we recognised that the

most effective counter-initiatives in the

face of these challenges were to exercise

a stronger control on factors within our

influence.

The result is that the Company deepened

its culture of procurement, logistical,

manufacture, marketing and branding

excellence with the objective to moderate

costs and protect its competitiveness.

The Company commenced the practice

of delivering cement directly to dealers as

against the erstwhile practice of routing it

through depots. This re-direction made it

possible for the Company to save logistical

costs and respond with speed to the

needs of trade partners.

The Company completed the construction

of a railway siding at its cement plant,

which made it possible to save handling

costs and related losses as opposed to the

earlier scenario when the railway siding

was 4 kms away. The C36 Crore investment

in the construction of the railway siding

is expected to generate a payback

in 3-5 years, strengthening logistical

competitiveness. The utility of the railway

siding will increase when the Company’s

Siliguri grinding unit is commissioned,

making it convenient to deliver clinker.

We believe that the railway siding unit

represents a platform that will generate

multi-year benefits into the long-term.

The Company altered its customer mix.

The proportion of cement sold to the

retail trade increased from 81.8% in FY 18-

19 to 82.2% in FY 19-20. The growing

preference to market products through

trade channels has helped the Company

protect or strengthen realisations as

compared to the institutional segment

where realisations are generally lower.

The Company moderated brand

investments around the time of the

pandemic outbreak, conserving resources.

The regional optimism

North East India possesses a clinker

capacity of 8.5 Mn tonnes and a cement

capacity of 11.3 Mn tonnes. The demand

for cement in the region is estimated at

9.4 Mn tonnes.

There are a number of reasons why we are

optimistic of our prospects.

Demand growth in North East India

ranges between 8 and 9% a year, based

on our experience of the last couple of

decades. This provides us with adequate

scope to market additional cement year-

on-year. Assam, the largest state in the

region, is expected to grow at a 9-10%

CAGR between FY 15-16 and FY 20-21,

virtually twice the pace of the Indian

economy.

The per capita consumption of cement

in North East India is about 142 kgs

compared with the all-India average of

The proportion of cement sold to the retail

trade increased from 81.8% in FY 18-19 to

82.2% in FY 19-20.

Deb as an Independent Director of the Company setting out the

terms and conditions of appointment and notice under Section

160(1) of the Companies Act, 2013 shall be available in the Investor

section of the website of the Company at www.starcement.co.in.

Further, Mr. Amit Kiran Deb is currently 72 years of age and during

his tenure for a period of 5 years from 1st April, 2020 for a term

upto 31st March, 2025, he will be attaining the age of 75 years. As

per Regulation 17(1A) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure

09, 2018, no listed entity shall appoint a person or continue the

directorship of any person as a non-executive director who has

attained the age of 75 years unless a special resolution is passed to

that effect.

Keeping in view, the vast expertise and knowledge, the Board

considers that the continued association of Mr. Amit Kiran Deb

cross the age of 75 years during his tenure of his directorship and it is

desirable to avail services of Mr. Amit Kiran Deb, as an Independent

Director. Accordingly, the Board recommends the resolution in

Director, as a Special Resolution for approval of the Members.
