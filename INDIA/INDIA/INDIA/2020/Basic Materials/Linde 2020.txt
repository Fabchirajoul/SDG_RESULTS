I. As a Lessor (IND AS 116)

The following is the summary of future minimum lease rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases and finance leases entered into by

the Company.

A. Operating leases as a lessor:

Significant leasing arrangements include lease of plant and machinery dedicated for use under long term arrangements for periods ranging

between 12 to 20 years with renewal option. Receivable under long term arrangements involving use of dedicated assets are allocated between

those relating to the right to use of assets on contractual terms and conditions. Any change in the allocation assumptions may have an impact on

the lease assessment and/or lease classification.

Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as below:

B. Finance leases as a lessor:

Certain plant and machinery has been made available by the Company to the customers under a finance lease arrangement. The arrangements covers

a substantial part of the economic life of the underlying asset and contain a renewal option on expiry. Receivables under long term arrangements

involving use of dedicated assets are based on the underlying contractual terms and conditions. Any change in the assumptions may have an impact

on lease assessment and/or lease classification. Such assets given under the lease arrangement have been recognised, at the inception of the lease

as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The finance income arising from the lease is being allocated based on a pattern

reflecting constant periodic return on the net investment in the lease. The income arising on account of finance lease arrangement is Rs 4.94 million.

The minimum lease receivable and the present value of minimum lease receivables in respect of arrangements classified as finance leases are as below:

To the Members of Linde India Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of

Linde India Limited (“the Company”), which comprise the Balance Sheet

as at 31 December 2020, and the Statement of Profit and Loss (including

Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Cash Flows and the

Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary

of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the

explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements

give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity

with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133

of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles

generally accepted in India, of the state of aꡜairs of the Company as at

31 December 2020, and its profit, total comprehensive income, its cash

flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in

accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10)

of the Act (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further

described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone

Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the

Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute

of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical

requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial

statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder,

and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with

these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit

evidence obtained by us is suꡝcient and appropriate to provide a basis for

our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment,

were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial

statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the

context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole,

and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate

opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described

below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Independent auditor’s report.

Key Audit Matter

Auditor’s Response

1

Revenue Recognition - Appropriateness of estimation of

contract cost & revenue recognition in PED Business

Revenue from the contracts entered by the Project

Engineering Division (PED) is recognized over a period of time

in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 115- Revenue

from Contracts with Customers.

Due to the nature of the contracts, revenue recognition

involves usage of percentage of completion method which

is determined based on proportion of contract costs incurred

to date compared to estimated total contract costs, which

involves significant judgments, identification of contractual

obligations and the Company’s rights to receive payments

for performance completed till date, changes in scope and

consequential revised contract price.

Accuracy of revenues and profit/loss may deviate significantly

on account of change in judgements and estimates. For this

reason, we have identified estimates involved in the revenue

recognition and budgeted costs for Project Engineering

Division as Key Audit Matter

Refer to the Accounting Policy para 2(e), Notes 24 and 40 to

the Standalone Financial Statements.

Principal audit procedures:

Our audit approach was a combination of test of internal controls and

substantive procedures including:

• Obtained an understanding of the management’s evaluation process

to recognize revenue over a period of time, the status of completion

for projects and total cost estimates;

• Identified and tested the controls related to revenue recognition,

focusing on the determination of percentage of completion, recording

of costs incurred and estimation of costs to complete the remaining

contract obligations through inspection of evidence of performance

of these controls;

• Tested selected contracts on sample basis for appropriateness

of revenue recognition including budgeted cost as well as the

percentage of completion for construction works as it requires

management’s estimates on the basis of progress of the projects;

• Evaluated management’s estimates of the impact to revenue and

budgeted costs arising from scope changes made to the original

contracts, claims, disputes and liquidation damages with reference to

supporting documents including variation orders and correspondence

between the Company and the customers;

• Tested on sample basis the actual costs incurred on construction

works during the reporting period;

• Recomputed the percentage of completion based on the latest

budgeted final costs and the total actual costs incurred and the

revenue recognised based on the percentage of completion;

• Evaluated the adequacy of the related disclosures in the standalone Ind

AS financial statements as required by the relevant accounting standard.

the provisions of the IT Act.
