Dear Stakeholders,

I am writing down this message to all our stakeholders at

a time when we are passing through the most volatile

and uncertain phase in our lives, owing to the

circumstances that the world or humanity has not seen

before. Yet, when the times are tough and there is

uncertainty all around; it is our individual and collective

belief in ourselves that gives us the will and strength to

move forward, and carve out a path through the

labyrinth of chaos and uncertainty.

Financial year 20 began on a positive note with the

overhang of both healthy GDP growth as well as healthy

cement growth in the previous ﬁnancial year 2019. The

mood was further buoyed with the formation of a stable

government consequent to general elections held in

the ﬁrst quarter. In the ﬁrst quarter due to elections

economic activities slowed down considerably. Healthy

monsoon in the second quarter brought very positive

prospects of a bumper harvest, increase in the rural

income, increase in the rural construction etc., but the

demand got impacted more than the normal seasonal

phenomenon due to prolonged monsoon which

continued well till the third quarter. In the last month of

the last quarter of the year global pandemic of COVID

19 broke out in India too resulting in the dismal

economic performance during the quarter in which the

GDP grew by mere 3.1% thereby dragging the growth

to just 4.2% for the year. Consequently cement demand

for the entire year showed a drop of ~5% in FY 20

against an handsome growth of ~13% in FY 19.

Rising trade tensions between US & China, rising of

nationalistic sentiments across the globe, weak oil

prices leading to slowing of construction in middle east

also took its toll on FDI in real estate sector which

otherwise was limping back to normal after the shocks

of demonetisation, GST, and RERA regulations. Lower

than expected tax collections also adversely impacted

governments’ expenditure on infrastructure projects.

Despite all the disruption, still Indian economy

performed better than many other major global

economies in FY 20.

Though the overall cement consumption during the

year shrank; the prices remained relatively stable and

improved towards last quarter. We retained our focus on

improving operational efﬁciencies, optimised the

already commissioned waste heat recovery plant of 7.5

MW at Durg in FY 19 and operationalised captive power

Managing Director

plant of 20 MW at Durg in FY 20. On supply chain and

distribution side our efforts in rationalisation between

plants, markets, modes of transportation, depot

locations, etc. resulted in 11% reduction in logistics cost.

Aided by favourable fuel and energy costs company

registered an increase of ~47% in EBITDA and an

impressive jump of ~180% in the net proﬁts. Our current

D/E of 0.86 gives us ample leverage to borrow & invest

in growth at an opportune time.

Moving back to present as I have mentioned at the

beginning that we are all going through a trying time

whose length and intensity are highly unpredictable.

Notwithstanding the sudden disruptions caused by the

global pandemic; the fundamentals of India economy

still remain strong. The inﬂation is under control, global

oil prices are stable, current account deﬁcit (CAD) is

down and we have healthy foreign exchange reserves.

After very stringent lock down in April, the economy has

shown resilience and demand in many sectors including

cement and construction has come back quite close to

the pre lockdown levels. Though the economic stimulus

package of Rs. 20 Lakh Crores announced by the

government has major components of credit & liquidity

boosting measures for the industry but direct ﬁscal

measures which have large rural orientation have began

to shown results in terms of rising rural demand and

consumption.

The predictions so far of the monsoon this year are

positive and with availability of labour in abundance, the

‘Kharif’ sowing is at its peak. Hopefully, a bumper crop

and farm output combined with handsome increase in

the support prices of agri-commodities; and increase in

the minimum wages of unskilled labour under

MGNREGA would revive rural economy further which is

still home to 70% of our population, to more than 50% of

people employed in urban construction, and also a

large part of blue collared workforce employed in the

industry. Clearly the tide has turned and revival in urban

economy is now largely dependent on the ripple affect

of rising rural incomes and rising rural consumptions.

Company’s focus on developing rural markets since last

few years shall stand in good stead and enable the

company to capitalise on these opportunities.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that while there

are multiple clusters of large outbreak in urban areas,

rural India despite lacking in basic infrastructure and

healthcare facilities has relatively been less impacted.

Clearly urban city planners have a daunting task of

decongesting large cities and take infrastructure

development to the outskirts, satellite towns, and semi

urban centers. The industry too will have to shift its

priorities and be more rural-centric. If till today skills

from rural have moved to urban for work; now the ﬂow

will have to be reversed. Work from home is now

becoming a new normal that may become permanent

for many. Supply chains in many component based

industries are becoming decentralised and diversiﬁed

with more emphasis on precision and completeness of

designs. Construction industry may also see rapid

adoption of pre-engineered and pre-fabricated

construction technologies which may require only the

assemblies at the sites.

I am happy to note that we are rapidly adapting to the

changes in this dynamic and ﬂuid environment. Our

offerings to the construction sector include ready-to-

use products and we shall continue to augment our

offerings and invest in new technologies. Our supply

chains are increasingly becoming rural centric and are

adapting to the rural patterns of demand and

consumptions. We shall continue to invest in adoption

of newer technologies, people and skill development

and in growing our businesses with the unstinted

support of all our stakeholders.

More than a century ago, the very foundations of this

group were built on the concepts of ‘Atma Nirbharta’

with use of local capital, local materials, local

technologies, and above all the local talent which since

then has grown manifold. I call upon all my fellow

stakeholders to join me in furtherance of the resolve to

take the company to newer heights built on its strong

foundations of ‘Atma Nirbharta’ and ‘Vocal for Local’.

Dear Shareholders, Associates and Team JKLC,

In these times where volatility and uncertainty are trying

to overshadow the human spirit, the best thing we can

do is to focus on our duties and improve our

performance without getting bogged down by the

volatility. Action and performance are the keys to

tackling uncertainty and we, at JKLC have fought the

uncertainty and tough times of the year gone by with

resilience and a strong all-round performance. Over the

past year, the Company has single-mindedly focused on

improving its supply chain, operational efﬁciencies at all

levels and maximising its realisations by optimising the

product mix, introduction of new brands and

augmenting the existing distribution network.

The cement production during the year fell by 7%,

despite the lower production, the company maintained

its efﬁciency parameters with respect to fuel and power

consumption at an optimum level. The commissioning

of the Waste Heat Recovery Power Plant of 7.5 MW in the

FY19 and 20 MW Thermal Power Plant in the FY 20 has

enabled the Company to contain its power cost at the

Durg Plant. Expansion of Waste Heat Recovery Project in

Jaykaypuram, Sirohi with an annual capacity of 10 MW is

in full swing and is expected to be commissioned in July

2021. Your Company was able to bring down the

logistics cost by a signiﬁcant 11% by optimising dumps

and modes of transportation and also encouraging

direct dispatches aided by the GST regime. Moreover,

to capture the ever-growing demand for its premium

brands like JK Lakshmi PRO+ Cement and Platinum

Heavy Duty Cement; and proactively moving close to

markets; your company is actively pursuing the strategy

of outsourcing of grinding capacities in attractive

markets. Your Company now has a wide range of

products to cater to all segments and we continued our

focus on providing better and superior products to the

market through innovation and technology in FY 20.

Our team left no stone unturned in initiating and

implementing sustained marketing and branding

efforts; keeping their ears to the ground for customer

and trade feedback to further strengthen the

distribution system.

During the ﬁnancial Year 2019-20, the company

successfully commissioned a new Grinding Unit with an

duties and work hard, but never

get attached to the results.

and never be inactive”

annual capacity of 0.8 Million tonnes at Cuttack in

Odisha . This is expected to improve capacity utilization

of its Eastern operation and improve its footprint in the

coastal Orissa.

The humanity today is facing one of the most

challenging times in it’s recent history. The Global

pandemic caused by Covid-19 has impacted the world;

creating a medical, economical, ﬁnancial and social

crisis; that has changed everything for an individual and

for an organisation. The hallmark of a truly effective and

efﬁcient organisation in turbulent times is its ability to

shift gears, adapt to the situation and relentlessly pursue

hard work and excellence in performance with a never-

say-die attitude. Every section of the society is ﬁghting

against this outbreak. JK Lakshmi Cement Ltd. with its

socially responsible ﬁbre, is aware of the challenges.

The company’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic has

simply been the ampliﬁcation of its core value system.

The company has left no stone unturned to keep the

work going and spirits positive. Your Company built

agile networks to protect the vulnerable and neediest.

Be it any strata of stakeholder - employees, dealers,

essential service providers, mason community or

society-at-large, the company is trying its best to come

out with solutions that can uplift human spirit in each

one of them. The company is ﬁghting this pandemic at

several fronts in collaboration with local panchayats and

district administration across its plant locations in

Rajasthan, Haryana, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat, by

supporting the people living in the vicinity of its plants

and helping migrant workers. I am proud to inform you

that Your Company has won the well-deserved 'Golden

Peacock Award for Corporate Social Responsibility' for

the year 2019. The award is given by Institute of

Directors (IOD) for signiﬁcant initiatives in CSR practices

and for creating new benchmarks. It recognises the

organisation’s ability to go beyond the statutory, ethical

and sustainability compliances to achieve higher

standards in corporate excellence. JK Lakshmi Cement

Ltd. is at the forefront in its own humble way for

providing basic support and amenities to the society,

amidst this global pandemic.

We as an organisation have always endeavoured to lay a

solid foundation created with learning and

development, training and practical experience,

hand-holding and focused skill enhancement for our

employees. Our initiatives such as SWAGATAM, SPARK,

My Exclusive Time and Customer-in-culture have

resulted in further aligning the employees with the

Organisation’s thought process and also motivated

them to perform efﬁciently. Pandemic COVID-19 has

seen our HR both at group level and the individual

company level taking proactive initiatives to keep up the

morale of the team, keep them engaged and widen

their horizon to look for opportunities which may

seemingly be hidden through the cloud of uncertainty

and despair. The role of the IT team was crucial in this

scenario for connecting, communicating and aligning

employees with business requirements from safety of

employee’s homes during the lockdown period.

I would also like to reiterate our gratitude towards our

customers, business partners, suppliers and our

esteemed shareholders, for their support, loyalty and

conﬁdence in us. We all need to come together and

ﬁght this uncertainty with hope, collaboration and

conﬁdence. At JKLC, we truly believe that our focus and

dedication, our hard work, our zeal to improve our

performance and our relentless pursuit of excellence

will help us in tackling these uncertain times and we will

come out of this successfully. I have complete

conﬁdence that even in perhaps tougher times to come,

we will take our performance to an even higher notch to

emerge unscathed and shining out of these uncertain

times.

The Board of Directors approved payment of an Interim

`

Total Dividend outgo has been 46.10 Crore (including

`

Dividend Distribution Tax of 7.86 Crore). No further

st

Financial Year 2019-20 ended 31 March 2020.

PERFORMANCE

Financial Year 2019-20 was a difficult year for the Industry

and Economy on many counts. First, there were elections in

the first quarter, followed by an unusually prolonged

monsoon stretching into the third quarter of the year. Usually

a good monsoon is a precursor to an uptick in rural demand

but India being part of global economy could not have

remained insulated from the turmoil of global slowdown.

In the last quarter when the demand was showing signs of

picking up, sudden hit due to COVID-19 in March 2020 not

only brought down the quarterly figures but also dashed all

the hopes of revival of demand in the near future.

The Industry witnessed a fall in demand of 6% - 7% during

the Financial Year 2019-20. The Company's combined

sales of Cement and Clinker fell by 5% over the previous

year and Cement capacity utilizations fell marginally due to

incremental capacity addition. Managing volatility and

fluctuation in the prices of key raw materials such as PET

Coke, Coal, Fly Ash etc. is a continuous process and are

leveraged to retain our position to be one of the least cost

producers. During the year, average pet coke prices fell by

about 12% whereas there was a reduction of 2% in power

costs. Over the past year, the Company has single-mindedly

focused on improving its operational efficiencies at all levels

and maximizing its Realisation per tonne by optimising the

product mix, introduction of new brands and augmenting

the existing distribution network, thus resulting in the net

Sales realization to improve by 8%.

Further, despite lower production, the Company maintained

its efficiency parameters including with respect to fuel

and power consumption to an optimum level. The

commissioning of the Waste Heat Recovery Power Plant of

7.5 MW in the Financial Year 2018-19 and 20 MW Thermal

Power Plant in the Financial Year 2019-20 has enabled the

Company to contain its power cost at the Durg Plant. The

cost of logistics, a derivative of global oil prices, is the single

biggest cost element in our operations. By optimising dumps

and modes of transportation and encouraging direct

dispatches aided by the GST regime, the Company was able

to bring down the logistics cost by 11%.

The Company registered an EBIDTA of 722.46 Crore as

`

against 472.16 Crore in the previous financial year,

`

while the Net Profit topped 236.11 Crore as against

`

` 80.10 Crore in the corresponding previous period.

Creditably, the Company improved its Debt Equity ratio to

0.86 in Financial Year 2019-20 from 1.06 in Financial Year

2018-19.

PROGRESS OF THE PROJECTS & EXPANSIONS

During Financial Year 2019-20, the Company successfully

commissioned a new Grinding Unit with an annual capacity

of 0.8 Million tonnes at Cuttack, Odisha and a 20 MW

Captive Thermal Power Plant at Durg, Chhattisgarh.

Expansion of Waste Heat Recovery Project in Jaykaypuram,

Sirohi with an annual capacity of 10 MW is in full swing and

is expected to be commissioned in July 2021.

OUTLOOK FOR INDIAN ECONOMY, INDUSTRY

purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is

evaluated based on each segments profit or loss and is measured consistently with profit or loss in the financial

statements.

(21) Recent accounting pronouncements

(i) New and amended standards

The Company applied Ind AS 116 Leases for the first time. The nature and effect of the changes as a result of

adoption of these new accounting standard is described below.

(a) Ind AS 116 Leases

Ind AS 116 supersedes Ind AS 17 Leases including its appendices (Appendix C of Ind AS 17 Determining

whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, Appendix A of Ind AS 17 Operating Leases-Incentives and

Appendix B of Ind AS 17 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease). The

standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and

requires lessees to recognise most leases on the balance sheet.

Lessor accounting under Ind AS 116 is substantially unchanged from Ind AS 17. Lessors will continue to

classify leases as either operating or finance leases using similar principles as in Ind AS 17. Therefore, Ind

AS 116 does not have an impact for leases where the Company is the lessor.

The Company adopted Ind AS 116 using the modified retrospective method with the date of initial

application of April 1, 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative

effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date of initial application. The Company elected to

use the transition practical expedient to not reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease at April 1,

2019. Instead, the Company applied the standard only to contracts that were previously identified as leases

applying Ind AS 17 and Appendix C to Ind AS 17 at the date of initial application.

Accordingly, the comparatives have not been restated and hence not comparable with previous period

figures.

As a result of adoption of Ind AS 116, Depreciation expenditure and finance cost is higher by ` 2.23

crore & ` 1.34 crore and Rent expenditure is decreased ` 2.89 crore

1.3 Investment in Equity Shares

Investment in Equity Securities are initially measured at cost. Any subsequent fair value gain or loss is recognized

through Statement of Profit and Loss if such investments in Equity Securities are held for trading purposes. The fair

value gains or losses of all other Equity Securities are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income.

1.4 Investment in Associates, Joint Ventures and Subsidiaries

The Group has accounted for its investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture at cost.

1.5 Derecognition of Financial Assets

A Financial Asset is primarily derecognized when:

•

The right to receive cash flows from asset has expired, or

•

The Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay

the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a “pass-through” arrangement

and either:

a)

The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or

b)

The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has

transferred control of the asset.

When the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass through

arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has

neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the

asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement.

In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability

are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of

the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be

required to repay.

2.

Financial Liabilities

2.1 Definition

Financial liabilities include Long-term and Short-term Loans and Borrowings, Trade and Other payables and

Other eligible Current and Non-current Liabilities.

(a) Initial Recognition and Measurement

All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and

payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank

overdrafts, and derivative financial instruments.

(b) Subsequent Measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below :

i)

Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading. The

Group has not designated any financial liabilities upon initial measurement recognition at fair value

through profit or loss. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are at each reporting date at

fair value with all the changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

ii)

Financial Liabilities measured at Amortized Cost

After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at

amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (‘’EIR’’) except for those designated in an

effective hedging relationship. The carrying value of borrowings that are designated as hedged items in

fair value hedges that would otherwise be carried at amortized cost are adjusted to record changes in

fair values attributable to the risks that are hedged in effective hedging relationship.

Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or

costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance costs in the

Statement of Profit and Loss.:

Managing Director (Chief Operating

Decision Maker).

The Chief Operational Decision Maker monitors the operating results of its business Segments separately for the

purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is

evaluated based on each segments profit or loss and is measured consistently with profit or loss in the financial

statements.

(21) Recent accounting pronouncements

(i)

New and amended standards

The Group applied Ind AS 116 Leases for the first time. The nature and effect of the changes as a result of

adoption of these new accounting standard is described below.

(a) Ind AS 116 Leases

Ind AS 116 supersedes Ind AS 17 Leases including its appendices (Appendix C of Ind AS 17 Determining

whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, Appendix A of Ind AS 17 Operating Leases-Incentives and

Appendix B of Ind AS 17 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease).

The standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of

leases and requires lessees to recognise most leases on the balance sheet.

Lessor accounting under Ind AS 116 is substantially unchanged from Ind AS 17. Lessors will continue to

classify leases as either operating or finance leases using similar principles as in Ind AS 17. Therefore,

Ind AS 116 does not have an impact for leases where the Groupis the lessor.

The Group adopted Ind AS 116 using the modified retrospective method with the date of initial

application of April 1, 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the

cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date of initial application. The

Group elected to use the transition practical expedient to not reassess whether a contract is or contains a

lease at April 1, 2019. Instead, the Group applied the standard only to contracts that were previously

identified as leases applying Ind AS 17 and Appendix C to Ind AS 17 at the date of initial application.

Accordingly, the comparatives have not been restated and hence not comparable with previous period

figures.

As a result of adoption of Ind AS 116, Depreciation expenditure and finance cost is higher by ` 2.23

crore & ` 1.34 crore and Rent expenditure is decreased ` 2.89 crore.

(b) Amendment to existing issued Ind AS

i)

Appendix C to Ind AS 12, Income Taxes - Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments

ii)

Amendments to Ind AS 19, Employee Benefits - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement

iii) Amendment to Ind AS 12, Income Taxes

iv) Amendment to Ind AS 23, Borrowing costs

The effect on adoption of above mentioned amendments were insignificant on the financial statements

of the Group

(c) Accounting Standards, Interpretations and amendments to existing standards that are Effective

st

from 1 April, 2020.

During the year Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) hasn’t issued any Standard which has been

applicable from April 01, 2020.:
