a condition of ‘payment of an amount 80% of the average

despatch of iron ore being payable along with the royalty

and all other applicable taxes’.

The impact of the said additional condition makes

NMDC’s mining operation at Donimalai unviable, the

of the State of Karnataka. Both have opined that the

condition being imposed by the Government of Karnataka

is without the authority of law.

Karnataka at various levels, including the Chief Minister

of the State by CMD. In spite of continuous follow-up,

no positive response has come from the Government of

Karnataka. Pending the decision on the representation by

the Karnataka Govt., the operations have been temporarily

suspended. In the circumstances, NMDC was left with no

other remedy than approaching the Hon’ble High Court of

Karnataka by filing a Writ Petition; and, as directed, the

WP No. 53514 of 2018 was filed on 29.11.2018.

After hearing the arguments of both the parties, the

Division Bench of Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka on

26-02-2019, reserved the matter for judgment. The

Division Bench of the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka,

Bangalore pronounced the judgement on 10.07.2019.

letter issued by Monitoring committee and as per the guidelines given by Hon’ble Supreme Court of India,

Pellet plant is paying Basic value, Royalty Value and bulk permit fee value to MC and GST amount to NMDC Donimalai

account. After receipt of GST amount from Pellet Plant, DIOM/KIOM is issuing advance receipt confirming the receipt

of GST from Pellet Plant along with necessary statutory Documents to MC in the prescribed format. Based on the

advance receipt issued by DIOM/KIOM, Monitoring Committee is issuing bulk permit to Pellet Plant for lifting of

materials. DIOM/KIOM is raising Tax invoice on Pellet Plant for the dispatched quantity, showing it as sales and also

paying GST to Government.

Simultaneously, Pellet Plant is recognizing the same as purchases and availing input credit. The above procedure is

followed due to Compulsion made by MC as they have denied permission for Pellet Plant to lift the Iron Ore without

participating in auction and accordingly, separate GST registration is also taken as per MC instructions.

However, the entry for un-realized profit on sale of Iron Ore to Pellet Plant is accounted.

2.34.14 Review for Impairment of Investment in Legacy Iron Ore Ltd, Australia (LIOL):

The total investment of the Company in LIOL is ` 214.70 Crores as on 31.3.2020 which is 92.32% of the total

shareholding (Previous year ` 168.53 Crores which is 78.56% of the total shareholding). The Company has examined

the investment for impairment with reference to Ind AS 36 and noted that the period of exploration has not expired

and the exploration activities are being continued and the company has not reached the stage of establishing

commercial viability of the tenements. It is also pertinent to mention here that NMDC has further infused an equity of

` 46.17 Crores during the current financial year 2019-2020 for continuing the exploration activity.

Further, it is noted that LIOL has recognized exploration and evaluation assets of `54.77 Crores (A$ 11.46 million) as

on 31.3.2020. For an exploration company the future cash flows are from the exploration tenements which have been

recognized as assets ie. Exploration and Evaluation assets (E&E assets). LIOL had also tested the E&E assets for

impairment and concluded that there is no indication for impairment of E&E assets after testing the compliance of

the following conditions:.

1.

The rights to tenure of the area of interest are current and

2.

The exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected to be recouped thorough successful development and

exploration of the area of interest, or alternatively, by the sale and

3.

exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not, at the reporting date, reached a stage which

permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and

active and significant operations in or in relation to the area of interest are continuing.:
