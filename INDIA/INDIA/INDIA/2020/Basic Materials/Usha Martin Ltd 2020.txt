to Rs. 2,488.25 Cr and Rs. 1,708.03 Cr respectively in the previous year.

in previous year.

A detailed discussion on review of operations of the Company has been

included in Management Discussion and Analysis which forms part of

this Report.

Update On Covid-19 Pandemic

Towards the end of financial year 2019-20, the entire global economy

faced an unprecedented disruption, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The pandemic has resulted in interrupted supply chain, halted

production and lock-down. With Covid-19 situation escalating, the

Company had proactively rolled-out a slew of measures to ensure health

and safety of its employees including suspending production at all its

manufacturing facilities by end of March 2020. Ensuring stringent safety

protocols for employee wellbeing, the Company reopened, in a gradual

manner, all its manufacturing facilities towards the end of April 2020.

The Company is proactively adapting to the changing business needs

and will stay prepared dynamically to do course correction if and when

required.

Dividend & Reserves

The Board of Directors has decided it would be prudent not to

recommend dividend for the year under review nor do they propose to

carry any amount to reserves.

Slump Sale of Steel Business Undertaking

Pursuant to the business transfer agreement executed with Tata Sponge

Iron Limited (now known as Tata Steel Long Products Limited) with an

objective to deleverage the Balance Sheet of the Company, the transfer

of the Steel Business Undertaking including iron-ore and coal mines

of the Company by way of slump sale on going concern basis was

completed during the year under review.

Outlook and Business

With adverse impact of Covid-19 on both domestic and international

economy, the overall outlook for fiscal 2020-21 is expected to remain

uncertain. The major challenge for the Company is to remain agile and

responsive to the changing market needs and focus upon increasing

market share in high contributory products such as crane, elevator,

mining and bridge ropes. LRPC strands and GP ropes are expected to

continue to remain growth drivers for the Company.

TPM & Quality

WWR division’s Quality Management System Certification has

transitioned from ISO 9001:2008 to ISO 9001:2015. The Environmental

Management System (EMS) Certification has transitioned from ISO

14001:2004 to ISO 14001:2015. Approval of manufacturing (AOM) by

DNV-GL, ABS & Lloyd’s are in place. The organization is licensed for

manufacture of ropes under API Spec 9A. The Company has product

certification by SNI of Indonesia, InMetro of Brazil, and SONCAP of

Nigeria & CCS of China. LRPC product is certified by ACRS of Australia

& Testing Laboratory has accreditation under ISO 17025: 2017. In order

to strengthen our basic systems, the concept of Business Excellence is

being pursued. Concepts like Daily Routine Work Management, Kaizen

Management, Cost Reduction Ideas and Fuguai Management have:

unabsorbed depreciation and brought forward business losses that would be available to the continuing business for set off against long-term capital gain (LTCG) that

would arise from sale of SBB Business and against future taxable income of the continuing business. Pursuant to sale of SBB business during the year, the Company has

utilised such deferred tax assets against LTCG arising from sale of SBB Business. Management believes that balance DTA of Rs. 4,293 lakhs will be recovered against

future taxable income that will arise from operations of the continuing business.

Reasons of loss or inadequate profits :

The external environment in the global economy as well as Indian economy continued to remain challenging. Slow growth in

the economy, huge debt burden in earlier years along with working capital crunch continued to adversely impact the Companys

performance.

2.

Steps taken or proposed to be taken for improvement :

With an objective to deleverage the balance sheet of the Company, the Company had entered into a business transfer agreement

with Tata Steel Long Products Limited (formerly Tata Sponge Iron Limited) for transfer of the Steel Business Undertaking (inter

alia comprising of steel manufacturing facility, an operative iron ore mine, coal mine under development, captive power plants,

plant and machinery of straight bar facility) of the Company by way of slump sale on going concern basis. A significant portion

of debt has been repaid by the Company after receiving cash consideration from Tata Steel Long Products Limited towards sale

of Steel Business Undertaking. In the aftermath of sale of the steel business undertaking, the Company is steadily consolidating

its raw material coverage position from various sources and no crisis is envisaged due to raw material shortage. Growth momentum

in the domestic economy as well as global recovery are expected to help reinforce the Wire and Wire Rope business. The Company

also continues to invest as part of its long term cost optimization plans in plant equipment, infrastructure facilities and

strengthening systems & processes.:
