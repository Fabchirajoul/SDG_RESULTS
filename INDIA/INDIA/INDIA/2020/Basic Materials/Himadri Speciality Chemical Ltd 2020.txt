I am optimistic

that even in the

face of all the

challenges that

2020 has in store,

this extraordinary

year will mark

the beginning

of a remarkable

chapter in

the history of

Himadri.: Dear Stakeholders,

Optimism is a mindset; it is an

attitude that holds the ability of

rewriting future. At Himadri, our

constant focus is on improving

business performance every

year through a prudent decision-

making process. This focus is

rightly guided by years of research

and specialised competencies in

the markets we operate. Despite

business uncertainties and

challenges, we are continuously

growing our market share while

maintaining our leadership

position.

The FY 2019-20 has been

a challenging year from a

macroeconomic perspective.

Changes in the worldwide

macroeconomic environment had

already flattened the economic

momentum early in the business

year. The radical change in the

trade policies of the United States

did more than just question the

industrialised world’s economic

system, which so far was based

on globalisation. Many of the

challenges that we faced in

the previous year, persisted in

FY 2019-20 as well. Moreover,

continued softness in the Chinese

economy, reduced automotive

sales in China, Europe, the UK and

Japan, impacted demand for raw

materials that we produce.

But even amidst such scenario, I

am pleased with our operational

performance against the

backdrop of a gradual economic

recovery. We analysed the long-

term positioning of all our key

business segments in the past,

in view of such challenges in the

economy. Our timely investments

What is your take on

the industy scenario and

emerging opportunities?

The Indian speciality chemical

industry is perfectly positioned to

capitalise on near-term and long-

term opportunities. It tells a story

of outperformance, determination,

promise and optimism. The

industry remains an attractive hub

of opportunities, even amidst an

environment of global uncertainty.

The disruption in the global supply

chains centred around China,

clubbed with the worsening global

sentiment against it, has prompted

numerous global majors to explore

options to diversify production

to other countries. This presents

itself as a perfect environment

thriving with potential and

prospects and could lead to near-

term opportunities for chemical

companies in India.

As we tide over these difficult times

and come out leaner, stronger and

more robust than ever, we remain

confident and optimistic about our

growth story.

about resources to be allocated to the segments

and assess their performance. The Company has

currently two reportable segments (a) Carbon

materials and chemicals; and (b) Power.

(v) Contingent liabilities

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that

arises from past events whose existence will be

confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence

of one or more uncertain future events beyond

the control of the Company or a present

obligation that is not recognised because it is

not probable that an outflow of resources will be

required to settle the obligation. The Company

does not recognise a contingent liability but

discloses its existence in the Standalone financial

statements.

(w) Exceptional items

When the items of income and expense within

profit or loss are of such size, nature and

incidence that their disclosure is relevant to

explain the performance of the Company for the

period, the nature and amount of such items is

disclosed separately as exceptional items. Such

items are material by nature or amount to the
