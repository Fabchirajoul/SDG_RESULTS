Dear Shareholders

“While we remain cautiously optimistic

in our perspective of how demand will

play out, we remain committed to staying

viable and sustainable across market

cycles.”: Dear Shareholders,

It is our Diamond Jubilee Year!!

A long journey from where Mr. K.P.

Goenka started the Company for

import substitution, now what we call

“Atmanirbhar”. My warmest greetings to

all of you!!

We began our Diamond Jubilee journey

with confidence and performed

reasonably well during the first three

quarters and then with the rest of the

world came a never-before situation – the

pandemic – which jolted the local and

global markets.

Tough times bring about the best in

a prudently-managed Company and

despite the gloom it is doing its best to

restore production at all factories and

ready to reach valued customers across

the globe. The situation, however, is still

fluid, but we definitely see rays of hope to

revive our 60-year old competitive journey

as India’s first and the largest manufacturer

of carbon black.

The Directors’ Report gives details of your

Company’s performance in a memorable

year.

From a strategic perspective, your

Company spread its presence through four

manufacturing facilities across regions and

broad based its products portfolio thus

enhancing its revenue visibility and margins.

The outcome of these efforts is reflected

in the strength of our Balance Sheet.

PCBL finished the year-under-review

with a gross debt-equity ratio of 0.36

corresponding to a net worth of C1692

Crore. It gives me great pleasure that your

Company is extensively under-leveraged

and is in a position to protect the integrity

of its fundamentals during a period of

slow down across the world.

For a number of years, PCBL has invested in

cutting-edge research and development.

Our research aims at enhancing the

efficiency of our manufacturing process,

widened our portfolio and enhanced

product attributes. You will be happy

that Sushila Goenka Innovation Centre at

Belgium has since become operational,

strengthening our competitive position

during a difficult time.

The Board of Directors declared an Interim

Dividend at the rate of 350%, ie C7 per

equity share of C2 each for the financial

year ended 31st March, 2020, which

includes a special Dividend at the rate of

175% on the occasion of Diamond Jubilee

Year of the Company.

Once again, thank you for your sustained

support.

Managing Director, engaged in day-long strategic virtual conferences

focusing on operations, communications, cash flow management, capex and training. The leadership engaged with

employees on email, assuring them that the management was handling the situation in the best possible way.

Plant initiatives

PCBL re-arranged seating arrangements at DCS, laboratories and offices to

reconcile workplace discipline with the need for social distancing. A disinfecting

channel in the plants helped sanitize persons and materials entering the

premises. A growing focus on automation is expected to minimize human

interaction and dependence in plant operations. The proposed development

of Digital Knowledge Management System and Documentation System

will comprise the standardization of operating procedures, knowledge

documentation of plants functions and assigning relevant responsibilities to

identified stakeholders. The company created training programmes in pandemic

management and safety precautions for truck drivers and contract workers.

(DIN: 00009497)

Place:- Kolkata

Date:- 23rd June, 2020

* According to Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013, the minimum amount that the Company was required to spend as a part of Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) was H6.77

Crores for the year ending on 31 March, 2020. According to the General Circular No. 10/2020 dated 23 March 2020 and Office Memorandum. No. CSR-05/1/2020-CSR-MCA, dated

28-3-2020 issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”), it was clarified that any contribution to Prime Minister's Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund'

(“PM CARES Fund”), set up with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation such as that posed by COVID 19 pandemic, shall qualify as CSR

expenditure under the Companies Act, 2013.

Further, an appeal was sent by the Secretary of MCA on 30 March 2020 (D.O. No.05/1/2020 – CSR – MCA) to contribute generously to the PM CARES Fund. It further urged to contribute

over and above the minimum prescribed amount, even if the companies had already contributed the prescribed amount towards CSR. Further, it stated that such excess amount

can later be offset against the CSR obligation arising in subsequent years, if the companies so desire. Accordingly, for the year ended 31st March 2020, the Company contributed a

sum of H10 Crores to the PM CARES Fund and H1 crore in registered trust for carrying out CSR activities. The Company, before making such contribution to the PM CARES Fund and

registered trust, had already spent H82.25 Lakhs on its other CSR activities. Hence, a total of H11.82 Crores was spent on CSR activities for the year ended 31 March, 2020, spending an

extra amount of H5.05 Crores for FY 2019-20. In view of the above representation made by the MCA, the Company is to treat the excess CSR expenditure of H5.05 Crores to be actually

spent in the subsequent years and would be treated to be offset against the future CSR obligations.

domiciled in India and is incorporated under the provisions of

the Companies Act applicable in India. The Company is primarily

engaged in the business of manufacturing & sale of carbon black

Stock Exchange of India Limited and The Calcutta Stock Exchange

Limited. The registered office of the Company is located at Duncan

These standalone financials statements were approved and

authorised for issue in accordance with resolution of the Board of

Directors on June 23, 2020.

1.

Basis of Preparation and Other Significant

Accounting Policies

1.1.1. Compliance with Ind AS

These standalone financial statements comply in all material

respects with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified

under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’) [Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] and other relevant

provisions of the Act. These standards and policies have been

consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise

stated. The standalone financial statements are presented in Indian

Rupee (H), which is the Company’s functional and presentation

currency.

1.1.2. Historical cost convention

These standalone financial statements have been prepared on a

historical cost basis, except the following, which are measured at

fair values:-

i)

certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative

instruments);

ii)

Plan assets of defined benefit employee benefit plans

1.1.3. Current versus Non-current Classification

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet

based on current/non-current classification.

An asset is classified as current when it is:

a.

expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in

the normal operating cycle,

b.

held primarily for the purpose of trading,

c.

expected to be realised within twelve months after the

reporting period, or

d.

cash or cash equivalents unless restricted from being

exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months

after the reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is classified as current when:

a.

it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle,

b.

it is held primarily for the purpose of trading,

c.

it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting

period, or

d.

there is no unconditional right to defer settlement of the

liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for

processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The

Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.

1.2.

Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes

in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets

may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for

the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its

recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an

asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing

value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their

present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current

market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific

to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent

market transactions are taken into account. For the purpose of

assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for

which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are

largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups

of assets (cash-generating units).

1.3.

Other financial assets (other than Investments)

1.3.1. Classification

The Company classifies its financial assets in the following

measurement categories:

a)

those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through

other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and

b)

those measured at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the Company’s business model for

managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of cash

flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses is either recorded

in the statement of profit and loss or other comprehensive income.

1.3.2. Measurement

At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its

fair value plus, in the case of financial asset not at fair value through

profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the

acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial

1. Basis of Preparation and Other Significant

Accounting Policies

1.1.1. Compliance with Ind AS

These consolidated financial statements comply in all material

respects with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified

under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’) [Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] and other relevant

provisions of the Act. These standards and policies have been

consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise

stated. The consolidated financial statements are presented in

1.1.2. Historical cost convention

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a

historical cost basis, except the following, which are measured at

fair values: -

instruments).

1.1.3. Principles of Consolidation

a.

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over

which the Company has control. The Company controls an

entity when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable

returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability

to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant

activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from

the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They

are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group combines the financial statements of the parent

and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of

assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany

transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions

between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses

are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of

an impairment of the transferred asset.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries

are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit

and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and

consolidated balance sheet respectively.

b. The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests

that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equity

owners of the Group. A change in ownership results in an

adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling

and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests

in any subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the

adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration

paid or received is recognised within equity.

c.

The subsidiary companies considered in the financial statements are as follows:
