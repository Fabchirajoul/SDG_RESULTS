STATUTORY REPORTS

Notice for AGM:

Dear Shareholders,

The pandemic of COVID-19 has proven

to be a critical turning point in the

history of human race and is set to

reshape the global society. Despite its

challenges, the pandemic has

presented an opportunity for all of us

to introspect and rediscover new

opportunities, rebuild our

environment, and re-establish our

economy. The world needs to embrace

more responsible and sustainable

choices for future generations. I am

hopeful that with appropriate action

aided by modern technology, things

will soon turn around.

All through the year, we ensured that

business was operated with a sharp

JSL’s digital journey further

accelerated in FY 2019-20. The

Company opted for a benchmarked

omni channel commerce solution by

adopting Hybris e-commerce. This

interactive and transparent tool

provides a 360 degree dashboard

view to our customers in real-time,

thereby cementing their trust and

engagement with the Company. JSL is

committed to moving towards a digital

manufacturing ecosystem and

creating value for all its business

partners.

focus on safety, while maintaining

proﬁtability and a consistent drive to

optimize operational costs. JSL

demonstrated stronger operating

parameters with improved internal

capabilities, ﬁt to cater to customers

with ever-evolving demand. Our R&D

has enabled us to match global

benchmarks for our products in the

industry, and that has facilitated JSL

to be amongst one of the preferred

manufacturers and suppliers of

stainless steel in the world.

Consistent efforts to expand our

product portfolio in railways,

hollowware, white goods, pipe & tube,

and auto segments have yielded

promising results. New grades and

variants were developed for lift and

elevator segment, metro coach

application, and railway foot-over-

bridge application, among others. On

the operational front, JSL

implemented Level-2 automation of

Argon Oxygen Decarburization (AOD)

converter, which led to ~10 %

improvement in productivity of this

unit. Your Company successfully

commissioned a 25 MT induction

furnace which further resulted in a

cleaner, energy-efﬁcient melting

process. JSL’s melt production

capacity now stands at 1.1 MTPA.

JSL is actively engaged in developing

a comprehensive ecosystem for

stainless steel in India. We have

further expanded our reach to premier

institutions like IIT Kharagpur and

introduced courses on stainless steel.

Around 300 students have enrolled

for the course in the ﬁrst year of its

roll-out. JSL continued to organize

Fabricator Training Programs across

India, beneﬁting over 9000 local

fabricators across 61 cities. Further,

various programs were conducted

along with MSMEs in several cities to

create awareness about these one-of-

a-kind fabrication programs. Special

showcase vans, displaying varied

applications of stainless steel in

industrial and home space, have been

developed by the Company. These

vans are now traversing across

several states in India, educating

existing and potential customer

segments on the beneﬁts of adopting

stainless steel. Our marketing

activities have also been advanced.

Jindal Saathi, a robust pipes & tubes

(P&T) marketing plan was activated in

July’19 through multiple media

vehicles along with on-ground

activation. The campaign was driven

through print, radio, OOH, and digital

media vehicles to drive awareness on

the originality of JSL products

through the Jindal Saathi seal. A third

party survey conducted after the

completion of this campaign has

revealed that more than 60%

fabricators and distributors in the

market now recognize this seal of

trust. Riding on a successful

campaign last year, we are now

planning the second phase of

marketing activities in FY21 for P&T

segment. Our customer MOU scheme

in FY19-20 performed well with more

than 87% of MOU volumes being

achieved despite disruption due to

lockdown. The continuous success of

this scheme is a testimony to our

trustworthy relations with customers.

As a leader of this esteemed

organization, I am extremely proud of

our employees who continuously

demonstrate high standards of

professionalism. Time and again, they

have proven their mettle through

relentless efforts that lead the

organisation out of challenging

situations. At JSL, we remain grateful

to our Board of Directors,

shareholders, lenders, business

associates, customers, and all the

stakeholders for their continued

patronage in making JSL what it is

today.

Our business prospects are linked to

the containment and effective

treatment of COVID-19. Additionally,

government policies across the globe

will play a critical role in reviving the

world economy. The state of domestic

stainless steel industry is linked to

this economic revival. India has

performed admirably when confronted

by a crisis in the past. I am optimistic

that with government’s clarion call for

‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’, we will work

towards reviving the domestic

manufacturing sector and build a self

reliant nation. For us at JSL, we are

ready to turn this challenge into a

competitive opportunity. With this, I

reiterate my optimism and stand by

the growth prospects of stainless

steel.

Managing Director. Events

like Utsav gave an opportunity to bring together our employees to bond better and extend the gratitude to the actual

support system – their families. Further, our engagement with employees in last Financial Year continued to strengthen

through the Climate Survey, which was launched to solicit their opinions, perceptions and feelings regarding the

organisation’s environment.

As a performance-driven organization, we recently introduced the concept of Continuous Performance Management

(CPM). The process of quarterly goal setting coupled with regular check-ins and coaching brings in focus the significance

of the dialogue between the Manager and his direct Reports on the functional priorities and the results, thereby

enabling employees to perform at their optimum levels.

The graduate engineering trainees (GET) hired from leading engineering & diploma colleges across India, went through

our flagship program - ARISE. The 9-months induction program was launched with an objective to “Shape Stainless

Engineers” of the future while preparing them for the transition from academic to the corporate world.

Learning & Development has been an important focus area with the objective to ‘build a strong Learning culture,

inspiring individuals to expand their capabilities & maximize their performance in their career at Jindal Stainless’. We

completed the 12 month journey of Masterful Management, a flagship leadership development program for middle

managers that focused on leadership capabilities for the changing business landscape. Capability of our workmen is

enhanced continually with technical programs like Arohan as well as through Pratigyan - a unique up skilling and

empowerment initiative for women. Leveraging the power of technology, our online courses ensured that we could

focus on the learning and development of all employees, despite location or lockdown constraints.

In our effort to ensure prevention of any form of sexual harassment and to be more inclusive and safer for female

employees, online module on POSH was launched across all management levels. The objective of the module is to

create awareness amongst employees regarding the subject and to reiterate our commitment towards becoming

a 'zero tolerance organization’ against sexual harassment of women at workplace.

The efforts to have world class people practices are also recognized by the industry with several awards we have won

in FY20, Business World Best Learning and Development Practise Award 2019, Workers Education Award 2019 and

Manufacturing Today Awards 2019 in the Platinum category, to name a few. We are committed to make JSL the most

preferred organisation to work for in the manufacturing sector.

Way Forward

Several internal and external factors augur well for the Company’s future. Today, JSL enjoys a deep repository of

experience of decade’s, a comprehensive pan-India and global distribution network, a large team of experienced and

professionally-run human resource and a well-diversified product portfolio of stainless steel products.

Over the years, the Company has not only undertaken initiatives to increase its overall capacities and distribution

network, but has also made significant efforts to strengthen its balance sheet. Going ahead, JSL remains focused on:
