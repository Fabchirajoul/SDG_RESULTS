STANDALONE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2020:

letter of credit which can be called upon if the

counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.

Impairment is made on the expected credit losses, which are the present value of the cash shortfalls over the expected life

of financial assets. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit

risk. The estimated impairment losses are recognised in a separate provision for impairment and the impairment losses are

recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Subsequent changes in assessment of impairment are recognised in provision for impairment and the change in impairment

losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

For foreign currency trade receivable, impairment is assessed after reinstatement at closing rates.

Individual receivables which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount of trade receivable

and the amount of the loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to other Income

NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Investment in equity instruments

Investment in equity securities are initially measured at fair value. Any subsequent fair value gain or loss is recognized through

Profit or Loss if such investments in equity securities are held for trading purposes. The fair value gains or losses of all other

equity securities are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. Where the company’s management has elected to present

fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair

value gains and losses to profit and loss. Dividends from such investments are recognised in profit and loss as other income

when the company’s right to receive payments is established. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity

investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

De-recognition of financial asset

A financial asset is derecognised only when

•

The company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or

•

Retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay

the cash flows to one or more recipients.

Where the entity has transferred an asset, the company evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards

of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. Where the entity has not transferred

substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised.

Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the

financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the company has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the

company retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement

in the financial asset.

b)

Financial liabilities

At initial recognition, all financial liabilities other than fair valued through profit and loss are recognised initially at fair value less

transaction costs that are attributable to the issue of financial liability. Transaction costs of financial liability carried at fair value

through profit or loss is expensed in profit or loss.

i)

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading. The Company has not designated

any financial liabilities upon initial measurement recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities at fair value

through profit or loss are at each reporting date at fair value with all the changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and

Loss.

Borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at

amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised

in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan

facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be

drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable

that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised

over the period of the facility to which it relates.

Borrowings are derecognised from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or

expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another

party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the statement

of profit and loss.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for

atleast twelve months after reporting period.

Trade and other payables

A payable is classified as ’trade payable’ if it is in respect of the amount due on account of goods purchased or services received

in the normal course of business. These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to

the end of financial year which are unpaid. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not

due within 12 months after the reporting period. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at

amortised cost using the effective interest method.

De-recognition of financial liability

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. The difference

between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the

consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the statement of profit and

loss.

iv. Hon'ble Supreme Court judgement dated February 28, 2019 relating to the provident fund, has been evaluated and

assessed based on legal opinion, the Company has arrived at the conclusion that there is no significant impact of this

matter and accordingly no provision is made in the books of accounts.

It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigations with accuracy, the Company believes, based on legal

opinions received, that it has meritorious defences to the claims. The management believe the pending actions will not

require outflow of resources embodying economic benefits and will not have a material adverse effect upon the results

of the operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2020

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Corporate and General Information

Jindal SAW Limited (“JSAW” or ‘’Parent’’) is domiciled and incorporated in India and its shares are publicly traded on the National

Stock Exchange (‘NSE’) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (‘BSE’), in India. The registered office of JSAW is situated at A-1, UPSIDC

Industrial Area, Nandgaon Road, Kosi Kalan, District Mathura, 281403 (U.P.) India

Under Companies Act, 2013, Group is defined as parent, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. For the purpose of these

financial statements, the aforesaid definition under Companies Act, 2013 has been considered.

Group is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of Iron & Steel pipe products, fittings and accessories with manufacturing

facilities in India, USA, Europe and UAE. Its products have application in oil and gas exploration, transportation, power generation,

supply of water for drinking, drainage, irrigation purposes and other industrial applications.

2.

Basis of preparation

The Consolidated financial statements comply in all material aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (IND AS) notified under

Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ( the Act) [ Companies ( Indian Accounting Standards ) Rules, 2015] and other relevant

provisions of the Act.

The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies used in the preparation for all periods presented.

The Significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements are set out in Note 3 of the Notes

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

3.

Significant Accounting Policies

3.1

Basis of Measurement

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on accrual basis and under the historical cost convention except

following which have been measured at fair value:

•

Certain financial assets and liabilities except certain Investments and borrowings carried at amortised cost,

•

assets held for sale - measured at fair value less cost of disposal,

•

defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at fair value,

•

derivative financial instruments.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (`), which is the Group’s functional and Group’s

presentation currency and all amounts are rounded to the nearest lakhs (` 00,000) and two decimals thereof, except as stated

otherwise.

3.2 Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Actual results could vary

from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting

estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision effects only that period or in the period

of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future years (refer Note 4 on significant accounting

estimates, assumptions and judgements).

3.3 Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements relate to Parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture and associate (‘Group’). Subsidiary

are those entities in which the Parent directly or indirectly, has interest more than 50% of the voting power or otherwise control

the composition of the board or governing body so as to obtain economic benefits from activities. The Group controls an

entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to

affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the

date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control or joint control. This is generally the

case where the group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Under Ind AS 111, Joint Arrangements, investments in

joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights

and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. The consolidated financial statements

have been prepared on the following basis:

a)

The financial statements of the subsidiaries are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the like items of assets,

liabilities, income and expenses after fully eliminating intra-group balances and intra-group transactions and unrealized profits

or losses in accordance with IND AS 110 –‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ notified under Section 133 of the Act, read with

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended time to time.

b)

Interest in associates and joint ventures are consolidated using equity method as per IND AS 28 - ‘Investment in Associates and

Joint Ventures’. Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter,

post-acquisition attributable profit/losses are adjusted in the carrying value of investment upto the Group investment in the joint

venture and associate.

c)

In the case of foreign subsidiaries, being non-integral foreign operations, revenue items are consolidated at the average

exchange rates prevailing during the year. All assets and liabilities are converted at rates prevailing at the end of the year.:

letter of credit which can be called upon if the

counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.

Impairment is made on the expected credit losses, which are the present value of the cash shortfalls over the expected life

of financial assets. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit

risk. The estimated impairment losses are recognised in a separate provision for impairment and the impairment losses are

recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Subsequent changes in assessment of impairment are recognised in provision for impairment and changes in impairment

losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses

For foreign currency trade receivable, impairment is assessed after reinstatement at closing rates.

Individual receivables which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount of trade receivable

and the amount of the loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to other Income.

Investment in equity instruments

Investment in equity securities are initially measured at fair value. Any subsequent fair value gain or loss is recognized through

Profit and Loss if such investments in equity securities are held for trading purposes. Fair value gains or losses of all other equity

securities are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. Where the Group’s management has elected to present fair value

gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value

gains and losses to profit and loss. Dividends from such investments are recognised in profit and loss as other income when the

Group’s right to receive payments is established. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments

measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

De-recognition of financial asset

A financial asset is derecognised only when

•

The Group has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or

•

Retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay

the cash flows to one or more recipients.

Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Group evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards

of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. Where the entity has not transferred

substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised.

Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the

financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the Group has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Group

retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement in the

financial asset.

b)

Financial Liabilities

At initial recognition, all financial liabilities other than fair valued through profit and loss are recognised initially at fair value less

transaction costs that are attributable to the issue of financial liability. Transaction costs of financial liability carried at fair value

through profit or loss is expensed in profit or loss.

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss include financial liabilities held for trading. The Group has not designated

any financial liabilities upon initial measurement recognition at fair value through profit and loss. Financial liabilities at fair value

through profit and loss are accounted at each reporting date at fair value with all the changes recognized in the Statement of

Profit and Loss.
