MANAGING DIRECTOR: Dear Stakeholders,

For the aluminium and copper industry, ﬁ scal 2020 was

characterised by the turbulence caused by the ongoing

US-China trade war, the price volatility on the London Metal

Exchange and the impact of Covid-19 on global trade

and markets. Despite these headwinds, Hindalco stood

out and delivered a strong performance. It was a clear

demonstration of how Hindalco’s sustained focus on cost

control, operational efﬁ ciencies and future-prooﬁ ng the

business model has served to energise our performance.

We recorded yet another year of best-ever ﬁ nancial and

operational results, bolstered by a record performance

by Novelis and stability in the Indian businesses. Our

performance was driven by the highest-ever production and

shipment of aluminium upstream and copper value-added

products coupled with higher shipments of beverage cans

by Novelis.

Our EBITDA margins in FY20 were one of the best in the

industry. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and

we brought down the consolidated Net Debt-to-EBITDA

to 2.61 times at the end of FY 2020. This was a validation

of our core strategies and objectives and exempliﬁ ed the

success of our integrated business model. It is also a

testament to our consistent focus on operational excellence

and our commitment to creating long-term value for all our

stakeholders.

DELIVERING VALUE CONSISTENTLY

FY20 was a remarkable year with Novelis delivering its best-

ever performance and the domestic aluminium business

showing sustained performance. As a result, we crossed a

number of operational and ﬁ nancial milestones, clocking the

highest-ever:

•

Metal production of 1,314 Kt and sales of 1,290 Kt for

Hindalco Aluminium

•

EBITDA margin at an industry high of 17% for Hindalco

•

Adjusted EBITDA of $1,472 million at Novelis

•

Adjusted EBITDA/tonne of $450 at Novelis

Senior Management : As decided by the Board.

III.

Business and Talent Competitors

We benchmark our executive pay practices and

levels against peer companies in similar industries,

geographies and of similar size. In addition, we

look at secondary reference (internal and external)

benchmarks in order to ensure that pay policies and

levels across the Group are broadly equitable and

support the Group’s global mobility objectives for

executive talent. Secondary reference points bring to

the table, the executive pay practices and pay levels

in other markets and industries, to appreciate the

differences in levels and medium of pay and build in as

appropriate for decision making.

IV. Executive Pay Positioning

We

aim

to

provide

competitive

remuneration

opportunities to our executives by positioning target

total remuneration (including perks and beneﬁ ts,

annual incentive pay-outs, long term incentive pay-

outs at target performance) and target total cash

compensation (including annual incentive pay-outs) at

target performance directionally between median and

top quartile of the primary talent market. We recognize

the size and scope of the role and the market standing,

skills and experience of incumbents while positioning

our executives.

We use secondary market data only as a reference point

for determining the types and amount of remuneration

while principally believing that target total remuneration

packages should reﬂ ect the typical cost of comparable

executive talent available in the sector.

V.

Executive Pay-Mix

Our executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate

balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash

compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual

Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and

Beneﬁ ts

Annual Incentive Plan:

We tie annual incentive plan pay-outs of our executives to

relevant ﬁ nancial and operational metrics achievement

and their individual performance. We annually align the

ﬁ nancial and operational metrics with priorities/ focus

areas for the business.

Long-Term Incentive:

Our Long-term incentive plans incentivize stretch

performance, link executive remuneration to sustained

long term growth and act as a retention and reward tool.

We use stock options as the primary long-term incentive

vehicles for our executives as we believe that they best

align executive incentives with stockholder interests.

We grant restricted stock units as a secondary long

term incentive vehicles, to motivate and retain our

executives.:

letter with certain ﬁ nancial institutions, which was subsequently superseded by the agreements

detailed below.

In December 2018, Novelis entered into an increase joinder amendment (the “2018 Term Loan Increase Joinder

Amendment”) to its existing Term Loan Facility. The 2018 Term Loan Increase Joinder Amendment governed the

commitments of certain ﬁ nancial institutions to provide, subject to closing conditions, up to ` 5,839 Crore ($775

Million) of incremental term loans under the terms of its existing term loan credit agreement. The commitments

under the 2018 Term Loan Increase Joinder Amendment expired in January 2020.

In February 2020, Novelis entered into an amendment (the “Term Loan Amendment”) to its Term Loan Facility. The

Term Loan Amendment modiﬁ es the Term Loan Facility by amending certain terms to facilitate the closing of the

acquisition of Aleris.

In February 2020, Novelis entered into an increase joinder amendment (the “2020 Term Loan Increase Joinder

Amendment”) to its existing Term Loan Facility. The 2020 Term Loan Increase Joinder Amendment provides

commitments of certain ﬁ nancial institutions to provide up to ` 5,839 Crore ($775 Million) of incremental term

loans under its existing term loan credit agreement. These commitments replaced the commitments of the same

ﬁ nancial institutions under the 2018 Term Loan Increase Joinder Amendment. The proceeds of the incremental

term loans were used to pay a portion of the consideration payable in the acquisition of Aleris, which closed on

April 14, 2020, as well as fees and expenses related to the acquisition, the incremental term loans, and short

term loans. The incremental term loans will mature ﬁ ve years after the date on which they are borrowed, subject

to 0.25% quarterly amortization payments. The incremental term loans will, once borrowed, accrue interest at

LIBOR (as deﬁ ned in the Term Loan Facility) plus 1.75%. The incremental term loans will be subject to the same

voluntary and mandatory prepayment provisions, afﬁ rmative and negative covenants and events of default as:

letter dated 25th April, 2018, NA imposed a penalty equal to 20%

of PBG amounting to ` 64 Crore for GP-4 and ` 74 Crore (refer Note15) for GP-5. As the PBG for GP-5 was still with NA,

it also appropriated an amount equal to the penalty from the PBG.

The above actions were contested by the Company and the Hon’ble Chhattisgarh High Court at Bilaspur has already

given its judgment in favour of the Company in the matter related to GP-5. As per the judgment, Hon’ble High Court has

asked NA to refund the amount apportioned by them and return the PBG to the Company. Company’s appeal to quash

the demand raised by NA in case of GP-4 is yet to be decided and is pending before the Mines Tribunal.

The Company further received two Show-Cause Notices dated December 3, 2019 from NA for shortfall in production

of coal at the above mines for FY 2017-18 and FY 2018-19 compared to their respective mining plans. Through these

notices, the NA asked the Company to show cause why action should not be taken against the Company for recovery

of an amount equal to the appropriation amount for the said defaults provided in Clause 6.3 and 10.3 of the Coal Mine

Development and Production Agreement.

The Company has furnished its replies to both the notices vide letters dated December 17, 2019 contesting that the NA

has no right under the aforesaid clauses to recover any amount from the Performance Security.

The NA have neither issued any further: letter to the Company nor raised any demand against the Company in this

regard.
