Message from the: Managing

Managing Director:

Dear Shareholders,

We have pleasure in presenting the 123rd Annual Report of the Company along with the audited statement of accounts for the

year ended 31st March, 2020. Considering the unfavourable market conditions prevailing for a major part of the year in all business

segments, the overall profitability for the financial year 2019-20 has been satisfactory after charging all expenses, interest costs etc.

The impact of Corona Virus outbreak (COVID-19) on public life and the industry in India and world over is also affecting the demand of

Company’s product portfolio. While this is expected to have a negative impact on the financial performance of Company in FY 21, the

Company cannot quantify the magnitude and duration of such impact at this time given the fluidity of the situation. Company continues

to monitor and assess its business operations daily. In this connection, with the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company has implemented

protocols based on recommendations from official health authorities such as World Health Organisation (WHO). Additionally, to

support the prevention of COVID-19 outbreak, the Company has prepared SOPs based on recommendations of a professional

facilities management firm viz CBRE and other corporate guidelines from leading Indian companies both in manufacturing and those

handling commercial buildings as also FICCI guidelines and inputs of our HR colleagues.

The summarised financial results are given below.

as per Ind AS 19 - ‘Employee Benefits’ in the financial statements. As these employee benefits are lump sum amounts

provided on the basis of actuarial valuation, the same is included above on payment basis.

40 RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURE (contd.):

Letter of Credit and/or insurance cover on export outstanding is also taken. Generally

deposits are taken from domestic debtors. Apart from deposit there is a commission agent area wise. In case any customer

defaults the amount is first recovered from deposits, then from the agent’s commission. Each outstanding customer

receivables are regularly monitored and if outstanding is above due date the further shipments are controlled and can

only be released if there is a proper justification. The carrying amount and fair value of security deposit amounts to ` 45.89

Crores (31 March 2019: ` 46.48 Crores) as it is payable on demand.

The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in

several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets and their credit worthiness are monitored

at periodical intervals. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of

financial assets.

The Company has written off trade receivables amounting to ` 1.27 Crs during the year (31 March 2019 ` 0.75 Crs) as there

was no reasonable expectations of recovery and were outstanding for more than 360 days from becoming due.
