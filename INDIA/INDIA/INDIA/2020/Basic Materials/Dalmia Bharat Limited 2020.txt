letter dated May 15, 2015 gave notice to BG for non-fulfilment of project conditions. The disputes between the parties are pending

adjudication before the Arbitral Tribunal (also refer note 34(C)).

47. The Group reviews trade receivables, advances and subsidies receivables on regular intervals and takes necessary steps (including legal action

wherever required) for the recovery these balances. The Group is confident to realise the value stated good in the financial statements. The

Group follows the expected credit loss model in respect of any such situations as stated in note 1B(iii)(t), it believes that such amount is

sufficient to cover for any possible loss.

48. During the financial year ended March 31, 2019, certain mutual fund units (“Securities”) appearing as current investments, valued at `374

as on March 31, 2020, were illegally and fraudulently transferred by one of the Depository Participant (“DP”), from demat accounts of DCBL,

subsidiary of the Group. Based on the complaint filed by DCBL and after conducting preliminary enquiry, the Economic Offences Wing, Delhi

(EOW) directed the Clearing Agent of DP (i.e. ISSL) not to deal with the Securities and also freezed all such Securities till further orders.

SEBI after complaint by DCBL also directed the DP, its promoters/directors, its related associates and other noticees mentioned in the order, not

to dispose of, alienate or encumber any assets, except with the prior permission of SEBI/ National Stock Exchange (NSE).

No final order has yet been passed by SEBI in the complaint lodged by DCBL against DP and others in respect of fraudulent transfer of Securities

from its demat accounts.

In the meantime, the clearing agent/ ISSL has also sought from Security Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai (“SAT”) the annulment of trade of Future &

Options contract entered into by DP. Such annulment of trades sought by clearing agent/ ISSL was directed by SAT vide its order dated July 03,

2019 to be heard by SEBI including grievance of all other investors. SEBI challenged the said order of SAT before Hon’ble Supreme Court. The

Supreme Court, vide its interim order dated August 27, 2019, directed NSE Clearing Corporation Limited, to honour F&O segments contract

which had matured on June 27, 2019. The Supreme Court also clarified that the payments so made shall be without prejudice to the rights

and contentions of the parties and subject to the final outcome and directions which would be passed in the matter. The matter is still pending

before Supreme Court. The matter is currently under investigation by DCBL through an independent firm of Chartered Accountants.

Further, EOW has filed charge sheet against the said DP, its promoter, ISSL and its business head for committing various offences under Indian

Penal Code. The charge sheet is accusing them of forging the Delivery Instruction Slips to effect fraudulent transfer of Securities from the demat

accounts of DCBL. After filing of charge sheet, DCBL has filed an application before the Jurisdictional Court for release of mutual fund units and

the same is currently pending.

Consequent to this, DCBL, during the year, has valued these Securities at the fair market value existing on the reporting date and an amount

of `30 has been credited to the statement of profit and loss under the head Other income. DCBL is fully confident of recovering its Securities

based on the legal opinion obtained in the matter. Hence, no provision is considered necessary in these financial statements.

49. The Government of India (‘GOI’) on December 24, 1997 announced industrial policy for development of industries in North East region

with a promise to give 100% exemption on Excise Duty (paid in cash) by way of ‘remission’ for 10 years from the date of commencement of

commercial production, and the same was continued in the second policy issued on April, 2007.

In the year 2008, the GOI abruptly modified remission entitlement vide notifications dated March 27, 2008 and June 10, 2008 restricting the

remission amount to value addition (‘notified rate’). Department started refunding excise remission as per notified rate but not 100 % of excise

duty paid from PLA.

The Group approached Guwahati High Court for sanction of 100 % remission on principal of promissory estoppel along with other petitions

and the same was allowed vide order dated November 20, 2014. Accordingly, the Group had accrued 100 % remission income in the books.

Against the order of High Court, department filed a SLP(C) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, for stay of the order of Guwahati High Court. The

Supreme Court stayed order of High Court (‘Interim Order’) with a condition to refund 50% of the disputed amount on December 07, 2015.

Finally, the Supreme Court pronounced decision on April 22, 2020 and held that amendment in notification is in continuance of earlier policy.

Accordingly, the Group have, during the current year, written off an amount of `8 which was pending for refund and has, further, during the

current year made provision of `5 being amount already refunded in lieu of Interim Order passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court both of which

are over and above said notified rate (‘disputed amount’).

50. The Government of Assam in their high power committee meeting in February 2019 had granted Mega Project status to one of the step down

subsidiary of the Group, under the Industrial and Investment policy of Assam 2014 for the investment done for establishment of clinkerisation

unit at Umrangshu (”USO”) of Calcom for 15 years in the state of Assam. The said unit would be entitled to 100% reimbursement of net SGST

paid for a period of 15 years from the date of commercial production on account of which 100% remission of SGST of `51 was recognized as

income in the previous year.:
