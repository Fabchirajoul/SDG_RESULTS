Forward- looking statements

In this Annual Report, we have disclosed forward-looking information to enable investors to

comprehend our prospects and take investment decisions. This report and other statements –

written and oral – that we periodically make contain forward-looking statements that set out

anticipated results based on the management’s plans and assumptions. We have tried wherever

possible to identify such statements by using words such as ‘anticipate’, ‘estimate’, ‘expects’,

‘projects’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’, and words of similar substance in connection with any

discussion of future performance. We cannot guarantee that these forward-looking statements

will be realised, although we believe we have been prudent in assumptions. The achievements

of results are subject to risks, uncertainties, and even inaccurate assumptions. Should known or

unknown risks or uncertainties materialise, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate,

actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. Readers

should keep this in mind. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking

statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Dear Shareholders,

Greetings.

This fiscal year, JSPL, as an organisation,

has been able to demonstrate what we

can achieve by focusing on operational

excellence, adopting capital prudence

across the board, and leveraging our

experienced and capable team. We have

come a long way in the last 30 years.

From being a 0.3 MTPA DRI plant at

Raigarh in 1989, to a conglomerate with

a multi-location global portfolio of Steel,

Power and Mining assets, we continue

to march steadfastly on the path shown

by Shri O P Jindal, our visionary founder

Chairman and guiding light. We would

like to thank you for your support so far

Standalone Gross

Revenue

and we are excited to see what we can

achieve together in the years to come.

Notwithstanding

an

economic

slowdown, and Covid-19 pandemic-

induced disruptions, for the first time

in the last 6 years, during FY2020, we

have been able to report a profit after

tax of `617.67 crores, on standalone

basis. This addition to our bottom-line

is a resounding validation of our strong

turnaround strategy put into action over

the past five years, and implemented

meticulously by an experienced and

committed team of professionals.

Significantly, not only have we recorded

the “best-ever” production levels across

the board, our steel production during

FY2020 has grown by more than 12%

on a consolidated basis, and by more

than 13% on a standalone basis, in

comparison with the previous financial

year. This is especially commendable as

we have been able to increase our steel

production levels despite the disruptions

of Covid-19. In contrast, the industry has

reported a drop in steel production levels

for FY2020.

We are obviously doing some things

differently than the rest of the industry. In

one word, our Mantra has been “Focus”!

Since 2015, we have been practising

“Theory of Constraints” (TOC) which

has helped us immensely in picking the

right metrics to run our operations and

evolve strategies. In 2018 we embraced

“Extreme Ownership” to empower our

leaders to take charge of their “metrics

of importance”. Similarly in 2020 we have

brought in the concept of “The One Thing”

to further align & sharpen the focus of our

top 600 executives to prioritise their time

and energy on the 20 per cent of tasks/

strategies that would give us 80 per cent

of results on the enhanced targets.

We are happy to report that during

FY2020, our standalone steel sales rose

by 12 per cent on a y-o-y basis. We

also reported standalone EBITDA at Rs.

5,777 crore for the same period. On a

consolidated basis, JSPL also achieved

consolidated Steel Production of 8.17 MT:

letter, we are

navigating through myriad challenges

posed by the Covid-19 pandemic,

whether at a personal, organisational, or

economic level. We would like to take this

opportunity to extend our gratitude to

all those who are working hard towards

minimising its impact on the health of

our communities. Our thoughts and

prayers are with every Indian during

these challenging times.

We are proud to say that every employee

at JSPL has contributed towards the PM

Cares Fund. We have also been directly

influential

in

supporting

multiple

hospitals with the supply of ventilators,

oxygen tanks and increasing bed and

quarantine capacities, amongst others.

We have participated in additional

efforts to ensure that local communities

have adequate access to food and any

supplies that they may need. As the

nature of this pandemic continues to

unfold, we remain committed to helping

and serving our communities through

any means possible.

This quick response and structured

framework allowed us to implement safe

working conditions for all our employees

seamlessly, whether from home or

in our facilities. It also enabled us to

resume operations under the Essential

Services Maintenance Act with minimal

disruptions to our operations. We would

like to thank all our employees for their

support through these uncertain times,

especially our leadership teams, who

have more than demonstrated their

ability to perform keeping the big-

picture in mind.

We would also like to take this opportunity

to thank the Government of India, State

Governments, Indian Railways and the

Banks for their immense support towards

minimising the impact of this pandemic

on our country. The moratorium period

on loan payments has also been a big

support.

Forward with confidence

We are optimistic that we will continue

to maintain our strong momentum as we

recover as a country from the Covid-19

pandemic. We expect demand to not

only recover, but also increase with a

more significant number of projects

coming through.

With our Capex cycle now completed,

we are now well set on the path to

achieving steady earnings growth, going

forward. Our projects are placed in

strategic locations that are close to raw

materials, end-markets and evacuation

infrastructure. We also have 3,400 MW

IPPs and 1634 CPPs set up at extremely

competitive project costs. As a result, we

are amongst the most-economical, high

quality producers of steel and power in

India, with a comprehensive, diversified

long products portfolio and several

unique

high-value-added

products.

Moreover, our strategic product portfolio:

MANAGING DIRECTOR: Dear Shareholders,

At the outset, I am pleased to inform

you that FY2020 was a milestone year

for us. Not only did we execute well on

our strategic plans, we also delivered a

reliable and comprehensive financial

performance that left our balance-sheet

in an overall stronger position by the end

of the year.

To a great extent, our return to cash profits

this year was the result of consistent

volume growth over the last two years,

allowing us to take full advantage of our

operating leverage. As we speak, we have

been able to reach record production

levels despite the Covid-19 disruption,

achieving more than 560,000 tonnes

average production per month on

continuous basis. Given this production

run-rate, we are confident of producing

between 7 to 7.5 million tonnes during

FY2021. This increase would also represent

a 15% volume growth approximately, on a

y-o-y and standalone basis for the running

year. Given this performance, I am pleased

to inform you that our core story of volume

growth remains intact, and our turnaround

momentum continues unabated.

Our return to cash profitability is also the

result of our performance in terms of cost

reduction, and thus the growth in our

EBITDA and net sales realisation. At each of

our four sites, we strategised and effected

cost reduction initiatives at a micro-level.

Leaving no stone unturned, we were able

to find the right balance between value

addition and value engineering. As a

result, our total EBITDA increase has been

almost `3,100 per tonne during the year,

while our net sales realisation improved

by nearly 8% or `2,700 crore. We have also

been helped by some cost adjustments

taking shape within the business. In

particular, fuel commodity, refractories

and electrodes have all witnessed

significant downward slope in their costs.

As we work through inventories and long-

term supply contracts, we will begin to

fully feel the positive effects of these cost

reductions in time.

What’s especially commendable is that

we turned out a good show despite tough

market conditions. To appreciate this fully,

I would like to give you an overview of the

environment in which we operated.

Navigating through a

challenging environment

A slowdown in consumer and service

sectors, massive disruptions in spending

and labour markets and a weak consumer

sentiment are likely to push steel demand

in developed economies to contract by

17.1% in 2020. Strict physical distancing

norms backed by policy support point to

a partial recovery with a 7.8% growth in

2021. The US steel demand is expected

to hit its lowest in 2020, muddled with

manufacturing recession due to Covid-19,

steep fall in crude oil prices and mounting

unemployment. The EU steel demand

is likely to experience a recession due to

slowdown in the automotive sector.

The Japanese steel industry is expected

to contract in double-digits owing to

declining exports. Korea’s steel demand

is also likely to experience a double-digit

decline due to dismal export markets

coupled with weak domestic demand.

In emerging economies, steel demand

(excluding China) is projected to decline

by 11.6% in 2020; however, it is also

expected to bounce back strongly to 9.2%

growth in 2021.

The oil-producing Middle East and North

Africa (MENA) region’s steel demand

is severely hit by the double blow of

Covid-19 outbreak and a slump in oil

prices.

The steel demand in India is also likely

to go down by 18% in 2020 owing to

stringent nationwide lockdown measures,

supply

chain

disruptions

coupled

with slower demand recovery in the

automotive sector. However, domestic

demand is expected to bounce back with

a sharp growth of 15% in 2021, on the

back of Government stimulus actions and

its continued support to increase rural

income. We remain positive in our outlook

as India aspires to be a manufacturing

hub through policy initiatives like ‘Make

in India’. The steel sector is one of the

key focus areas with direct and indirect

linkages to multiple industries. It should

be able to achieve a positive trade balance

by enhancing its export manufacturing

capabilities. With the necessary push from

the Government, laced with the adoption

of emerging technologies, India’s crude

steel production is expected to touch

255 MT in 2030-31 with production to

clock 7.2% CAGR. At JSPL, we are well

positioned to surf this long-term growth

wave.

Our performance in FY2020

Our experience spanning three decades of

multiple economic cycles, and well tested

and proven counter strategies for down

cycles have served us well over the years.

With this familiarity and understanding,

we delivered a commendable financial
