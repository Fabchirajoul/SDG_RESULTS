Dear Shareholders,

COVID-19 and the associated lockdowns across countries

have triggered a once-in-a-century crisis for the society

and the economy in 2020. January now seems like a

month of a bygone era – such has been the enormity

of change. This is a defining period in human and

business history: one that will test the resilience of

individuals, societies, corporations, and nations.

Given the fog of uncertainty all

around, it is hard to be prescient

in these times. But there is little

doubt on one reality: companies

with quality leadership, sound

business fundamentals, and a

track record of winning in turbulent

times, will emerge as champions

in the new global order.

Global Economy

It has been several months since

the pandemic engulfed the world

and yet there is a lot of uncertainty

with respect to the extent of the

economic contraction due to this

crisis, and the subsequent pace of

recovery.

This year will see an economic

contraction,

but

this

2020

recession is turning out very

different from the past recessions.

It has been too sudden – almost

off the cliff; its spread has been all-

encompassing – affecting almost

every economy and sector, and

the plunge in economic activity

levels and employment has

been unprecedented.

On

the

positive

side,

this recession is likely to

be one of the shortest,

assuming no second wave

of the pandemic recurs.

As

present

lockdowns

around the world get lifted,

and

businesses

reopen,

economic activity is likely

to bounce back fairly quickly.

Around $9-trillion stimulus from

different governments globally

will help to support this recovery,

along with the monetary actions

by Central banks. These policies

will also help to restrict the

second-order effects like defaults

and bankruptcies.

Some scars of the crisis will

remain

in

the

form

of

subdued

consumer

and

business

confidence.

Some sectors, like airlines

and hospitality, will take
