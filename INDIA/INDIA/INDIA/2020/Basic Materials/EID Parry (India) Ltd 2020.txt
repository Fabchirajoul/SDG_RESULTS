Your Company’s performance during the year marginally improved

The Sugar Business, impacted by stock holding restrictions under

the new Regulatory regime, a subdued price, sharpened its focus on

cost optimisation and retail sales, delivering quality products thereby

consolidating its market share. The better realisation from sugar retail

sales and alcohol sales facilitated in improving the Company’s bottom

line to a large extent amidst a subdued demand environment. The

business grew reasonably recording modest growth in revenue and

profitability despite heightened competition and elevated input costs.

E.I.D.- Parry (India) Limited 13:

Letter of Credit (LC) in favour of power generating companies

for the agreed quantum of power supply. The order provides for

encashment for LC by the generating company after the agreed credit

period of 45 or 60 days as the case may be. This was a welcome

move by the GOI to facilitate timely collection of debtors, which has

come into effect from 01.08.2019.

Ethanol

Molasses is a viscous by-product obtained from raw sugar during

the manufacturing process. Cane-based ethanol can be produced in

three different ways directly from cane juice, and from B-heavy and

C molasses. In 2003, the Government of India (GOI) had launched

the Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP) on a pilot basis, which

was subsequently extended to the Notified 21 States and 4 Union

Territories to promote the use of alternative and environment-friendly

fuels. The programme is a part of the long-term strategy to reduce

India’s dependency on crude imports and insulate the nation from

global oil price volatility as well as give the domestic sugar sector a

boost by diverting excess sugar stocks towards ethanol manufacture.

While the programme initially targeted a 10% blending of petrol with

the biofuel by 2022, later the target was enhanced to achieve 20%

ethanol blending with petrol by 2030.

The Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas have released Ethanol

Procurement Policy on a Long-Term Basis under Ethanol Blended

Petrol (EBP) Programme. The salient features of this policy include

the annual procurement quantity as estimated by OMCs to remain

firm for ESY (Ethanol Supply Year: Dec to Nov). A mechanism to

be introduced by OMCs for change in transportation rates with the

change in fuel rates.

Currently, sugar companies are able to supply 230-240 Crore litre to

OMCs. With the opening up of the B heavy and Syrup route, sugar

companies, in totality, can supply maximum 500-550 Crore litre.

However, current capacities are insufficient to utilise the B heavy

route with optimum potential. This has led the government to offer soft

loans of ` 15000 Crore to companies wanting to create greenfield/

brownfield ethanol capacity.

Though the government seems to be serious about its 10% and 20%

ethanol blending programme, historically it has faced multiple issues

like lack of capacity, lower feedstock availability, lower crude prices and

OMC resistance to adopt 10% ethanol blending. Hence, any change

in government policy can derail the EBP and negatively impact sugar

millers. However, this looks unlikely as the government has approved

a soft loan to 114 projects for increasing distillery capacity.

During the year, the Central Government announced that no separate

environmental clearance will be required to produce additional ethanol

from B-heavy molasses as it does not contribute to the pollution load.

To obviate the need for undertaking fresh Environmental Impact

Assessment (EIA) or public consultation in all such cases of increase

in production capacity, the Government has given a clarification

relating to issuance of environmental clearance in order to facilitate

the sugar mills to undertake additional production of ethanol from

B-Heavy Molasses in place of using C-Heavy Molasses without any

increase in the total pollution load.

Cogeneration

Bagasse is the fibrous matter that remains after sugarcane stalks are

crushed to extract their juice and is a by-product generated in the

process of manufacture of sugar. It can either be sold or be captively

consumed for generation of steam. It is currently used as a biofuel

and in the manufacturing of pulp and paper products and building

materials. The bagasse produced in a sugar factory is however used

for generation of steam which in turn is used as a fuel source and the

surplus generation is exported to the power grids.

For each 10 tonnes of sugarcane crushed, a sugar factory produces

nearly 3 tonnes of wet bagasse. Since bagasse is a by-product of the

cane sugar industry, the quantity of production in the country is in

proportion to the quantity of sugarcane produced.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

1 Statement of Compliance

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with

Ind ASs notified under Sec 133 of the Companies Act, 2013

[Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] and other

relevant provisions of the Act.

a) The Company has applied the following standards and

amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period

commencing April 01, 2019:

Ind AS 116, Leases

Appendix C to Ind AS 12, Income Taxes - Uncertainty over Income

Tax Treatments

Amendments to Ind AS 19, Employee Benefits - Plan Amendment,

Curtailment or Settlement

Amendment to Ind AS 23, Borrowing Costs

Amendment to Ind AS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint

Venture - Long-term Interests in Associates & Joint Ventures

Amendments to Ind AS 103, Business Combinations and Ind AS

111, Joint Arrangements

Amendment to Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments

The Company had to change its accounting policies as a result

of adopting Ind AS 116. This is disclosed in note 2A. The other

amendments listed above did not have any material impact on

the amounts recognised in prior periods and are not expected to

significantly affect the current or future periods.

1.1 Basis of preparation and presentation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost

basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at

fair values at the end of each reporting period, defined benefit plan

- plan assets measured at fair value, assets held for sale which is

measured at lower of cost and fair value less cost to sell and share

based payments as explained in the accounting policies below.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration

given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or

paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market

participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that

price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation

technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the

Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or

liability if market participants would take those characteristics into

account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.

Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these

financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-

based payment transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 102,

leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 116, and

measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not

fair value, such as net realizable value in Ind AS 2 or value in use

in Ind AS 36.

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements

are categorized into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the degree to which

the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the

significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety,

which are described as follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets

for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the

measurement date;

•

Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included

within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either

directly or indirectly; and

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

1.2 Revenue Recognition

The Company had adopted Ind AS 115 in the year 2018-19 from

April 01, 2018 and had opted for retrospective application with

the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard recognised

as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at

the date of initial application. The standard has been applied to all

open contracts as on April 01, 2018, and subsequent contracts with

customers from that date.

IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC

The spread of COVID-19 has severely impacted businesses around the globe. In many countries, including India, there has been severe disruption

to regular business operation due to lock downs, disruptions in transportation, supply chain, travel bans, quarantines, social distancing and other

emergency measures. The Group’s significant business is in Agriculture and allied products (Fertiliser, Sugar etc)and it has been identified as an

essential service. The Group’s factories were operating during the lockdown except for few days in the initial lock down period and was able to

conduct the operations with minor delays in certain factories/business.

However, uncertainty caused by the current situation has resulted in delays in dispatches on account of logistical issues. This situation was a

temporary phenomenon and has started to improve.

The Group has made detailed assessment of its liquidity position. The Group has sanctioned credit facilities which can be used as and when

necessary and has the ability to repay the debts as and when it falls due. The Group also has assessed recoverability and carrying values of its

assets comprising property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, trade receivables, inventory and investments as at balance sheet date, and

has concluded that there are no material adjustments required in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements. In the case of inventory relating

to Holding Company and Parry Sugars Refinery India Private Limited (‘PSRIPL’), management has performed the inventory verification at a date

subsequent to the year end in the presence of its internal auditor (an external firm of professionals carried out the work under the supervision of the

Company’s internal auditors) to obtain comfort over the existence and condition of inventories as at March 31, 2020 including rollback procedures

etc. The Group has also evaluated the internal controls including internal controls with reference to financial statements and all the controls are

operating effectively and the Group has not diluted any controls in this regard.

Management believes that it has taken into account all the possible impact of events arising from COVID-19 pandemic in the preparation of the

consolidated Ind AS financial statements including the ability of the Group to continue as going concern. However, the impact assessment of

COVID-19 is a continuing process given the uncertainties associated with its nature and duration. The Group will continue to monitor any material

changes to future economic conditions.

The auditors have included an emphasis of matter para in their auditor’s report regarding the same.
