REASON FOR SHORTFALL OF CSR SPEND

The marginal shortfall of Rs.9.00 lakhs is because some jobs, though assigned, have not been completed by the parties concerned

due to COVID-19 lockdown situation.

RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE CSR COMMITTEE:

All our projects are identified in a collective manner, in consultation with the community decision makers and the local beneficiaries.

Gauging their basic needs and assessing our own mechanisms, we take recourse to the participatory rural appraisal mapping process.

Subsequently, based on discussions with local authorities such as Village Panchayats/Tehsildars, projects are prioritized.

Arising from this, the focus areas that have emerged are those chosen to be included in the CSR plan for the year. All of our

community projects are identified and monitored by the hierarchy of our Company:

- Our CSR Committee of Directors

- Subordinate HR/CSR and P&A staff

- Employee Volunteers

- 3rd party/NGO associates/agencies

All projects are assessed under the agreed strategy, and are monitored every quarter, measured against targets and budgets. Wherever

necessary, mid-course corrections are employed and applied, to ensure that AACL’s standard of excellence is met at all levels of

making a positive impact on community.

The CSR Committee hereby declares that the implementation and monitoring of CSR Policy, is in compliance with CSR objectives

and Policy of the Company.
