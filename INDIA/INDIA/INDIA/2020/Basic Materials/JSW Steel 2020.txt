The closure of the transaction is subject to obtaining

necessary approval from the National Company

Law Tribunal, New Delhi (“NCLT”). The Resolution

12. ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES

In its commitment to conserve natural resources, reduce

emissions and hazardous discharges to the environment

and preserve biodiversity, the Company has undertaken

extensive planning and investments to reduce long-term

environmental impact and risks. The business has

proactively harnessed innovation, technology adoption

and process changes in keeping with this objective.

The efforts have been reinforced by set targets and

goals that will aid the creation of lasting value for all

stakeholders.

The approach has resulted in several environmental

initiatives to reduce carbon emission, conserve

resources like water, energy and input materials,

minimise waste and increase recirculation, recycling and

enhancement of local biodiversity.

The Company has established a Board-level Business

Responsibility Reporting Committee which reviews the

sustainability parameters every quarter.

In light of the rapid developments related to climate

change viz. technology, regulations, taxation, investors’

growing expectations, disclosures and so on, the

Company has constituted a Climate Action Group (CAG)

with cross-functional expertise, encompassing R&D,

strategy, operations, communications etc. Facilitated by

the Corporate Sustainability Team, the CAG operates as

a central think-tank, to formulate and drive the climate

change mitigation strategy and actions for the Company

towards a low carbon road ahead.

With a seamless mechanism in place to review

stakeholder issues periodically, the Company has been

undertaking extensive planning, process optimisation

and investments in technology and innovation to limit

environmental risks.

REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS AND DISCHARGES

Air emissions

The Company continues to upgrade and implement

better pollution control systems while seeking expansion

and improvement in its plans. FY 2019-20 saw many

initiatives to reduce emission and dust.

-

In

Vijayanagar,

Online

Continuous

Emission

Monitoring Systems (OCEMS) were installed in 71

stacks for measuring 95 parameters that provide

accurate and continuous information on particulate

matter or gaseous emission.

-

Upgradation of SMS-1 primary and secondary

fume extraction systems and SMS-2 primary fume

extraction systems to reduce roof top emission at

Vijayanagar.

-

Installation of Maximised Emission Reduction of

Sintering (MEROS) to treat process gases of Sinter

Plant 4 at Vijayanagar, which help reduce emissions.

-

Installation of dedusting systems at Vijayanagar’s

RMHS, pellet plant, BF-1 & 2 and Sinter Plant.

The system is designed to achieve a work zone

guarantee of <2mg/m3.

-

In Dolvi, 12 dust extraction systems were installed at

RMHS to reduce fugitive emission during transfer of

raw material from belt conveyor and transfer points.

-

RMHS open yards in Dolvi were fully covered with

conventional/space frame covered shed to prevent

dust emission during operation of the yard.

-

Replacement of duct bends and plug duct leakages

in proportioning house at the Dolvi plant to avoid

dust leakage from damaged ducts. This increases

efficiency of ESPs and reduces emissions.
