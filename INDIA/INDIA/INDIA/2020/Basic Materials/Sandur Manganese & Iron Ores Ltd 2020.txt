Balance Sheet

83,099.43

69,504.93

During the financial year 2019-20, the Company produced

both, manganese ores and iron ores upto the maximum

permissible annual production limits. Lower sales of

Manganese Ore by about 15.37% is attributed to reduction

in demand and price of Mn ore for almost one quarter in

line with reduction in prices of Mn alloys. However, the

Company was able to generate an increase in sales of

iron ore by about 3.62% during the financial year 2019-20,

as the iron ore demand and prices did not see significant

volatility during the year.

various domain functions. Senior executives of the

Company representing key operational domains

(Mines, Plant & Project, Finance, Commercial and

Corporate Functions), have been co- opted unto the

Board as whole-time directors with effect from 01

April 2020 ensuring better coordinated functioning

of the executives and more efficient and effective

decision-making process, besides resulting in

increased accountability at the level of operational

heads.

The following directors stepped down from the Board

in the larger interest of the Company with effect from

01 February 2020, to make way for new inductions:

(i) S. Y. Ghorpade (DIN: 00080477);

(ii) B. Ananda Kumar (DIN: 01711145);

(iii) Vatsala Watsa (DIN:02626457);

(iv) K. V. Ramarathnam (DIN: 00097892);

(v)

P. Anur Reddy (DIN: 05170191); and

(vi) Lakshmi Venkatachalam (DIN: 00520608).

Also, Shri. S. Y. Ghorpade (DIN: 00080477),

Chairman relinquished his position as the

Chairman w.e.f. 01 February 2020 making way

for fresh Board leadership. The Board conferred

Emeritus for life. The Board further approved

the appointment of Shri. T. R. Raghunandan

(DIN: 03637265), Non-Executive Director as the

Chairman of the Board w.e.f. 01 February 2020.

illegal mining being carried on in the States of
