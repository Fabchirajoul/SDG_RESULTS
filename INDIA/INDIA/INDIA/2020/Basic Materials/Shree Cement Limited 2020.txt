Managing Director’s Outlook

Jt.: Managing

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S OUTLOOK

risks and be willing to discover the

untapped potential that exists in

equipment, processes and systems.

Conventional wisdom promotes - ‘Better

safe than sorry’. In business, a common

belief is to have strong safeguards in any

process and avoid deviations. Systems are

designed to operate within limitations. But

in the process, we may be missing

opportunities of betterment. For example,

for expediting completion of kiln

maintenance schedule, ordering of a

particular item may have deviated from

procurement norms. Normally this

deviation would be avoided as it would be

questioned later. However, people at Shree

allow such small deviation. Emphasis has to

be on practical approach. People need to

look beyond what may be ideal limits to

settling for what are necessary limits.

Similarly, there is common belief that best

of the talent will guarantee success. I am of

the view that you need the right people and

not necessarily the best people. Many raise

question as to how our eﬃciencies are very

high and how we are able to complete our

projects before time one after another.

I believe it is intrinsic motivation in our

people that enables this accomplishment.

High Perks and external motivation can

inﬂuence only for short span but the

willingness to realize something new is what

drives them continuously. The excitement of

triumph outshines all other motivations. Give

authority and purpose and people will

deliver. People try new things on every day

basis. Their hard work and dedication and

zeal to achieve something extra help them

unlock the untapped potential of eﬃciency in

our operations.

A great idea is of little use it if remains only in

mind. What is needed is to take concrete

actions upon them. The biggest of changes

have their origins from sincere actions taken

on smallest looking ideas. Thus teams need

to work on every seed of thought that holds

promise of bringing improvement. All actions

may not turn out successful but it deﬁnitely

assures gradual progress against the

alternate of standing still. Constant course

correction, taking actions and moving ahead

increases the chances of success. This in turn

creates edge for the long term sustenance of

an organization.

Important point is to adopt a practical

approach focused on betterment instead of

blindly following a rule based approach.

Systems and procedures are guidelines but

they should not come in the way of creative

solutions. We believe in an open culture.

Ready to embrace new solutions, ideas and

knowledge. Our willingness to change and an

open mind help us explore new paths. We

shall remain in constant pursuit of better

ways of doing things and creating a

diﬀerential value.

H. M. Bangur |: Managing

Managing Director

Regular planting of

seeds of new ideas,

solutions and thinking

is a way of life and

key to our success.

Like the mother

nature, which changes

at regular intervals

and still remain

eternal, our practices

keep changing while

remaining true to

its core.

achieved yesterday should become a base

for a new challenge to be achieved today.

For this, ﬁrst and foremost is to create an

ecosystem of innovation. People need to be

empowered at all levels to challenge the

present and come up with new ideas, new

thinking, newer way of doing things as a

matter of daily routine. They must feel the

need to create growth instead of simply

managing daily work. Secondly, many times

people defend status quo saying that “We

tried that before but it didn’t work”. This

becomes an excuse for not making another

attempt. To overcome this mindset, the

leadership needs to encourage people’s

failed attempts of experimenting or trying

newer things. In fact, if we’re not failing at

all, we’re doing something wrong – because

failure is a necessary by-product of

innovation. Third and an easy way of

breaking status quo is to make people

understand the value of their ideas. People

should be encouraged to express their

suggestions or new proposals in terms of

extra revenue earned or cost saved.

Another area that aﬀects an organizations’

ability to deal with uncertainties is the time

taken for decision making. Delayed decision

often turns into a lost opportunity. In the

age of digital world, plenty of data is

available and lots of analysis is possible.

Problems of “analysis paralysis” and “never

ending discussions” often grip leaders and

their teams. This leads to delay in decisions.

It needs to be understood that picking a

“good-enough” decision is better than a

perfect but delayed decision. In fact, there

does not exist a perfect solution to a

problem. One needs to take a good enough

decision and improve it as he goes along.

Bottom line is that faster decisions are

better than no decisions.

Shree’s past performance has been among

the best in the industry because of its

focused approach on constant

improvement, challenging the status quo

and ﬁnding innovative solutions. Past

accomplishments however breed

complacency. Hence we have created an

atmosphere of agility to ensure that people

don’t become contended and continually

attempt to remain on the better side of

embracing the change. They are encouraged

to perceive opportunities in challenges,

pursue them and use them to build a

competitive edge. They are encouraged and

empowered to question themselves and

venture outside of their comfort zone. In

challenging times like at present, we are

even more focused on out-of-box thinking

and creative solutions to rationalize costs

and improve eﬃciencies.

Regular planting of seeds of new ideas,

solutions and thinking is a way of life and

key to our success. Like the mother nature,

which changes at regular intervals and still

remain eternal, our practices keep changing

while remaining true to its core. We will

continue to break new grounds, create new

synergies and set new benchmarks.

date and conversion of variable interest rate into ﬁxed interest rate as per notional amount at agreed exchange

rate. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exchange

risk arising from the forecasted purchases. Some of the forward contracts are designated as cash ﬂow hedges.

The Company is following hedge accounting for cross currency & interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps

and some foreign currency forward contracts based on qualitative approach.

The Company is having risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking these hedge transactions.

The Company has maintained adequate documents stating the nature of the hedge and hedge eﬀectiveness

test. The Company assesses hedge eﬀectiveness based on following criteria:

i.

An economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument

ii.

The eﬀect of credit risk

iii. Assessment of the hedge ratio

The Company designates cross currency & interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps and some foreign

currency forward contracts to hedge its currency and interest risk and generally applies hedge ratio of 1:1.Refer

Note 21 for timing of nominal amount and contractual ﬁxed interest rate of cross currency & interest rate swaps

and interest rate swaps.

All these derivatives have been marked to market to reﬂect their fair value and the fair value diﬀerences

representing the eﬀective portion of such hedge have been taken to equity.
