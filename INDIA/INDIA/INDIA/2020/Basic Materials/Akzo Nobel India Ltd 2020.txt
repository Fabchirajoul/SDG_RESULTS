MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT

It is not the strongest of the

species that survive, nor the

most intelligent, but the one more

responsive to change.

Rajiv Rajgopal

MD, AkzoNobel India

Charles Darwin

Adapting to

the New World

As I write this statement,

COVID-19 has changed

things that we took for

granted. It has created

both challenges and

opportunities and it will now

be on us to recalibrate the

journey ahead and make

AkzoNobel India more

adaptable in these changing

times. It seems even more

that change is the only

constant.

The financial year ending

31 March 2020 was a

year of transformations.

During 2019, we continued

our transformation into

a focused paints and

coatings company. The

transformation journey

enabled us to drive further

efficiencies, implement

new ways of working and

making the organization

agile and adopt best

practices to get ready for

the next decade.

r) Leases

Till 31 March 2019

The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains)

a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the

inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a

lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use

of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys

a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not

explicitly specified in an arrangement.

As a lessee

Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Company,

as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of

ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases

are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the fair value of the

leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum

lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of

finance charges, are included in borrowings or other financial

liabilities as appropriate. Each lease payment is allocated

between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is

charged to the profit or loss over the lease period so as to

produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining

balance of the liability for each period.

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards

of ownership are not transferred to the Company as lessee are

classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating

leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are

charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period

of the lease unless the payments are structured to increase

in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the

lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.

As a lessor

Lease income from operating leases where the Company is

a lessor is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over

the lease term unless the receipts are structured to increase

in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the

expected inflationary cost increases. The respective leased

assets are included in the balance sheet based on their

nature.

With effect from 1 April 2019

As a lessee

From 1 April 2019, leases are recognised as a right-of-use

asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the

leased asset is available for use by the Company. Contracts

may contain both lease and non-lease components. The

Company allocates the consideration in the contract to the

lease and non-lease components based on their relative

stand-alone prices. However, for leases of real estate

for which the Company is a lessee, it has elected not to

separate lease and non-lease components and instead

accounts for these as a single lease component.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially

measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include

the net present value of the following lease payments:

a.

fixed payments (including in -substance fixed

payments), less any lease incentives receivable

b.

variable lease payment that are based on an index or a

rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the

commencement date

c.

amounts expected to be payable by the Company

under residual value guarantees

d.

the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company

is reasonably certain to exercise that option and

e.

payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the

lease term reflects the Company exercising that option

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain

extension options are also included in the measurement

of the liability. The lease payments are discounted using

the interest rate implicit in the lease. If the rate cannot be

readily determined, which is generally the case for leases

in the Company, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is

used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have

to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of

The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has created economic disruption throughout the world including India. Akzo Nobel India Limited

has ensured compliance with the lockdown protocols in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central and State governments

and local authorities. The operations of the Company were significantly impacted due to supply chain disruptions caused by lock down

of plants, offices and warehouses. The Company has resumed operations in a phased manner consistent with the directives from the

Government of India/ State governments/ Local authorities. The Company has evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on its operations &

financial position. Based on its review of the macro economic conditions & current outlook for the Indian economy, there is no additional

impact in financial statements apart from the financial impact already considered in financial statements of the Company as at 31

from estimates as on the date of approval of financial results. The Company will continue to monitor any material changes to its future

business and economic conditions.
