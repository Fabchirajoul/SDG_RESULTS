Dear Shareholders,

I trust this: letter finds you and your

dear ones safe and in good health. I

am pleased to present the Company’s

Annual Report 2019-20.

We as a human race were struck by a devastating

blow which we are now battling. A virus which

is not only invisible, does not differentiate and is

unrelenting in its spread. Governments, large and

small organisations, and every individual across the

world had no choice but to shutdown all normal

activity to protect and contain the spread of this

virus. Despite this we have seen untimely loss of

many lives, across the board disruption of economic

activity and adverse hugely adverse impact on

millions of livelihood.
