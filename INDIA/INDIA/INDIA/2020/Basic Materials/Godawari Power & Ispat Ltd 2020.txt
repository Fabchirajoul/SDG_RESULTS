year under review was

external environment.

B.L. AGRAWAL,: MANAGING DIRECTOR

Overview

The world is passing through one of the most uncertain periods in decades. The global

economic slowdown from 3.6% to 2.9% in 2019 was complemented by the outbreak

of the Covid-19 pandemic, the effects of the pandemic visible from January 2020

onwards and only deepening as the subsequent months passed.

The Indian economy slowed from 6.1% in 2018-19 to 4.2% in 2019-20 and 3.1% in

the last quarter of the year under review. Retail inflation climbed to a six-year high of

7.35% in December 2019. Despite these economic challenges, India emerged as the

fifth-largest world economy in 2019 with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$2.94

trillion. India jumped 14 places to 63 in the 2020 World Bank's Ease of Doing Business

ranking.

The global outlook was further affected by the outbreak of the pandemic in China in

December 2019, which spread to a number of countries in the subsequent two months

before emerging as a full blown pandemic in March 2020.

During the last week of the financial year under review, a national lockdown was

imposed to fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. This cast a shadow on the

anticipated recovery of the Indian economy in 2020-21, affecting demand, supply

chain, discretionary spend and capital expenditure. However, as we entered the unlock

phase, industrial activities started to show signs of improvement, though the number

of pandemic-impacted patients continued to spike. The combination of these realities

made it a challenging year for the industry in general and steel sector in particular.
