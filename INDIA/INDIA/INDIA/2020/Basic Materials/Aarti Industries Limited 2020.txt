Dear Shareholders,

My warm greetings to all of you!

These are unprecedented times and

the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting

everyone around the world and every

aspect of our daily lives. Hope all of you

and your families are safe and in the

best of health.

As a manufacturer and supplier

of speciality chemicals and

pharmaceuticals, Aarti Industries forms

a crucial part of the essential services

segment. I want to extend my deepest

gratitude to each and every member of

the Aarti Industries family for ensuring

we keep our operations running and

doing all that we can to respond

effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We are determined to work as a team

across the industry to harness our

know-how, experience and expertise to

combat this evolving crisis.

Despite the challenges, we remain

committed to invest in technology and

innovation to create new chemistry

and unearth novel solutions that will

contribute to long-term sustainable

value creation for all our stakeholders.

Exhibiting Resilience

In FY 2019-20, our business was

impacted by global economic weakness

in few end-user segments, slow

demand in some large usage verticals,

sharp volatility in the prices of key raw

materials and currencies and finally,

the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I

am pleased to inform you that despite

such exceptional business conditions,

our PAT was up 9% to `536 crores,

though our revenues were marginally

lower by 2%. However, our resolve

remains firm and, we continue to march

tenaciously towards our vision of

becoming ‘the global partner of choice’

for many more major consumers of

speciality chemicals.

Our Speciality Chemicals business

witnessed higher margins on account

of the increasing share of value-added

and high-margin products, from ~70%

of revenues in FY 2018-19 to about

75% this fiscal. Our operating profit

grew marginally by 2% to

`977 crores, and EBIT margin

expanded by 80 basis points to 21.1%.

However, the raw material prices

that are contractually passed on to

customers weakened, resulting in

3% decline in revenues. Also, the

shortage of nitric acid, which is used

largely in the manufacture of speciality

chemicals, impacted our operations

and performance.

In the pharma business, revenues

increased by 4% while margins

expanded by 250 basis points. EBIT

margins saw significant expansion

based on higher contribution from

regulated markets and value-added

products. Expanding business

volumes across markets and operating

leverages have helped the segment to

sustain the growth momentum.

Seizing opportunities

China, which accounts for about

20% of global speciality chemicals

revenues, has tightened environmental

standards, resulting in the closure

or shifting of capacities in about 50

chemical manufacturing clusters.

The increased labour costs and the

COVID-19 pandemic have aggravated

the situation further as companies seek

to reduce their dependence on China

and source alternative suppliers.

Aarti Industries, with its integrated

value chain and diversified product

mix, strong technical capabilities,

robust track record and cost-efficient

operations, forms an ideal fit for

entities looking for alternate supplier

independent of China. Our teams are

working with various existing and

prospective Indian and global players

on multiple such opportunities.

Advancing on Innovation

Aarti Industries is a knowledge-driven

organisation, where we strive towards

Despite the challenges, we remain

committed to invest in technology

and innovation to create new

chemistry and unearth novel

solutions that will contribute

to long-term sustainable value

creation for all our stakeholders.

Some of the initiatives in this regard as briefed below:

BE SAFE (By Employee Sustainability Assurance for

Employee): As a responsible organization, we are committed

to ensure complete safety and wellbeing of our workforce. We

subscribe to the best industry practices and global standards

related to safe, secure, and sustainable workplace. To achieve

the desired objectives, we launched BE SAFE, a mega initiative

in April 2019 with an objective of ‘Assurance on Complete

Health Check of the Plants’. The intended goal of the BE SAFE

programme is ‘Assurance to Management on Health Check

of all Facilities - Zero Harm’. We intend to ingrain safety as

a cultural attribute in our organization. In this endeavour, we

have adopted ‘BE SAFE’ as a standard greeting message. Our

leadership and all our employees religiously adhere to this

greeting in their day-to-day interactions.

To reinforce the message of safety, we organize a BE SAFE

huddle (15 minutes) every day in the evening that is attended

by all personnel from all manufacturing units through video

conferencing. Till March 2020, we have conducted more than

200 BE SAFE Huddles and an average of 600+ personnel

attends this huddle everyday. In this huddle, learnings from

major events, success stories, breakthroughs achieved are

shared. In addition, a Safety pledge is taken by all employees

at the start of every shift.

Strengthen Aarti Management System: As a part of our

BE SAFE initiative we majorly focus on Aarti Management

Systems (AMS) elements like Process Management, Asset

Management, Operations Management, Operations Training,

Management of Change, Pre-startup Safety Review, General

Plant Conditions, Job Management, Deviation management,

Behaviour based Safety, Quality management, General

plant condition, Occupational health, Emergency response
