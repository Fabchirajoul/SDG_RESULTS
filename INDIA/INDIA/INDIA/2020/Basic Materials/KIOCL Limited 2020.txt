Environmental

Management

and

Pollution

Control

Measures

Your Company is committed to preservation of ecology and

prevention of pollution in its manufacturing activity. Company’s

Environmental Management System is certified to 14001:2015

Standards. Some of the initiatives taken at plant level during the

year are as under:

• LED fittings (200 nos.) have been replaced in office

buildings in place of conventional fluorescent tubes in

various locations in Pellet Plant Unit.

• Energy efficient motors replaced for water pump (110 KW)

and blower motors (22 KW) were replaced and proposed for

changing the balance motors in phased manner.

• Grid connected Roof Top Solar plants have been set up in

the Captive Power Plant (CPP) area of Pellet Plant Unit. The

total capacity of the plant is 83.2KW.

letter of intent,

which has also not been issued

so far (September 2013). This

has resulted in idling of funds and

injudicious expenditure of ₹ 4.20

crore.

In order to improve the productivity of BFU, M/s. MECON

have suggested several modifications. Installation of

3rd PCM and introduction of pulverising coal injection

system were two prominent proposals. As the system of

injection of coal requires high investment, only installation

of 3rd PCM was undertaken in the 1st Phase modification.

However, by the time the installation was completed,

the same could not be put to use due to suspension of

operations of BFU because of commercial non-viability.

The machine will be put to use as and when the plant

starts its operation. The benefits/improvements are:

(a) Safe working environment for maintenance personnel;

(b) Shorter waiting period for Hot Metal collected in

ladles. This avoids solidification of top layer of metal

in the ladle (reduced skull formation)

(c) Better surface finish of Pig Iron Cubes/Blocks

(enhances marketability) and:

letter No. H/C.474 Classification/11 dated 21.10.2011 raised an issue regarding the applicability of distance-based

charge (DBC) over and above normal freight on Iron ore transported through railway network for manufacture of pellets and their

subsequent export. Both South Western Railway (SWR) and East Coast Railway (ECR) have raised demand of ₹14,463.93 lakhs

and ₹ 10,361.38 lakhs respectively towards distance-based charge (DBC) over and above normal freight on Iron ore transported.

DBC will attract only for iron ore fines and lumps which are directly exported and not on the Iron Ore so moved and utilized in

the steel plants for manufacture of finished product and exported thereafter. The same is also not applicable to Pig iron and

Sponge Iron Industry.:

letter no. MS/CMG/Fe-38-52 dated 06/05/2005. At the time of closure of the mine, the

Company filed a petition with prayers for direction, inter-alia, to permit utilization of 54.01 hectares of land required for the

purpose of safety and slope stability of the mine.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in its judgment (December 2006), directed IIT Delhi to issue global tender for, inter-alia,

re-analyzing the stability of slopes, drawing up of mine closure plan, implementation of the above plan and drawing up of

detailed terms for the work to be done, consistent with basic paradigm of “no or minimal disturbance to un-broken area”.

The expenditure for this purpose was to be met out of ₹1,900Lakhs paid by the company and which is presently lying with the

adhoc Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA).

The Hon’ble Supreme Court has also directed that if any funds are required in excess of ₹1,900 Lakhs, the agency or the

designated officer shall move to the Court for necessary direction.

Ministry of Mines Government of India, vide: letter dated 07/02/2014, nominated the Regional Controller of Mines, IBM

Bengaluru as the ‘Designated Officer’ to take possession of Kudremukh Iron Ore Mines. Accordingly, the Company has handed

over the possession of the Kudremukh Iron Ore Mines on 03/04/2014 to the Regional Controller of Mines, IBM Bengaluru.

Subsequently, officials of IBM Bengaluru and IIT, Delhi inspected the mine site on 20/05/2014, in which IIT Delhi opined that,

keeping in view of the environment and safety concerns, the residual task of mine closure is relatively minor as compared to

what was originally envisaged. Hence, the amount of ₹1,900Lakhs paid by the company to Central Empowered Committee

(CEC) already lying with the CAMPA would be sufficient. In addition to above, the Company has also made provision to the

extent of ₹600 Lakhs which is sufficient to meet the expenditure on mine closure, no further liability is considered necessary.

Letter of Credit and/or Bank Guarantee. Accordingly, Company has assessed that the impact of expected credit loss on

receivable to be negligible.

IV. Foreign Currency Risk

The Company being an EOU is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect

to the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Japanese Yen (JPY). Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions:
