letter of credit which can be called upon if the

counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.

Impairment is made on the expected credit losses, which are the present value of the cash shortfalls over the expected life of

financial assets. The estimated impairment losses are recognised in a separate provision for impairment and the impairment

losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Subsequent changes in assessment of impairment are recognised in provision for impairment and the change in impairment

losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Investment in Equity Shares

Investments in Equity Securities are initially measured at cost. Any subsequent fair value gain or loss is recognized through

Profit or Loss if such investments in Equity Securities are held for trading purposes. The fair value gains or losses of all other

Equity Securities are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income.

Investment in Associates, Joint Ventures and Subsidiaries

The Company has accounted for its investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture at cost.

Investments in Mutual Funds

Investments in Mutual Funds are accounted for at cost. Any subsequent fair value gain or loss is recognized through Profit or

Loss Account.

Derecognition

Financial Asset is primarily derecognised when:

(i)

The right to receive cash flows from asset has expired, or

(ii) The Company has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the

received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a “ pass-through” arrangement and either:

a)

The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or

b)

The Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has

transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass through arrangement,

it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained

substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise

the transferred asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises

an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and

obligations that the Company has retained.

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original

carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company could be required to repay.

Financial Liabilities

Initial Recognition and Measurement

All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly

attributable transaction costs. The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings

including bank overdrafts, and derivative financial instruments.

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction

between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values

A

The fair values of derivatives are on MTM as per Bank.

B

Company has opted to fair value its mutual fund investment through statement of profit & loss.

C

Company has opted to fair value its quoted investments in equity share through OCI.

D

As per Para D-15 of Appendix D of Ind AS 101, the first time adopter may chose to measure its investment in subsidiaries, JVs and

Associates at cost or at fair value. Company has opted to value its investments in subsidiaries, JVs and Associates at cost.

E

Company has adopted effective rate of interest for calculating Interest. This has been calculated as the weighted average of effective

interest rates calculated for each loan. In addition processing fees and transaction cost relating to each loan has also been considered

for calculating effective interest rate.

F

The Management has obtained independent valuer’s report for Financial Liability against: Letter Of Comfort (LOC) issued by the Company

for borrowing facility extended to a step-down subsidiary by the Bank. The fair valuation of LOC is based on the best evidence of fair

value determined by the valuer which valued the Letter of Comfort by applying Black Scholes Put Option Model using the inputs

(including business projections , cash flows, terminal value etc ) provided by the management of the Company and used applicable

discount rate ( as adjusted for risk) in arriving at the expected value of LOC.

* The carrying amounts are considered to be the same as their fair values due to short term nature.

Fair value hierarchy

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or

indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

letter of credit which can be called upon if the counterparty is in default under the

terms of the agreement.

Impairment is made on the expected credit losses, which are the present value of the cash shortfalls over the expected life of financial

assets. The estimated impairment losses are recognised in a separate provision for impairment and the impairment losses are recognised

in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Subsequent changes in assessment of impairment are recognised in provision for impairment and the change in impairment losses are

recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Investment in Equity Shares.

Investments in Equity Securities are initially measured at cost. Any subsequent fair value gain or loss is recognized through Profit or

Loss if such investments in Equity Securities are held for trading purposes. The fair value gains or losses of all other Equity Securities are

recognized in Other Comprehensive Income.

Investment in Associates, Joint Ventures and Subsidiaries.

The Company has accounted for its investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture at cost.

Investments in Mutual Funds

Investments in Mutual Funds are accounted for at cost. Any subsequent fair value gain or loss is recognized through Profit or Loss

Account.

Derecognition.

Financial Asset is primarily derecognised when:

(i)

The right to receive cash flows from asset has expired, or

(ii) The Company has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash

flows in full without material delay to a third party under a “ pass-through” arrangement and either:

a)

The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or

b)

The Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control

of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass through arrangement, it

evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially

all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to

the extent of the Company’s continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred

asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying

amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company could be required to repay.

Financial Liabilities.

Initial Recognition and Measurement

All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable

transaction costs. The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts,

and derivative financial instruments.
