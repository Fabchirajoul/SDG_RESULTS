Board Of

Dear Stakeholders

As we embark into the golden

jubilee year of our operations, I am

delighted that your Company has

accomplished 5 decades of tireless

service in the Indian chemical industry.

I am pleased to have served this

prestigious Company for 12 years

and will always fondly remember

my association with Deepak Nitrite

Limited (DNL) throughout its journey

of transformation. Now, it is time for

me to retire and pass on the baton to

the leader of next generation - Shri

Maulik Mehta. I feel proud to have

had the opportunity to take your

Company thus far with all the support

and guidance from you and the team

at DNL.

Over these 12 years, we have

witnessed several milestones and

the experience from all these

developments has been enriching and

delightful. Being a CEO of a global

company like DNL is an incredibly

demanding role. Fortunately, I

have always felt supported in my

role by the several passionate and

hardworking colleagues; my fellow

management team members who

have demonstrated utmost dedication

towards joint objectives and the

several thousand shareholders who

have reposed faith in us.

However, I fall short of words to convey

how much I have genuinely enjoyed

being part of and working with DNL

family. To spend over a decade of your

life amongst people so enormously

talented, relentless and optimistic, and

to together achieve excellence and

such wonderful outcomes has been

nothing short of a blessing.

Bidding my farewell, I warmly

congratulate Shri Maulik Mehta on

his new role, hoping for a brighter

future for him and my wholehearted

belief that we shall all witness Deepak

Nitrite’s continued evolution and

further scaling up into a world-class

chemical intermediates Company.

Best Regards,

UMESH ASAIKAR

Dear Stakeholders

We are pleased to present to you

our Forty Ninth Annual Report for the

Financial Year (FY) 2019-20. During

this year, Deepak Nitrite celebrates

the milestone of 50 years in business.

I would like to take this opportunity to

thank all of you, our stakeholders, who

are an integral part of our business

and have contributed in significant

measure to our progress. We have

entered the Golden Jubilee year on

the back of sound fundamentals,

profitability and strong performance

of Deepak Phenolics ahead of

expectations. We strongly believe

in delivering our promises made to

investors and other stakeholders. We

are now well positioned to take up

several growth opportunities and I am

sure that we will continue to receive

your support as ever.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC SCENARIO

FY 2019-20 was an extremely

challenging year for the global

economy and was marked by multiple

upheavals. Trade conflicts, political

uncertainties, heightened volatility in

commodity prices with some never

before seen developments with

respect to crude oil, protectionism etc.

Towards the end of the fiscal,

unprecedented impact was witnessed

from the global spread of the

COVID-19, which caused turmoil

across markets worldwide. The world

economy is anticipated to lose roughly

US$ 8.5 trillion in output in 2020 &

2021 (Source: UN – World Economic

Situation Report), nearly wiping out the

cumulative output gains of the last four

years. The pandemic has unfolded with

alarming magnitude and the severity

of the health and economic crisis is

incomparable to any event in recent

memory. Government enforced border

controls and lockdowns of varied

durations across multiple countries

have impacted economic operations

around the world. However, even as

Governments around the world deploy

fiscal and monetary stimulus in order

to successfully resuscitate demand, it

is believed that the second and third

order effects of the pandemic may

limit the pace of recovery.

India’s economic growth is estimated

to be lower at 1.2% in 2020, a further

decline from the previous year

growth of 4.1% (Source: UN – World

Economic Situation Report). In Fiscal

2019-20, the Indian Economy was

benefiting from lower interest rates,

witnessed benign inflation, improved

liquidity and was on course to witness

improved tax collections. Towards the

second half of the fiscal, India began

to witness early signs of an uptick in

business activities signalling return

of momentum to Asia’s third-largest

economy. However, those were short

lived as the pandemic has derailed the

prospects for higher economic growth

in the short term. The pace of recovery

is currently uncertain as the country is

yet unwinding from the lockdown and

the medium to long term outlook is

opaque at every level.

MAJOR PROSPECTS IN INDIAN

CHEMICAL INDUSTRY

The chemical industry in India has

been actively gaining global market

share in recent years and has been

a beacon of hope. Leading players

have demonstrated intent to scale up,

diversify offerings and plough earnings

back into the business by pursuing

innovation and sophistication. Given its

strong fundamentals, India’s chemical

industry is expected to keep growing

at a fairly strong pace after absorbing

the shock in FY 2021. Also, the pace

for the chemical industry’s adoption

of technology continues to be on the

rise. Looking towards an optimistic

future, India’s chemical industry is set

for sustained growth receiving impetus

with capital investment and affirmative

Government policies.

ENTERING 50TH YEAR

As Deepak Nitrite is on the verge

of completing its 50 years of

operations, we take immense pride

on our track record, not just of

financial performance but also of the

relationships that we have been able to

build along the way. Deepak Nitrite is

a trusted name in the Indian chemical

industry and it has done so by having

the right combination of dedicated

employees, effective manufacturing

processes and a sustained effort of

building long term relationships with

external stakeholders.

Its manufacturing strength is based

on having strong growth pillars and

considerable integration downstreams

which has allowed us to remain

resilient in the face of volatility.

Calibrated transformation has been

the underlying aspect of the Company

which has enabled us to elevate

our operations over the years and

continuously expand offerings to

increase the share of high-value and

complex products. Higher outlay in

capital infusion into R&D will help us

widen our basket in the coming years

and also in remaining competitive

on a global scale. At the heart of

this transformation, we cement our

strongest value: to be a force for good.

During FY 2019-20, Deepak Phenolics

having completed first full year of

operations after commencement of

commercial production and running

above 90% capacity utilization, is a

validation of the scale of commitment

FROM THE DESK OF

CHAIRMAN &: MANAGING DIRECTOR

Managing Director

Deepak Nitrite Limited | 23:

Dear Stakeholders

I feel honoured to be given the

opportunity to serve the Company

and reaffirm that I am committed to

growing the organisation keeping

sacred the values that are instilled by

promoters in Deepak Nitrite, while

embracing 50th year of legacy. I thank

Shri Umesh Asaikar for his efforts over

the last era to bring the Company at

today's height.

During the fiscal year, our Company

navigated global volatilities ably

deliver an excellent performance

on the back of an engaged team,

sustainable operations and a wide

portfolio of important chemical

intermediates. We continue to be

associated with leading names in the

Chemicals Industry. Our customers

have reaffirmed their commitment

further developing their product

lines with upstream support from

Companies like Deepak that deploy

state-of-the-art technology for process

and sustainability.

Strategic Transformation

We stand at a turning point in global

chemical supply chain as China

de-emphasizes its chemical

manufacturing industry, and global

partners look beyond for countries

and companies that can offer market

stability. Our Company is thus, well

regarded for its specialisation in niche

chemistries and ability to conduct

hazardous and complex processes

safely. During the year, DNL witnessed

its established business lines of Basic

Chemicals and Fine and Speciality

Chemicals break new grounds. The

Performance Products division

which reported a turnaround

performance in the prior fiscal was

able to further elevate itself.

In FY 2019-20, Deepak Phenolics

Limited (DPL), a wholly-owned

subsidiary, completed its first full

year of operations with a rapid ramp

up of about 90% capacity utilisation,

a testament to plant operators

and domestic customers’ desire to

partner with an Indian supplier. I take

the opportunity to share my deep

gratitude with all stakeholders. DPL

also commissioned its premium grade

Isopropyl Alcohol (‘IPA’) plant in April

2020, at the height of the lockdown,

thanks to stoic support from policy

makers and its technology team. With

a capacity of 30,000 MT, Deepak is

committed to supplying this essential

item at a time when human

needs transcend economics.

DNL is well along its journey of

becoming a Company that its

stakeholders, both internal and

external, can depend on for support,

growth opportunities and future

readiness. We hope to take this to

the next level by strategically utilizing

various land parcels to produce new

chemical intermediates in long

term relationships with key customers.

Performance and Operational

Excellence

The COVID pandemic challenged

our ability to respond to a crisis like

no other. We executed a Business

Continuity Plan which focused on

first ensuring employee welfare, and

restarting plants safely under the

shadow of manpower and material

movement constraints. Our Company

continues to prioritize revenue

recovery and a unique ability to

leverage strategic customer

relationships. Our Company,

nonetheless, lost about several days

of effective production in FY 2019-

20, and a large part of April so that it

could adhere to government policies

fully. On the one hand, we are working

with customers in the dyes segment

as they slowly restart their production,

while on the other, we see buoyant

demand from the pharmaceutical,

personal care and agrochemical

industries. I remain cautiously

optimistic about our performance this

year.

Environment and Sustainability

Despite the current situation

surrounding the pandemic, we believe

that the trend towards sustainable,

environmentally friendly operations

continues. Companies that hold these

values dear will see their performance

bolstered at the expense of others who

remain callous about manufacturing,

heedless of impact on the globe.

As a signatory of Responsible Care,

Together for Sustainability (TFS) and

Nicer Globe, DNL assigns the highest

importance of safety, environment

and health. Our Company has

implemented multiple initiatives to

reduce its carbon and water footprint,

and has developed value-added

chemicals from by-products in its

circular economy efforts. I can proudly

say that the DPL facility has the highest

energy efficiency of any Phenol plant

of its size in the world. I’d like to thank

all our stakeholders for their continued

encouragement and support. By

aligning our goals with those of our

customers, and society at large, we

are building a stronger, more resilient

Company that works to make the world

a better place with its presence.

Best Regards,

MAULIK D. MEHTA

CEO’s: LETTER

Dear Stakeholders

We stand on the cusp of 50 glorious

years of excellence and value creation.

This has been a long and fulfilling

journey where Deepak Nitrite Limited

(DNL) has successfully demonstrated

its capabilities and perseverance to

evolve from a local manufacturer

of Bulk Chemicals into a global

provider of Chemical intermediates.

It is fitting that we are on the verge of

50th year on the back of new records

set for revenues, operating margins,

profitability and return ratios. Our

track record over this journey of 5

decades, gives us immense pride

as we have built deep relationships

with leading enterprises in India and

overseas, established a manufacturing

footprint of global scale and positively

impacted the lives of employees,

associates, partners and through our

Foundation, served society at large. A

notable milestone for any institution,

we will take this opportunity to further

strengthen DNL and set it for higher

course in the years ahead.

Effective Project Management &

Strengthening Team Bond

During fiscal 2019-20, DNL witnessed

healthy demand for products both

locally and internationally and

has delivered a comprehensive

performance characterised by higher

volumes, increased realisations as well

as cost optimisation. We were able to

report improved margins in all of the

business segments on a standalone

basis as well as higher profitability in

its wholly owned subsidiary, Deepak

Phenolics Limited (DPL).

Through DPL, we achieved a key

milestone by substituting majority of

the local market imports of Phenol

and Acetone, and reportedly attaining

a market share of about 65% in the

country. DNL has been a frontrunner

in tapping the import substitution

opportunity in India, thereby

delivering long-term benefits to the

country. Additionally, it has also been

successful in producing and selling

pharma grade Acetone.

Backed by our diversified portfolio-

mix, DNL continued to leverage on

the better export demand for Fine

and Speciality Chemicals products

and DASDA which led to rise in the

share of exports in the overall business

mix. We have been able to capitalise

on the demand from large global

customers who are graduating towards

high quality and competitive global

suppliers as they seek to diversify

their sourcing requirements away

from China. We are fortunate to have

delivered a robust performance in

the first 11 months of FY 2019-20 that

the Company was able to withstand

the impact on the business from the

COVID-19 pandemic towards the end

of the fiscal year.

DNL acquired several land parcels

as a part of its capacity expansion

and growth plan. This comprises a

big parcel of land acquired at Dahej,

Gujarat, followed by smaller parcels

of land acquired in Hyderabad and

in Roha. The land acquired during FY

2019-20 has been capitalised wherein

the Company had paid ` 141 Crores in

aggregate for these land parcels.

Phenolics-Performance Update

During FY 2019-20, DPL has also

delivered a robust performance

with healthy profitability despite

cyclicality in Phenol and Acetone

prices globally. DPL had it first full year

of operations in FY 19-20, wherein

its Phenol production volumes were

just short of 200,000 tons or above

90% capacity utilisation. The shortfall

was owing to the loss of production

following the nation-wide lockdown

and consequent restrictions ordered

by the Government. Despite many

challenges, DNL has managed to

PERFORMANCE REVIEW

Standalone

Your Company delivered a solid all-round performance during

the year under review steered by positive growth across

its Strategic Business Units (“SBUs”). In FY 2019-20, Total

Revenue including Other Income stood at ` 2,237.24 Crores

as against ` 1,794.52 Crores in FY 2018-19.

EBITDA was `804.28 Crores in FY 2019-20, higher by

160.94% as compared to ` 308.23 Crores in FY 2018-

19. Higher margins were a result of favorable product mix,

improved realizations as well as cost efficiency initiatives

carried out. Raw material costs stood at ` 887.98 Crores as

against ` 976.18 Crores in FY 2018-19, lower by 9.04%.

Profit Before Tax (“PBT”) was ` 706.03 Crores as compared

to ` 212.50 Crores in FY 2018-19. The Profit After Tax (“PAT”)

stood at ` 544.04 Crores as compared to ` 138.04 Crores

in FY 2018-19. The robust performance during the year was

driven by growth initiatives which were implemented in prior

years to elevate your Company’s market position in India and

overseas. The integrated nature of operations which involve

production processes starting from key building blocks going

up to niche and complex chemical intermediates have allowed

your Company to take advantage of opportunities that arose

amidst rising volatility in product prices and disruption in

global supply chains. Specialisation in certain niche products

combined with strong demand has allowed your Company

to benefit from improved realisations, further strengthening

its leadership position in the market. The Depreciation and

Finance Costs during the year stood at ` 77.93 Crores and

` 20.32 Crores, respectively.

Domestic Revenues stood at ` 1,292.94 Crores from

` 1,211.53 Crores in FY 2018-19, representing a growth of

7% on account of positive and sustained demand scenario

from key end-user industries. The Revenue from exports

stood at ` 936.72 Crores compared to ` 580.39 Crores last

year. Increased demand along with higher realisation gains in

key export geographies expanded Export Revenues by 61%.

This was also supported by strategic initiatives undertaken by

the management team with respect to widening the customer

base and re-calibrating the product-mix.

The Indian chemical industry is well poised to capitalize on the

growing opportunities arising out of uncertainties and supply

disruptions created by other geographies globally. This is

expectedly a tailwind for the Indian chemical manufacturers

including your Company which has demonstrated scalability

and evolved to serve a diverse spectrum of end-user

industries. Even as the global economy remains impacted by

the COVID-19 pandemic and its fallout, the Indian chemical

industry is expected to continue this positive momentum

over the medium to long term and improve its market share

providing some of the leading companies like your Company a

platform to demonstrate capabilities on a global scale.:
