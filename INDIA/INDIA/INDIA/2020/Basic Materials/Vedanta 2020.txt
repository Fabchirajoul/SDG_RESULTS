Dear Stakeholders,

It is a great honour for me to share

my thoughts with you as your

Company’s Chairman. This year, the

Board welcomed and appointed me

as the Non-Executive Chairman of

Vedanta Limited. It is with great

pride that I say, your Company

has always been on a continuous

journey of growth and expansion with

best-in-class safety, benchmarked

technology, and cost efficiency. We

continuously ensure that we have

the right management in place to

drive our business and take the

organisation to the next level. In line

with this vision, we are pleased to

announce that your Company will

now be run by a guided Management

Committee comprising of your Group

Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief

Financial Officer (CFO),Chief Human

Resources Officer (CHRO) and Chief

Commercial Officer (CCO).

I sincerely wish and pray that you

all are safe at your homes. Your

safety matters to us, as the world

is currently grappling with an

unprecedented health crisis that we

all are fighting together. These are

undoubtedly testing times, but it also

brings to the fore the undaunted and

ingenious human spirit that prevails

against all challenges. We, at Vedanta,

salute this human spirit and solidarity

of citizens and nations across the

world, and reaffirm our commitment

to work towards a self-reliant and

sustainable future for all.

India’s COVID response continues

to be undoubtedly exemplary

by global standards, and the

Government of India, along with all

state governments are coordinating

effectively to flatten the curve. We,

at Vedanta, are doing our bit in a

modest way to help save lives and

livelihoods. You will be happy to know

that your Company has contributed

₹101 crore to the Prime Minister’s

Citizen Assistance and Relief in

Emergency Situations (PM-CARES)

received well-accredited recognitions

across governance, safety and

environmental parameters, including

moving up in the rankings of in the

Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).

To summarise, it was a year where

we could yet again validate the

confidence vested in us by everyone.

A GRADUAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY

In CY2019, the global economy

seemed to be on a path to recovery.

This was primarily led by the

bottoming out of manufacturing

activity and global trade and

monetary policy easing by central

banks the world over. This sentiment

was further bolstered at the start of

CY2020, in light of the progress in

US-China trade talks and Brexit deal.

In what was expected to be a year

of continued recovery, CY2020 now

has a fresh challenge to combat in

the form of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although it is early to ascertain its

impact on global supply chains,

consumer behaviour, overall business

sentiment and supply-demand

equations in the short term, we

will have more clarity only over the

medium term.

ENVIRONMENT IN INDIA

For India, FY2020 was characterised

by several developments, including

the re-election of the ruling party

with an even larger mandate; the

systemic identification, restructuring

and tidying up of prevailing issues in

the financial services sector; and the

announcement of a slew of policy

measures by the government.

While the clean-up applied temporary

brakes on growth owing to a credit

crunch, the fiscal and monetary

policy announcements acted as a

counterbalance, along with focus on

keeping inflation under permissible

limits. At the juncture that we

are in, India faces its own unique

opportunities and the priorities that

come with it.

As we stand today, we have the

reasons to believe that we are better

positioned than any other nation

with a visionary government, young

working population, a conducive

business environment and rising

public expenditure.

Dear Stakeholders,

This is my first integrated report since

assuming the role as Interim Group

CEO of Vedanta Limited and I am

honoured and humbled to be leading

our great Company which I have

proudly been a part of for last ten

years. I must begin by acknowledging

Mr. Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan for his

leadership in our Company over the

last two years. Under his guidance,

we built an exceptionally strong

foundation that will benefit our

We are grateful for his service.

Vedanta has a rich legacy as India’s

selflessness. We strive for a positive

impact on the communities we

Hot Metal from the Blast Furnace operation

Pig Iron - Finished product

Global refined copper consumption

remained unchanged in 2019 at 23.5

Mt vis-à-vis 2018, while demand in

China, the largest copper consumer

increased by ~1%. Geopolitical

tensions and a struggling global

manufacturing sector plagued refined

copper consumption in 2019.

Encouraging developments in the

trade dispute between the US and

China was gradually bolstering

kg, way below the world average of

229.3 kg, suggesting a huge unrealised

potential for steel demand growth.

Recently, India has been trying to

unleash this through an extensive

reform agenda and an ongoing push

for infrastructure development.

These factors, along with favourable

demographics, are improving the

macroeconomic fundamentals.

India was a net exporter in FY2020

at 1.5 million tonnes net exports

compared to net importer in FY2019

with exports increased to 8.3 million

tonnes a growth of 31.4 % in FY2020

compared to FY2019 at 6.3 million

tonnes. However, the country is to

witness a sudden increase in exports

in FY21 as well.

Products and Customers

We completed the acquisition of

ESL, an integrated steel plant on

June 4, 2018. ESL is primarily selling

Wire rod, TMT and DI pipe products

in India mainly to the construction,

infrastructure and automotive sectors.

In India, long products consumption

was increased to 52 million tonnes, a

growth of 5.83% in FY2020 compared

to 49 million tonnes in FY2019,

whereas flat products have seen a flat

of 3.06% from 49.4 million tonnes in

FY2019 to 47.9 million tonnes.

consumer confidence. However, the

pandemic outbreak has jeopardised

recovery at least for the medium

term. On the supply side, India

grappled with availability constraints

of refined copper due to Vedanta’s

Tuticorin smelter closure for the

second year

in a row.

Products and Customers

Refined copper is predominantly

used in manufacturing cables,

transformers and motors as well as

castings and alloy-based products.

The Tuticorin smelter closure

adversely impacted our production in

India.

Market Drivers and Opportunities

Over the medium and long term,

copper consumption in India and

China is likely to increase, driven

by population growth, urbanisation,

the rise of aspiring middle class and

demand for EVs.

These trends are supported by

enabling government measures and

initiatives. However, these forecasts

will only hold true if the virus is

contained properly and there are no

fears of massive disruption in socio-

economic life across geographies.

On the supply side, there could

be further disruptions in copper

production due to the smelter

upgrades in Chile following the

introduction of new environmental

regulations.

The extended closures at Chilean

smelters (including Chuquicamata

and Potrerillos) reduced smelter

production in the first half of 2019.

Our ability to take advantage of

emerging opportunities is largely

dependent on the re-opening of our

smelter at Tuticorin.

Stack of Copper Cathodes, Sterlite Copper

COPPER

STEEL

The construction sector is boosting

steel demand

Global crude steel production reached

1,869 million tons for the year CY2019,

up by 3.03% compared to 2018.

Growth can be attributed to increase

in production by China at 8.3% y-o-y.

India’s crude steel production was

108.57 million tons, down by 2.1%

on 2019, meaning that India has

replaced Japan as the world’s second

largest steel producing country. While

the steel demand recovery seen in

2018 continued in 2019, risks have

increased due to global pandemic

breakdown, high debts and volatile

capital flows in many emerging

economies. As a result, steel prices

are expected to experience volatility

in 2020. India’s steel demand has

shown a marginal growth of 1.4%

from 98.7 million tonnes in FY2019

to 100 million tons in FY2020. But

world steel consumption is expected

to see a fall of 15-20% in 2020 as a

result of the virus outbreak. In the

medium term (2019-2024), demand is

expected to grow at 0-2% CAGR with

world excluding china at growing at

1-3% CAGR.

India’s steel use per capita for

finished steel products stood at 74.3

Market Drivers and Opportunities

With COVID-19 spreading across

the globe, steel demand to see a

substantial decline in 2020. Speed

of recovery will be influenced by

containment of virus and government

stimulus. The pandemic may bring

further setbacks to globalization,

with global supply chain disruptions

and nationalistic trade/ investment

measures. The automotive sector

shall be hardest hit among

steel using sectors followed by

mechanical machinery. Deep scars

from the pandemic may have a

lasting impact on economies and

investment recovery shall take

time. Business paradigm hasto

adjust to the new normal - social

distancing, teleworking, changes in

consumer behaviour and preferences.

Social distancing may undermine

productivity and increase costs.

While construction sector, which

is identified as the steel demand

driver shall be affected by changing

demand for housing v/s commercial

buildings, new urbanisation patterns,

weak investment, shift towards green

energy, the machinery sector will

suffer from low investment, but shall

boost from automation. Favourable

government stimulus shall be the key

to economy’s revival.

VEDANTA LIMITED INTEGRATED REPORT AND ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019-20 241:

letter dated December 03, 2019 as a pre-condition to

PSC extension.

bЌ Proɯt Petroleum:

DGH, in May 2018, raised a demand for the period up

to March 31, 2017 for Government’s additional share

of Profit Oil based on its computation of disallowance

of cost incurred over the initially approved Field

Development Plan (FDP) of pipeline project for ` 1,508

Crore (US$ 202 million) and retrospective re-allocation

of certain common costs between Development Areas

(DAs) of Rajasthan Block aggregating to ` 2,723 Crore

(US$ 364 million), representing share of the Company

and its subsidiary. DGH vide it’s: letter dated May 12,

2020, reiterated its demand only with respect to the

retrospective re-allocation of certain common costs

between Development Areas (DAs) of Rajasthan Block

of ` 2,723 Crore (US$ 364 million) for the period upto

March 31, 2017.

Subsequently, the Company in January 2020 received

notifications from DGH on audit exceptions arising out

of its audit for the FY 2017-18, which comprises of the

consequential effects on profit oil due to the aforesaid

matters and certain new matters on cost allowability

plus interest aggregating to ` 4,828 Crore (US$ 645

million), representing share of the Company and its

subsidiary, which have been suitably responded to by

the Company.

The Company believes that it has sufficient as well

as reasonable basis (pursuant to PSC provisions &

approvals), supported by legal advice, for having

claimed such costs and for allocating common costs

between different DAs. In the Company’s opinion,

these computations of the aforesaid demand / audit

exceptions are not appropriate and the accounting

adjustments sought for issues pertaining to Year 2007

and onwards are based on assumptions that are not

in consonance with the approvals already in place.

The Company’s view is also supported by independent

legal opinion and the Company has been following

the process set out in PSC to resolve these aforesaid

matters. Thus, the Company sought for appointment of

a sole expert for opining on the audit exceptions by a

letter dated November 14, 2019 and thereafter on May

14, 2020, Company has issued a notice of Arbitration

proceeding on the above matters and is confident of

resolution of matters in its favour.

Further to above stated letter from GoI on October

26, 2018, in view of pending non-finalisation of the

Addendum to PSC, the extraordinary situation prevailing

on account of COVID-19 and non-finalisation of issues

including the aforesaid DGH demand, the GoI granted,

vide letter dated May 14, 2020, permission to the

Company to continue petroleum operations in RJ-ON-

90/I block, till the execution of the Addendum to PSC

or for a period of three months from May 15, 2020,

whichever is earlier.

In our view, above mentioned condition linked to

PSC extension is untenable and has not resulted in

creation of any liability and cannot be a ground for

non-extension. In addition, all necessary procedures

prescribed in the PSC including invocation of arbitration,

License and the Registration Certificate for the existing

smelter plant.

The Company has appealed this before the National

Green Tribunal (NGT). NGT vide its order on December

15, 2018 has set aside the impugned orders and

directed the TNPCB to pass fresh orders for renewal

of consent and authorisation to handle hazardous

substances, subject to appropriate conditions for

protection of environment in accordance with law.

The State of Tamil Nadu and TNPCB approached

Supreme Court in Civil Appeals on January 02, 2019

challenging the judgement of NGT dated December 15,

2018 and the previously passed judgement of NGT dated

August 08, 2013. The Supreme Court vide its judgement

dated February 18, 2019 set aside the judgements of

NGT dated December 15, 2018 and August 08, 2013

on the basis of maintainability alone and directed the

Company to file an appeal in High court.

The Company has filed a writ petition before Madras

High Court challenging the various orders passed

against the Company in 2018 and 2013. Continous

hearings were conducted from June 2019 to January

2020. Rejoinder and sur-rejoinder arguments on behalf

of the parties concluded on January 08, 2020 and the

orders have been reserved for judgement.

Further, in October 2019, the Company has filed a writ

petition in Madras High court for allowing access to

plant to undertake essential care and maintenance

as due to lack of care and maintenance in the last

18 months, several structures such as pipelines,

cable trays etc. are in corroded state and likely to get

damaged. Management believes that assessment of

physical damage, if any, can be carried out once it gets

access to the plant. However, the same is not expected

to be material.

As per the Company’s assessment, it is in compliance

with the applicable regulations and expects to get

the necessary approvals in relation to the existing

operations.

The Company has carried out an impairment analysis for

existing plant assets during the year ended March 31,

2020 considering the key variables and concluded that

there exists no impairment. The Company has done an

additional sensitivity analysis with commencement of

operations of the existing plant in FY 2022-23 and noted

that the recoverable amount of the assets would still be

in excess of their carrying values.

The carrying value of the assets as at March 31, 2020 is

` 2,328 Crore.

Expansion Plant:

Separately, the Company has filed a fresh application

for renewal of the Environmental Clearance for the

proposed Copper Smelter Plant 2 (Expansion Project)

dated March 12, 2018 before the Expert Appraisal

Committee of the MoEF wherein a sub-committee was

directed to visit the Expansion Project site prior to

prescribing the Terms of Reference.

In the meantime, the Madurai Bench of the High

Court of Madras in a Public Interest Litigation held

vide its order dated May 23, 2018 that the application

for renewal of the Environmental Clearance for the

Expansion Project shall be processed after a mandatory

public hearing and in the interim, ordered the Company

to cease construction and all other activities on site for

the proposed Expansion Project with immediate effect.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has

delisted the expansion project since the matter is sub-

judice. Separately, SIPCOT vide its letter dated May 29,

2018, cancelled 342.22 acres of the land allotted for the

proposed Expansion Project. Further the TNPCB issued

orders on June 07, 2018 directing the withdrawal of the

Consent to Establish (CTE) which was valid till March

31, 2023.

The Company has approached Madras High Court by way

of writ petition challenging the cancellation of lease

deeds by SIPCOT pursuant to which an interim stay

has been granted. The Company has also filed Appeals

before the TNPCB Appellate Authority challenging

withdrawal of CTE by the TNPCB, the matter is pending

for adjudication.

Rmpairment recognised during the year

For the expansion plant, the project activities are on

halt since May 2018. Further, the project EC for the

expansion plant got expired on December 31, 2018

and fresh application is filed before the competent

authority, however, the process will start only after

reopening of the existing plant and after obtaining all

statutory approvals, the timing of which is uncertain.

Keeping in view the above factors and the fact that

value in use cannot be reasonably ascertained, the

Company has carried out recoverability assessment

of the items of property, plant and equipment, capital

work-in-progress (CWIP) and capital advances. Based

on the realisable value estimate of ` 288 Crore, the

Company has recognised an impairment of ` 669 Crore

(comprising of CWIP balances of ` 435 Crore, capital

advances of ` 196 Crore and other assets of ` 38 Crore)

during the year.

Property, plant and equipment of ` 1,473 Crore and

inventories of ` 517 Crore, pertaining to existing and

for a ten-year extension of PSC for Ravva Block

with effect from October 28, 2019, in terms of the

provision of the “Policy on the Grant of the extension

to Production Sharing Contract Signed by Government

awarding small, medium-sized and discovered field to

private joint ventures” dated March 28, 2016. The PSC

addendum recording this extension has been executed

by all parties.

The Ravva Extension Policy, amongst others, provides

for an increased share of profit petroleum of 10% for

the GoI during the extended term of the Ravva PSC

and payment of royalty and cess as per prevailing

rate in accordance with the PNG Rules, 1959 and

OIDB Act. Under the Ravva PSC, – the Company’s oil

and gas business is entitled to recover 100% of cost

of production and development from crude oil and

natural gas sales before any profit is allocated among

the parties. Cost recovery for exploration cost during

extension period shall be governed as per the provision

of Office Memorandum 2013, 2019 issued by MoPNG

on exploration in mining lease area post expiry of the

exploration period.

(ix) Impact of Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019

Pursuant to the introduction of Section 115BAA of the

Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 which is effective April

01, 2019, companies in India have the option to pay

corporate income tax at the rate of 22% plus applicable

surcharge and cess as against the earlier rate of 30%

plus applicable surcharge and cess, subject to certain

conditions like, the Company has to forego all benefits

like tax holidays, brought forward losses generated

through tax incentives/additional depreciation and

outstanding MAT credit. Considering all the provisions

under Section 115BAA and based on the expected

timing of exercising of the option under Section

115BAA, the Company had re-measured its deferred

tax balances as at March 31, 2019 leading to a deferred

tax credit of ` 834 Crore being recognised during the

financial year. This requires assumptions regarding

future profitability, which is inherently uncertain. To

the extent assumptions regarding future profitability

change, there can be increase or decrease in the

amounts recognised.

(x) Assessment of impairment of assets at Aluminium

division

Considering lower sales realisation, an impairment

trigger has been identified in the aluminium division of

the Company. The impairment assessments are based

on a range of estimates and assumptions, including:

Estimates/

assumptions

Basis

Future

production

Production facilities and expansion projects

Commodity

prices

management’s best estimate benchmarked

with external sources of information, to

ensure they are within the range of available

analyst forecast

Discount rates

cost of capital risk-adjusted for the risk

specific to the asset/ CGU

The Company has carried out an impairment analysis,

based on value in use approach, considering the

key variables and concluded that there exists no

impairment. The Company has carried out sensitivity

analysis on key assumptions including commodity price,

discount rate and delay in expansion of refinery. Based

on sensitivity analysis, the recoverable amount is still

expected to exceed the carrying value as at March 31,

2020 of ` 36,992 Crore.

(xi) Flue-gas Desulfuriȧation

Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change

(MOEF&CC) has revised emission norms for coal-

based power plants in India. Accordingly, both captive

and independent coal-based power plants in India

are required to comply with these revised norms for

reduction of sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions for which

the current plant infrastructure is to be modified or

new equipment’s have to be installed. Timelines for

compliance to the revised norm for various plants in

the Company range from June 2020 to March 2022.

Different power plants are at different stages of the

implementation process. However, it is unlikely that the

implementation would be completed by the stipulated

date.

CPCB vide notification dated May 20, 2020 published

on its website has imposed a penalty of ` 18 Lacs

per month per non-compliant unit and any further

directions based on the periodic review of compliance

status.

Power plants of the Company are required to comply

with the revised norms in the coming year(s). Company’s

respective operations have been engaging with the

concerned authorities to extend the timeline for

letter dated December 03, 2019 as a pre-condition to

b) Profit Petroleum:

DGH, in May 2018, has raised a demand for the period

up to March 31, 2017 for Government’s additional share

of Profit oil based on its computation of disallowance

of cost incurred over the initially approved Field

Development Plan (FDP) of pipeline project for ` 1,508

Crore (US$ 202 million) and retrospective re-allocation

of certain common costs between Development Areas

(DAs) of Rajasthan Block aggregating to ` 2,723 Crore

(US$ 364 million), representing share of the Company

and its subsidiary. DGH vide it’s: letter dated May 12,

2020, reiterated its demand only with respect to the

retrospective re-allocation of certain common costs

between Development Areas (DA’S) of Rajasthan block of

` 2,723 Crore (US$ 364 million) for the period upto March

31, 2017.

Subsequently, the Company in January 2020 received

notifications from DGH on audit exceptions arising out

of its audit for the FY 2017-18, which comprises of the

consequential effects on profit oil due to the aforesaid

matters and certain new matters on cost allowability

plus interest aggregating to ` 4,828 Crore (US$ 645

million), representing share of the Company and its

subsidiary, which have been suitably responded to by the

Company.

The Company believes that it has sufficient as well

as reasonable basis (pursuant to PSC provisions &

approvals), supported by legal advice, for having

claimed such costs and for allocating common costs

between different DAs. In the Company’s opinion, these

computations of the aforesaid demand / audit exceptions

are not appropriate and the accounting adjustments

sought for issues pertaining to Year 2007 and onwards

are based on assumptions that are not in consonance

with the approvals already in place. The Company’s view

is also supported by independent legal opinion and the

Company has been following the process set out in PSC

to resolve these aforesaid matters. Thus, the Company

sought for appointment of a sole expert for opining on

the audit exceptions by a letter dated November 14, 2019

and thereafter on May 14, 2020, Company has issued a

notice of Arbitration proceeding on the above matters

and is confident of resolution of matters in its favor.

Further to above stated letter from GoI on October

26,2018, in view of pending non-finalisation of the

Addendum to PSC, the extraordinary situation prevailing

on account of COVID-19 and non-finalisation of issues

including the aforesaid DGH demand, the GoI granted,

vide letter dated May 14, 2020, permission to the Group

to continue petroleum operations in RJ-ON-90/I block,

till the execution of the Addendum to PSC or for a period

of three months from May 15, 2020, whichever is earlier.

In our view, above mentioned condition linked to PSC

extension is untenable and has not resulted in creation

of any liability and cannot be a ground for non-extension.

In addition, all necessary procedures prescribed in the

PSC including invocation of arbitration, in respect of

the stated audit observation have also been fulfilled.

Accordingly, in our view, the PSC extension approval

granted vide DGH letter dated October 26, 2018 upholds

with all conditions addressed and no material liability

would devolve upon the Group.

Ravva locƤ

The Government of India (GoI) has granted its approval

for a ten-year extension of PSC for Ravva Block with

effect from October 28, 2019, in terms of the provision of

the “Policy on the Grant of the extension to Production

Sharing Contract Signed by Government awarding small,

medium-sized and discovered field to private joint

ventures” dated March 28, 2016. The PSC addendum

recording this extension has been executed by all parties.

The Ravva Extension Policy, amongst others, provides for

an increased share of profit petroleum of 10% for the GoI

during the extended term of the Ravva PSC and payment

of royalty and cess as per prevailing rate in accordance

with the PNG Rules, 1959 and OIDB Act. Under the

Ravva PSC, –the Company’s oil and gas business is

entitled to recover 100% of cost of production and

development from crude oil and natural gas sales before

any profit is allocated among the parties. Cost recovery

for exploration cost during extension period shall be

governed as per the provision of Office Memorandum

2013, 2019 issued by MoPNG on exploration in mining

lease area post expiry of the exploration period.

(ix) Impact of Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019

Pursuant to the introduction of Section 115BAA of the

Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 which is effective April

01, 2019, companies in India have the option to pay

corporate income tax at the rate of 22% plus applicable

surcharge and cess as against the earlier rate of 30%

plus applicable surcharge and cess, subject to certain

conditions like, the company has to forego all benefits

like tax holidays, brought forward losses generated

through tax incentives/additional depreciation and

outstanding MAT credit. Considering all the provisions

under Section 115BAA and based on the expected timing

of exercising of the option under Section 115BAA, the

Group has re-measured its deferred tax balances leading

to a deferred tax credit of ` 1,774 Crore on deferred tax

balances as at March 31, 2019 being recognised during

the financial year. This computation required assessment

of assumptions regarding future profitability, which

is inherently uncertain. To the extent assumptions

regarding future profitability change, there can be

increase or decrease in the amounts recognised.

(x) Flue-gas desulfurisation (FGD) implementation:

Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change

(MOEF&CC) has revised emission norms for coal-

based power plants in India. Accordingly, both captive

and independent coal-based power plants in India

are required to comply with these revised norms for

reduction of sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions for which

the current plant infrastructure is to be modified or

new equipment’s have to be installed. Timelines for

compliance to the revised norm for various plants in

the Group range from December 2019 to March 2022.

Different power plants are at different stages of the

implementation process. However, it is unlikely that the

implementation would be completed by the stipulated

date.

TSPL for which the last date of compliance was

December 31, 2019, has issued Letter of Intent (LOI)

to the successful bidder and continues to operate the

plant in absence of any directions from Central Pollution

Control Board (CPCB) or MOEF&CC. TSPL is confident

that authorities would take considerate stand in view of

stringent timelines and earnest efforts taken by the plant

to meet the environmental norms. TSPL has received

show cause notice from Punjab Pollution Control Board

(PPCB), which was favourably disposed of by PPCB with

a recommendation to CPCB for extension of timeline.

Subsequently, a show cause notice has been issued

by CPCB to TSPL and other power plants which were

required to meet December 31, 2019 deadline. CPCB

vide notice dated May 20, 2020 published on its website,

has imposed penalty of ` 18 Lacs per month per non-

compliant unit and any further directions based on the

periodic review of compliance status.

Similarly, other power plants of the Group in India are

required to comply with the revised norms in the coming

year(s). Group’s respective operations have been engaging

with the concerned authorities to extend the timeline for

compliance. In the event, the request for extension of

timeline is not accepted, this could lead to levy of some

penalties, the impact of which is not likely to be material.

(xi)ч Electrosteel Steels Limited had filed application

for renewal of Consent to Operate (‘CTO’) on August 24,

2017 for the period of five years which was denied by

Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (‘JSPCB’) on

August 23, 2018. Hon’ble High Court of Jharkhand has

granted stay on August 25, 2018 against said order of

denial of CTO by JSPCB and the stay has been extended

by the Court to allow the operations till next date of

hearing, which is now fixed on June 19, 2020. Hon’ble

High Court has also extended stay against order of
