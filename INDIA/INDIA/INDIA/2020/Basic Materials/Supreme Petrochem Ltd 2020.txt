letter providing the e-mail address, mobile number, self-

attested PAN copy along with client master copy (in case

of electronic mode)/copy of share certificate (in case of

physical mode) via e-mail at the Email Id – einward.ris@

kfintech.com for obtaining the Annual Report and Notice

of e-AGM of the Company electronically.

6.

In case of joint holders, the Member whose name appears

as the first holder in the order of names as per the Register

of Members of the Company will be entitled to vote at the

AGM.

7.

To avoid fraudulent transactions, the identity/signature of

the Members holding shares in electronic/demat form is

verified with the specimen signatures furnished by NSDL/

CDSL and that of members holding shares in physical

form is verified as per the records of the R&T Agent of

the Company. Members are requested to keep the same

updated.

8.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Act and other applicable

Regulations, a Member entitled to attend and vote at the

AGM is entitled to appoint a proxy to attend and vote

on their behalf and the proxy need not be a Member of

the Company. However since this AGM is being held

pursuant to the MCA/SEBI Circulars through VC/OAVM,

physical attendance of Members has been dispensed with.

Accordingly, the facility for appointment of proxies by the

Members will also not be available for the AGM and hence

the Proxy Form and Attendance Slip are not annexed to

the Notice.

9.

Corporate/institutional Members (i.e. other than individuals,

HUF, NRI, etc.) are required to send a scanned copy (PDF/

JPG format) of the relevant Board Resolution/Authority: Letter/Power of Attorney etc. together with attested

specimen signature of the duly authorised signatory(ies)

who is/are authorised to vote, to the Scrutinizer through

e-mail at supreme.scrutiniser@gmail.com and may also

upload the same in the e-voting module in their login. The

scanned image of the above documents should be in the

naming format ‘SPL_EVENT No.’

10. The facility of joining the e-AGM through VC/OAVM will

be opened 15 minutes before and will remain open upto

15 minutes after the scheduled start time of the e-AGM,

i.e. from 03.45 p.m. to 04.15 p.m. and will be available

for 1000 members on a first-come first-served basis.

This rule would however not apply to participation in

respect of large Shareholders (Shareholders holding 2%

or more shareholding), Promoters, Institutional Investors,
