MANAGING DIRECTOR, CENTURYPLY

hat is the marketing strategy of

Centuryply?

The principal marketing strategy

at our company is to make something

of a quality standard that speaks

for itself. Centuryply manufactures

and markets a range of products like

plywood and doors. The brand is

synonymous with strength, quality

and a peace of mind. The Company’s

surface products like laminates and

veneers are respected for aesthetics

and choice. During the last few

years, the Company has focused on

enhancing trust at a time when most

consumers are seeking to shift from

anonymous commodity alternatives to

branded solutions.

What are the different ways that the

Company has selected to market

products?

The organisation uses a mix of

‘above the line’ (TV commercial,

print, radio, outdoor) and ‘below the

line’ media vehicles (point of sales

activation initiatives) to promote

campaigns. During the last year,

the biggest initiative comprised

the digital. In a business-as-usual

scenario, we invested 4% of our gross

revenues in brand building; in today’s

environment, much of our spending is

on the digital medium.

How is the product being perceived by

its target consumer segment?

The name Century, the red colour and

the star logo are widely recognised

among consumers and trade partners.

The products of Centuryply are used

by consumers who seek value in our

quality, range and guarantee. Our last

consumer research indicated that

the core equity of Century was trust,

reflected in a peace of mind that ‘Once

we have brought Century, we know

we will not need to worry about the

product for years.’

What branding initiatives were taken

during the year under review?

Centuryply undertook a number of

initiatives in 2019-20: nation-wide

external wall painting, retail-wise

branding, own store launch, Influencer

Loyalty Program and the digital

initiative (social media marketing,

content marketing, e-commerce,

brand and product campaigns, affiliate

tie-ups, moment marketing etc.).

Why is much of the spending moving

towards the digital?

Digitisation is the future when it

comes to marketing for reasons of

effectiveness and efficiency. The result

is that digitisation initiatives are

being taken across functions, strategic

business units and stakeholders. This

momentum is irreversible on account

of the ease of connect, accessibility

and affordability of access. The

conventional 360-degree marketing

has been replaced by 365-day

marketing. Centuryply responded to

this reality with a number of product,

brand and service-related promotions:

some focused on educating customers

on product features, some targeted

building preferences for brands, some

were directed at enhancing awareness

and some were directed at social

awareness.

Which brand-related campaign was

launched?

Century Heroes was an initiative

started in 2014 to pay tribute to the

real heroes in our world without

whose contribution large and complex

projects can never become a reality.

The carpenter community works

behind the scenes to make sure

that not only stiff deadlines are met

but also deliver high workmanship

- the #strong inside beautiful

outside positioning. Century Heroes

recognised their indomitable spirit

and workmanship through a film,

enhancing awareness of the need to

respect carpenters’ competence. The

content, based on real-life instances,

sent out a warm and positive social

message. The result: the film

registered around six million ‘hits’

on the social media and was adjudged

among 50 most impactful campaigns

of 2018 by Social Samosa.

Was there any environment-

related initiative undertaken by the

Company?

The Company continued to spread

awareness against the irresponsible

use of plastic, encouraged tree

planting and extended to the issue

of breast cancer. Breast cancer is the

largest cause of cancer deaths among

women. The campaign urged men and

women to share their pictures on their

social media handles with an element

of pink and take the #PinkPledge of

self-detection. Men were requested

to encourage women to take the

#PinkPledge. The total ‘likes’ were

89,111 with an approximate reach of

584,829. On instagram, the campaign

reported 54,575 ‘likes’ and the post

was ‘saved’ 457 times. Century

Excise Duty Refund Claim *

1,181.04

-

* The Company has claimed refund of 50% of differential excise duty paid in cash, for its plywood unit in north-east India, on the basis of

favourable decision by Hon’ble Guwahati High Court, which was passed relying on the decision by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of

M/s V.V.F Limited & others versus the Union of India. However, the Hon’ble Supreme Court, vide its judgement dated 22 April 2020, has

reversed its earlier decision in the case of M/s V.V.F Limited, mentioned herein, and allowed the subsequent and amended notifications

issued by revenue authority which replaced the 100% excise duty refund benefit as envisaged in original notification no. 20/2007, with

refund equivalent to specified percentage of excise duty payable based on value addition and held that the amended notifications was

clarificatory in nature and is not hit by doctrine of promissory estoppel. The objective of the amended notifications was to prevent tax

evasion by some of the unscrupulous assessees by misusing the benefit granted vide the original notification and therefore doctrine of

promissory estoppel cannot be invoked when the public interest warrants.

Being aggrieved by this judgement, the Company is in the process of preferring an appeal before the appropriate forum against the

same, as the act of some unscrupulous assesse cannot be considered as basis to implement a judgement that has an adverse impact on

the genuine manufacturers and the said act of the revenue authority cannot be said to be in public interest. Further, based on the legal

advice obtained by the Company from External Counsel, as well as its own assessment, there is every likelihood of the Company’s appeal

being allowed and consequent reversal of the above judgement by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.

In view of the above, reversal of income which was previously recognized in the books of accounts, amounting to H1,181.04 lacs, is not

required.

Note: Based on discussion with the solicitors/favourable decisions in similar cases/legal opinion taken by the Company, the management

believes that the outflow of resources is not probable and hence, no provision there against is considered necessary.

Excise Duty Refund Claim *

1,181.04

-

* The Group has claimed refund of 50% of differential excise duty paid in cash, for one of its plywood unit in north-east India, on the basis

of favourable decision by Hon’ble Guwahati High Court, which was passed relying on the decision by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the

case of M/s V.V.F Limited & others versus the Union of India. However, the Hon’ble Supreme Court, vide its judgement dated 22nd April,

2020, has reversed its earlier decision in the case of M/s V.V.F Limited, mentioned herein, and allowed the subsequent and amended

notifications issued by revenue authority which replaced the 100% excise duty refund benefit as envisaged in original notification no.

20/2007, with refund equivalent to specified percentage of excise duty payable based on value addition and held that the amended

notifications was clarificatory in nature and is not hit by doctrine of promissory estoppel. The objective of the amended notifications

was to prevent tax evasion by some of the unscrupulous assessees by misusing the benefit granted vide the original notification and

therefore doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked when the public interest warrants.

Being aggrieved by this judgement, the Group is in the process of preferring an appeal before the appropriate forum against the same,

as the act of some unscrupulous assesse cannot be considered as basis to implement a judgement that has an adverse impact on the

genuine manufacturers and the said act of the revenue authority cannot be said to be in public interest. Further, based on the legal

advice obtained by the Company from External Counsel, as well as its own assessment, there is every likelihood of the Company’s appeal

being allowed and consequent reversal of the above judgement by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.

In view of the above, reversal of income which was previously recognized in the books of accounts, amounting to H1,181.04 lacs, is not

required.

Note: Based on discussion with the Solicitors / Favourable Decisions in similar Cases / Legal opinion taken by the Group, the management

believes that the outflow of resources is not probable and hence, no provision there against is considered necessary.
