Managing Director’s Message:

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

Every once in a while, a truly global event occurs, altering the

traditional paradigm of life and living. It also brings to the fore

the collective human ingenuity, not only to transcend existential

challenges but also to thrive in a new normal. At J.K. Cement,

we have always emphasised the importance of growing together

to stay ahead of the curve. The strong and vibrant stakeholder

ecosystem we have built over the years, strengthens our

resilience and provides a strong foundation to propel the next

phase of our growth journey and co-create a shared future.

STRONG ALL-ROUND PERFORMANCE IN

A CHALLENGING YEAR

I am pleased to share that J.K. Cement delivered another year

of strong growth and profitability in FY 2019-20, amid an already

challenging external environment that was further dampened by

the COVID-19 pandemic. A slowing domestic economy, delayed

infrastructure spending and pandemic-induced disruptions in the

fourth quarter impacted cement demand. Considering the high

correlation of cement demand with the domestic economy, our

performance demonstrates our robust fundamentals, driven by

resource efficiency, expanded capacities, growing prominence

across urban and rural markets and enhanced reach.

We achieved growth of 10% in revenue from operations to

₹ 5,464 Crores in FY 2019-20 (from ` 4,981 Crores in

FY 2018-19). Our EBIDTA increased 40% to ` 1,201 Crores in

FY 2019-20 (from ` 855 Crores in FY 2018-19) while EBIDTA

margin improved to 21.98% in 2019-20 (17.16% in FY 2018-19).

EBIDTA/tonne rose 41% to ` 1,256 in FY 2019-20 from ` 888 in

FY 2018-19. Net profit increased 23% to ` 400 Crores in

FY 2019-20 (from ₹ 325 Crores in FY 2018-19). Our earnings per

share stood at ` 51.82 in FY 2019-20. The Board recommended

an interim dividend of ` 7.50 per share in February 2020 which

was treated as final dividend in the meeting held in June 2020.

At J.K. Cement, we have always

emphasised the importance of growing

together to stay ahead of the curve.

46. COVID-19

The operations of the Company were impacted in the month of March 2020 due to temporary shutdown of all

plants following nationwide lockdown announced by the Government of India because of COVID-19 outbreak.

On account of this, the Company has prepared cash flow projections, assessed the impact on operations and

also assessed the recoverability of receivables, impairment of its property plant and equipment, factored

assumptions used in annual impairment testing of investment in subsidiaries and intangible assets having

indefinite useful lives using various internal and external information up to date of approval of these financial

results. On the basis of evaluation, current indicators of future economic conditions and cement industry

in particular, the Company expects to recover the carrying amount of these assets and does not anticipate

any impairment to these financial and non-financial assets on going concern basis. The impact of COVID-19

may impact the underlying assumptions and estimates used to prepare the Company's financial statements,

which may differ from that considered as at the date of approval of these financial statements. The Company

will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions, which are subject to

uncertainties that COVID-19 outbreak might pose on economic recovery.:
