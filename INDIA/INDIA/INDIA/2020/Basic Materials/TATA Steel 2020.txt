Building bridges to the future

SINCE 1907

We have helped shape India’s industrial narrative since the time we set up

our first steel plant in Jamshedpur to cater to local steel demand. More than

a century later, we continue to make the world’s most versatile material even

better to help create iconic structures and landmarks, as well as roads and

bridges to make life easier. In the meantime, we have navigated through the

ebb and flow of wars and pandemics, and highs and lows of the industry,

which have strengthened our resolve and resilience.

Today, as India takes confident strides towards economic ‘self-reliance’,

we remain committed to move forward on our intertwined growth

journey. Our desire to imagine, innovate and co-create a future with infinite

possibilities is reflected in our efforts to look beyond steel, adopt

next-generation technologies and make a meaningful positive impact on

over a billion lives.

INTEGRATED REPORT & ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2019-20 | 113TH YEAR

12

13:

Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to write to you and present

the Integrated Report for FY 2019-20.

I hope this: letter finds you safe and in

good health.

For most of FY 2019-20, the global steel

industry faced a number of challenges due

to global demand and geopolitical tensions

which have affected the contours of the

business environment in which we operate.

Next came the onset of the COVID-19

pandemic in the final quarter of the year,

which ushered in a new reality for industries

across the world.

Global GDP growth eased to 2.9% in 2019,

against an initial growth projection of 3.5%.

In India, growth slowed to 4.2% in FY 2019-20

against an initial growth projection of 7.5%

in the beginning of the year. India was just

beginning to show signs of coming out of

a protracted slowdown that began in early

2018 when COVID-19 arrived.

The impact of the slowing economy was also

felt in the global steel sector. Global crude

steel production reached 1,870 MnT in 2019,

registering a more modest growth of 3.4%

in 2019 against 4.6% in 2018. The Indian steel

sector registered a stark easing of growth

to 1.8% in 2019 compared to 7.7% growth

in the previous year. Domestic steel prices

declined sharply in FY 2019-20 (-15% year-

on-year, on average) due to weak demand

from key industries including automobile,

construction, and consumer durables.

Overcapacity in China also played a role in

the softness in steel prices last year.

Despite the difficult environment, Tata Steel

Group recorded a production increase of 5%

in FY 2019-20. Tata Steel India was successful

in increasing deliveries, being profitable,

and launching new products. Tata Steel

India delivered an EBITDA margin of 21%,

outperforming the global steel industry.

In Europe, we maintained production levels

in FY 2019-20 in line with FY 2018-19.

In the past year, we implemented a number

of key strategic moves:

‐ We, through our subsidiary company,

acquired the steel business of Usha

Martin Limited.

‐ The integration of Tata Steel BSL Limited is

progressing well.

‐ We are well on course of reorganising

India subsidiaries into four segments:

Mining, Long Products, Downstream and

Infrastructure & Utilities.

‐ We made progress on the Tata Steel

Kalinganagar phase two expansion, with a

focus on the pellet plant and cold

rolling mill.

‐ We aggressively advanced our digital

transformation. Tata Steel Kalinganagar

became the only Indian manufacturing

facility to be designated as Industry

4.0 Lighthouse by the World Economic

Forum. We deployed 100+ data analytics

models across processes to drive insight-

based decision-making. Our connected

workforce programme leverages multiple

technologies and systems to pre-empt

unsafe incidents.

‐ We continued our focus and investments

in sustainable operations, improving

our measures on parameters such as

CO2 emission intensity, coke rate, energy

intensity, water consumption, among

others, in both our Jamshedpur and

Kalinganagar plants.

As we look ahead, it is important to gauge

COVID-19’s unprecedented impact on the

global economy. It is expected that global

growth will contract by over 3% in 2020, the

worst contraction since the 1930s. For the

first time since the Great Depression, both

advanced and developing economies are in

recession together. Tata Steel is confident

in its ability to navigate this period through

strong financial discipline, a reduction

in capital expenditure and cash flow

management.

The health and safety of its workforce has

always been paramount to Tata Steel. We

have been at the forefront of developing

industry-specific protocols that can be a

model—from testing parameters to contact

tracing, monitoring social distancing

norms, classifying employee risk levels, and

providing appropriate healthcare responses.

Within our communities, Tata Steel played a

key role in COVID-19 relief. Tata Main Hospital

(TMH) and Medica Hospitals at Kalinganagar,

Gopalpur and Joda have been designated as

hospitals for testing, treatment and isolation,

while TMH has been certified to carry out

RT-PCR tests for COVID-19. We ramped up

medical infrastructure in Jharkhand and

Odisha, adding over 1,200 isolation beds

and COVID-19 screening facilities. We have

provided support to nearly 1,00,000 migrant

workers, and are continuing to provide

sustenance to millions. In keeping with

the ethos of Tata Steel, there is still more

for us to do.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank

you for your continued trust, confidence,

and support.

Warm regards,

N. Chandrasekaran

of Credit lines for the Phase II expansion

of Kalinganagar.

We have judiciously availed Government

schemes and policies during the year

which led to lower tax charge and outgo

due to rationalisation of Corporate Income

tax rates from 30% to 22% and settlement

of 234 Central Excise and Service Tax

disputes under the tax amnesty scheme

known as Sabka Vishwas Legal Dispute

Resolution Scheme (SVLDRS).

** TSLP - Tata Steel Long Products Limited

FY 2019-20 Highlights

Impact on SDGs

To tide over the pandemic-induced

business disruptions in the domestic

market, sufficient short-term liquidity of

₹4,800 crore was arranged. Our innovative

financing strategy for coal procurement

helped us to deleverage by ₹360 crore.

In addition, we generate cost savings from

business process improvements (TQM

initiatives and Shikhar25).

MANAGING CAPITAL OUTCOMES

Our India operations were strengthened

by the acquisition of the steel business of

UML, by our subsidiary TSLP, increasing

and stabilising production at Tata Steel

BSL acquired in FY 2018-19. We continue

to utilise trade finance products to realise

funds from business cash flows in advance

to deleverage the balance sheet.

The credit rating agencies, Standard

& Poor’s (S&P) and Brickworks have

retained their existing credit rating on

the Company. However, based on the

prevailing situation, the outlook has been

revised to ‘Stable’.

STRATEGIC FOCUS

‐ Drive growth without increasing

leverage; enhance internal cash

generation through efficiency and

productivity

‐ Focus on divestments; build synergies

from acquisitions

‐ Allocate capital efficiently

adjustments that would result if Tata Steel Europe Limited were

unable to continue as a going concern.”
