Dear Shareholders,

Undoubtedly, this has been one of the

most challenging years in recent

times for the global economy and the

Indian economy. Even in these

challenging times, I am happy to

share that Welspun Corp grew from

strength to strength, with this year’s

performance breaking all our

previous records on production, sales

and proﬁtability. We have also

strengthened our balance sheet and

we have almost become debt-free, on

a net-debt basis. We have utilized our

cash ﬂows to pre-pay loans, buyback

shares and pay a substantial dividend

during the year.

We continue to maintain

our operational excellence

amidst challenges, by

strengthening our balance

sheet and almost

becoming debt-free, on a

net-debt basis. Utilizing

our cash ﬂows to pre-pay

loans, buyback shares and

paying a substantial

dividend during the year,

we have shown sustainable

performance.
