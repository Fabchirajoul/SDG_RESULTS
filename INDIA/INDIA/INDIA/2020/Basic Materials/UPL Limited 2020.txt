Dear Shareholders,

Before I share my thoughts about our performance for

the reporting year, let me take you through the journey

that has made us what we are today. It all started

in 1969 in a small town called Vapi, Gujarat in a very

modest way. Many of you may be aware, that we made

the first indigenous red phosphorus in India and were

awarded the President’s Gold Seal for this research

and development. In 1975, we ventured into the export

market; and over the decades, we have crafted an

exciting story of growth and evolution. In our story,

everyone wins. Today, it embraces the entire world and

over seven billion people, who need at least 21 billion

meals every day.

We have now prominent presence in global food

systems, which is both a challenge and an opportunity

for us. The challenge is to find sustainable answers

to feed the growing population of the world, with

scarcer resources. The opportunity is that we have the

experience, expertise, technology and empowered

global team to bring together all the different players in

the food system. We have access to 90% of the world’s

food basket and are focused on facilitating progress for

the entire agricultural value chain, including growers,

distributors, suppliers and innovation partners.

We are building a network that redefines the way a

whole industry thinks and works. Opening it all up,

to refreshing ideas, innovative ways and new answers.

Chairman’s Perspective

“

A CHERISHED MILESTONE

We celebrated our 50th anniversary in FY2020

and it is a rare occasion for all of us to introspect about

what we can achieve now and in the next half-a-century

and beyond. We have grown many-fold since inception

both organically and through acquisitions.

The year 1994 marked UPL’s first international acquisition.

Over the last 25 years, we have made over 40 acquisitions

and have been successful in accelerating growth in a

profitable and sustainable manner. The Arysta LifeScience

acquisition represented the largest of them in our

existence and possibly the most important.

Following the acquisition of Arysta LifeScience,

we became one of the top 5 agricultural solutions

companies worldwide. As a new company, we now

offer an integrated portfolio of both patented and

post-patent agricultural solutions for various arable

and specialty crops, including biological, crop

protection, seed treatment and post-harvest

solutions spanning the entire crop value chain.

PERFORMING AMID CHALLENGES

Frankly speaking, the global operating environment

for the entire stretch of FY2020 remained challenging

with sub-optimal growth rates, heightened trade

uncertainties, liquidity challenges followed by the

global pandemic, which is still adversely impacting

lives and livelihoods. At UPL, we have been able to sail

through the crisis and deliver on our commitments to

all stakeholders.

During the year, we also completed the successful

integration of Arysta LifeScience, the company we

acquired in February 2019, in a record time of just over

one year. We are now fully integrated, and recorded a

strong set of numbers in the first year itself. As always,

we have constantly challenged ourselves to deliver

more with less resources and set new benchmarks in

the process.

As a global manufacturer and distributor of critical

crop care solutions, we have been fortunate that

our products have been classified as an ‘essential

commodity’ to serve the world’s food chain during the

pandemic. All our factories around the world remained

in operation, following relevant geography-specific

safety guidelines. We also lived out our commitment of

being ‘Always Human’ through our global community

initiatives to help citizens fight the crisis and support

human lives.

Moving on to the Indian landscape, our teams and

facilities continued to operate during the year with

relevant safety guidelines issued by the government.

I must also mention in this context that we welcome

the government’s decision of allowing exports of

27 proposed products, which were earlier proposed to

be banned. We remain confident that the government

will take a pragmatic approach and permit the sale of

these products in the domestic markets too, as they

provide cost-effective solutions to farmers, thereby

ensuring stability of the food supply chain.

MORE SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTS

With our diversified manufacturing facilities,

empowered teams, expert partners, stronger innovation

bandwidth, end-to-end solutions in crop protection

and reach across global markets, we are committed to

creating a sustainable food supply chain for the world.

We have close to 3,000 patents and pending patents.

We believe that the intensity of our R&D will continue

and increase in future. Also, we believe that today with

the growth in resources that we have and the increased

budgets we have we can be more innovative; and we

can resource our processes much further than we could

before and drive bigger innovation. We are also open to

collaborate with different partners and stakeholders to

bring sunrise innovation to the market.

With one foot in emerging markets and another in

the developed world, we are now at the sweet spot

between scale and agility. Although these are tough

and uncertain times, with your encouragement and

support we are confident of our ability to deliver

industry-leading growth in the coming years.

Regards,

R.D. Shroff

Chairman and: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

ON INTEGRATION AND PERFORMANCE

FY2020 saw us complete the integration of Arysta

LifeScience into UPL ahead of plan and deliver on the

synergy targets. Worldwide, our teams have worked

relentlessly through the year to put together this

wonderful coming together of two companies.

The success of the transaction can be seen by

the performance of each region in our business.

We have optimised manufacturing footprint, increased

procurement efficiency, enhanced R&D bandwidth and

consolidated IT and support functions. We now have a

broader portfolio, enabling us to offer our customers

complete crop solutions and create better opportunities

for cross-selling. Our global team is rallied around

our strategic purpose; and overall, we reported cost

synergies worth ` 773 crore in FY2020.

The amazing thing about our performance is that,

in our integration year, we outperformed the industry.

I have the pleasure to report a strong financial and

operating performance for FY2020. During the year,

our revenue grew by 13% to ` 35,756 crore from

` 31,616 crore, our EBITDA surged by 18% to

` 7,452 crore from ` 6,312 crore in FY2019. Our EBITDA

margin stood at 21% in FY2020 (20% in FY2019). One key

target for the reporting year was to reduce our net debt

post acquisition; and our ` 4,400 crore debt reduction

is a testament of our strength. We are sharpening our

focus on cost rationalisation, optimal capital allocation

and a stronger liquidity buffer.

ON VALUE FOR ALL

We began our sustainability journey long back because

we believed it will create more value for the grower and

the world. Our focus is to bring sustainability to our

farmers in an effective manner, so that it reduces cost

and increases yields. We remain engaged with farmers

throughout the crop life cycle from pre-planting to

post-harvest. Our perspective is that farmers have a

variety of requirements than just controlling a pest or

a disease. They want to produce healthier yields with a

long-term focus, because they make a living out of it. We

are offering need-based solutions and technologies that

support farmers. We are committed to developing or

outsourcing whatever technology is required to provide

them the best-in-class portfolio and least exposure to

risk. Also, we believe that our platform will provide that

focus and align all stakeholders on our focus; and in the

meantime, we will enlarge our market share so that this

platform becomes more valuable.

ON BUILDING OUR BIOSOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO

Our biosolutions business is one of the fastest

growing segments and we are consistently investing

in it to enhance our capabilities. We are offering

ProNutiva®, an exclusive programme that integrates

natural BioSolutions (bioprotection, biostimulants and

bionutrition) with conventional crop protection products

to meet or exceed the real-world requirements of

today’s growers. This is a revolutionary programme to

offer farmers better yields for higher margins and to

meet food demands in a more sustainable manner.

ON COMBATING COVID-19

As the world faces the unprecedented threat of the

COVID-19 pandemic, UPL continues its operations with

its plants running to meet the challenges of providing

stable and reliable services to farmers around the world.

We recognise that our products are essential, and even

more in crucial times like these.

The crop protection business is an integral part of this

critical ecosystem, which we take seriously as both a

privilege and a responsibility. Providing stability to the

world’s food supply is our top priority, and we have

reason to believe that in the long run, our food supply

chain will come out even stronger than before.

As a part of our COVID-response initiative, we have

donated ~US$ 10 million and supplied ~US$ 3.3 million

worth of Private Protective Equipment (PPEs) to external

stakeholders. We have produced more than 6,000 litres

of sanitisers and disinfectant solutions for police and

hospitals. Also, we have provided spray equipment

to disinfect public areas, using 1.15 million litres of

sanitising solution.

ON AN INSPIRED GLOBAL WORKFORCE

We have created an inclusive work environment where

employees are encouraged to contribute their unique

talents, skills and distinct perspectives. We believe that

‘Purpose’ flourishes when we have a team with diverse

set of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives.

Our strategy is overarching

and is built around critical

global priorities. We are

helping create sustainable,

robust food systems that can

withstand not only climate

change, but also crises such as

the one we are living through

right now, helping over

500 million farmers protect

their crops.

“

win-win partnerships. We are a unique confluence of

global outreach with local insight. Our presence in our

major markets allows us to better understand specific

market trends and grower requirements, thus enhancing

our ability to develop tailored local products consisting

of one or more formulated, ready-to-use mixtures of

different active ingredients that solve the needs of

growers of a particular crop in a specific country.

08:

Dear Shareholders,

accordance with geography-specific local official

guidelines across all our facilities and offices.

Business continuity: We recognise that our products

are essential, even more so in unprecedented times

like these. Hence, all our manufacturing plants remain

operational with the critical inventory in place for key

raw materials. A Rapid Response Team was formed to

monitor the developments, to issue guidelines and to

solve problems. We also ensured fluid collaboration

with customers. We rolled out virtual product launches

and conducted virtual sales meetings.

Community outreach: We donated ~US$ 10 million

and supplied ~US$ 3.3 million worth of PPE to various

stakeholders. We produced 6,000+ litres of sanitisers

and disinfectant solution for police and hospitals.

Moreover, we provided spraying equipment to disinfect

public areas, using 1.15 million litres of sanitising

solution. I want to thank our teams for their relentless

engagement to go the extra mile and help communities

all around the world.

OUR OPERATIONS

Post our integration with Arysta LifeScience, we have

emerged stronger. Today, we enjoy a larger geographic

presence, offer total crop solutions and have a more

powerful innovation engine. You will be happy to know

that we have received very encouraging response from

customers after the integration of Arysta LifeScience.

It was really an enormous endeavour; so many moving

parts were managed meticulously that today we can

really say with satisfaction that a milestone has been

accomplished. It feels like we are working together for

years now and the teams have come together as one.

We’re better and we’re stronger together.

We reported an outstanding year at UPL. We achieved

this, despite erratic weather patterns, forex volatility

and COVID-19 headwinds, driven by the strength of our

business model and strategy execution.

Most importantly, we were able to grow market

share in many countries, especially in our herbicide

portfolio. Moreover, our portfolio of new innovations

and BioSolutions have gained popularity among

farmers globally.

In Latin America, we reported 24% increase in revenue

to ` 13,764 crore in FY2020 (` 11,074 crore in FY2019).

We were able to claim the number four market position

in Brazil and advanced to number one position in

Mexico and Colombia. We garnered higher customer

share of wallet after the integration. In North America,

despite floods impacting markets, we grew revenue by

13% to ` 5,635 crore in FY2020 (` 4,967 crore in FY2019)

owing to growth in major product lines.

In Europe, we reported 7% degrowth in revenue to

` 5,376 crore in FY2020 (` 5,752 crore in FY2019) as

the region was hit hard by a dry and hot season; and

also saw currency depreciation. Despite demand

weaknesses in herbicides due to the lack of moisture,

we were able to deliver stable growth in our solutions

portfolio. We continue to gain market share with

products like seed treatments and insecticides.

In India, we experienced a good rabi season and that

partially offset the difficult kharif season. The region

reported 11% increase in revenue to ` 3,828 crore

in FY2019 (` 3,454 crore in FY2019). We developed

new markets for our product and services, educated

farmers on the use of biostimulants and brought new

technologies to farmers to enhance farm productivity.

Finally, in the rest of the world, we saw strong growth

in Japan and the ASEAN countries such as Vietnam and

Indonesia. Our revenues from the region increased

12% to ` 7,153 crore in FY2020 (` 6,369 crore in FY2019).

Recently, we announced the acquisition of Laoting

Yoloo, China, adding a strong team, more than

150 products and a state-of-the-art plant. This will

strengthen our presence in China, one of the world’s

major crop protection chemical markets.

of changes in equity and consolidated statement of

In our opinion and to the best of our information and

according to the explanations given to us, and based on

the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate

financial statements of such subsidiaries, associates,

joint ventures as were audited by the other auditors,

the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the

information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”)

in the manner so required and give a true and fair view

in conformity with the accounting principles generally

accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the

Group, its associates and joint ventures as at March 31,

2020, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive

income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated

BASIS FOR OPINION

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards

on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the

Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further

described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit

of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our

that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial

statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by

the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and

the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled

our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with

these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence

obtained by us along with the consideration of audit

reports of the other auditors referred to in sub paragraph

and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the

consolidated financial statements.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS

49. IMPACT OF COVID-19

The Governments of various countries notified lockdown to contain the outbreak of COVID 19. Due to COVID-19

situation, there have been several restrictions imposed by the Governments across the globe on the travel, goods

movement and transportation considering public health and safety measures. The Group’s crop protection and seeds

businesses has been classified as an ‘essential commodity’, at par with medical equipment/ medicine, food chain, etc.

As of today, all production facilities in various parts of the globe remain in operation, following enhanced internal

safety guidelines. The Group follows a multi-sourcing strategy for active ingredients and raw materials allowing the

Group to hedge supply risks and ensure reliable supply. The Group also maintains strategic safety stocks to ensure

availability of raw materials and formulated products. During this period, the Group continued sales of their products

and does not expect any material adverse impact at this point of time. Considering the liquidity position as at

March 31, 2020 and expectation of cash generation from operations, the group believes that it has ability to service

debt and other financing arrangements during the current financial year.
