LETTER TO

SHAREHOLDERS

06 - 07:

Letter to Shareholders: Dear Shareholders,

It is my honour and privilege to inform you about the performance and achievements

of your Company during the FY 2019-20. The year was one of the most volatile in the

recent times. After the low market conditions which plagued the initial seven months

of the Financial Year, the demand and prices saw a spike in the months of November

to February. Though the performance was expected to further strengthen, as March

is historically the best month for steel industry, the onset of COVID-19 led to a slump

in the international as well as domestic market. The Company, however, continued

its pursuit of excellence and achieved notable improvements in various areas of

operations, marketing, etc. which is further detailed in this letter and the Annual

Report. As a result of these improvements coupled with the impact of valuation of

sub-grade fines at different mines, the Company ended the year once again in black.

COVID-19 is expected to be one of the major game changers in the times to come

having already severely impacted the World economy in an adverse manner. It has

ushered in an era where business dynamics are continuously undergoing changes to

adapt to the rapidly changing business environment and economic scenario. Steel

Industry has already felt a major shock due to this development during the last couple

of months of 2019-20 as well as the first quarter (i.e. April-June ’20) of the FY 2020-

21. In the light of COVID-19 Pandemic, the projections for global economy and global

steel industry are coming out negative for the immediate succeeding years.

In order to counter the impact of COVID-19, your Company started its action

proactively as early as in the month of February ’20 itself by holding discussions and

planning counter measures for the same. SAIL activated a scaled response towards

management of COVID-19 at its Plants, Units, Mines and Townships. SAIL Hospitals

at five Integrated Steel Plant locations have earmarked 10% of the beds (330 beds)

of the total beds (3300 Beds) as isolation wards and set up a testing centre at IGI,

Rourkela for COVID-19 patients. Quarantine facilities at guest houses/hostels in the

townships and at Mines hospitals have also been created for over 600 persons.

SAIL Plants and Units are installing full-body automatic sanitizers, touch-free hand-

sanitizers, water dispensers, spraying disinfectants, using digital thermal recorders

at prominent locations.

In its fight to defeat COVID-19, SAIL stepped forward and contributed `30 crore to

the PM CARES Fund. Apart from this, Rupees one crore each has been contributed to

the CM Relief Fund of the four states where our integrated steel plants are operating.

Our employees also contributed their one day’s salary amounting to around `9 crore

to this Fund. With the help of district authorities, civil society organizations, self-help

groups (SHGs) and its employees, SAIL actively implemented the desired lockdown

rules, social distancing norms and effective use of Aarogya Setu App for breaking

the chain of transmission of COVID-19 virus in the peripheral areas of Steel Plants

and Units.

In order to support the vulnerable sections of society, daily-wage earners/ labourers,

poor peasants and their families, who are left with dwindled resources during

lockdown, our Plants and Units, through district authorities, are distributing dry

ration packets (comprising of rice, dal, salt, condiments, wheat atta, soap, etc.).

More than 6000 dry ration kits have been distributed across Plants of SAIL and the

activity is continuing. Daily cooked meals to patients and healthcare workers are

also being served. CSR departments of Plants are also facilitating stitching of Face

Masks, Gamachhas, Aprons, Gloves, etc., and their distribution in and around the

Steel Plants through SHGs.

Coming to the performance during FY 2019-20, your Company achieved sales

turnover of `61,025 crore during the FY 2019-20, which fell short of the previous

year performance by 8% despite a higher sales volume. The major reason for the

same was lower Net Sales Realisation (NSR) for 5 Integrated Steel Plants (ISPs)

which saw a reduction of 12% over previous year. EBITDA or the Gross Margin

at `11,199 crore saw an improvement of 9% over previous year (`10,283 crore)

based on the persistent approach to improve operational efficiency which saw

improvement in TE Parameters like BF Productivity, Specific Energy Consumption,

etc. and helped by factors like decrease in input prices like imported coking coal,

salary & wages, royalty rate of iron ore and positive impact of rail price settlement

for FY 2015-16 to 2018-19. However, burdened with higher capital related charges

which included depreciation and interest and a hefty impact on valuation of stock of

different inventories due to fall in prices on account of COVID-19, the Profit Before

Tax (PBT) slid down to `3,171 crore, a decline of 5% over previous year (`.3,338

crore). The Profit after Tax at `2,022 crore also saw a reduction of 7% over previous

year (`2,179 crore).

On the production front, FY 2019-20 saw the Company reclaiming its position as the

top crude steel producing company (16.155 MT) in the Country. The performance

was laced with a number of records including highest ever crude steel through

concast route (14.6 MT), best ever saleable steel production (15.47 MT). Despite

operating lower number of furnaces, Company produced Hot Metal (17.438 MT) at

similar level as the previous year achieving best ever BF Productivity. One of the

most important products in the basket of SAIL viz., Rails (for supplies to Indian

Railways) crossed the 1 million tonne mark and saw its highest ever production

(12.85 lakh tonnes) during the Financial Year 2019-20, a substantial growth of 30%

over previous year (9.85 MT). Production from new Universal Rail Mill (URM) at

5.38 lakh tonne showcased a growth of 46% over previous year (3.69 lakh tonne).

The despatch of Long Rails stood at 6.33 lakh tonnes, growth of 43% over previous

year (4.41 lakh tonnes). The proportion of long rails in the overall despatches also

improved to 52% from 48% in the previous year.

As the Modernisation & Expansion Plan drew to its completion, your Company

has put balance/remaining facilities to ensure timely ramp up. In this connection,

at Bhilai Steel Plant, hot trial of Argon Rinsing Station-3 and Ladle Furnace-3 of

Steel Refining Unit (SRU) at Steel Melting Shop-III was successfully completed in

May’19 and Aug’19 respectively. Further, hot trial of Converter-3 was also completed

in Feb’20. Apart from the MEP, the major projects under AMR saw the lighting up of

the Re-heating Furnace#1 (RHF#1) of New Hot Strip Mill on 25th January, 2019 with

Hot trials of New Hot Strip Mill starting on 29th January, 2020 at Rourkela Steel Plant.

At Bokaro Steel Plant, under Modernization of SMS-I, 1st heat was taken from the

BOF Converter on 22nd May, 2019 and the Converter is in regular operation. Under

“Up-gradation of Stoves of Blast Furnace#1”, heating of all the three Stoves started

during July’19 and completed in August’19. The stoves were put into operation with

blowing-in of Blast Furnace#1 on 8th January, 2020.

A large number of new initiatives were undertaken across all the Plants for process

improvements, with special emphasis on productivity & quality improvement,

product development & commercialization, energy conservation and automation.

The continuous activities in respect of product development have led to development

of 17 new Steel Products during FY 2019-20. Some of these products have been

developed from the newly commissioned production facilities viz., Cold Rolling Mill-

III at Bokaro Steel Plant, New Plate Mill at Rourkela Steel Plant, Medium Structural

Mill at Durgapur Steel Plant and Wire Rod Mill, Bar Mill & Universal Section Mill at

IISCO Steel Plant.

At Bhilai Steel Plant, trial rolling of new profiles of TMT bars (12, 16, 25, 32 mm)

was successfully carried out in the FY 2019-20 at the Bar and Rod Mill. The Mill has

produced 1.83 lakh tonne of finished products during 2019-20, with hot trials of

“SAIL SeQR” grade steel being also carried out successfully. Durgapur Steel Plant

(DSP) supplied 449 nos. of LHB(Linke Hofmann Busch) wheels to Indian Railways

during 2019-20. LHB wheels, an import substitution product, are safer, light weight

and enable high speed movement on broad gauge. At Rourkela Steel Plant(RSP),

the state-of-the-art New Plate Mill achieved the highest ever annual production of

8.7 lakh tonne. The API 5LX70 Grade steel was successfully produced and rolled for

pipeline transportation system. In addition to this, first lot of maraging steel plates

rolled in Plate Mill was dispatched to MIDHANI, Hyderabad for “GAGANYAN” (Human

letter dated 12th March, 2018 to Ministry of Coal(MoC)

regarding returning of Sitanala Coal Block, MoC, vide: letter dated 4th October, 2018

issued a Termination Notice against Allotment Agreement and Allotment Order, in

respect of Sitanala Coal Block and on 25th October, 2018 advised the bank to invoke

the Bank Guarantee(BG) of `10.43 crore. SAIL had preferred Writ Petitions before

the Delhi High Court to challenge the Order dated 4th October, 2018. Though, Hon’ble

Delhi High Court declined to pass any interim order, but clarified that if the petitioner

prevails in this petition, the consequential direction for refund of the amount collected

by invoking the BG will be passed. The matter is sub-judice.

Parbatpur Coal Block

Consequent to the SAIL’s letter dated 8th March, 2018 to Ministry of Coal (MoC) about

returning of Parbatpur Coal Block, MoC, vide letter dated 5th December, 2019 issued

a Termination Notice against Allotment Agreement and Allotment Order in respect of

Parbatpur Coal Block and advised the bank to invoke the BG of `62.57 crore.

SAIL has preferred Writ Petitions before the Delhi High Court challenging the Order

dated 5th December, 2019. In response, vide Order dated 19th December, 2019, the

Hon’ble Delhi Court directed for maintaining status quo in respect of the BG, till the

next date of hearing.

In view of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and consequential lockdown, the

matter on both the above mentioned cases could not be placed on scheduled dates

and the next date of hearing is yet to be informed.

In the meanwhile, on the request of SAIL, MoC, vide Gazette Notification dated 13th

February, 2020, has appointed

letter dated 30th November, 2019 by BSP,

Director, MoEFCC (NCM) vide: letter dated 11th May, 2020 suggested to seek

forest clearance for balance un-diverted forest land under the lease before

processing of EC proposals for the entire area of lease by MoEFCC.The matter

was examined and it was found that

letter No.- 11-599/ 2014-FC dated 1st April 2015 issued revised Guidelines for diversion

of Forest Land for non-forest purpose under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 (FC Act). These revised Guidelines stipulated that in case of existing mining leases having

Forest Land (partially or fully), where approval for only a part of forest land has been obtained under the FC Act, the Central Government accorded general approval under

Section-2(iii) of the FC Act for the remaining area also to be Forest Land, subject to certain conditions, which includes realising Net Present Value (NPV) for the entire forest

land falling in the mining lease, in case NPV of such forest land has not already been realised.

In this matter, as per legal opinion obtained by the Company, Section 2 (iii) of FC Act, 1980 will not apply to Government Corporation and NPV is required to be paid

only for that limited area, which has been approved by MoEF& CC and in which mining activities are proposed to be done and not for the entire forest area. The matter of

applicability of NPV for total forest land has been challenged by the Company in Hon’ble High Court of Jharkhand. The Hon’ble Court, in its order, has directed to place the

matter before Division Bench of this Court.

A writ petition has also been filed in the Hon’ble high Court of Chhattisgarh against the demand of `96.28 crore received during 2017-18 from the Office of Principal Chief

Conservator of Forest, Chhattisgarh.

The Company has deposited `96.28 crore with Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Chhattisgarh and a Special Leave Petition has been filed in Hon’ble Supreme Court

of India against the order of Hon’ble High Court of Chhattisgarh.

47.7 Pursuant to the Hon’ble Supreme Court Judgment dated 2nd August, 2017 in the Common Cause matter regarding illegal mining, demand/Show cause notices have

been issued for recovery of the price of minerals produced without and beyond the environmental clearances under Section 21(5) of Mines and Mineral Development

Regulation Act, 1957, forest clearance under the Forest Conservation Act 1980, and towards excess production beyond consent to operate. The Company has challenged

letter No.- 11-599/ 2014-FC dated 1st April 2015 issued revised Guidelines for diversion

of Forest Land for non-forest purpose under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 (FC Act). These revised Guidelines stipulated that in case of existing mining leases having

Forest Land (partially or fully), where approval for only a part of forest land has been obtained under the FC Act, the Central Government accorded general approval under

Section-2(iii) of the FC Act for the remaining area also to be Forest Land, subject to certain conditions, which includes realising Net Present Value (NPV) for the entire forest

land falling in the mining lease, in case NPV of such forest land has not already been realised.

In this matter, as per legal opinion obtained by SAIL, Section 2 (iii) of FC Act, 1980 will not apply to Government Corporation and NPV is required to be paid only for that

limited area, which has been approved by MoEF& CC and in which mining activities are proposed to be done and not for the entire forest area. The matter of applicability of

NPV for total forest land has been challenged by SAIL in Hon’ble High Court of Jharkhand. The Hon’ble Court, in its order, has directed to place the matter before Division

Bench of this Court.

A writ petition has also been filed in the Hon’ble high Court of Chhattisgarh against the demand of `96.28 crore received during 2017-18 from the Office of Principal Chief

Conservator of Forest, Chhattisgarh.

India against the order of Hon’ble High Court of Chhattisgarh.

47.7 Pursuant to the Hon’ble Supreme Court Judgment dated 2nd August, 2017 in the Common Cause matter regarding illegal mining, demand/Show cause notices have been

issued for recovery of the price of minerals produced without and beyond the environmental clearances under Section 21(5) of Mines and Mineral Development Regulation

Act, 1957, forest clearance under the Forest Conservation Act 1980, and towards excess production beyond consent to operate. SAIL has challenged the purported demand

before the High Court of Jharkhand and Odisha and obtained stay on demand.

crore during the year) on estimated basis. Balance amount of `1973.33 crore (including interest) has been treated as contingent liability in Note No. 47.1(i)(h)

above.

(ii) In respect of Limestone, by the Government of Jharkhand amounting to `29.47 crore (including interest) (`24.88 crore as on 31st March 2019). Based on

Reconciliations are carried out on on-going basis. Provisions, wherever considered necessary, have been made. However, Management does not expect to have any

material financial impact of such pending confirmations/reconciliations.

48.4 SAIL has a stock of 42.98 million tonnes (estimated in previous year at 41.52 million tonnes) of sub grade iron ore fines at its various mines. The low Iron content of these

Fines made them unsuitable for consumption in the Steel Plants of SAIL. Moreover, the Government of India, vide notification dated 19th September, 2012 prevented all

captive miners (including SAIL) from selling these sub-grade fines in the market. Since these materials could neither be consumed nor sold, they had no economic value,

and therefore, no costs were assigned to these sub-grade fines till 2018-19 and considered as Inventory with NIL value.

In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 20A of the MMDR Act, 1957, the Ministry of Mines, Government of India, vide its order no. F.No.16/30/2019-M.VI dated

16th September, 2019 directed the concerned State Governments to allow the sale of sub-grade minerals lying at the captive mines of SAIL, subject to ascertainment by

the State Governments in consultation with the Indian Bureau of Mines, of the usability of such fines in the steel plant. Subsequently, by a clarification dated 4th January,

2020, Ministry of Mines has removed the condition of certification of usability.

On a clarification sought by SAIL on the powers of the State Government in this matter, the Additional Solicitor General of India vide opinion dated 19th May, 2020, has

opined that the above notification has been issued u/s 20A (2)(v) of the MMDR Act. The matter is under the Union List of Schedule VII of the Constitution and the power to

issue directives vests entirely with the Central Government. It was specifically mentioned in the opinion that the State Governments have no power to deny SAIL the right

to sell the fines.

Further, the Expert Advisory Committee (EAC) of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), on a query made by the Company has opined vide their communication

dated 6th June, 2020 that the accumulated sub-grade fines should be regarded as immaterial by-product and valued as inventory at Net Realizable Value as per Ind AS 2

(Inventories). Also, the increase in the carrying amount of such inventories due to the notification of the Central Government permitting sale should be recognized in the

Statement of Profit and Loss as change in accounting estimates in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 8 (Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates

and Errors).

SAIL took steps for quantitative verification of SGFs at each of the mines and carried out qualitative analysis (including gradation) for Fe content during the last quarter of

current Financial Year.:
