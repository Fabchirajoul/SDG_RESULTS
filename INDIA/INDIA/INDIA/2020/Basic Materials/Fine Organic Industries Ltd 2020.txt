Dear Shareholders,

I am delighted to share with you the events and

developments of our Company during FY 2019-20.

We continued performing well in most of our sectors

during the year. However, the last few days of March

2020, we witnessed one of the severest health crisis

in recent times – Coronavirus (COVID-19). It has not

just thrown challenges at us but also changed a lot

of dynamics at the global level and opening up new

possibilities. The world is exploring manufacturing

alternatives and India is well-placed to harness the

opportunity coming its way.

Chairman’s

Message

We believe our focus

on product innovation

through continuous

development has

been critical to our

versatile presence

across several

applications.
