Forward-Looking Statements

In this Annual Report, we have disclosed forward-looking information to enable investors to comprehend our prospects and take informed investment

decisions. This report and other statements, written and oral, that we periodically make are forward-looking statements that set out anticipated performance/

results based on the management’s plan and assumptions. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as ‘anticipate’,

‘estimate’, ‘expects’, ‘projects’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’ and words of similar substance in connection with any discussion of future performance. We

cannot guarantee that these forward-looking statements will be realised, although we believe we have been prudent in assumptions. The achievement of

results is subject to risks, uncertainties and realisation of assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialise or should underlying

assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Readers should bear this in mind.

letter

of commitment titled “My Definite Chief Aim” on

14th February, 1979 and decided to take the

plunge and start up in June 1980. The men – U.

Shekhar, Geera Ramakrishnan, Shashi Shanbhag,

CR Ramakrishna and Sudhir Patil were highly qualified

individuals who could have excelled in any company;

but as they say, “Entrepreneurs are people who are

willing to work 80 hours a week to avoid working 40

hours a week.” These budding entrepreneurs dreamt

big and just wanted to do that.

Back then, there were no venture capitalists,

PE funds or HNI backers. Bootstrapping was

the only option. All of them came from humble

non-business backgrounds and while there was

slight resistance and hesitation on part of their

families initially, eventually it was their backing,

support and sacrifice that ensured these budding

entrepreneurs take the leap. Thus, on 22nd June,

1980, the journey began at Tarapur with the idea

to manufacture a basket of ingredients used in the

production of shampoos and toothpastes.
