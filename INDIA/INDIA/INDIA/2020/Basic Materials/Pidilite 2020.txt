1 Corporate information

Pidilite Industries Limited, together with its subsidiaries are pioneers in consumer and industrial speciality

chemicals in India. The equity shares of the Company are listed on BSE Ltd (BSE) and national Stock Exchange

of India Ltd (nSE).

The address of its registered office is Regent Chambers, 7th Floor, Jamnalal Bajaj Marg, 208, nariman Point,

Mumbai 400 021. The address of principal place of business is Ramkrishna Mandir Road, Off Mathuradas Vasanji

Road, Andheri (E), Mumbai 400 059.

2 Significant Accounting Policies

2.1

Basis of accounting and preparation of financial statements

The standalone financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the Indian

Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) read

with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the

following items –

a. Certain Financial Assets/ Liabilities (including derivative instruments) – at Fair value

b. Employee Stock Options - at Fair value

The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (InR) and all values are rounded to the nearest

crores, except otherwise indicated.

2.2

Business Combination

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred

in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-

date fair values of the assets transferred by the Company, liabilities incurred by the Company to the

former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Company in exchange of control of

acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

When the consideration transferred by the Company in a business combination includes assets or

liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is

measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as a part of the consideration transferred

in a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as

measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding changes against

goodwill or capital reserve, as the case maybe. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that

arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed

one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition

date. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is subsequently (after the

measurement period) remeasured at subsequent reporting dates with the corresponding gain or loss

being recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.

In case of business combinations involving entities under common control, the above policy does

not apply. Business combinations involving entities under common control are accounted for using

the pooling of interests method. The net assets of the transferor entity or business are accounted

at their carrying amounts on the date of the acquisition subject to necessary adjustments required

to harmonise accounting policies. Retained earnings appearing in the financial statements of the

transferor is aggregated with the corresponding balance appearing in the financial statements of the

transferee. Identity of the reserves appearing in the financial statements of the transferor is preserved

and appears in the financial statements of the transferee in the same form. Any excess or shortfall of the

consideration paid over the share capital of transferor entity or business is recognised as capital reserve

under equity.

2.3

Goodwill

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over the net of

acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill arising

on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business

less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-generating

units (or groups of cash-generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the

combination. A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment

annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable

amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first

to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the

unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each assets in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill

is recognised directly in Statement of Profit and Loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not

reversed in subsequent periods.
