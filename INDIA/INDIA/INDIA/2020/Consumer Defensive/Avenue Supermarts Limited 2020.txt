Notice of the

Annual General Meeting:

Message from the Chairman: Message from the

Dear Shareholders,

I was not supposed to write this year, considering nothing

much would change. Then COVID-19 happened and it was

extremely necessary to tell all of you how we are dealing with the

pandemic. Hence the unusual nature of this: letter is that most

of it is about what has happened after the end of financial year

2019-20. We had a good year on most financial metrics and we

opened the highest number of stores in a fiscal year. Yet it seems

like a faint far away event in comparison to the pandemic, its

progress and impact on our lives.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has affected us all and has

completely changed our way of life. Amidst the tumult of this

unprecedented period, our priority has been to safeguard

the health and well-being of our employees, customers and

communities at large, while continuing our business operations

with responsibility and care. Our hearts go out to all those

affected by COVID-19. At the same time, we are extremely

grateful to all healthcare officials and local authorities. Their

unwavering help and support, despite personal risk, are an

inspiration to us all.

The countrywide lockdown began towards the latter half of

March 2020 and continued through the end of May 2020. During

this period, more than half of our stores remained closed for

operations due to regulatory instructions, and stores that were

open, operated for restricted hours. Customer footfalls were

significantly lower and as per directives of the authorities, we

had to stop the sale of all non-essential products (Apparel and

General Merchandise). Staff attendance was significantly below

par in the first 3-4 weeks and our new store construction was

abruptly halted for nearly 3 months. We also faced issues in our

supply chain due to severe transport restrictions during the first

3-4 weeks. We were gradually able to open most of our stores

from mid-June onwards. We also commenced the sale of non-

essentials in most stores. In general, local enforcements have

been more severe than official notifications published from time

to time throughout this pandemic period. Opening up of stores

continues to be very inconsistent even now. There are abrupt,

sudden and short notice lockdowns across cities. Some for

seven days, some for five days and some for the weekends.

Workplace changes

We anticipated a lot of issues based on what we saw across

the world as the pandemic lagged in its progress in India. Basis

this early learning, we quickly adopted newer work practices

from mid-March at our Head Office, Regional Offices, Stores,

Message from the Managing

Managing Director & CEO

Our ability to pay our

vendors and employees

on time, as before, and

serve our customers

their essential needs like

before, brings extreme

satisfaction to every

DMartian.:

letter, I would like

to say to all our DMartians, “What

an amazing team you are and I am

personally grateful to each one of you.

Along with the doctors, health workers

and emergency service personnel, you

stand TALL, right next to them”.

The passage of time has made us more

confident in dealing with the pandemic.

The unwavering courage of our

employees, the trust of our customers and

your support should help us get through

this crisis.
