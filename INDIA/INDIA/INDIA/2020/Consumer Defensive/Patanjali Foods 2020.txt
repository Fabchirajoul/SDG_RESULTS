Dear Shareholders,

Pranam.

We are glad to present our

Annual Report for Financial

Year 2019-20 after takeover of

management in December 2019.

Message to

Shareholders

The year has been challenging given the

slowdown in World Economy, coupled

with the impact of the Coronavirus

(COVID-19) outbreak, affecting several

economies

with

COVID-19-induced

lockdowns. During the outbreak of

coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic,

despite various constraints, most of the

manufacturing units of your Company

were in production to manufacture

essential commodities like edible oils

and soya food products in line with the

guidelines from the Central and State

Governments.

Your

Company

has

adopted various measures like social

distancing and precautionary hygiene

practices for the safety of people

employed in manufacturing facilities and

on-ground operations.

MOVING TOWARDS “ATMA NIRBHARTA”

We are one of the largest manufacturers

and marketers of a healthy range of

Consumer Products viz. edible oils,

vanaspati, bakery fat and soya foods. In

addition, we are one of the largest palm

plantation companies in India.

Against an estimated consumption of 23

million tonnes of Edible Oils per year,

India’s domestic production stands at

merely 8 million tonnes. The demand-

supply gap of 15 million tonnes is

imported from Malaysia, Indonesia and

other countries. India being an agrarian

economy, with hard-working farmers

desperately need profitable crops, yet

so much money is spent on importing

edible oil and enriching farmers in

MANAGING DIRECTOR: Dear Shareholders,

FMCG is the fourth largest Sector in

the Indian economy, covering food &

beverages; healthcare and household &

personal care, of which food & beverages

accounts for 19-20% of total FMCG

Sector. The Sector is expected to grow

by 5-6% in next 1-2 years. The growth

in urban segment has been comparatively

better than rural segment which is

largely driven by growing awareness,

easier access, brand consciousness and

changing lifestyles.

Your Company being one of the largest

manufacturers of a healthy range of

Consumer Products is well placed in

the FMCG Sector by offering branded

consumer

products

which

include

Edible Oils, Soya Foods, Vanaspati,

Bakery Fat, Atta, Honey amongst

others. Your Company produces value

added products from downstream and

upstream businesses with significant

presence in the export market as well.

Your Company has an integrated value

chain in Palm and Soya segments having

a seamless business model. We are one

of the largest Oil Palm companies in

India, which is amongst the most

profitable crops. Our management has

taken ambitious target to fast track area

expansion in Oil Palm over next 5 years

towards reducing India’s dependence on

edible oil imports.

The new management has initiated

several measures to stabilise the business

operations by putting in place internal

control mechanism; risk management

measures;

building

organisational

structure;

enhancing

corporate

governance;

which

strengthened

integrity, transparency and enhancing

good and accountable governance.

Your Company has achieved a total

income of ` 13,175.37 Crores the

financial year 2019-20 as compared to

12,829.26 Crores during the previous

financial year. Profit before tax (excluding

exceptional items) were ` 210.38 Crores

during 2019-20 as compared to ` 76.72

Crores registering a significant growth of

over 174%.

The growth opportunity in our core

categories

remains

strong.

Your

Company continues to benefit from large

brand portfolio that spread across the

mass, popular and premium segments.

Your Company is well placed to lead

growth trend with a strong portfolio

of brands including Mahakosh, Sunrich

and Ruchi Gold in the popular business.

Further, on the back of continuing

premiumisation

with

Nutrela,

the

Company has introduced new products

under Nutrela brand such as Nutrela

Honey, Nutrela High Protein Atta, to

name a few. In this league, the launch

of ‘Nutrela Gold’, premium edible

oil by your Company, is also gaining

widespread consumer acceptance. Your

Company is also keen to expand in other

areas of food segment either through

self-production enhancement or by way

of organic/inorganic growth to widen

the consumer offering and leverage our

expanding distribution reach across the

Country. It will solidify Ruchi Soya’s

position amongst the top FMCG players

in India.

As large consumer of energy, we are also

committed towards clean energy and are

actively and profitably engaged in the

wind power generation at 11 locations

in India with an annual capacity of

85.3 Megawatts. We are also exploring

deployment of solar power at our plant

locations in various parts of India to

reduce dependence on expensive fossil

fuel generated power.

I would like to extend my gratitude to our

management, our staff, our customers,

business associates and our stakeholders

for their ongoing trust and support.

We believe that our value creation

approach enable us to optimise value

for our shareholders and have a long-

term positive impact on all stakeholders

connected to our each business.
