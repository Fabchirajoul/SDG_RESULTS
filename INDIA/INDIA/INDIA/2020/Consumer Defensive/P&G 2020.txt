Dear Shareholders,

C. R. Dua

Chairman

It gives me great pleasure to share with

you the performance of your Company

for the Financial Year 2019-20. This fiscal

witnessed unprecedented disruption to the

business and numerous challenges due to

the COVID-19 pandemic. Your Company

navigated these tough times with agility

to deliver a resilient performance for the

Financial Year. While uncertainties and

challenges remain in the near-term, we will continue to focus on our strategy to drive

superiority and improve productivity to drive balanced growth, while prioritizing

the health and safety of our people.

Your Company has built citizenship into its way of doing business and is committed

to be a force for good and a force for growth. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,

we stepped up and launched ‘P&G Suraksha India’ to serve our communities by

partnering with government and relief organizations through in-kind, product and

critical supplies donations. We also leveraged the voice of our brands on social media

to create awareness about preventive measures to combat the spread of COVID-19.

In addition, your Company continued its focus on educating the underprivileged

children in India through the ‘P&G Shiksha’ program. Through this, CSR program

the P&G group in India has supported 2300 schools that will impact the lives of 20

lakh children. P&G Shiksha’s efforts are focused in three main areas – improving

educational infrastructure, empowering marginalized girls through education and

improving learning outcomes. We also provided health & hygiene kits to those

affected by disaster. Last year, P&G distributed nearly over 1 lakh sanitary pads to

women and girls impacted by cyclone Amphan and supported more than 2,500

families affected by floods in Maharashtra with health and hygiene kits.

Lastly, I would also like to express my gratitude to all our consumers, customers,

employees, business partners and YOU, our valued Shareholders for your support

during this unprecedented year. We are keenly focused on creating value for

our stakeholders. We will continue to innovate and provide superior products to

consumers and sustainably grow the business.

Pay Competitively

Set target compensation opportunities to

be competitive with other multinational

corporations of similar size, value, and

complexity.

3.

Focus on Long-Term Success

Include equity as a cornerstone of our

executive pay programs and by using a

combination of short-term and long-term

incentives to ensure a strong connection

between Company performance and actual

compensation realized.
