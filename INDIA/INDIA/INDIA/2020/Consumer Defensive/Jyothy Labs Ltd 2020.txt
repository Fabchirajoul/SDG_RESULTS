Message from the Chairman Emeritus

12: Message from the

Message from the Chairman Emeritus: Dear Shareholders,

All of you are aware, me and all the Board members had

thoroughly assessed the capability of Ms. M R Jyothy,

my daughter, to lead the organisation JLL towards

faster growth for the future. She, who was heading

the marketing department as Chief Marketing Officer

for more than one and a half decade, is appointed as

Managing Director of your Company effective from

April 1, 2020.

Shri R Lakshminarayanan, who has immense insights in

the FMCG sector is being chosen as the

Message from the Chairman: Dear Shareholders,

I consider it a rare privilege to have been nominated as

the first non-executive

Managing Director

Jyothy Labs has never been merely a company that

manufactures products and markets them to target

groups. It is a company dedicated to improving lives

in many small ways that add up to make a significant

difference to the consumers’ day, to raise their confidence

level, to free up their time, to let them sleep in peace.

Through our marketing initiatives, we clearly put forth

these value propositions to the consumers. Our research

and development (R&D) wing is engaged in the kind of

innovation that actually fulfils unmet and unarticulated

needs of the common man and woman. We keep our ear

to the ground always to understand what these needs are.

We stand now at a point when we have earned the

trust of consumers and other stakeholders through the

integrity of our promise, the quality of our products, and

the insightful differentiation that delivers 100% value in

every pack. Our aim is to retain the trust and transform

our strategy for the future.

THE YEAR IN RETROSPECT

2019-20 proved to be challenging, especially in the

second half because of an overall slowdown in the

economy, weak rural growth and the COVID-19 pandemic

that severely affected trade and commerce everywhere,

India being no exception. The external environment did

impact our growth, but we drew upon our advantages

and maintained our market shares across all our brands.

Our revenues (based on consolidated financial) for the year

declined by 5.6% to ` 1,711 Crore. Gross Margin improved

to 47.4% from 46.5%. Operating EBITDA stood at 14.7%

(` 251.1 Crore) as compared to 15.5% (` 281.1 Crore) in

the previous year. Profit After Tax stood at ` 162.6 Crore as

compared to ` 197.6 Crore in the previous year. The decline

is largely attributable to loss of sales in the month of March

2020 on account of sudden lockdown due to COVID-19.

EMbEDDING INFOTECH

Our information technology transformation began a year

ago and bore fruit in the year under review. Each of the

sales representative now has a digital application on their

mobile phones which enables them to capture data in real

time and process sales order more efficiently.

These tools help us to assess the time spent on the field,

identify the products moving the fastest, and look into

related matters. Analysing data like this can lead to a

significant increase in sales volumes and helps to grow our

presence in different zones, since sales heads have a better

overview of all that is happening. We are looking at more

ways to use emerging technology, especially at the plant

level. Technology is being embedded in each and every

function to create one uninterrupted network

of information.

Our aim is to retain the trust

and transform our strategy

for the future.

14 | Annual Report 2019-20

Jyothy Labs Limited:

Managing Director

Q. What is the most significant thing to have

happened at Jyothy Labs this year?

A. This year, we have moved towards a transition,

as Jyothy Labs is ready for the next generation of

leadership. The average age of the new leadership

team is just over 37 years; it is a young, dynamic

team. The succession comes with fresh thinking which

is reminiscent of our beginning from the grassroots in

1983 with strong focus on innovation and delivering

differentiated products.

Having firmly established ourselves as a leading

market player in the household products space in

India, we are looking to align ourselves with the

transformations happening in the FMCG industry,

especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. We have

ramped up focus on essential and hygiene products to

service the rising demand for safety. These products

already constitute for a large pie of our overall

portfolio and we have further augmented it with

launch of Margo Handwash and Margo Sanitizer.

These new products are already seeing increased

traction in the market. Also, understanding that a

large share of Indian demographics is middle-class

and below with lower affordability, we have ramped

up manufacturing and distribution of small unit packs.

This will enable them to meet the need of the hour –

safety, health and hygiene.

We tied-up with alternate distribution channels as

lockdown necessitated consumers to have doorstep

delivery of products for safety purpose. We believe

this forced change will soon become a normal due to

convenience and comfort factors. We are also seeing

greater benefit of digital technologies which facilitates

direct orders from retailers, thus ensuring the dual

objective of safety and speed.

We are confident that these initiatives will help us

retain our market share as well as get the most out of

the mega opportunities expected to come.

Q. At this point, what is the biggest strength for the

Company?

A. What has powered us for many years is our culture

and value system. During these years, we have gained

a tremendous amount of on-ground knowledge

- of how our consumers live, their needs and how

to connect with them. It keeps us a step ahead in

understanding their latent needs and addressing that

with a right product.

The original wisdom with which the Company began

is now supplemented by technology at every level:

staff, distributor, retail, digital marketing. We have SAP,

Information Technology tools and data analytics to cover

the whole spectrum of Jyothy Labs’ operations. Our data,

past or present, can be utilised in a more meaningful way

through data analytics and take us into the future.

Q. How challenging has this year been for Jyothy Labs?

A. The year gone by has not been experienced in a long

time. It has been challenging because of macro-

economic factors, low consumption and financial sector

crises and then, in the last quarter of the financial year,

because of the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent

lockdown. Almost every sector is passing through

unprecedented challenges and has been negatively

affected, which has never been the case. Besides, it

happened at a time when demand of our personal care and

household insecticide products peak, thus impacting sales.

Q. What should any resilient company do in this

situation?

A. In a challenging period, companies must learn, carry out

effective cost-cutting, look for efficiencies, productivity

and push everyone a little more. The need of the hour is

to take prudent measures.

Q. How do you read consumer spending patterns in

difficult times vis-à-vis an FMCG company like

Jyothy Labs?

A. The consumers will always buy as per their wants,

needs and means. Usually they spend in two areas:

Ullas Kamath talks of the inherent

strengths of Jyothy Labs and how it is

geared for the future.

once transferred to the said Demat account of the

IEPF Authority can be claimed only after following

due procedure prescribed under the said IEPF Rules.

Therefore, members are requested to claim their

unpaid dividend pertaining to the financial year
