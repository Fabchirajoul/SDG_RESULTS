Message from the Chairman &: Managing

Managing Director

Annual Report 2019-20

I am confident that we will continue to

outperform the industry and strengthen our

market positioning in the years to come.

17:

Dear Shareholders,

India represents one of the largest global

consumption hubs and there is no doubt about

the significant growth opportunities that the

country presents due its current low per capita

consumption. The middle class is expanding

rapidly and the number of household below

poverty line is declining. The young Indian

is very well informed, aspirational and

increasingly becoming affluent. These are all

the perfect ingredients for the long term growth

of a consumer products company like Radico

Khaitan.

In the near to medium term, the current global

health calamity has resulted in an economic

crisis that is unprecedented. It has impacted

millions of lives globally and has brought

economies to near standstill as governments

across the world imposed restrictions to

contain the outspread of COVID-19. After the

stringent lock downs and other measures, the

number of new cases has started to decline

in certain countries which had seen major

outbreaks. Healthcare organisations across

the globe are working at a remarkable pace to

develop vaccines which provides hope that this

should all normalise soon. Swift policy actions

undertaken by governments to protect and

support businesses and individuals will not only

alleviate the severe pressure that the economy

is facing but also pave the way for a smooth

recovery.

The Indian economy was anyway under

pressure during the first eleven months and the

outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020 aggravated

the situation. Despite this, it is heartening to

see that Radico Khaitan has closed the financial

year FY2020 with a remarkable operational and

financial performance. Despite the lock down

during the later part of March 2020, we have

delivered a robust double digit IMFL volume

growth. This is a reflection of our strong brand

equity and consumer focused brand portfolio.

Management continues to make strategic

and highly targeted investments in innovative

marketing and products to gain market

share. I am confident that we will continue to

outperform the industry and strengthen our

market positioning in the years to come.

Majority of the businesses worldwide have

faced disruptions and economic fallout.

Therefore, they are looking to diversify and de-

risk their supply chain and manufacturing.

After the COVID-19 pandemic, India will have

the opportunity to build an economy that is

more resilient, diversified and attractive to the

global OEMs. This is an opportunity to rebuild

a truly Atmanirbhar Bharat or a self-dependent

India.

These are uncertain times and it is difficult to

predict the extent of this pandemic, therefore

we are being cautious in our approach. But

at the same time we are very optimistic on

the strength and resilience of our business

model, Indian economy and the humanity as a

whole. Once this is over, we will step towards a

healthier and brighter future.

Warm regards,

Lalit Khaitan

Chairman &: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

Radico Khaitan has continued the growth

momentum during FY2020. Despite the ongoing

economic crisis, we delivered IMFL volume

growth of 12.5%, led by Prestige & Above

volume growth of 15.2%. This has been made

possible due to the all round efforts of each of

our employees, the trust of our loyal consumers

and our robust business model. We currently

have four millionaire brands and at least

two more of our brands are approaching the

milestone of annual sales of a million case in

the near to mid-term. I am also proud to report

that the 8PM family of brands has crossed

volume of 10 million cases during FY2020.

Though COVID-19 pandemic has created an

unprecedented situation, it has also brought

significant learning opportunities to each one

of us. This has enabled Radico Khaitan to

introspect our strategies and the resilience of

the business model. We have developed and

implemented a company-wide policy framework

on how things will change during the post-

COVID era. Amidst this crisis, we have prioritised

the health and safety of our employees and

communities around us.

In the current scenario, the Company has

adopted a deliberate and prudent approach

which is not very different from our long term

strategy. First and foremost is the focus on

strengthening our brand portfolio. We will

continue to launch brands in the premium

category which will contribute to the future

growth. Digital has always been an important

part of our marketing strategy. We will

reassess and refocus our A&SP strategy and

we believe that going forward, the share of

digital will increase even further. We are taking

a conscious effort towards the review of each

capex and cost line item. Particularly in context

of the COVID-19 scenario, this will enable the

Company to further optimize cash flows and

make operations much leaner. Finally, we are

leveraging technology to drive transformation

in the work environment and support the

workforce.

Although in the short term the spirits industry

has faced significant challenges, the long-

term dynamics of the industry remain intact.

There are a number of factors that make

India one of the top markets for global spirits

companies. These include growing disposable

incomes particularly with the younger Indian,

expansion of the middle-class, increasing rural

consumption and dispersed urbanization,

greater acceptance of social drinking and a

higher proportion of the young population

entering the drinking age.

We entered the new financial year when the

major global economies were shut down. The

impact is widespread and the coming months

are going to be very challenging. Consumers

are likely to hold back on discretionary spends

with focus on health and hygiene potentially

leading to future behaviour shifts. Going forward

technology will take a centre stage for providing

convenience and enhanced experiences to

consumers. Given the uncertain economic

environment, it difficult to predict how exactly is

the consumer behaviour going to change in the

longer term and its impact on business models.

Radico Khaitan has a strong brand equity and

loyal consumer base. This will enable us to

continue to gain market shares in the coming

years. We continue to take necessary steps to

maintain our robust foundation and financial

strength whilst at the same time delivering

differentiated consumer experience.
