KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS

[Pursuant to Schedule V(B) to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure

Requirements) Regulations, 2015]

Key Financial Ratios for the Company:

Notes:

1. Net Profit Margin and Return on Net worth ratios have been computed based on Profit After Tax (before exceptional

items).

2. The relatively higher Debtors Turnover ratio for the year ended 31st March, 2020 is largely attributable to lower year-end

credit sales.

3. The relatively higher Current ratio for the year ended 31st March, 2020 is largely attributable to higher financial assets reflecting

higher cash generation for the year.

4. Interest Coverage Ratio and Debt-Equity ratio are not relevant for the Company as it has negligible debt.

Managing Director/Wholetime

Director of a subsidiary.

Under Ind AS, the cost of ITC Stock Options (Stock Options)

is recognised based on the fair value of Stock Options as on

the grant date.

While the fair value of Stock Options granted is recognised

in the Statement of Profit and Loss for employees of the

Company (other than those out on deputation), the value of

Stock Options, net of reimbursements, granted to employees

on deputation and to employees of the wholly owned and

other subsidiary companies is considered as capital

contribution/investment.

The Company generally seeks reimbursement of the value

of Stock Options from such companies, as applicable.

It may, if so recommended by the Corporate Management

Committee and approved by the Audit Committee, decide

not to seek such reimbursements from:

(a) Wholly owned subsidiaries who need to conserve financial

capacity to sustain their business and growth plans and

to address contingencies that may arise, taking into

account the economic and market conditions then

prevailing and opportunities and threats in the competitive

context.

(b) Other companies not covered under (a) above, who need

to conserve financial capacity to sustain their business and

growth plans and where the quantum of reimbursement

is not material - the materiality threshold being ` 5 Crores

for each entity for a financial year.

Cash Settled Stock Appreciation Linked Reward (SAR)

Plan

Cash Settled SAR units are granted to eligible employees

under the ITC Employee Cash Settled Stock Appreciation

Linked Reward Plan (“ITC ESARP”). The eligible employees

for this purpose are such present and future permanent

employees of the Company, including a Director of the

Company, as may be decided by the CMC / Nomination &

Compensation Committee/Board.

For cash settled SAR units granted to eligible employees, a

liability is initially measured at fair value at the grant date

and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting period,

until settled. The fair value of ESAR units granted is recognised

in the Statement of Profit and Loss for employees of the

Company. In case of employees on deputation to group

companies, the Company generally seeks reimbursements

from the concerned group company. The value of such

payments, net of reimbursements, is considered as capital

contribution/investment.

Leases

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a

contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains,

a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified

asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

Company as Lessee

Right-of-Use (ROU) assets are recognised at inception of a

contract or arrangement for significant lease components at

cost less lease incentives, if any. ROU assets are subsequently

measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and

impairment losses, if any. The cost of ROU assets includes

the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct cost

incurred and lease payments made at or before the lease

commencement date. ROU assets are generally depreciated

over the shorter of the lease term and estimated useful lives

of the underlying assets on a straight line basis. Lease term

is determined based on consideration of facts and

circumstances that create an economic incentive to

exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination

option. Lease payments associated with short-term leases

and low value leases are charged to the Statement of

Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the

relevant lease.

The Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the

present value of lease payments to be made on the date of

recognition of the lease. Such lease liabilities do not include

variable lease payments (that do not depend on an index or

a rate), which are recognised as expense in the periods in

which they are incurred. Interest on lease liability is recognised

using the effective interest method. Lease liabilities are

subsequently increased to reflect the accretion of interest

and reduced for the lease payments made. The carrying

amount of lease liabilities is also remeasured upon modification

of lease arrangement or upon change in the assessment of

the lease term. The effect of such remeasurements is adjusted

to the value of the ROU assets.

Represents Fair value of Non-current Financial Instruments

Fair value hierarchy

Fair value of the financial instruments is classified in various fair value hierarchies based on the following three levels:

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted price included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly

(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using market approach and valuation

techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If significant

inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.

Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs such as foreign exchange spot rates and forward

rates at the end of the reporting period, yield curves, risk free rate of returns, volatility etc., as applicable.

Level 3: Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the fair value is determined using generally accepted

pricing models based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with the most significant inputs being the discount rate that reflects the

credit risk of counterparty.

The fair value of trade receivables, trade payables and other current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be equal to

the carrying amounts of these items due to their short-term nature. Where such items are non-current in nature, the same has

been classified as Level 3 and fair value determined using discounted cash flow basis. Similarly, unquoted equity instruments

where most recent information to measure fair value is insufficient, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements,

cost has been considered as best estimate of fair value and has been excluded in the fair value measurement disclosed above.

There has been no change in the valuation methodology for Level 3 inputs during the year. The Company has not classified any

material financial instruments under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2

during the year.

Managing Director, ITC Limited and

Mr Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII. There were

200 participants representing corporates, ministries,

government departments, academia, financial institutions,

civil society, consultants, bilateral/multilateral agencies,

research scholars, media, and educational institutions.

The Un-plastic Collective, a voluntary multi-stakeholder

platform, co-partnered by CII, UNE and WWF India was

launched at the 14th Sustainability Summit. The purpose of

the Collective is to move beyond regulation and minimise the

externalities of plastics on the environmental, ecological and

social health of our planet. The collective seeks to galvanise

commitment by industry, government and investors to reduce

the generation and consumption of plastic and improve

management of plastic waste. A report on “The Un-plastic

Strategy–Why and how to minimise externalities” was

released at the Summit, detailing a step by step guide for

businesses on the issue of managing plastics and provides a

framework to prioritize action based on financial, social and

environmental impact.

The CII-ITC Sustainability Awards recognise and reward

outstanding contributions by corporates to sustainable

development in the country. Since 2006, 953 businesses have

applied for the Awards, of which 304 have been recognised so

far. In 2019, out of 75 applicants, 29 companies were declared

winners in various categories. The 14th CII-ITC Sustainability

Awards 2019 took place virtually in July 2020.

The Climate Action Programme (CAP) 2.0° instituted by the

Centre in 2018 aims at raising the bar on corporate climate

action and building climate resilience of Indian businesses.

20 large corporates and approximately 50 SMEs participated

in the first cycle of the programme in 2018-19. A group of

20 assessors from the industry was also trained to carry out

the assessments in this cycle. The applicant with the highest

score in each sector, after undergoing 3 levels of assessments,

including a site visit was recognised by a non-industry-based

jury in the Climate Leadership Conference and Awards

ceremony held on August 1, 2019.

In July 2019, 19 CEOs of India Inc. came forward as founding

members of the India CEO Forum on Clean Air to provide

corporate leadership to drive cross-sectoral action on air

pollution. Subsequently, a declaration was charted, to

provide impetus to corporate action on air pollution, signed

by 22 CEOs. Aspiration of the forum is to achieve tangible

improvements in ambient air quality by committing action

on air pollution.

The Centre promoted capacity building in sustainability

through a range of training and consulting assignments.

In 2019, around 2000 participants were covered through

56 programmes, conducted both in India and abroad.
