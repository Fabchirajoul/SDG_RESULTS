Chairman's Message

02: Managing

Chairman's

message: Dear Shareholders,

As I write this letter, we are several months into a global

pandemic and this unprecedented crisis has reiterated the

importance of resilience, as a country, as a business and

as individuals.

Now more than ever before, the success of our business is deeply

intertwined with the progress of our customers and our partners,

our ability to innovate and delight consumers and the well-being

of the communities where we operate.

India was fraught with multiple headwinds throughout

FY20 – lingering distress in the financial services space, muted

consumption and cyclical slowdown across industries.

The virus outbreak exacerbated these challenges and India’s

GDP contracted to 4.2% in FY20, the lowest growth in a decade.

The Government of India has announced several measures to

inject liquidity into the economy, limit the impact on vulnerable

sectors and enhance the pace of recovery.

At Diageo India, as growth in the alcoholic beverages sector

slowed sharply and commodities inflation reached new levels

in the first half of the financial year, we continued to focus on

making our brands stronger through renovations and driving

operational and financial efficiency. I am happy that we were

able to maintain our operating margins in FY20 even in a

tough environment.

We stood up to be counted in the fight against the

pandemic, through donation of bulk hand sanitisers and

showing solidarity to our on-trade partners through the

‘Raising the Bar’ programme and by providing medical insurance

for the bartenders.

I am encouraged by the regulators’ acknowledgment of our

category’s salience in the revenue generation capability of

State Governments and by extension, our contribution to the

economy. This is a positive step towards normalisation of the

category and the industry.

During the year, we made significant investment in our talent

pipeline and progressed towards a culture of inclusivity and

shared values. I am particularly pleased that our commitment

to making our workplace more diverse is bearing fruit –

women constitute nearly 26% in leadership positions in the

organisation today.

Moreover, we continue to make substantial progress in our

sustainability journey. I am delighted to inform you that

Diageo has met its 2020 water replenishment target, two years

ahead of time.

Looking at the future, India’s structural growth drivers remain

intact. A young demographic base, growing income levels,

expanding middle-class, greater preference for premium food

and drink experiences and steadily rising social acceptance of

spirits will continue to underpin demand in the years to come.

We have the benefit of a world leader in spirits as our parent

company; and their global experience combined with a strong

team in India will be instrumental in helping us remain strong,

steady and spirited in our pursuit of value-accretive growth.

I am confident that we are well placed both in ensuring the

resilience of the Company and in helping the wider stakeholder

fraternity to meet the challenges of the changing times.

I thank everyone for their support and confidence during

these trying times.

Stay safe. Stay well.

Managing Director

& CEO's message: Dear Shareholders,

FY20 was a challenging one for the Indian economy with the

macroeconomic slowdown causing the GDP growth plummet

to 4.2%. Subdued economic activity and bearish consumer

sentiment led to broad-based consumption slowdown which,

along with commodity inflation, particularly ENA, impacted

growth and margin for beverage alcohol - resulting in industry

growth falling to levels lower than that recorded during the

demonetisation and highway ban quarters. The onset of

COVID-19 and the resultant national lockdown towards the

end of the fiscal year further exacerbated the situation.

Enhancing profitability despite significant

headwinds

Despite the muted economic environment, Diageo India grew its

Prestige & Above (P&A) segment by 6% in the first nine months

of the year, within a reported total net sales growth of 5.4%.

Net sales, however, declined by 11% in the last quarter, impacted

by closure of the on-premise channel and off-trade retail vends.

For the full year, we clocked 1.2% revenue growth.

Recognising the revenue challenge early in the year, we put

management focus on productivity across all cost lines, including

extracting A&P efficiencies, savings in non-staff overheads

and interest costs, optimising our imports value chain through

logistics efficiencies, coupled with overall fiscal discipline.

I am pleased, therefore, that despite the multitude of headwinds

during the year, your Company’s EBITDA grew by 17% with

EBITDA margin expanding by over 220 bps. Overall, despite an

unfavourable environment which impacted demand and cost,

PAT for the year was up 7%.

Renovating our big brands

During the year, our two biggest Prestige segment brands –

Royal Challenge and McDowell’s No. 1 – were relaunched with

new blend and packaging. Although the roll-out of the

renovated brands has been impacted by the lockdown, the early

signs are promising.

The year also witnessed a disruptive innovation in Scotch

through the launch of ‘Hipster’, a portable Scotch whisky in a

pocket-size format – sleek, stylish and perfect for spontaneous

casual moments.

We continued to strengthen our route-to-consumer through

deployment of technology that enables better management of

trade channels. Our IT-enabled tool ‘TRAX’, uses real-time image

recognition (such as recording images of product display on

retail shelves, providing analysis of stock availability and share

on shelf) that helps track in-market execution and enhance

service quality.

Continuing to play our role in society

Good corporate citizenship is core to our business, and we

continue to invest significantly behind creating societal impact.

Through our flagship ‘Diageo Road to Safety’ campaign, now

in its 5th year, we are building on our partnerships with State

Governments to help create a national movement on road safety

in the country. This year, in a first-of-its-kind one-year sustained

"Over the course of this year, we will have to navigate

several unknowns, including disruptive waves of

state level lockdowns, impact of recent tax hikes

on consumer demand and the effects of economic

turmoil. We will continue to dynamically manage the

situation in the near term, while staying true to our

longer-term strategy."

statements, no such disclosures have been made in these

standalone financial statements.

Court of Karnataka and Bombay, shares held in aforesaid trust

have been treated as an investment.

discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting

period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.

1.19 Rounding of amounts

All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes

have been rounded off to the nearest million as per the

requirement of Schedule III (Division II) to the Act, unless

otherwise stated. The sign ‘0’ in these financial statements

indicates that the amounts involved are below INR five lacs

and the sign ‘-’ indicates that amounts are nil.

Note 2 – Critical estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of

accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the

actual result. This note provides an overview of the areas that

involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items

which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates

and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally

assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and

judgements is included in relevant notes together with information

about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the

financial statements.

The areas involving critical estimates and judgements are:

• Estimation of defined benefit obligation – Note 38(b)

• Estimation of provisions and contingent liabilities – Notes 8, 17

and 49

• Impairment of trade receivables – Note 31

• Impairment of investments and loans to subsidiaries – Notes 4, 5

and 36

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based

on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of

future events that may have a financial impact on the Company and

that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.:

Note 45: regulatory notices and communications

The Company has previously received letters and notices from various regulatory and other government authorities as follows:

a)

as disclosed in the financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019

from the Securities Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’), in relation to the Initial Inquiry, Additional Inquiry, and matters arising out of the

Agreement dated February 25, 2016, entered into by the Company with Dr. Vijay Mallya to which the Company has responded. No

further communications have been received thereafter;

b)

as disclosed in the financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 from

the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (‘MCA’) in relation to its inspection conducted under Section 206(5) of the Companies Act, 2013

during the year ended March 31, 2016 and subsequent show cause notices alleging violation of certain provisions of the Companies

Act, 1956 and Companies Act, 2013, to which the Company had responded. The Company had also received a: letter dated October 13,

2017 from the Registrar of Companies, Karnataka (the ‘Registrar’) inviting the Company’s attention to the compounding provisions of

the Companies Act, 1956 and Companies Act, 2013 following the aforesaid show cause notices. During the year ended March 31, 2018,

the Company filed applications for compounding of offences with the Registrar in relation to three show cause notices, applications

for adjudication with the Registrar in relation to two show cause notices, and requested the Registrar to drop one show cause notice

based on expert legal advice received. The Company is awaiting a response from the Registrar to the aforesaid applications. The

management is of the view that the financial impact arising out of compounding/ adjudication of these matters will not be material to

the Company’s financial statements;

c)

as disclosed in the financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, from

the

letter of comfort to a bank, towards a loan facility from that bank amounting to INR 3,500 million (2019: INR 3,500

million) availed by Pioneer Distilleries Limited (PDL), a subsidiary. As per the: letter, the Company has expressed its intention to ensure that PDL

repays the outstanding amount under the facility on due date and in the event of default by PDL, to take appropriate steps to cause PDL to

repay the outstanding out of PDL’s resources. The said letter does not constitute a guarantee by USL, as in the event of default by PDL, the bank

shall have no recourse to USL.

Notes:

(a) Income tax matters- Income tax matters primarily relate to exposures under transfer pricing and disallowance of certain expenses that the Company had claimed

as deductions in its Income Tax returns.

(b) Indirect tax matters- The Company has operations across various states in India. The Company has identified possible exposures relating to local sales tax, entry

tax, state excise duty and central excise duty.

(c) Other civil litigations and claims- Other civil litigations relate to various claims from third parties under dispute which are lying with various courts/appellate

authorities.

(d) Provident fund- The Company has evaluated the impact of the Supreme Court (“SC”) judgement dated February 28, 2019 in the case of Regional Provident Fund

Commissioner (II) West Bengal v/s Vivekananda Vidyamandir and Others, in relation to non-inclusion of certain allowances in the definition of “basic wages” of the

relevant employees for the purposes of determining contribution to Provident Fund (“PF”) under the Employees’ Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions Act,

1952. There are interpretation issues relating to the said SC judgement. In the assessment of the management, the aforesaid matter is not likely to have a significant

impact on the Company and accordingly, no provision has been made in the financial statements.

(e) Use of Judgement

Management categorizes the matters based on the probability of cash outflow, which require judgement. Management obtains the views of external consultants

where necessary. Based on the assessment, management recognises liability/ provision, or discloses the matter as a contingent liability, except for matters where the

probability of outflow of cash is considered remote. Due to uncertainties involved in the process, actual outflows may be different from those originally estimated.

The Company may be involved in legal proceedings in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of any expected settlement. In such cases,

appropriate disclosure is provided but no provision is made and no contingent liability is quantified.

(f) Management is optimistic of a favourable outcome in the above matters based on legal opinions / management assessment. It is not practicable for the Company

to estimate the timing of the cash outflows, if any, in respect of the above, pending resolution of respective proceedings.
