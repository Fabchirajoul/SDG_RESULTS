Dear shareholders,

We present the first Integrated An-

nual Report of Emami Limited.

We believe that the time has come

to extend beyond the conventional

appraisal of corporate performance.

This appraisal needs to be not as

much about our topline and bot-

tom-line but all factors influencing

these visible indices.

The result is that our Annual Report

has analysed all factors that have

translated into our sustainability:

Manufacturing Capital, Natural

Capital, Financial Capital, Intel-

lectual, Social & Relationship and

Human Capital. The interplay of

these capitals has translated into a

sustained growth in net worth and

other stakeholder-centric measures.

Even as the Indian economy was

affected by the slowdown, Emami

prioritised research, product intro-

duction, cost optimisation, footprint

expansion, direct reach and modern

trade expansion and digitalisation.

We believe that our business model

will be more relevant in a new world

facing the challenge of COVID-19 as

consumers invest more in hygiene,

healthcare and wellness. Emami is

positioned to capitalise and resume

its multi-year growth journey.
