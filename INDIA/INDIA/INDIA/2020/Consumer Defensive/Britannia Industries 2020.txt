CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW (CONTINUED):

letter of credit for ` 48.90 (31 March 2019: ` 72.31).

Notes:

(i)

Contingent liabilities disclosed above represent possible obligations where possibility of cash outflow

to settle the obligations is not remote.

(ii)

The above does not include non-quantifiable industrial disputes and other legal disputes pending

before various judicial authorities [Also refer note 42 and 55].

(iii) The Supreme court of India in the month of February 2019 had passed a judgement relating to

definition of wages under the Provident Fund Act, 1952. However, considering that there are

numerous interpretative issues relating to this judgement and in the absence of reliable measurement

of the provision for the earlier periods, the Company had made a provision for provident fund

contribution pursuant to the judgement in the previous year. The Company will evaluate its position

and update its provision, if required, on receiving further clarity on the subject. The Company does
