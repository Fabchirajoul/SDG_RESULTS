letter to our

shareholders: Dear shareholders,

Over the last decade, GCPL has

transformed into an emerging markets

FMCG leader. While we are very proud of

our achievements as a company, I believe

we are only as good as what we do next.

Before I share with you my reflections on

what we need to do going forward to build

towards this, I want to take stock of where

we are today; the good news, and the bad.

Our performance in fiscal year 2020

was not good. Sales declined around

4 per cent and Profit Before Tax (pre

exceptions) was flat. March 2020

was particularly impacted by the

spread of the COVID-19 pandemic

and the eventual lockdown in many

geographies where we operate. This

resulted in virtually no sales in the

latter part of the month.

The

bad news

We now have with COVID-19, a

health, humanitarian and economic

crisis of epic proportions to contend

with. The excellence we will require

now, going against water rather

than with water, to perform and take

market share, means a significant

step up in ways we probably haven’t

even realised yet.

letter to a favour- seeking competitor: “I

hold my brother Godrej in such a high regard that

if your enterprise is likely to harm him in any way, I

regret very much I cannot give you my blessings.”

Godrej was founded in India’s freedom movement.

We made the first vegetable oil soap during the

Spanish flu pandemic.:

Managing Director of the

Company with effect from the

30, 2020 for personal reasons.

His resignation was accepted

by the Board of Directors at

their meeting held on June 9,

2020. The Board has requested

Mr Vivek Gambhir to continue

as a Whole-time Director up to

September 30, 2020. The Board

members place on record their

sincere appreciation for

Mr Gambhir’s contributions to

the Company’s growth during

his tenure as the Managing

Director.

At the meeting held on June

9, 2020, the Board approved

the appointment of Ms Nisaba

Godrej as the Managing

Director of the Company,

subject to approval of the

shareholders at the Annual

General Meeting (AGM).

The Board of Directors also

requested her to continue

as the Chairperson of the

Board till March 31, 2022 and

accordingly, designated her as

the Chairperson and Managing

Director.:

Not applicable

In case of Mr Vivek Gambhir and Mr V Srinivasan, the remuneration includes the actual performance-linked

variable remuneration payable for the fiscal year on the basis of performance, profitability, and optimum utilisation

of capital. Ms Nisaba Godrej has voluntarily waived the PLVR for the financial year 2019-20 due to the grave

situation caused by the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic and suspension of business activities due to the

lockdown imposed by the Government of India and the likely impact of the same on the Company’s performance.
