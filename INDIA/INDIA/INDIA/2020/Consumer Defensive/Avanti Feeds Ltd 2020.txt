Dear Shareholders,

It is heartening to see that the performance of your

Company has improved significantly in 2019-20 as

compared to 2018-19. The Aqua Culture industry

suffered a setback in 2018 and made a quick positive

recovery in 2019-20.

As you are all aware, your Company is a well-

acknowledged pioneer in the Indian Shrimp industry,

with a proven track record of 27 years. We have

technical expertise in developing need based feed in

accordance with shrimp culture conditions prevailing

in different regions of our country’s vast landscape.

regularly our well-trained technical teams visit our

farmer friends, brief them on the most suitable

shrimp culture methods and update them on latest

developments in aquaculture industry.

The shrimp production in India has registered a

growth of about 10% - 12% at 8,00,000 Tons in 2019

as compared to 6,85,000 tons in 2018. Shrimp feed

consumption has registered a growth of about 10%

at 11,50,000 tons in 2019 compared to 10,20,000

Tons in 2018. In view of CoVID-19 impact, the Global

demand and production is expected to come down

by about 10% to 15% in FY21 compared to FY20.

As the industry was breathing a sigh of relief in

2019-20 after a serious setback in 2018-19, the

Covid-19 broke out as a pandemic posing a big

challenge to the humanity. The Corona Virus which

unfolded in a big way during second half of 2019

in China spread like a wild fire almost the entire

world with India being no exception. The Covid-19

broke out in India during February 2020 leading to

imposition of country vide lockdown from 24th March,

2020 bringing all the activities to a standstill.

As an initial reaction to the pandemic, the shrimp

culture stocking slowed down during April and May

2020, apprehending a fall in export prices and export

market. As you know the Q1 i.e. Apr-May-Jun 2020

are the months during which stocking takes place

intensively and the production levels are forecasted

depending on the stockings and extent of culture

area which missed in Q1 of FY21. There was also

We effectively countered every business

challenge that came our way, and emerged

stronger and profitable.

Foreign Currency Translation

(i)

Functional and presentation Currency

Items included in the financial statements of the

Company are measured using the currency of

its primary economic environment in which the

Company operates ('the functional currency').

The financial statements are presented in Indian

rupees (INr), which is the Company's functional

and presentation currency.

(ii)

Transactions and Translations

Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets

and liabilities are translated into the relevant

functional currency at exchange rates in effect

at the Balance Sheet date. The gains or losses

resulting from such translations are included

in net profit in the Statement of Profit and

Loss. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary

liabilities denominated in a foreign currency

and measured at fair value are translated at the

exchange rate prevalent at the date when the

fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets

and nonmonetary liabilities denominated in a

foreign currency and measured at historical cost

are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at

the date of the transaction.

Transaction gains or losses realized upon

settlement of foreign currency transactions are

included in determining net profit for the period

in which the transaction is settled. revenue,

expense and cash-flow items denominated in

foreign currencies are translated into the relevant

functional currencies using the exchange rate in

effect on the date of the transaction

c.

Revenue Recognition

The Company earns revenue primarily from sale

of Shrimp Feed.

revenue is recognized upon transfer of control

of promised products or services to customers

in an amount that reflects the consideration the

Company expects to receive in exchange for those

products or services. To recognize revenues, we

apply the following five step approach:

(1)

identify the contract with a customer,

(2)

identify the performance obligations in the

contract,

(3)

determine the transaction price,

(4)

allocate the transaction price to the

performance obligations in the contract,

and

(5)

recognize revenues when a performance

obligation is satisfied.

At contract inception, the Company assesses

its promise to transfer products or services to

a customer to identify separate performance

obligations. The Company applies judgement

to determine whether each product or services

promised to a customer are capable of being

distinct, and are distinct in the context of

the contract, if not, the promised product or

services are combined and accounted as a single

performance obligation. The Company allocates

the arrangement consideration to separately

identifiable performance obligation based on

their relative stand-alone selling price or residual

method. Stand-alone selling prices are determined

based on sale prices for the components when it

is regularly sold separately, in cases where the

Company is unable to determine the stand-alone

selling price, the Company uses third-party prices

for similar deliverables or the company uses

expected cost plus margin approach in estimating

the stand-alone selling price.

revenue is recognised upon transfer of control

of promised products or services to customers in

an amount that reflects the consideration which

the Company expects to receive in exchange for

those products or services.

d.

Government Grant

Grants from the government are recognised

at their fair value where there is a reasonable

assurance that the grant will be received and the

Company will comply with all attached conditions.
