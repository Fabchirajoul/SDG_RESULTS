Mr. Madhusudan Gopalan,: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to share with

you the performance of your Company

for the Financial Year 2019-20. This fiscal

witnessed unprecedented disruption to the

business and numerous challenges due to the

COVID-19 pandemic. Your Company navigated

these tough times with agility to deliver a resilient

performance for the Financial Year. While uncertainties

and challenges remain in the near-term, we will continue to focus on our strategy

to drive superiority and improve productivity to drive balanced growth, while

prioritizing the health and safety of our people.

Your Company has built citizenship into its way of doing business and is committed

to be a force for good and a force for growth. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,

we stepped up and launched ‘P&G Suraksha India’ to serve our communities by

partnering with government and relief organizations through in-kind, product

and critical supplies donations. We launched the ‘Gillette Barber Suraksha

Program’, to support the barber community get back on their feet. The program

enabled them to restart their business while maintaining high standards of safety,

health and hygiene. We also leveraged the voice of our brands on social media to

create awareness about preventive measures to combat the spread of COVID-19.

In addition, your Company continued its focus on educating the underprivileged

children in India through the ‘P&G Shiksha’ program. Through this, CSR program

the P&G group in India has supported 2300 schools that will impact the lives of 20

lakh children. P&G Shiksha’s efforts are focused in three main areas – improving

educational infrastructure, empowering marginalized girls through education

and improving learning outcomes. Last year, P&G supported more than 2,500

families affected by floods in Maharashtra with health and hygiene kits.

Lastly, I would also like to express my gratitude to all our consumers, customers,

employees, business partners and YOU, our valued Shareholders for your support

during this unprecedented year. We are keenly focused on creating value for

our stakeholders. We will continue to innovate and bring superior products to

consumers and sustainably grow the business.

Gurcharan Das

Chairman:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to share with you the overall

performance of your Company in 2019-20.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the

subsequent nation-wide lockdown to contain the spread of

the pandemic disrupted the business operations. During this

unprecedented crisis, we are prioritizing the health and safety

of our employees and maximizing the availability of our products,

which play an essential role in meeting the daily health and hygiene

needs of our consumers across the country.

It is the agility, commitment and innovation of your organization that enabled us to deliver resilient

results in such a challenging environment. Your Company delivered sales of ₹1,679 crores, down 10%

vs year ago and Profit After Tax (PAT) of ₹230 crores, down 9% vs year ago. In April-May, our sales were

significantly impacted due to the pandemic-related lockdown, which reduced the shaving frequency

among consumers. With the easing of the lockdown, we saw a sharp recovery to the pre-COVID levels.

Our resilient results are driven by our strategy to drive superiority of our brands across product, packaging,

communication, retail execution and value. This is fueled by strong focus on productivity and enabled

by a highly agile and accountable organization. We are winning across all channels - traditional, modern

retail and e-commerce. We are continuously innovating the way we build brands, run our supply chain

and use digital marketing and data analytics to improve consumer reach and engagement.

In the men’s grooming business, Gillette continued to be the market leader and reached its highest

ever market share. Our irresistible superiority on product and commercial innovations continued to add

millions of new users to the Gillette franchise. We launched Gillette SkinGuard, a premium system razor

that provides the smoothest shave to consumers. In the brand’s female grooming portfolio, Gillette

Venus registered its strongest year on share growth. In the Oral Care category, your Company continued

to innovate, grow share and penetration. Oral-B also launched rechargeable electric toothbrush with

popular characters for children.

As a part of our COVID-19 response, Gillette launched the ‘Gillette Barber Suraksha Program', to support

the barber community get back on their feet. The program enabled them to restart their business while

high standards of safety, health and hygiene. Gillette continues to groom the youth of India on key skills

required to increase employability through its program ‘Safalta Apni Mutthi Mein' which has reached

more than 8000+ colleges and universities. We also reinvented our flagship CSR program P&G Shiksha

and reached children remotely during this crisis. We connected with students via phone calls, SMSs,

video calls and WhatsApp to continue and enhance their learning at home.

While there are near-term challenges, the FMCG sector continues to be an important contributor to the

economy. As the market recovers, we will continue to focus on driving balanced growth behind brand

fundamentals, strength of the product portfolio and improved execution.
