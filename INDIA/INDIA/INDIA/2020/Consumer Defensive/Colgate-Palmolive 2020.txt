Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of financial statements requires

the use of accounting estimates which, by

definition, will seldom equal the actual results.

This note provides an overview of the areas

that involved a higher degree of judgment or

complexity, and of items which are more likely

to be materially adjusted due to estimates and

assumptions turning out to be different than

those originally assessed. Detailed information

about each of these estimates and judgments

is included in relevant notes together with

information about the basis of calculation for each

affected line item in the financial statements.:

Managing Director and Finance Director of the Company. The Company

operates only in one Business Segment i.e. ‘Personal Care (including Oral Care)’ which primarily includes products such

as Soaps, Cosmetics and Toilet Preparations and the activities incidental thereto within India, hence does not have any

reportable Segments as per Ind AS 108 “Operating Segments”. The performance of the Company is mainly driven by sales

made locally and hence, no separate geographical segment is identified.
