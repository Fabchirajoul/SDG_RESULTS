Dear Shareholders

We write this Annual

Report amidst a situation

that has never been

witnessed in our living

memory (at least for a

majority of the world’s

population). The COVID-19

pandemic has left national

leaders battling to save

the lives of fellow citizens,

while trying to bring

economic growth back on

track, as phased lockdown

continues.

As we adapt to a post-COVID

world, we are pleased to share

with you our achievements in

the year gone by, showcasing

our efforts towards building

a sustainable business whilst

creating value for all stakeholders.

FY19-20 was marked by

satisfactory growth across

our geographies and business

verticals.

The love for food

We are proud to be in the

business of food - something that

unites families, especially at an

age where digital connectivity

has left little time for moments of

togetherness. The simple joys of

cooking meals and reconnecting

with your family over meals,

continues to offer meaningful

contributions across diverse

emotional quotients.

At the heart of our business

lies our consumers and it is

what drives us to scale our

capabilities and tap into emerging

opportunities. While changing

Our flagship brands

Daawat and Royal

further strengthened

their position in

India and US during

the year.

Ashwani Kumar Arora

Chief Executive Officer &: Managing Director

Growth pertains

to the sustained

market leadership

of our key brands,

across geographies

we operate, coupled

with an expanding

product portfolio and

consistent demand for

our products.
