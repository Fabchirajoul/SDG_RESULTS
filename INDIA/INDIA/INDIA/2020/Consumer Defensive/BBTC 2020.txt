36 Leases

(a) The Company has adopted Ind AS 116 on “Leases” with effect from 1 April, 2019 by applying it to all

contracts of leases existing on 1 April, 2019 by using modified retrospective approach and accordingly,

comparative information for the year ended 31 March, 2019 has not been restated.

(b) The Company has recognised and measured the Right-of-Use (ROU) asset and the lease liability over

the remaining lease period and payments discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as at the

date of initial application. This has resulted in recognising ROU asset of INR 210.97 and a corresponding

lease liability of INR 210.97 as at 1 April, 2019. For financial year ended 31 March, 2020, the nature of

expenses in respect of operating leases has changed from lease rent in previous periods to depreciation

for the ROU asset of INR 70.54 and finance costs for interest accrued on lease liability of INR 25.96.

(c) The effect of adoption of Ind AS 116 on financial statements and earnings per share for the year ended

31 March, 2020 are not material. Segment results have been arrived after considering interest expense

on lease liabilities.:
