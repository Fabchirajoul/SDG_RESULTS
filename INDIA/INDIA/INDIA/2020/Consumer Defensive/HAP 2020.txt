MANAGING DIRECTOR’S DESK:

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S DESK: Dear Stakeholders,

I am honoured to announce the completion of HAP’s 50th year.

It has been quite a journey, and I have been fortunate to witness

the progress we have made over the last 5 decades.

HAP’s story is one of dedication and simplicity, and started with

the introduction of Arun Icecreams. Our aim was to provide ice

creams to customers who craved for something refreshing.

Te success of Arun Icecreams inspired us to go further and

create more brands and products that would meet various

customer needs. Today, these brands are being consumed in

households across the country - from Arokya Milk to Hatsun

Curd. Our newer brands Ibaco and Oyalo continue to show

a steady upward trend, and we can’t wait to see what the

future holds.

Our story is the result of the intelligent hard work and

commitment of our shareholders, farmers, employees and all

other stakeholders. I, on behalf of the entire HAP family, thank

you for your loyalty and support. We look forward to writing the

next chapter of this journey with you on board.
