01-24 Company Report

25-94 Statutory Report

95-296 Financial Statement:

Dear Shareholders and Friends,

The year 2020 will go down as annus horribilis with the enƟre

world reeling from a once-in-a-century pandemic. The COVID-

19 virus, which countries around the world believed and

hoped could be contained through strict lockdown measures

of a few weeks, now half a year later, seems to be an all-

consuming juggernaut. While some countries have been able

to bend the curve, sporadic outbreaks have driven home the

message that in an interconnected world, no one recovers Ɵll

everyone does.

Indian economy, which was already limping before the

outbreak of COVID-19, came to a grinding halt as COVID-19

mandated total lockdown disrupted the social, economic and

ﬁnancial structures of the country. The NBFC / HFC sector,

which has been going through a liquidity crisis since the IL&FS

default in September 2018, and the resultant risk aversion on

part of the debt markets and the banking system, came under

further pressure on account of COVID-19. The government of

India and the RBI have responded swiŌly, announcing

sweeping measures to arrest the economic slowdown by

facilitaƟng credit ﬂow to the aﬀected sectors. Speciﬁc

measures were also announced towards providing liquidity

support to HFCs, NBFCs and MFIs. The RBI provided liquidity

boost to these sectors through its TLTRO 2.0 operaƟons worth

₹50,000 Crores; special liquidity scheme of upto ₹30,000

Crores; ParƟal Credit Guarantee Scheme of ₹45,000 Crores;

and more recently ₹10,000 Crores through AddiƟonal

Standing Liquidity Facility. Your Company also availed of

funding through these faciliƟes.

As I have menƟoned in my quarterly results' calls and in other

interacƟons with you, running down our developer loan book

is a key area of priority for me and the senior management

team. Over the last two years we have managed to generate

signiﬁcant amounts of liquidity by selling down or geƫng the

developer loans on our books reﬁnanced. Presently, we are in

the midst of a few more similar transacƟons with various

porƞolio investment funds, which will enable us to moneƟse a

large part of our wholesale porƞolio and generate liquidity.

OperaƟonal Performance Overview

Our balance sheet size at the end of FY2019-20 stood at ₹

1,02,872 Crores, declining from ₹1,30,104 Crores as at end

of FY 2018-19 mainly on account of decrease in loan book

as we sold down retail loans during the year to generate

liquidity. Our total loan assets are at ₹ 93,021 Crores. Proﬁt

aŌer tax for the year stood at ₹2,200 Crores. Adjusted for

COVID-19 provisions, the PAT for the year was ₹2,904

Crores.

Despite the Ɵght liquidity condiƟons, your Company

conƟnued to strictly adhere to its liquidity management

principles and held cash and investments of ₹13,410 Crores at

end of FY 2019-20, represenƟng 18.4% of its loan book. Your

Company had a fully matched ALM with no negaƟve

mismatches in any bucket, and is already fully in compliance

with guidelines issued by the RBI on November 4, 2019, which

permits 10% to 20% mismatch in various Ɵme buckets. Our

capital adequacy as at end of FY 2019-20 stood at 22.82%,

with Tier 1 at 15.05% against a regulatory requirement of 13%

and 10% respecƟvely. At a gearing of 4.0x, your Company is

one of the least levered companies among its peers.

Transforming Business Strategy to an Asset-Light Model

The crisis of the past 21 months has made us realize that the

HFC business will now have to go through a cyclical shiŌ

wherein chunky balance sheets and high leverage will have to

transform into leaner balance sheets by following an asset

light model of business. While your Company's total loans

under management [AUM] will grow, the exposure on its

balance sheet will be signiﬁcantly lower, thus reducing the

requirement for large borrowings and high leverage. As the

earnings will be proporƟonal to the enƟre AUM, this model

will be RoE accreƟve, while business risks will remain

contained.

We see opportunity in co-originaƟng loans with banks and

credit funds, and increased porƞolio sell-downs. In retail loans

the Company will originate home loans and MSME LAP loans

which it can then securiƟze to banks and other ﬁnancial

insƟtuƟons. Of all the incremental business generated, only a

relaƟvely small proporƟon will stay on the Company's

balance-sheet, while the rest will be oﬀ-balance sheet.

MoneƟzing Stake in OakNorth Bank

In November 2015, IBHFL acquired 39.76% stake in OakNorth

Bank for $100 Million. Since then, Oaknorth Bank has

emerged as one of the fastest growing banks in Europe,

leveraging technology tools for fast and eﬃcient disbursals to

the Small and Medium Enterprises [SME] sector. Resource

raising is also completely online, with the enƟre deposits for

95-296 Financial Statement:

Dear Shareholders,

Your Directors are pleased to present the Fifteenth Annual Report of the Company along with the audited statement of accounts for the

financial year ended March 31, 2020.

The financial year 2019-20 saw the COVID-19 pandemic further add to the economic headwinds that the Indian economy has been

facing. The pandemic is expected to substantially impact domestic and global growth, and worsen geopolitical uncertainties.

Through financial year 2019-20, the Company continued to rationalize its balance sheet following the difficult liquidity scenarios that the

NBFC/HFC sector has been facing since September 2018, following the default by the infrastructure-lending focused NBFC IL&FS. The

Company focused on managing liquidity and ALM, and conserving capital.
