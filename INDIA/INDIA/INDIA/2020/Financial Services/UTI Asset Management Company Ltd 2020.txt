Dear Shareholders,

I hope you are well, staying safe and healthy, as Covid-19 still continues to impact communities in India and

across the globe.

Your company is credited as India’s first mutual fund. Over the period of time, we have developed a strong brand

recognition amongst investors as a pure-play independent asset manager which distinguishes us from most of

our major competitors. These attributes clubbed with diverse products and services, consistent long term track

record of delivering a stable investment performance and AUM growth have facilitated our company in sailing

seamlessly through adversities arising from the spread of Covid pandemic and subsequent lockdown.

Our Response to Covid-19

In response to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, we promptly strategized a remote engagement model and

enabled full spectrum of our existing digital initiatives – online platforms & mobile applications, to ensure business

continuity during the lockdown period. For employees, whose safety and well-being has been our topmost priority,

remote working facilitated by us ensured their working in a productive and efficient manner.

For distributors, we initiated training and investor education programs on various subjects, such as understanding

the economic impact of COVID-19, client engagement tools, working from home and yoga. We also initiated

monthly “live” market outlook sessions on our social media channels that assisted us in sustaining client relationship

during the period. In addition to business continuity measures, we also focused on optimizing operational cost

through cost reduction measures on discretionary spending and by initiating workforce based savings.

I am pleased to inform you that as on date, there has been no adverse material impact in our overall investor

services, as we ensured majority customers seamlessly transit to online transactions and uninterrupted delivery of

services during the lock down period.

Business Performance:

Your company’s legacy has been centered on our continuous effort to strengthen the existing multichannel

distribution network, increasing share in B30 cities and improving our operating metric. Our client services

catered to a diverse group of individual and institutional investors through a wide variety of funds and services.

Our bouquet of service includes – managing the domestic mutual funds of UTI Mutual Fund, providing portfolio

management services (“PMS”) to institutional clients and high net worth individuals (“HNIs”), and retirement

funds, offshore funds and alternative investment funds.

Chairman’s Message:

Dear Shareholders,

The year 2019-20 has been an exceptional year and the events that unfolded towards the end of the year

was unprecedented in many ways. We learnt new ways of working and started valuing those aspects of life, about

which we perhaps did not give much thought earlier. These events brought in challenges as well as opportunities.

At UTI, we believe in adapting to situations to improving our processes, productivity and investor servicing,

without losing sight of our long term goals. Throughout history, as the first mutual fund in the country, UTI has

strived to be with its investors & stakeholders and we are with you even in these times.

The year 2019-20:

While the circumstances prevailing at the financial year end were not what we would have liked it to be,

it was also satisfying for us that we were able to take many progressive initiatives during the year. We closed our

year 2019-20 with an Average AUM of Rs.1515 billion in our domestic mutual fund business and a total group

AUM of Rs.9798 billion. Our domestic mutual fund market share stood at 5.6% at the year end. Your company

earned a standalone Profit after Tax (PAT) of Rs.3.09 billion and a consolidated PAT of Rs.2.71 billion.

During the year, new mandates were received from Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), The

Coal Mines Provident Fund Organisation (CMPFO) and Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) under

our PMS division. Our group companies, UTI Capital, UTI Retirement Solutions and UTI International continued

to work for growing their business and enhancing visibility.

Driving growth consistently:

We believe that, notwithstanding the external situations, we are appropriately positioned to remain

competitive in the market, reach out to new geographies and further consolidate our position in B-30 centres.

I am happy to inform you that your company continues its business operations seamlessly and the collective

contribution of employees along with robust business model played a crucial role in ensuring that our investors

continue to enjoy uninterrupted services during the pandemic and lock down period.

Early on, your company started initiatives for enhancing our reach in distribution. Restructuring of sales

channels, segregation of distributors, automation of the sales force, increased focus on Fintech companies,

increasing the number of SIPs, additional 4500 mutual fund distributors, conducting 535 outreach programmes

covering 20000 participants and increased interaction of Fund Managers with sales team & distributors are some

of the measures that we took during the year. We launched several marketing campaigns, including a pilot project

for Bihar region called Adarsh Bihar, and used social media extensively. The campaign “Power of Three” garnered

sales of around Rs.40 billion.

CEO’s Message:

letter of appointment inter alia outlining his / her role, function, duties and responsibilities.

In a separate meeting of the independent directors, the performance of non-independent directors, the performance of board

as a whole and performance of executive director was evaluated, taking into account the views of non-executive directors.

51. Events after reporting date

The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, assessed the potential impact of the COVID-19 global

pandemic on the Company and the Group. The coronavirus outbreak is a new emerging risk to the global economy. The Group’s

business may be impacted by falling revenues as a result of decreases in the NAVs of the underlying funds on which the management

fees for the Group are calculated. Business continuity plans have been invoked to help ensure the safety and well-being of staff

thereby retaining the ability to maintain business operations following lockdowns in both India and Mauritius. These actions help

to ensure business resilience. The situation is changing so rapidly that the full impact cannot yet be understood, but the Group will

continue to monitor the situation closely.

The directors consider that the Group have adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable

future and therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

Notes to consolidated accounts annexed to and forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year

ended 31 March, 2020::
