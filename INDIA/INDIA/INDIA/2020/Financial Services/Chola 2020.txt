Message From The Chairman

08

Message From The: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

It is during the times of uncertainty and challenges,

that robust businesses with strong underlying

fundamentals stand out from the rest. The ﬁnancial

year 2019-20 has been one such challenging year

for the NBFC industry in India and its allied sectors

including automotive, real estate and MSMEs. The

year saw a signiﬁcant decline in the automotive

sales across product categories, especially in

commercial vehicles. The real estate sector and

MSMEs were signiﬁcantly aﬀected towards the

latter half of the year due to a liquidity crunch and

muted demand. The COVID-19 outbreak has

further

extended

the

already

underlying

challenges.

Industry review

Owing to multiple headwinds, commercial vehicle

industry closed the year FY 20 with a 29%

de-growth. Despite the expectation of an

improvement in rural demand due to a good Rabi

crop, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to

restricted movement of goods and lesser demand

in the Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV) segment.

Used commercial vehicle sales however, is less

likely to be impacted in FY 21 considering lower

market prices, BS VI transitioning an extended time

gap in regularization of the new vehicle supply

chain. Domestic Car and Utility vehicle industry

witnessed two consecutive years of decline for the

ﬁrst time in a decade, with a de-growth of 18% in

FY 20. Tractor industry had a de-growth of 10% in

FY 20 due to weak farm sentiments in the ﬁrst half

of the year, together with erratic rainfall and the

onslaught of COVID-19 during March 2020. A faster

recovery of the rural sector with a good Rabi

harvest, normal monsoon, government support

through farm subsidies and direct income support

to farmers is expected to aid tractor demand in

FY 21. Government’s thrust towards doubling farm

income is also expected to drive long term growth
