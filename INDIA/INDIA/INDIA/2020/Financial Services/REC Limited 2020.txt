Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to present to you the 51st Annual Report of your Company. With the COVID-19 pandemic still impacting our lives,

these are turbulent times for our businesses and economies. However, adversity caused by the pandemic has also revealed to

us new ways of survival and doing business. Despite the challenging times, REC stands tall as a leading financial & development

institution of the country, delivering strong performance on all counts while cautiously managing its risks. The Company has also

made its humble contribution towards managing the pandemic, by arranging food & shelter for migrant workers, distribution of

essentials for communities and medical gear for frontline workers, besides contribution to the PM CARES Fund.

Global economic conditions had been witnessing a gradual decline since the last two years. The world economy, which grew at

4% in 2017, continued to soften to a growth of 3.6% in 2018 and 2.9% in 2019. With the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020, one

country after the other was hit with high human costs and a resultant public health crisis. At the same time, economic activity was

adversely impacted at an unprecedented level. China, which happened to be the epicentre of the pandemic, saw a sharp decline in

its production activities. This had a cascading effect on global supply chains, prolonging the halt in manufacturing activities & cross

border trade. Simultaneously, asset prices, commodity prices and equity markets also plummeted. Softening oil prices provided

some relief, but uncertainty in the economic outlook continues.

Governments of advanced economies as well as developing economies were swift in providing fiscal response to market disruptions,

alongwith support to heavily-impacted sectors and workers. Broad-based fiscal stimulus has prevented a further decline in the

business sentiment and a bigger downturn.

India was also impacted by the pandemic, but the adverse effects have been contained well by swift and strong measures taken by

the Government. The Indian economy, which had a strong performance in the recent decades, grew at 4.2% in fiscal 2019-20 as the

last quarter was hit by COVID-19 and nationwide lockdown. The IMF has projected a contraction in the Indian economy in 2020, due

to continuing challenges posed by the pandemic. However, the economy is expected to bounce back in the next year.

The Hon’ble Prime Minister has given us the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, of making India a self-reliant nation. A huge fiscal package

has been provided alongwith policy push, in order to minimize the adverse economic impact of the pandemic. RBI has cut down the

repo rate to a 15-year-low of 4% and reverse repo rate to 3.35%, besides allowing banks, NBFCs and housing finance companies

to stall EMIs and extend moratorium up to six months.

The new norms of ‘social distancing’ and ‘work-from-home’ brought into fore by COVID-19, have put an increased focus on the

centrality of electricity in powering our current and future societies. Having said that, power sector is not immune to the adverse

effects of the pandemic and decreased economic activity. The long-term impact would become apparent only with passage of time.

On the whole, sustained economic growth is necessary to maintain the demand for power and better energy systems. In the coming

years, we would see enhanced power generation through renewable sources, as also new technologies like smart grids, geospatial

data systems and widespread e-Mobility, which should form basis of our energy planning to be done today.

POWER SECTOR SCENARIO

The power sector in the country witnessed limited disruption due to COVID-19, as power comes under essential services category.

However, demand for power fell steeply on account of drop in the commercial and industrial activity. Power distribution was impacted

the most, with fall in revenue collections affecting the financial and liquidity position of players. As the lockdown eased out, power

demand started to recover. Further, the Government announced liquidity infusion to the power sector, granting relief from the sudden

cash crunch.:

Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) Norms (including standard asset provisioning) issued by RBI is appropriated to “Impairment

Reserve”. Refer Note 27.9.:

instructions contained in RBI Circular CC No.168 dated 12th February 2010. As an IFC, the total permissible exposure for

lending in the private sector is 25% of owned funds in case of single borrower and 40% in case of a single group of borrowers

and exposure for lending and investing taken together can be upto 30% and 50% of owned funds, respectively.
