Dear Shareholders,

At the outset, I hope you and your family are taking due care,

and are safe during these testing times. India has been

through one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world.

The country is, however, opening up in a calibrated manner

since May. IndusInd Bank as an organisation responded

exceedingly well amidst the crisis, with branches, contact

centres, ATMs remaining fully operational, and catering to

the fnancial needs of our customers. We continue to monitor

the situation, and shall take all possible steps to safeguard

the valued interests of our customers and our employees. I

am confdent that over the next few quarters, India will

develop a “new normal” and as a Bank, we will drive value by

being responsive to our stakeholders through convenient

and simple banking.

It’s been over 100 days since I took on my new role as the MD

and CEO of IndusInd Bank, and consider myself extremely

privileged to have been a part of this institution since 2008.

The Bank has been on a journey of growth with proftability

and today, we have truly transformed into a universal bank,

respected and looked up to for our innovative, sophisticated

and robust customer solutions on our "best-in-class" banking

platforms. In my 12 years of service with IndusInd Bank, I am

proud of what we have achieved as an organisation, always

staying frmly committed to the strong values and the rich

legacy that we have. A legacy that spans over 25 years of

commitment to our customers. As a part of the overarching

strategy of the Bank, the management team and I will focus

on “sustainability” as a theme to drive long-term stakeholder

value.

The Bank successfully completed the merger with Bharat

Financial Inclusion Limited (BFIL) on July 4, 2019, following all

the requisite approvals. The merger serves two very

important criteria (1) being a change agent for fnancial

inclusion as BFIL has nearly 8 million women customers

mainly in rural villages where we help create livelihoods by

fnancing their “Kirana” stores, providing livestock fnancing

and cottage industry loans to name a few and (2) delivering

growth and proftability to the Bank by providing wider

banking services like savings and recurring deposits,

payments, basic consumer durable loans to hitherto

unbanked or under-banked persons.

As you are aware, in the recent past, the fnancial markets

have witnessed extreme volatility owing to the COVID-19

outbreak and challenging fnancial markets. Stock prices

turned volatile and this fuelled unwarranted market

speculation including the share price of your Bank. This

period may have been a cause of concern to you. I would like

to assure you that IndusInd Bank remains fnancially strong,

well-capitalised and liquid. To demonstrate our fnancial

soundness, you will be aware that the Bank sought and

obtained approval from shareholders as recently as August

25, 2020 to raise `3,288 crores from marque investors and

the Bank’s Promoter through preferential issuances of

equity shares.

Next, I would like to come to the fnancial highlights for the

year:

• FY20 witnessed a healthy growth in top line with revenues

up 31% and operating proft up by 34%.

• Net interest income grew 36% and fees 24%. NIM

improved a good 34 bps from 3.80% to 4.14%.

• The Bank maintained liquidity as measured by Liquidity

Coverage Ratio in the 110% - 120% range, well in excess of

minimum regulatory requirements. We have bolstered our

liquidity position even further in the current fnancial

year FY21.

• We slowed our balance sheet growth due to COVID-19

towards the end of the fnancial year resulting in 11% YoY

loan growth.

• Our Retail business grew faster with the Retail to Corporate

mix at the year-end being 56%:44%.

• Our provisions during the year were higher than our usual

run-rate as we increased our provision coverage ratio (PCR):

letter and in spirit. The strong compliance culture is

ensured through detailed policies and guidelines, strong

procedures, mechanism of regular reviews, monitoring and

testing, regular messages from the Top Management on the

importance of compliance and zero-tolerance towards

non-compliance, and compliance awareness programmes.

The Bank has a robust Compliance Policy, charting out the

compliance philosophy of the Bank and the roles and

responsibilities of the Compliance function. The Compliance

function plays a vital role in ensuring that the overall business

of the Bank is conducted within the ambit of rules,

regulations, laws and internal guidelines. The function assists

the Board and Top Management in efciently managing the

compliance risk.

The Compliance function works as a nodal link between the

Bank and the regulatory authorities, i.e., RBI, SEBI, DFS, UIDAI,

IBA, IRDA, PFRDA, etc., and provides guidance to all verticals

in the Bank on applicable regulatory framework, i.e.,

regulatory guidelines, statutes and advisory issued by the

regulatory authorities. The Compliance function enjoys

complete independence, and identifes, records and assesses

compliance risks associated with the Bank’s operations,

including

new

products

and

practices,

proposed

establishment of new types of business, and material

changes in the products and businesses.

The Bank has adopted three lines of defence: (a) approach

with operations and business controls as frst line of defence;

(b)

internal

governance

including

Compliance

Risk

Management as the second line; and (c) Internal Audit being

the third line of defence to ensure a strong compliance

culture at all levels.

The Vigilance Department has been functional in the Bank

since October 2008, and its objective is to enhance the level

of managerial and operational efciency and efectiveness.

The aim is to prevent, detect and analyse corruption /

wrongdoing / misdemeanours on the part of the

employees and follow it up by deterrent / preventive action

to ensure highest standards of integrity, governance and

ethical practices.

The Whistle Blower Policy was adopted by the Bank in 2009

so as to provide a channel to various stakeholders, viz.,

employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, etc., to bring

to the notice of the Bank any issue involving compromise /

violation of ethical norms, legal or regulatory provisions, etc.,

without any fear of reprisal, retaliation, discrimination or

harassment of any kind.

The Bank’s Vigilance Manual / Whistle Blower Policy and

practices are in complete synchrony with all statutory and

regulatory guidelines on Vigil Mechanism to ensure a

compliant, fraud-free and ethical work environment.
