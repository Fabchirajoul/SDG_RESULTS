DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

Greetings and best wishes to all of you as we step into a glorious

4th decade of operations in FY2020 with determination and

focus. We have defined our goals with the strong pace of our

strategic delivery and improved performance.

Our progress in the past three decades has been indeed

phenomenal. We have grown bigger and better every single year

– from 8 offices in 1989 to 282 offices now; from 8 employees

to 2,392 employees; from a portfolio of ` 25 crore to ` 2.10 lakh

crore; from a disbursement of ` 11 crore to ` 55,000 crore; from

an interest income of ` 47 lakhs to ` 17,362 crore; from a net

profit of ` 57,000 to ` 2,431 crore. Today, we can proudly say

that we have touched the lives of over 27.7 lakh people, are

currently servicing about 12 lakh individuals, and have always

been the front-runner in ensuring affordable access to housing

finance and help realise people’s dream of owning a house.

Even after 30 years, we are as passionate as ever in our mission

to help millions of individuals on their path to owning a home.

We continue to be one of the largest players growing in size,

stature and profitability in the housing finance industry. With a

strong business foundation, an extensive distribution network

and with proven industry expertise, we are enormously trusted

as a respected financial services company. Our law-compliant,

transparent and professional board of eminent personalities of

experience and excellence in different fields provides us with

the right guidance.

ImPACT OF COvID-19

India’s real estate sector, which was just emerging out of the

past market turbulence, policy reforms and liquidity crisis,

suffered a setback with the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused

income uncertainty and poor consumer sentiments. The

outbreak of the pandemic and labour unavailability dampened

real estate activity, caused construction delays and reduced

demand, affected liquidity, increased stress in the housing

finance sector and dented consumer sentiments even further.

Income disruption caused by the economic slowdown and the

pandemic-imposed lockdown, had an unfavourable impact on

the industry.

However, things are not all bleak – the government’s fiscal

stimulus measures to maintain liquidity and economic continuity

helped. As part of the relief package, the Reserve Bank of

India announced a ` 10,000 crore funding to NHB to provide

refinance to housing finance companies. The Ministry of

Housing also extended credit-linked subsidy scheme for the

middle-income group by one year – from April 2020 to March

2021. RBI allowed a moratorium of 3 months to all term loans,

reduced the cash reserve ratio and cut down repo and reverse

repo rates.

At LIC Housing Finance, we not only extended the moratorium

facility, but also passed on the benefits of reduced interest

rates to all the eligible borrowers. The silver lining in the cloud is

that the lockdown also provided some disguised opportunities

such as inclination of first-time buyers to go for own home and

demand for bigger flats in view of social distancing norms.

OuR 4-R STRATEgy

The pandemic has a major impact on the way we live and work.

In the current turbulent and unprecedented times, businesses

of all sizes and industries need to get adjusted to disruption and

change. What stood us in good stead was our resilience and

zeal to meet a challenge head-on and ride it out with strength

and stability. We understand that many things will never be the

same again. To pave our way for a better and sustainable future:

mESSAgE FROm mAnAgIng DIRECTOR & CEO

Despite the adverse situation, we are comfortably

placed in terms of liquidity. Despite the pandemic

situation, we have been successful in raising

resources at a low cost through nCDs, bank loans, CPs

and public deposits – which is a strong testament to

the unwavering faith of our lenders and investors.: DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

It gives me pleasure to present to you the Annual Report of a

landmark year.

Through our 30-year journey, we have run the business ably

and efficiently using the three key assets of our deep domain

knowledge, expanding network and a service mindset, and have

successfully delivered sustainable business and created long-

term value. Today, we are ranked amongst the top performing

players in the industry with a strong business foundation,

extensive distribution network, proven industry expertise,

superior fundamentals and top rating, with strong value systems

and beliefs.

As we step into the 4th decade, we continue our journey

with a robust business model that allows us to deliver

long-term value. Our robust portfolio and better asset

quality clearly stands out in the industry. During our

remarkable journey, we successfully crafted the story of

growth established with processes and success defined in

results – a rising loan book, maintaining profitability, and

asset quality.

I am happy to have attained a milestone year and blessed

to have led this superlative team of incredible talent and

dedication. We continue to serve our aspirational buyers – who

are mostly buying a house for the first time, probably, the only

time during their lifetime.

ImPACT OF COvID

We write to you amidst an unprecedented and critical

situation. The outbreak of COVID-19, a catastrophe in itself,

affected lives with each passing day. Its impact is being felt

by all the sectors, including real estate and housing finance.

The outbreak of the pandemic drastically altered the overall

economic outlook and disrupted the financial sector. The

stimulus packages offered by the government in the wake

of the pandemic are directed towards improving private

consumption, demand generation and investment to spur

GDP growth.

The real estate sector, which was already reeling under a liquidity

crunch and slowing economic growth, has been hit hard as

the extended lockdown suppressed buyer interest and muted

sales. Housing sales in the top 8 cities fell to its decade low, new

launches declined and the pricing environment weakened. The

structural reforms, liquidity schemes and fiscal support provided

by the Reserve Bank of India and the government are expected

to provide relief to stressed asset classes.

At LICHFL, we faced reduced demand for housing loans and

increase in delinquencies due to an adverse change in the credit

habits of borrowers. Our cash flows were impacted as servicing of

debt continued. It also led to a slowdown in home loan disbursals

as individuals deferred home purchases till the time they could

perceive stability in their income levels and a resumption in

business activities.

bATTLIng THE CRISIS

As we prepared to battle the challenging times, adaptability has

been the core competency of our workforce. We made proactive

adjustments to our business plan and exhibited readiness in an

improved situation. Our immediate concern was to safeguard

lives, and the foremost priority was to take care of our employees

and the communities we live in. We facilitated Work from

Home and encouraged employees to find innovative means,

causing minimum disruption to work and enabling effective

letter and spirit, to ensure safety of our employees

and associates, and placed collaborated efforts to battle

the pandemic.

HFCs bRACIng CHALLEngES

For FY2021, the unexpected crisis posed challenges of the like

we have never witnessed in the past. Due to the pandemic,

every model or process in the operations of a housing finance

company called for recalibration. In the post pandemic scenario,

predictability on important factors such as revenue, profitability

and non-performing assets and asset quality will become

challenging, given that the continuity of data chain has been

affected. With this uncertainty, HFCs have been bracing to run a

tight ship in lending as well as liability management.

OuR PERFORmAnCE

We are happy to share an update on our performance during the

year. In spite of a turbulent year, the Company fared fairly well

on disbursements, portfolio growth, revenues, profit growth.

Revenue from Operations were ` 19,697 crore, as against ` 17,358

crore, a growth of 13%. Profit After Tax stood at ` 2,401.83 crore

compared to ` 2,430.97 crore due to a fall in disbursements.

Our outstanding loan portfolio stood at ` 2,10,578 crore, against

` 1,94,646 crore, reflecting an 8% growth. Individual Loan

Portfolio stood at ` 1,96,340 crore, as against ` 1,81,569 crore,

growing by 8%.

Though we recorded a good year in the initial three quarters,

COVID did have a significant impact on the fourth quarter.

Our disbursement stood at ` 46,936 crore vis-à-vis ` 53,908

crore. Our Customer base in individual home loan segment

crossed over 27 lakh customers. Disbursement was spread

across different regions of India, with good growth emanating

from central and eastern parts of the country. During the year,

performance in the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana continued to

be a strong point, with disbursement exceeding ` 11,200 crore,

up 52% over the previous year. This is more than 25% of total

retail loan disbursement.

We maintained our strong asset quality, with a gross NPA of

2.86% and net NPA of 1.99%, in comparison with 1.54% and 1.08%,

respectively. We continued to remain committed to our “Zero

Tolerance Policy to NPAs”. Net Interest Income, our key measure

of profitability, was ` 4,689 crore, growing by 10%; while Net

Interest Margin was 2.34% against 2.38% in the previous year. The

Loan to Value (LTV) ratio was stringently maintained at 50-60%.

We are pleased to inform you that the Board has recommended a

dividend of 400% at ` 8.00 per equity share. We have been

consistently paying dividends for three decades, demonstrating

our resolve to share profits with our shareholders.

gOOD COnTROL OvER COST OF FunDS

Despite the adverse situation, we are comfortably placed in

terms of liquidity. Despite the pandemic situation, we have been

successful in raising resources at a low cost through NCDs, bank

loans, CPs and public deposits – which is a strong testament

to the unwavering faith of our lenders and investors. There has

been a softening in the cost of funds, owing to the repo rate

reduction by RBI in the recent months. Our cost of funds is one

of the best in the market.

As we prepared to battle the

challenging times, adaptability

has been the core competency

of our workforce. we made

proactive adjustments to our

business plan and exhibited

readiness in an improved

situation. Our immediate

concern was to safeguard lives,

and the foremost priority was to

take care of our employees and

the communities we live in.

Our best-in-class asset quality, with

Managing Director of LIC of India on

1st April, 2019. Prior to his appointment as: Managing

Letter of Credit and Bill Discounting

(4) Grant a moratorium of three months, by default, on

payment of all instalments, Interest on LC/BD/OD/CC

(5) No minimum account balance charges

(6) Over Draft and Cash Credit Facilities.

Since many small businesses serve the common masses of the

nation, they have more opportunities to revive quickly as soon

as the situation gets back to normal.

Also this prevailing situation of lockdown and social distancing

has introduced the concept of ‘Work From Home’. This although

have enhanced the demand for large living places and is

expected to boost the residential real estate demand, however

this situation is expected to adversely affect the demand for

commercial spaces and a lot of space is expected to stay vacant

due to the fall in demand. Also the LRD loan portfolio has to be

reassessed due to the large scale negotiation in the rentals by

the various corporate tenants.

The Company is constantly reassessing the current scenario

and is adopting increased caution while funding projects and

LRD loans and is considering the existing borrowers with

credible repayment track record and cashflows before taking

new exposure on them. More emphasis is being placed on the

security value and manner of valuation in order to ensure that

there is no dilution of security. Although, the actual impact can

only be known after the completion of the moratorium period

on 31st August, 2020, the performance of the borrowers for a

certain period after the completion of moratorium would be

observed, before making subsequent disbursement.

The Company has also laid increased emphasis in strengthening

its recovery mechanism and is having a focused approach to

ensure its existing portfolio is intact. Also, in order to ensure that

the existing retail borrowers are not lured by other financers,

the Company is passing the benefit of the rate cut to the

customer and is allowing rewriting of the existing loans with

nominal fees.

Also the Company has reduced its interest rates multiple times

in order to stay competitive and has reduced its card rate to sub

7% levels. The Company is focusing on sourcing retail loans of

moderate ticket size with large volumes in order to mitigate the

risks and is constantly modifying its product mix. The Company

has launched a product wherein the interest rate being offered

is linked to the CIBIL score.

The funding environment continues to be positive for the

Company and the liquidity position continues to be quiet good.

The borrowing programme had been completed by the end of

February, 2020 and during March, the Company was raising

funds for expected March end disbursement and for funding

disbursement demand of first few weeks of the new financial

year and for servicing the borrowings during the month of April,

2020. However, the demand for the funds remained subdued,

due to the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic by WHO post

11.03.2020 and the subsequent lock down. Thus, by the end of

March, 2020 the Company had healthy liquidity position.

There had been a reduction in the cost of borrowing, during the

FY 2019-2020. The fall in the incremental spread is more than the

fall in cost of funds because of the lower yield, as there had been

a decline in the asset growth due to the lesser disbursements

towards the high yielding portfolio segment such as project

loans etc. owing due to the sluggish market conditions. The

Company is in a suitable liquidity situation and is well placed in

the appropriate ALM buckets as per the NHB regulatory norms.

CASH FLoW STATeMenT

FoR THe peRIod ended MARCH 31, 2020:

of the Company. CODM has identified only one operating

KeY eSTIMATeS And JudGeMenTS:

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity

with Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) requires

the management to make estimates, judgements

and assumptions. These estimates, judgements and

assumptions affect the application of accounting policies

and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date

of the financial statements and the reported amounts

of revenues and expenses during the year. Accounting

estimates could change from period to period. Actual

results could differ from those estimates. Revisions to

accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.

The Management believes that the estimates used in

preparation of the financial statements are prudent

and reasonable. Future results could differ due to these

estimates and the differences between the actual results

and the estimates are recognised in the periods in which

the results are known / materialise.

3.1 determination of expected Credit Loss (“eCL”)

The measurement of impairment losses (ECL) across

all categories of financial assets requires judgement, in

particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of

future cash flows based on Company’s historical experience

and collateral values when determining impairment losses

along with the assessment of a significant increase in

credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of

factors, changes in which can result in different levels of

allowances.

Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting

judgements and estimates include:

Bifurcation of the financial assets into different

portfolios when ECL is assessed on collective basis.

Company’s criteria for assessing if there has been a

significant increase in credit risk.

Development of ECL models, including choice of

inputs / assumptions used.:
