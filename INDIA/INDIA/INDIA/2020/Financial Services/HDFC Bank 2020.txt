Managing Director: Dear Stakeholders,

2020 marks the 26th year of our remarkable journey,

during which we have won multiple accolades.

This would not have been possible without you. So, let

me start by thanking each one of you for the immense

faith and dedication you have shown in co-creating this

great institution.

During the course of a quarter of a century, India and

the world have changed at a breath-taking pace.

And so has our Bank. I’m extremely humbled to be

part of this living legacy and take immense pride at

being given the opportunity to partner with over 1 Lakh

invaluable colleagues who made this possible.

Doing the right thing, always.

Nearly 30 years ago, India opened its markets to the

world. In doing so, it created exciting opportunities

for private sector banks like us. Backed by a strong

parent, we took baby steps and, in 1995, we opened

our first branch in Mumbai at Sandoz House, Worli.

From day one, we were clear about our strategy to

drive growth. Integrity: We would always do what is

right. Prudent: We wouldn’t take short cuts nor cut

corners. Strategic: We wouldn’t take undue risks or

blindly follow trends. By adhering to these stringent

standards, we became the torchbearers of what later

came to be known as corporate governance. And this

is the origin of our five core values: Customer Focus,

Operational Excellence, Product Leadership,

People and Sustainability.

This was also the time when corporate lending

was the order of the day. Naturally, we started out

as a wholesale bank. But then India changed with

liberalisation creating a new class of people with

disposable incomes. And we did too by shifting

our focus to retail banking and now we have an

industry-leading position in almost every aspect of

retail banking including private banking and wealth

management. But being prudent we maintained a

balance between both segments of our business.

This strategy has stood us in good stead. Perhaps not

more so than in 2019-20 when wholesale banking has

helped counter the downturn in certain retail segments

as a result of an overall slowdown in consumption.

Backed by our policy of having our ears to the ground,

understanding consumer sentiments and needs and

responding with agility have helped us to continue to

lead on the wholesale banking side.

Bringing about meaningful change

Our vision has always been to bring about meaningful

change. We did this by adopting technology to

power digital transformation in banking, focusing

on semi-urban and rural areas to drive high growth,

and creating sustainability in far-flung areas across

India. We are pioneers in building a technology-led

Bank and we are one of the first to offer NetBanking

services, 10-sec Personal loan, App Banking and

now WhatsApp Banking. To our corporate customers,

we continue to offer the entire gamut of financial

services such as Payments, Tax Solutions, Government

We are pioneers in building a

technology-led Bank and we are

one of the first to offer NetBanking

services, 10-sec Personal Loan, App

Banking and now WhatsApp Banking.

Aditya Puri, Managing

Managing Director

Business, Trade Finance Services, Cash Management

Solutions and Corporate Cards through our flagship

platforms, besides seamlessly connecting our

customers through APIs and Host-to-Host services.

We are also the first bank to have the digital ability

to sanction a working capital loan to MSMEs across

the table at the customers’ premises based on deep

technology integration and AI-led credit risk modelling.

We expanded our footprint to semi-urban and rural

areas, where we have over 50% of our branches

today. Our unswerving commitment to excellence, and

common sense, made all these possible.

What makes us prouder is the transformation we

have brought in the lives of people excluded from

development. Through our social initiatives under

‘Parivartan’, over 10% of our workforce is dedicated

to social causes, making a tangible impact in people’s

lives. Our Sustainable Livelihood Initiative (SLI), for

instance, entails skilling women at the bottom of

the pyramid and providing livelihood finance to help

them break the cycle of poverty. We firmly believe

that empowering women will lead to empowering

families. Through our Holistic Rural Development

Programme (HRDP), we have touched more than

4 Lakh households across 1,282 villages in 17 states.

We continue to stay focused on effecting impactful

change through various initiatives in irrigation, and soil

HDFC Bank’s stability even in these challenging times.

And we feel happy to quote S&P, “Overall, we believe

HDFC Bank’s individual creditworthiness is significantly

stronger than the average of the Indian Banking Sector,

reflected in its SACP of BBB+.”

So where does that leave us?

Our Best is Yet to Come

What about the future? Let me start by reiterating

where we stand today. We as a bank have:

•

One of the biggest and strongest balance sheets

•

High capital adequacy levels

•

Market leadership in most of the products

that we deal in

•

An excellent reputation for delivering value to all

stakeholders, especially shareholders

•

Technology that offers an omnichannel experience

•

The finest people who have made us what we are

•

A commitment to society that is second to none

All this means, we are very well placed to ride out the

COVID-19 storm. We intend to continue to innovate,

adapt, and disrupt to remain trailblazers. We will

continue to collaborate to bring the power of One Bank

to our customers. We will continue to invest ahead

in technology, computing and artificial intelligence

to provide hyper-personalised offerings/experiences

to our customers to become a Digital First Bank

where every customer interaction at any touchpoint is

intuitive, seamless, contextual and predictive. All these

collectively ensures that we reduce costs and increase

our reach. It is also reflected in the six strategic

priorities that we have focused on in the last three

years and will continue to do so. These are:

•

Reimagining the Branch Channel from a banking

storefront to a financial services marketplace

•

Leveraging Bharat’s growth potential based on our

Semi-Urban and Rural footprint

We are well positioned with a strong

balance sheet and healthy liquidity.

Our robust liability franchise continues

to be the bedrock on which we will

build our future

We intend to continue to innovate,

adapt, and disrupt to remain

trailblazers. We will continue to

collaborate to bring the power of One

Bank to our customers.

and water conservation, helping build healthcare and

hygiene infrastructure.

I’m also personally proud of our Blood Donation Drive,

which entered the Guinness World Records, through

which we have cumulatively collected over 1.4 Million

units of blood helping save lives.

Riding the Storm

We are living in unprecedented times with COVID-19

claiming lakhs of lives globally including India, and

destroying millions of livelihoods due to extended

lockdowns. My heart goes out to the families of all

those who have lost their lives. Let me also, on behalf

of HDFC Bank, salute our healthcare workers on the

frontline, who have risked and sometimes lost their

lives in this battle against a raging pandemic. Let us,

however, remember that the darkest hour is always just

before the dawn, and that dawn is not far away. Be it

in riding out the health crisis or recovering from the

financial losses that many have suffered, faith and hope

are our biggest allies. But let us also accept that life

has perhaps changed forever. During this period, we

invoked our Business Continuity Plan (BCP), which has

helped us to continue functioning in the ‘new normal’.

We learnt several new things along the way that will

help us improve our stakeholders’ lives. This includes

being efficient while working from home and equipping

ourselves to prepare for the tomorrow through

e-learning programmes and leveraging this opportunity

to further the digital agenda of the Bank.

HDFC Bank has always been strong, growing

consistently through multiple economic cycles.

We have capitalised on opportunities without giving in

to greed. We are well positioned with a strong balance

sheet and healthy liquidity. Our robust liability franchise

continues to be the bedrock on which we will build

our future. In April 2020, global ratings agency S&P

reaffirmed its international rating for HDFC Bank at

BBB-/A3 with a Stable outlook, giving credence to

•

A Payments business with a differentiated

business model that leverages the

Bank’s offerings

•

Digital 2.0 to transform customer journeys into

omnichannel customer experiences

•

Virtual Relationship Management where

technology comes alive with a human touch

•

Our subsidiaries that continue to focus on the

segments they operate in

And backed by a key intangible asset that is not

found in our balance sheet but helps build it:

Integrity! Even after 25 years, we have not changed

our fundamentals where Integrity remains our

biggest asset.

And all of this would not have been possible without

the trust our customers have in us, driving us to

deliver what we have over the years. With that

trust in place, I reiterate that the best of our Bank

is yet to come!

Integrated Report

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2019-20

Senior management team:

Dear Stakeholders,

Your Directors take great pleasure in presenting the 26th Annual

Report on the business and operations of your Bank, together

with the audited accounts for the year ended March 31, 2020.

FY 2019-20 was one of the most challenging years for the Indian

economy, which faced several headwinds from a slowdown in

domestic and global growth, and geopolitical uncertainties.

This was exacerbated by the outbreak of the COVID 19

pandemic in the second part of the fourth quarter. Faced with

a crisis with no parallels in recent history, most governments

across the world including in India prioritised life over anything

else and imposed a lockdown to break the chain of transmission.

Needless to say, the ‘Great Lockdown’ came with an economic

price as well, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)

forecasting the “worst economic downturn” globally since the

Great Depression in the 1930s.

To minimise the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak

and revive the economy, governments and central banks

across the world announced a host of fiscal and monetary

policy measures. The Indian government rolled out a

` 1.7 lakh crore interim relief package primarily directed towards

daily wage earners and farm labourers. The finance ministry

also waived late fee, interest and penalties on GST returns for

three months and eased various statutory filing deadlines to

provide regulatory relief to businesses. The RBI announced an

emergency cut in policy rates: by 115 basis points in the repo

rate and 130 basis points in the reverse repo rate. The Central

Bank also announced a three-month moratorium on repayments

of term loans and then extended it by another three months.

The Union Government has also announced a stimulus

package of 20 lakh crore with a focus on the MSME and NBFC

sectors. (Please refer to the Macroeconomic and Industry

Developments section on pages 89-90 for details).

In this uncertain environment, your Bank continued on its growth

path by conducting its business responsibly and reinforcing its

commitment to the environment and community at large.

1)

Financial Performance

Your Bank recorded an improvement in majority of its

key financial parameters, largely due to its prudent

credit evaluation of targeted customers and diversified

loan book across customer segments, products, and

sectors. Managing risk-return decisions with discipline

also contributed to the Bank’s performance. Net Profit at

` 26,257.3 crore went up by 24.6 per cent. Net Interest

Income at ` 56,186.3 crore rose 16.5 per cent. Net Interest

Margin remained stable 4.3 per cent. Gross Non-Performing

Assets (NPAs) at 1.26 per cent was among the lowest in

the industry.

2)

Parivartan

Your Bank continued to transform lives through its

umbrella CSR brand, Parivartan which denotes change.

The Bank believes that businesses can only prosper if

the communities in which they operate prosper as well.

This belief has inspired its social initiatives which have

potentially made a difference to the lives of over 7.8 crore

people, predominantly in rural India. Driving this change

is the Sustainable Livelihood Initiative (SLI) team, which

employs about 10 per cent of the Bank’s workforce and

works exclusively on improving livelihood opportunities.

The

‘Teaching-The-Teacher’

initiative

has

impacted

over 2 crore students. The Holistic Rural Development

Programme has touched another 16 lakh people across

more than 1,200 villages. Having an umbrella brand

enables the Bank to lend a sharper focus to these efforts.

Your Directors are also happy to report that your Bank met

the mandatory CSR expenditure through a spend of ` 535

crore. The Bank contributed ` 70 crore towards Prime

Minister’s CARES Fund to support the government’s fight

against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Summary

Although

the

economy

and

HDFC

Bank

are

facing

immediate-term challenges from the halt in economic activities

due to the lockdown, the market in the post-pandemic

recovery period presents tremendous opportunities, given the

under-penetration of banking services in the country. Your Bank

is well positioned to capitalise on those opportunities, given the

strength of its major franchises. Your Bank is also poised to

make a greater contribution to bridge the urban-rural divide – be

it through its business or social initiatives. This, of course, will not

be possible without the contribution of the ever growing family

of over two lakh employees (including that of the subsidiaries)

across the country, who remain at the forefront of taking your

Bank forward every day. Your Directors would like to especially

thank those who went well beyond their call of duty during the

Covid-19 pandemic to keep your Bank functioning.

Mission and Strategic Focus

Your Bank’s mission is to be a ‘World-Class Indian Bank’.

Its business philosophy is based on five core values: Customer

Focus, Operational Excellence, Product Leadership, People and

Sustainability. Sustainability should be viewed in unison with

Environmental, Social and Governance performance. As a part

of this, HDFC Bank through its umbrella CSR brand Parivartan

seeks to bring about change in the lives of communities mainly

in rural India.

During the year under review, the business objective was to

continue building sound customer franchises across distinct

businesses to achieve healthy growth in profitability consistent

with your Bank’s risk appetite.

In line with the above objective, the Bank aims to take

digitalisation to the next level to:

•

Deliver

superior

experience

and

greater

convenience to customers

•

Increase market share in India’s growing banking and

financial services industry

•

Expand geographical reach

•

Cross-sell the broad financial product portfolio

•

Sustain strong asset quality through disciplined credit

risk management

•

Maintain low cost of funds

Your Bank remains committed to the highest levels of ethical

standards, professional integrity, corporate governance, and

regulatory compliance, which is articulated in its Code of

Conduct. Every employee affirms to abide by the Code annually.

Dividend

During FY 2019-20, the Bank has paid special interim dividend of ` 2.50 per equity shares (post split), to commemorate 25 years of

the Bank’s operation. In light of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Circular dated April 17, 2020, all banks were directed not to make

dividend pay-outs pertaining to the financial year ended March 31, 2020 until further instructions from RBI, with a view that banks

must conserve capital in an environment of heightened uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the

Bank has not proposed any final dividend for the year ended March 31, 2020.

In general, your Bank’s dividend policy, among other things, balances the objectives of rewarding shareholders and retaining capital

to fund future growth. It has a consistent track record of dividend distribution, with the Dividend Pay-out Ratio ranging between

20 per cent and 25 per cent, which the Board endeavours to maintain.

The dividend policy of your Bank is available on your Bank’s website:

https://v1.hdfcbank.com/htdocs/common/pdf/corporate/Dividend-Distribution-Policy.pdf:

Managing Director.

The Compliance function independently tracks, reviews

and ensures compliance with regulatory guidelines and

promotes a compliance culture in the Bank.

Your Bank has a comprehensive Know Your Customer,

Anti

Money

Laundering

(AML)

and

Combating

Financing of Terrorism (CFT) policy (based on the

RBI guidelines/provisions of the Prevention of Money

Laundering Act, 2002) incorporating the key elements

of Customer Acceptance Policy, Customer Identification

Procedures, Risk Management and Monitoring of

Transactions. The policy is subjected to an annual review

and is duly approved by the Board.

The Bank has taken significant measures in developing and

enhancing an effective and sustainable KYC AML and CFT

Compliance Programme. The adherence to the guidelines

prescribed in the policy is monitored by your Bank at

various stages of the customer lifecycle. Your Bank has

robust controls in place to ensure adherence to the KYC

guidelines at the time of account opening.

The Bank also has a continuous review process in the form

of transaction monitoring including a dedicated AML CFT

monitoring team, which carries out transaction reviews

for identification of suspicious patterns/trends that helps

your Bank to further carry out enhanced due diligence and

appropriate actions thereafter. The status of adherence to

the KYC, AML and CFT guidelines is also placed before

the Audit Committee of the Board for their review at

quarterly intervals.

The Audit team and the Compliance team undergo regular

training both in-house and external to equip them with the

necessary knowhow and expertise to carry out the function.

The Audit Committee of the Board reviews the effectiveness

of controls, compliance with regulatory guidelines as also

the performance of the Audit and Compliance functions in

your Bank and provides direction, wherever deemed fit.

Your Bank has always adhered to the highest standards of

compliance and has put in place appropriate controls and

risk measurement and risk management tools to ensure a

robust compliance and governance structure.

IV.

Responsible Financing

Your Bank is committed to Responsible Financing and

refrains from funding projects that have an adverse impact

on Environment, Health and Safety (EHS). EHS is an

integral part of the Bank’s overall credit risk assessment and

monitoring process. Every project funded has to pass the

Bank’s muster in terms of the EHS risk it entails, potential

impact and mitigation measures in place or proposed.

The key aspects of the assessment process are:

For all loans exceeding ` 10 crore in amount and five

years in tenure, borrowers have to submit a declaration of

compliance with EHS norms.

In select large-ticket projects, your Bank appoints a Lender’s

Independent Engineer (LIE) who conducts due diligence

across several parameters including EHS. The findings of

the LIE’s assessment report are then discussed with the

client to ensure compliance.

105

Financial Statements and Statutory Reports

Integrated Report

Directors’ Report

The LIE regularly monitors such projects during the

construction period through site visits and reports

progress which includes status of approvals and relief and

rehabilitation measures undertaken. Your Bank officials

also conduct independent site inspections from time

to time to ensure that the project is progressing to the

Bank’s satisfaction.

After the project becomes operational, the borrower has

to submit an annual declaration of compliance with various

national laws including those related to EHS. This is also

followed up by onsite visits of bank executives.

Your Bank deals with the client primarily through its

Relationship Manager (RM). The RM has to report

compliance with EHS norms in the Credit Assessment

Memorandum (CAM) both at the time of initial sanction

and during the annual review process. Such certification is

based on information/disclosures provided by the borrower

at the time of initial appraisal and during periodic review of

the facilities.

The RM records outstanding EHS issues if any and follows

them up with the client for prompt resolution. The Bank

levies default interest in case of deviations and, thus,

ensures compliance with the agreed EHS norms. If there

are significant deviations that could affect the viability of the

project, your Bank reserves the right to either reduce its

exposure or recall the loan.

Performance of Subsidiary Companies

Your Bank has two subsidiaries, HDB Financial Services Limited

(HDBFSL) and HDFC Securities Limited (HSL). HDBFSL is a

leading NBFC that caters primarily to segments not covered by

the Bank while HSL is among India’s largest retail broking firms.

The financial results of the subsidiaries are prepared in accordance

with notified Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind-AS’) with effect

from April 1, 2018 (April 1, 2017 being the transition date).

Accordingly, the financial results for the comparative reporting

period have also been prepared in accordance therewith.

Independent Auditor’s Report

To the Members of HDFC Bank Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the standalone financial statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the Bank”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at

March 31, 2020, the Profit and Loss Account, Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial

statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial

statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in

the manner so required for Banking Companies and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally

accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2020 and its profit and its cash flows for the year ended on that

date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone

Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the

Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“the ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the

standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical

responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained

is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to Note 43 to the standalone financial statements, which describes that the extent to which the COVID-19

Pandemic will impact the Bank’s standalone financial statements will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial

statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a

whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.:

for credit cards are recognised on a straight-line

basis over the period of contract. Other fees and

commission income are recognised when due, where

the Bank is reasonably certain of ultimate collection.

10

Employee benefits

Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS):

The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’)

provides for the grant of options to acquire equity

shares of the Bank to its employees and whole time

directors. The options granted to employees vest in

a graded manner and these may be exercised by the

employees within a specified period.

The Bank follows the intrinsic value method to account

for its stock-based employee compensation plans.

Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any,

of the market price of the underlying stock over the

exercise price as determined under the option plan.

The market price is the closing price on the stock

exchange where there is highest trading volume on

the working day immediately preceding the date of

grant. Compensation cost, if any is amortised over

the vesting period.

Gratuity:

The Bank has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined

benefit retirement plan covering all eligible employees.

The plan benefit vests upon completion of five years

of service and is in the form of lump sum payment to

employees on resignation, retirement, death while in

employment or on termination of employment of an

amount equivalent to 15 days’ basic salary payable

for each completed year of service without upper

limit. The Bank makes contributions to recognized

Trusts administered by trustees and whose funds

are managed by insurance companies, of amounts

notified by the said insurance companies. In respect

of erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) employees, the

Bank makes contribution to a fund set up by eLKB

and administered by the Board of Trustees.

The defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by

an independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet

date using the projected unit credit method as per

the requirement of AS-15, Employee Benefits,

to determine the present value of the defined

benefit obligation and the related service costs.

The actuarial calculations entails assumptions about

demographics, early retirement, salary increases and

interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in

the Profit and Loss Account.

Superannuation:

The Bank has a Superannuation Plan under which

employees of the Bank, above a prescribed grade,

are entitled to receive retirement benefits either

under a cash-out option through salary or under a

defined contribution plan. For those opting for a

defined contribution plan, the Bank contributes a sum

equivalent to 13% of the employee’s eligible annual

basic salary (15% for the whole time directors and for

certain eligible employees of the erstwhile Centurion

Bank of Punjab (eCBoP) staff) to Trust administered by

trustees and whose funds are managed by insurance

companies. The Bank has no liability towards future

superannuation fund benefits other than its annual

contribution, and recognises such contributions as

an expense in the year incurred.

Provident fund:

The Bank is covered under the Employees Provident

Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and

accordingly all employees of the Bank are entitled

to receive benefits under the provident fund. The

Bank contributes an amount, on a monthly basis,

at a determined rate (currently 12% of employee’s

basic salary). Of this, the Bank contributes an amount

equal to 8.33% of employee’s basic salary up to a

maximum salary level of ` 15,000/- per month, to

the Pension Scheme administered by the Regional

Provident Fund Office. The balance amount of the

12% employer’s share is contributed to an exempted

Trust set up by the Bank and administered by a

Board of Trustees. In respect of eCBoP employees,

employer’s and employee’s share of contribution to

Provident Fund till March 2009, was administered

by the Regional Provident Fund Office and from

April 2009 onwards, the same is transferred to the

exempted Trust set up by the Bank and administered

by the Board of Trustees. In respect of eLKB

employees, the Bank contributes to a Trust set up by

eLKB and administered by a Board of Trustees. The

171

Financial Statements and Statutory Reports

Integrated Report

Schedules to the Financial Statements

Bank recognises such contributions as an expense

in the year in which it is incurred. Interest payable

to the members of the trust shall not be lower than

the statutory rate of interest declared by the Central

Government under the Employees Provident Funds

and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall,

if any, shall be made good by the Bank.

The

guidance

note

on

implementing

AS-15,

Employee Benefits, states that benefits involving

employer established provident funds, which require

interest shortfalls to be provided, are to be considered

as defined benefit plans. Actuarial valuation of this

Provident Fund interest shortfall is done as per the

guidance note issued in this respect by The Institute

of Actuaries of India (IAI) and provision towards this

liability is made.

The

overseas

branches

of

the

Bank

make

contribution to the respective applicable government

social security scheme calculated as a percentage of

the employees’ salaries. The Bank’s obligations are

limited to these contributions, which are expensed

when due, as such contribution is in the nature of

defined contribution.

Leave encashment / Compensated absences:

The Bank does not have a policy of encashing

unavailed leave for its employees, except for certain

eLKB employees under Indian Banks’ Association

(IBA) structure. The Bank provides for leave

encashment / compensated absences based on

an independent actuarial valuation at the Balance

Sheet date, which includes assumptions about

demographics, early retirement, salary increases,

interest rates and leave utilisation.

Pension:

In respect of pension payable to certain eLKB

employees under IBA structure, which is a defined

benefit scheme, the Bank contributes 10% of

basic salary to a pension trust set up by the Bank

and administered by the Board of Trustees and an

additional amount towards the liability shortfall based

on an independent actuarial valuation as at the

Balance Sheet date, which includes assumptions

about

demographics,

early

retirement,

salary

increases and interest rates.

In respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved

to a Cost to Company (CTC) basis compensation

structure and had completed less than 15 years of

service, the contribution which was made until then,

is maintained as a fund and will be converted into

annuity on separation after a lock-in-period of two

years. For this category of employees, liability stands

frozen and no additional provision is required except

for interest as applicable to Provident Fund, which is

provided for.

In respect of certain eLKB employees who moved

to a CTC structure and had completed service of

more than 15 years, pension would be paid on

separation based on salary applicable as on the date

of movement to CTC structure. Provision thereto is

made based on an independent actuarial valuation as

at the Balance Sheet date.

New Pension Scheme (NPS):

In respect of employees who opt for contribution to the

NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the

basic salary of employees to the aforesaid scheme,

a defined contribution plan, which is managed

and administered by pension fund management

companies. The Bank has no liability other than its

contribution, and recognises such contributions as an

expense in the year incurred.

11

Debit and credit cards reward points

The Bank estimates the probable redemption of

debit and credit card reward points and cost per

point using an actuarial method by employing an

independent actuary, which includes assumptions

such as mortality, redemption and spends. Provisions

for liabilities on the outstanding reward points are

made based on an independent actuarial valuation

as at the Balance Sheet date and included in other

liabilities and provisions.

12

Bullion

The Bank imports bullion including precious metal

bars on a consignment basis. The imports are

typically on a back-to-back basis and are priced

to the customer based on the price quoted by the

supplier. The difference between the price recovered

from customers and cost of bullion is accounted for

at the time of sale to the customers and reported as

“Other Income”.

The Bank also deals in bullion on a borrowing and

lending basis and the interest thereon is accounted

as interest expense / income respectively.

13

Lease accounting

Lease payments including cost escalation for assets

taken on operating lease are recognised in the Profit

and Loss Account over the lease term on a straight-

line basis in accordance with the AS-19, Leases.

14

Income tax

Income tax expense comprises current tax provision

(i.e. the amount of tax for the period determined

in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961,

the rules framed thereunder and considering the

Employee Stock Option Plan (‘ESOP’s)

The Bank considers ESOPs as a vehicle to create a balance between short term rewards and long term sustainable

value creation. ESOPs play a key role in the attraction and retention of key talent. The Bank grants equity share

options to its Whole Time Directors and other employees above a certain grade. All plans for grant of options

are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and are approved by

the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post approval by the NRC.

The grant of options is reviewed and approved by the NRC. The NRC grants options after considering parameters

such as the incumbent’s grade and performance rating, and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate

by the NRC. Equity share options granted to the Whole Time Directors are subject to the approval of the NRC,

the Board and the RBI. With effect from April 1, 2018, the Bank has amended its policy for grant of ESOPs.

Under this policy, ESOPs granted to eligible employees vest over four tranches spread over a period of 48

months. The ESOPs granted subsequent to April 1, 2019 vest no faster than on a pro rata basis. Vesting for all

ESOPs granted subsequent to April 1, 2017 was based on the assessment of performance of the employee at

the time of vesting. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Bank reviewed its policy of conditional vesting:

The specific criteria on the applicability of malus and claw back arrangements are reviewed by the NRC annually.:
