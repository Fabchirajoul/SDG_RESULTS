MEDIUM-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGY

Enhancing Customer Experience and Trust

The Group aims to be amongst the most trusted financial services conglomerates in India and has continuously striven to create an ethos of

trust across all the businesses. To measure trust in all businesses, the Group utilizes the ‘net promoter score’ methodology to measure the

willingness of its customers and employees of the Group to recommend its services. The Group tracks this score on a regular basis and use it

as a basis for understanding the customer delight and loyalty and employee satisfaction levels with the Group.

Further, the Group endeavors to enhance customer experience through the development and delivery of a large array of financial products

and services, using cost-efficient, convenient-to-access, and easy-to-use delivery channels, including various digital and technological initiatives

(such as improved digital experience for the customers through an improved user interface). The Group believes that this strategy will enable

it to build relationships with highly engaged and satisfied customers, which will contribute to its future growth. As a part of this strategy, the

Group has created simplified, technology-driven processes for several products and services (for example, account opening, fixed deposits,

credit cards, personal loans, seamless internet banking, and UPI transactions).

The Group also aims to strengthen its data and analytics capability, leading to improved actionable customer insights. The Group will continue

to introduce additional features across its digital transaction channels which will make banking and other services easier and more convenient.

This will further enhance the customer experience, which the Group believes, will lead to higher cross-selling of products, thereby contributing

to the future growth and profitability.:
