CIN: L65110MH2000PLC128245:

Dear Shareholders,

As we prepare this year’s annual: letter

to shareholders, the world is facing

one of the greatest health threats

humankind has ever seen, one that is

likely to have a profound impact on the

Indian and global economies, and on

all of its citizens. Our thoughts remain

with the communities and individuals,

including healthcare workers and

other

frontline

responders,

most

deeply hit by the COVID-19 crisis.

Throughout our history, we have

prioritised supporting our customers,

communities and employees in such

critical times. This unprecedented

situation is no different, and we

know that we have to play our part in

supporting all our stakeholders.

In these annual letters, I usually

discuss HDFC Life’s priorities and

performance, as well as the broader

issues

facing

our

Company

and

the large untapped life insurance

opportunity in India. However, right

now, as we deal with the spiralling

effects of this pandemic, I want to

focus on what we as a life insurer can

do to remain strong, resilient and well-

positioned to support our customers,

colleagues and communities across

India. While the long-term strategy

to deepen insurance penetration will

largely remain the same, short-term

focus is on servicing of customers

digitally, accelerated digital selling,

employee engagement and reviewing

our operating model.

Incidentally, this year also marks 20

years of our momentous journey.

Looking back on the last two decades

— starting from the time we received

our licence from IRDAI as the first

private player in the country to be

allowed to sell life insurance — the

organisation has weathered some

unparalleled challenges and achieved

many industry-firsts in the process.

I am proud of each and every

individual who has been part of this

wonderful journey of two decades,

and I want to take this opportunity

to thank each and every one of

our employees.

While the end of FY 2020 was

difficult, we are well positioned as

we enter a new decade. We have

consistently been amongst the top

three companies in the private sector

in terms of new business premium,

closing the year at ` 17,238 crore

with a market share of 21.5%. We

ended the year with New Business

Margin (NBM) of 25.9% compared to

24.6% in the previous year, and with

an Embedded Value (EV) of `20,650

crore along with an 18.1% operating

return on EV. Indian GAAP profits grew

by 1% over the previous year. This

was achieved through steady growth

in premium income, balanced product

mix across our diversified distribution

and

cost

efficiency

enabled

by

our focus on technology. We have

taken cognisance of the potential

We continue our focus

and commitment to invest

considerable resources

into technology under

the aegis of “Reimagining

insurance” and with

a customer-centric

lens. Our focus is on

leveraging technology

to simplify life insurance

for our customers – be

it issuance, claims,

servicing, or any other

engagement.

of our Promoter Company i.e. Housing

Development Finance Corporation Limited.

She is currently the President of the

International Union Housing Finance, an

association of global housing finance firms.

Corporate

Overview:

Dear Shareholders,

In FY 2020, HDFC Life delivered a

strong

performance

despite

the

disruptions caused by the COVID-19

pandemic in the last quarter. We have

insured over 6 crore lives this year

and provided innovative protection,

retirement and savings solutions to

our customers. Despite the near to

mid-term uncertainties, we strongly

believe that our 1.3 billion population

offers us significant opportunities

over the next few decades as India

continues to grow as an economy.

2020 and two decades of our

journey…

This year, we also complete 20 years

since our inception, and we are proud

of our memorable journey so far. Over

the years, HDFC Life has contributed

significantly to the way the life

insurance industry has evolved in

India. From a single player industry

two decades ago, today, the market

is thriving with 24 players. During this

time, we have created many industry

firsts, broadened our market share

across all our lines of businesses,

whilst maintaining a strong book and a

healthy balance sheet.

Today, as we fight the unprecedented

challenge posed by COVID-19, I am

strongly reminded of the fact that

as an organisation, we stand by our

principles that have stood the test of

time. Even as this crisis caused by the

pandemic deepens, I have immense

faith in our capabilities and resilience,

and as a well-functioning organisation

that mobilises resources with agility, I

am confident we will collectively rise

up to the challenge, adapt and thrive

for the good of all our stakeholders.

Business review

We continue to drive our business

on the back of our stated strategy

of balanced product mix, diversified

distribution,

continuous

product

innovation, and reimagining insurance

through effective use of technology.

We have made significant progress

towards the financial targets we laid

out, and ended FY 2020 with a steady

growth of 18% in individual business

APE, closing the year at ` 6,145 crore.

We registered a growth of 15% in

overall new business received premium

and 9% growth in renewal premium.

We also continued to maintain our

leadership position in Group business

with a 20% growth in new business

received premium in FY 2020.

Value of new business grew by

25%, increasing from ` 1,537 crore in

FY 2019 to ` 1,919 crore in FY 2020,

whilst operating return on embedded

value was 18.1% compared to 20.1%

last year, on account of strengthening

our

persistency

assumptions

and

creation

of

a

COVID

reserve

in

anticipation of worsening mortality

experience. Our solvency position

remained strong at 184% compared

to 188% a year ago, the drop mainly

due to the fall in equity markets.

Over the years, HDFC

Life has contributed

significantly to the way

the life insurance industry

has evolved in india. From a

single player industry two

decades ago, today, the

market is thriving with 24

players. During this time,

we have created many

industry firsts, broadened

our market share across

all our lines of businesses,

whilst maintaining a

strong book and a healthy

balance sheet.:

Ms. Vibha Padalkar -: Managing

letter from HDFC Life, stating that, to the best of HDFC Life’s

knowledge, the data and information provided to us is accurate and complete and that there are no material

inaccuracies or omissions therein.

The Company’s analysis of projected cash flows is based on a series of assumptions as to future operating

experience. It should be recognised that actual experience will differ from these assumptions on account of

changes in the operating and economic environment and natural variations in experience. To the extent that

actual experience is different from the assumptions, the projected cash flows will also differ. The Company’s

analysis includes various scenarios to illustrate how vulnerable the outcomes are to changes in assumptions for

the key risks across a range of outcomes, although these scenarios will not be exhaustive and other outcomes

are possible. The Company’s analysis was presented at 31 March 2020 and no warranty is given by Milliman that

future experience after this date will be in line with the assumptions made.

Any change in the general operating environment would add a high degree of uncertainty to the Company’s

analysis. There is substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the economic, legal, and

regulatory environment, and the level and nature of business activity, which could materially impact outcomes.

The Company’s analysis only reflects the impact of the fast developing COVID-19 pandemic to the extent that it

reflects economic conditions at 31 March 2020.

Yours faithfully
