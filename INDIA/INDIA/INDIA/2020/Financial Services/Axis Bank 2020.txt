Dear Shareholders,

Over the last 26 years of our operations, it has been a priority for the Bank to stand by our customers

as a trustworthy and supportive partner, helping them fulfil their financial needs and realise their life

ambitions. The Bank continues to be perceived as an approachable, caring, efficient and empathetic

institution by our customers.

Customer centricity has been one of the core values of the Bank and the spirit of openness is

reflected in every interaction which our employees have with each of our customers every day. For

us, ‘Open’ is more than a sign that is displayed at our branch doors. It is a sign of what our customers

can expect when they walk in through our doors. For their dreams and hope, our ears and minds are

open, and for their plans we promise to open every possible window of opportunity.

In fiscal 2020, the Bank successfully

raised `12,500 crores of capital

through one of the largest ever QIP

issues by a private sector issuer,

this strengthened the Bank’s capital

ratios, with total adequacy of 17.53%

and CET1 ratio of 13.34%. The

operating profitability in fiscal year

2020 continued to remain steady with

16% growth in net interest income

and 23% growth in operating profits.

The Bank’s net NPA plus BB & below

book has declined substantially to

2.7% from 3.4% at the end of last

fiscal. The provision coverage (without

considering write‑offs) increased to

69% from 62% at the start of the

year. The Bank now holds additional

provisions aggregating to `5,983

crores towards various contingencies

which are not included in the

aforementioned provision coverage.

The Governments and Central banks

across the world have responded

with massive fiscal, monetary and

regulatory measures to counter the

outbreak of virus and protect their

respective economies that have come

to a near standstill state. However, the

global economic activity will take a

long time to recover. The Government

of India and the Reserve Bank of India

have responded swiftly, announcing

wide measures to aid weaker sections

of society and facilitate credit flow

to the economy; and I expect further

measures from them to consistently

support the economy during the

prolonged recovery phase. As the

economy continues to combat the

unprecedented uncertainty caused

by COVID‑19 pandemic outbreak

since the start of this calendar year,

we have lived up to our promise to

the nation of being a responsible

citizen, being ‘Open’ to address the

needs of our customers, employees

and communities.

The Bank has been agile and

responsive to the ever changing

situation. We had proactively

strengthened the operational and

technological infrastructure needed,

to ensure continuity of normal

operations. During the lockdown

phase implemented by government,

over 96% of our ATMs and 99% of

our branches were operational. We

implemented a large‑scale ‘work from

home’ mandate with over 9,000 VPN

and VDI connections provided to

ensure business continuity and almost

100% of the critical activities were

capable of being executed by working

from home. I am immensely proud

of our team of 74,000+ who came

together as one, working fearlessly

from branches, offices and from their

homes to reach out and serve the

customers in their most difficult times.

The customer feedback and stories of

support are a strong testament to the

Axis spirit. We reached out to almost

3 lakhs customers on a daily basis

during this period.

The Bank has navigated this

unprecedented and challenging period,

well assisted by our capital position,

adequate liquidity buffers and stable

deposits franchise.

The Bank has been agile

and responsive to the ever

changing situation. We had

proactively strengthened the

operational and technological

infrastructure needed,

to ensure continuity of

normal operations.

The recent COVID‑19 pandemic and

businesses across sectors hard. The

Bank had been proactive to take

requisite measures on the operational

front and had proactively developed

strategies to counter the near term

challenges. The Bank had invoked

business continuity plan weeks prior to

Board Performance Evaluation

The Companies Act, 2013 and the Listing Regulations relating to Corporate Governance provides for evaluation of the

performance of the Board, its Committees, Individual Directors and the Chairman of a company.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee is the nodal agency for conducting the said performance evaluation. The

Nomination and Remuneration Committee has reviewed and approved the manner for effective evaluation of the performance

of the Board, its Committees, its individual Directors and its Chairman and determined the criteria for conduct of such

performance evaluation for the financial year under reference, along with the proposed action for implementation by the Bank

Meetings of the Board/Committees of the Board

The schedule in respect of the meetings of the Board / Committees thereof to be held during the next financial year and for

the ensuing Annual General Meeting is circulated in advance to all the Members of the Board. During the year, 10 meetings

of the Board were held and the gap between the said meetings did not exceed the limit of 120 days, as prescribed under the:

Managing Director & CEO and Whole Time Directors of the Bank and that of its subsidiary

companies (“eligible Employees/Directors”), in terms of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Employee Stock Option

Scheme and Employee Stock Purchase Scheme) Guidelines, 1999 / Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based

Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014, as amended. The objective of the said ESOS is to enhance employee motivation, enable

employees to participate, directly or indirectly, in the long-term growth and financial success of the Bank, to act as a retention

mechanism by enabling employee participation in the business of the Bank as its active stakeholder and to usher an ‘owner-

manager’ culture.

In terms of the said ESOS, as on date, up to 26,50,87,000 stock options are available for grant by the Bank to the eligible

Employees/Directors of the Bank and that of its subsidiary companies. The eligibility and number of stock options to be

granted to such eligible Employees/Directors is determined on the basis of the outcome of their performance evaluation and

such other criteria as may be approved by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee / Board, from time to time.

During the period from February 2001 to January 2019, the Shareholders of the Bank had approved the grant of stock options,

as aforesaid, on seven occasions. Under the first two ESOS of the Bank and in respect of the grant of stock options made by the

Bank upto 29th April 2004, the option conversion price was set at the average of the daily high-low price of the Bank’s equity

shares traded during the 52 weeks preceding the date of approval of grant by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee/

Board, prevailing on the Stock Exchange which had the maximum trading volume of the Bank’s equity share during the said

period. Thereafter, under the third and subsequent ESOS of the Bank and with effect from the said grants made by the Bank on

or after 10th June 2005, the stock option conversion price was changed to the latest available closing price of the equity shares

of the Bank, prevailing on the Stock Exchange which recorded higher trading volume, on the day prior to the date of approval

of grant by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.

Pursuant to the sub-division of the equity shares of the Bank, the Shareholders of the Bank at the 20th Annual General Meeting

held on 27th June 2014, also approved the consequent adjustments to the stock options granted to the eligible Employees/

Directors, under the various ESOS of the Bank, such that all stock options available for grant (including lapsed and forfeited

options available for reissue) and those already granted but not vested and those vested but not exercised, as on the record

date fixed for the purpose of sub-division, were proportionately converted into options bearing equity shares of the face value

of `2/- each of the Bank and the grant price of all the outstanding stock options (unvested, vested and unexercised) as on the:

Managing Director & CEO and Shri Puneet Sharma, President (Finance and

Accounts) & CFO of the Bank, for the quarter/ financial year ended 31st March 2020, was placed before the Board at its

meeting held on 28th April 2020, in terms of Regulation 17(8) of the Listing Regulations.
