Message from the Chairman

complex economic environment

support, will help us honour them. This is also

the time for the Bank to increase its focus on

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) front,

and continue to factor in new age risks that are

becoming increasingly mainstream.

As we move forward and embrace the new normal,

we aspire to be seen as a Bank, which is trusted

for its integrity, practices highest standards of

governance, is contemporary and continuously

motivated to deliver value to its stakeholders. There

is uncertainty about the depth and length of the

current crisis. However, as the Bank embraces this

transformation, I am confident that an adaptive and

responsive business model that harnesses the power

of digital and focuses on customer value, we will

collectively drive positive outcomes for YES BANK.

The Board and I, feel a deep sense of pride

to be a part of an institution which continues

to show remarkable resolve and confidence

towards delivering these positive outcomes.

The achievements and the change would not have

been possible without the incredible support of

the Government of India, RBI, other regulators,

investors, valued customers, my Board colleagues

and over 21,000 enthusiastic YES BANK employees.

Thank You all.

Best Regards,

sunil mehta

Chairman

dear shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to connect with you for

the first time as MD & CEO of YES BANK. On behalf

of the Bank, I take this opportunity to thank you for

your unflinching support, which continues to provide

inspiration and strength to all of us.

I thank the State Bank of India, HDFC Limited,

ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, IDFC First Bank, Kotak

Bank, Federal Bank, Bandhan Bank and our other

shareholders for reposing faith in the institution.

We recognize the commitment that you as investors

in YES BANK, have made in the organisation. We are

confident that the renewed focus, coupled with the

changes we continue to make at the Bank, will enable

us to continue to deliver on our commitment to provide

customers a differentiated banking experience. It is

unprecedented in the history of banking that top

financial institutions in the country came together to

provide support to another Bank. This has only been

possible due to the strong belief and faith of customers

and the banking fraternity alike in the franchise.

On our journey of transformation, we have completed

our first crucial milestone within a quarter of

restarting operations. The successful completion of

our `15,000-crore follow-on public offering (FPO),

India’s largest fund raise in the financial services sector,

against an extremely challenging socio-economic

backdrop is a testament to the faith reposed by our

investors. This is one of the first but a very crucial step

in the Bank’s journey of transformation into a ‘Digital

Bank’ - a key milestone and a market endorsement of

the efforts being made by the Bank. Moreover, this has

further strengthened our foundation with reinforced

liquidity, which is well above the required regulatory

norms. We look forward to building on this momentum.

I thank our new investors – both institutional and retail,

for reposing faith in the institution and our future

roadmap, despite global headwinds of the COVID-19

situation and its socio-economic impact.

While we work towards navigating through the

economic headwinds, our first priority is to provide the

best possible experience to our customers. Although,

the Bank has seen tumultuous times in the recent past,

we have taken decisive steps to ensure we continue to

fulfil our commitment to our stakeholders. The tone

has already been set by our reconstituted Board

of Directors and leadership as well as independent

control functions on enhancing governance and risk

frameworks, translating into a culture of accountability

to all our stakeholders. The Bank has made

significant changes in the Risk framework to ensure

that impending risks are identified, evaluated, and

resolved before these convert into reputational risks.

We have made foundational changes to strengthen

our governance frameworks, identify and mitigate

risks, with the objective of creating an authentic,

empathetic Brand committed to ethical leadership and

conducting business with integrity. While there is still

more work to be done to reach this goal, I assure you

that the Board of Directors and I are striving to deliver

on the expectations of our customers, employees,

communities, regulators and shareholders.

As I write this message, the world is traversing through

a situation that has no precedence in recent history.

The COVID-19 outbreak is a crisis for humanity as a

whole with far-reaching effects. Apart from the social

and human costs, the world is expected to face a

severe economic downturn as the impact of nationwide

lockdowns become apparent. The International

Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts global GDP to contract

by 4.9% in 2020. That said, the Governments, the

private sector and the civil society are collaborating to

minimise the fallout.

assigned to them in the best interest of the Bank. The Committees also make

specific recommendations to the Board on various matters whenever required. All

observations, recommendations and decisions of the Committees are placed before

the Board for information or for approval. All the Committees were re-constituted

post Re-Constitution of the Board with effect from March 26, 2020 on taking charge

by the new Board pursuant to the YBL Reconstruction Scheme. In order to keep the

Committee structure lean, “Fraud Monitoring Committee” and “Board Committee on

Wilful Defaulters and Non Co-operative Borrowers” were merged into one committee

and re-named as “Fraud, Wilful Defaulters and Non-Cooperative Borrowers Monitoring

Committee”. Also, “Service Excellence, Branding and Marketing Committee” and

“Stakeholder Relationship Committee” were merged into one committee and re-

named as “Stakeholders Relationship & Customer Service Committee”. Further, “Risk

Monitoring Committee” was re-named as “Risk Management Committee”. Accordingly,

regarding disclosure of Nil divergence to Stock Exchange. The amount was paid in

terms of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Settlement proceeding) Regulations,

(c) whistle Blower Policy:

In compliance with the provisions of SEBI Listing Regulations, Companies Act, 2013 and

other applicable laws and in accordance with principles of good corporate governance,

the Bank has devised and implemented a vigil mechanism, in the form of ‘Whistle

Blower Policy’. The policy devised is also aligned to the recommendations of Protected

Disclosure Scheme for Private Sector Banks and Foreign Banks, instituted by RBI.

This policy enables a Whistle Blower to raise concerns relating to reportable matters

(as elucidated in the said policy) such as breach of Bank’s Code of Conduct, fraud,

bribery, corruption, employee misconduct, illegality, health & safety, environmental

issues and wastage/misappropriation of bank funds/assets, etc., without fear of

reprisals and to provide for independent investigation. The framework of the policy

endeavors to simplify and smoothen the process for Whistle Blower and foster

responsible reporting, a Whistle Blower cannot resort to the Whistle Blower Policy to

report his/ her personal grievances.

The concerns can be raised through 'Corporate Whistle Blower Initiative (CWI)

portal, which is an independent online reporting service aimed at facilitating a

secure communication between the Whistle Blower and independent Whistleblower

Committee constituted by the Bank.

The policy has provisions to safeguard Whistle Blower against victimization. As a

responsible and vigilant organization, the Bank encourages responsible and fearless

reporting of genuine concerns or grievances and also provides for direct access to the

Material uncertainty related to going concern

We draw attention to Note 18.3 of the Standalone Financial Statements, which

indicates that the Bank has incurred a loss of `16,418 crores for the year ended 31

March 2020. Particularly during the last six months, there has also been a significant

decline in the Bank’s deposit base, an increase in their NPA ratios resulting in breach

of loan covenants on its foreign currency debt and credit rating downgrades resulting

in partial prepayment of foreign currency debt linked to external credit rating.

The Bank has also breached minimum Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) and Liquidity

Coverage Ratio requirements of RBI during the year and has provided an amount of

`334 crores for the expected penalty on the SLR breach. The Bank has also breached

the RBI mandated CET1 ratio and Tier 1 capital ratio which stood at 6.3%.and 6.5%

as compared to the minimum requirements of 7.375% and 8.875% respectively. This

requires the Bank to take effective steps to augment its capital base in the year 2020-

21. The breach of the CET1 and Tier 1 requirements was also impacted by the decision

of the Bank to enhance its Provision Coverage Ratio, on a prudent basis, on its NPA

loans over and above RBI’s minimum loan provisioning norms. Further, on 5 March

2020, the Central Government, based on the RBI’s application imposed a moratorium

under section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 for a period of 30 days effective

5 March 2020. The RBI, in consultation with the Central Government and in exercise

of the powers under section 36ACA of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, superseded

the Board of Directors of the Bank on 5 March 2020. The above indicators of financial

stress and actions taken by the RBI resulted in a significant withdrawal of deposits.

On 13 March 2020, the Government of India notified the Yes Bank Limited

Reconstruction Scheme 2020 (‘the Scheme’) [notified by the Central Government, in

exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (4) and subsection 7 of section 45 of

the Banking Regulation Act, 1949]. Under this Scheme the authorized share capital of

the Bank was increased to `6,200 crores. The Bank has received capital from investors

amounting to `10,000 crores on 14 March 2020. The State Bank of India (SBI) and other

banks and financial institutions invested in the Bank at a price of `10 per equity share

of the Bank (`2 face value with a `8 premium). SBI is required to hold upto 49% with a

minimum holding of 26% by SBI in the Bank (which is subject to a 3 year lock in). Other

investors are subject to a 3 year lock in for 75% of the investments they make in the

Bank under this Scheme. Existing investors (other than investors holding less than

100 shares) in the Bank are also subject to a lock in for 75% of their holding as per this

Scheme. A new Board of Directors, CEO and MD and Non Executive

laundering, fraud and nexus between the founder and former MD & CEO and certain

has assessed that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income

will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realized. The Bank

expects to have a taxable profit for the future years. Our conclusion is not modified in

respect of this matter.

We draw attention to Note 18.5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements which states

that the Bank had made an additional provision of `15,422 crores for the period ended

31 December 2019 on a prudent evaluation of the status of NPAs based on discussion

with regulator over and above the RBI norms relating to the minimum provision to be

made by banks on their loans and advances. The additional provision is judgmental

based on the quality and status of specific loans identified by the Bank as at 31

March 2020. We believe that this judgment exercised by the Bank is appropriate. Our

conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.

KeY AuDIt MAtteRs

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most

significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current

period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated

Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not

provide a separate opinion on these matters. In addition to the matter described in

the Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern section, we have determined the

matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

29 February 2020.

In the opinion of the Bank, based on the financial projections prepared by the Bank

and approved by the Board for the next 3 years, the capital infusion, lines of liquidity

provided by RBI and the reconstruction Scheme, the Bank will be able to realize

its assets (including its deferred tax asset) and discharge its liabilities in its normal

course of business and hence the financial statements have been prepared on a going

concern basis. The said assumption of going concern is inter-alia dependent on the

Bank’s ability to achieve improvements in liquidity, asset quality and solvency ratios

and mitigate the impact of Covid-19 and thus a material uncertainty exists that may

cast a significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. However,

as stated above, as per management and the Board there are mitigating factors to

such uncertainties including the amount of capital funds that have been raised in

March 2020, the nature and financial resources of new investors who have infused

funds in the Bank, the new Board of Directors, CEO and MD and part time

Bank, based on the legal opinion of its external independent legal counsel is of the view

that the merits of the Bank’s decision to write back the AT 1 bonds is in accordance

with the contractual terms for issuance of AT 1 Bonds. The Bank had also been granted

a short term special liquidity facility for 90 days (ending on June 16, 2020) from the

RBI. The Bank has written to RBI for an extension of the same for a year. The Bank also

raised CDs of `72,000 million as at March 31, 2020. As a consequence of the above

factors the Bank’s loss post tax and AT 1 write back (exceptional income) is `164,180

million. The Bank’s CET1 ratio is 6.3% (regulatory requirement with CCB of 7.375%) and

tier 1 capital ratio is 6.5% (regulatory requirement of 8.875%) as at March 31, 2020. The

Bank has substantially enhanced its PCR and strengthened its Balance Sheet. However,

RBI’s current framework on ‘Prompt Corrective Action’ (PCA) considers regulatory

breaches in CET as a potential trigger. The Bank remains in constant communication

with RBI on the various parameters and ratios and RBI has not imposed any fine on the

Bank for the regulatory breaches.

The Bank’s deposit base has seen a reduction from `2,276,102 million as at March

31, 2019 to `1,053,639 million as at March 31, 2020 (Position as at May 02, 2020

`1,027,179 million). Consequently, the Bank’s quarterly average ‘Liquidity Coverage

Ratio’ (LCR) has fallen from 74% for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to 40% for

the quarter ended March 31, 2020 (regulatory limit 100%), position as at May 02, 2020

34.8%(regulatory limit 80%). The Bank also has a deferred tax asset of `82,810 million

as at March 31, 2020. Though the Bank has made a loss of `164,180 million for the year

ended March 31, 2020, the Bank has a taxable profit for the year ended March 31, 2020.

In the month of March 2020, SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 continued to

spread across the globe and India, which has contributed to a significant decline and

volatility in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and

local economic outlook and activities. On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was

declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. On March 24, 2020, the

Indian government announced a strict 21-day lockdown which was further extended

across the country to contain the spread of the virus. The extent to which the COVID-19

pandemic will impact the Bank’s future results will depend on related developments,

which remain highly uncertain.

led to a continuing breach in Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) starting October 2019 and

continues till date. The Bank’s deposit base has seen a reduction from `2,094,973

million as at September 30, 2019 to `1,657,554 million as at December 31, 2019. The

deposit position as at March 31, 2020 is `1,053,639 million and has reduced further

to `1,027,179 million as at May 02, 2020. The Bank had also prepaid ~USD 1.18 billion

(`85,000 million) by February 29, 2020. On March 5, 2020, the Central Government,

based on the RBI’s application imposed a moratorium under section 45 of the Banking

Regulation Act, 1949 for a period of 30 days effective March 5, 2020 which was lifted

on March 18, 2020. Further, the RBI, in consultation with the Central Government

and in exercise of the powers under section 36ACA of the Banking Regulation Act

1949, superseded the Board of Directors of the Bank on March 5, 2020. As per the

moratorium a restriction was imposed on the withdrawal by depositors of amounts up

to `50,000 and the Bank also could not grant or renew loans or make any investments.

On March 13, 2020, the Government of India notified the “Yes Bank Ltd. Reconstruction

Scheme, 2020” (Scheme). As per the Scheme, authorized capital has been increased

from `11,000 million to `62,000 million. The State Bank of India (SBI) and other

investors invested in 10,000 million shares at a price of `10 per equity share of the

Bank (`2 face value with a `8 premium). The Bank has received capital amounting

to `100,000 million as of March 14, 2020 from a consortium of Banks and Financial

Institution led by State Bank of India. SBI is required to hold upto 49% with a minimum

holding of 26% by SBI in the Bank (which is subject to a 3 year lock in). Other investors

are subject to a 3 year lock in for 75% of the investments they make in the Bank under

this Scheme. Existing investors (other than investors holding less than 100 shares) in

Yes Bank are also subject to a lock in for 75% of their holding as per this Scheme.
