Preface

As mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), India’s top 1000 listed entities

based on market capitalisation on the BSE and NSE, are required to submit a ‘Business Responsibility

Report’ (BRR) along with their Annual Report for 2019-20. This report is required to be in line with

‘National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business’

(NVGs), as released by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in July 2011.

Bajaj Holdings & Investment Ltd. (‘BHIL’, ‘the Company’), to whom the said requirement became

applicable for the first time in 2016-17, presents its fourth BRR in line with the NVGs and the BRR

requirement of SEBI. The business responsibility performance of the Company is assessed annually by

BHIL’s Board of Directors.

BHIL is a holding and investment company. BHIL and its subsidiaries hold strategic stakes of 35.77% in

Bajaj Auto Limited (BAL), 41.63% in Bajaj Finserv Limited (BFS) and 51% in Maharashtra Scooters

Limited (MSL), besides other investments.

Principle 1: Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with Ethics, Transparency and

Accountability

BHIL endeavours to adopt high standards of corporate governance and adheres to all applicable

guidelines with transparent disclosures about the Company’s performance. As the holding and

investment company of the Bajaj Group, the values of ethics, transparency and accountability are

ingrained into its daily operations. In order to reinforce the Group values to its subsidiaries, the

Company regularly engages with their management teams.:

Managing Director in the Annual Report.

The Company is a signatory to the Model Code of Conduct developed by the Confederation of Indian

Industry (CII) and has also adopted two CII Charters viz., Charters on Fair and Responsible Workplace

Guidelines for Contract Labour and Charters on Fair and Responsible Workplace Guidelines for

Collaborative Employee Relations.

BHIL follows the Code of Practices and Procedures for Fair Disclosure of Unpublished Price Sensitive

Information (UPSI). The Company has established a Whistle Blower Policy which describes the process

to report any unethical behaviour or violation of the Code of Conduct. Any employee can report to

the management regarding instances of unethical behaviour, suspected fraud or violation of the Code

of Conduct or ethics policy. In order to safeguard employees, who report any unethical behaviour,

against victimization, sufficient measures have also been put in place. In exceptional cases, there is

also a provision for direct access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. All whistle blower

complaints are investigated and action initiated, where required.

No stakeholder complaints linked to adherence of Code of Conduct were received in the reporting

year.

Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and contribute to

sustainability throughout their life cycle

BHIL is a holding and investment company and is not involved in any manufacturing activity or services

under the purview of BRR.

Principle 3: Businesses should promote the well-being of all employees

As of 31 March 2020, BHIL had a total of 19 employees, which included 6 women employees. The

Company did not have any specially-abled employees or recognized employee association.

BHIL is aware that employees are an essential part of a company’s success. The Company aims to

attract qualified personnel and invests in their growth and development. BHIL regularly engages its

employees and conducts various learning and development programs. In order to gain wider

exposure, employees are also provided opportunities to move across the subsidiaries

BHIL has various policies and procedures in place to prevent any kind of discrimination. The ‘Policy on

Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace’ ensures the safety and security of its female

employees. The Company did not receive any complaint relating to child labour, forced labour,

involuntary labour or sexual harassment in 2019-20 and none are pending as of 31 March 2020.

Principle 4: Businesses should respect the interests of, and be responsive towards all stakeholders,

especially those who are disadvantaged, vulnerable and marginalized

BHIL is an equal opportunity employer and ensures that its remuneration practices are based on merit,

irrespective of the person’s ethnic background or gender. These are regularly updated and are in line

with the market benchmarks. In addition, the Company practises affirmative action and ensures there

is no discrimination of any type against socially disadvantaged sections at the work place.:
