The RBI has also taken steps to infuse

liquidity into the system via targeted long-

Note 43.6: Equity price risk:

The Company’s investment in non-listed equity securities are

accounted at cost in the financial statement net of impairment.

The expected cash flow from these entities are regularly

monitored to identify impairment indicators.

NOTE 44: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The principles and techniques of fair valuation measurement of

both financial and non-financial instruments are as follows:

(a) Valuation principles

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell

an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly

transaction in the principal (or most advantageous)

market at the measurement date under current market

conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether

that price is directly observable or estimated using a

valuation technique.

For determination of fair value, financial instruments are

classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as

summarised below:

Level 1: Those where the inputs used in the valuation

are unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for

identical assets or liabilities that the Company has access

to at the measurement date. The Company considers

markets as active only if there are sufficient trading

activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of

the identical assets or liabilities and when there are

binding and exercisable price quotes available on the

balance sheet date.

Level 2: Those where the inputs that are used for

valuation and are significant, are derived from directly or

indirectly observable market data available over the entire

period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include quoted

prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,

quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive

markets and observable inputs other than quoted prices

such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities

and credit spreads. In addition, adjustments may be

required for the condition or location of the asset or the

extent to which it relates to items that are comparable to

the valued instrument.

Level 3: Those that include one or more unobservable

input that is significant to the measurement as whole.

(b) Valuation governance

The Company’s fair value methodology and the

governance over its models includes a number of controls

and other procedures to ensure appropriate safeguards

are in place to ensure its quality and adequacy. All new

product initiatives and their valuations are subject to

approvals by related functions of the Company.

(c) Assets and liabilities by fair value hierarchy

The Company’s investment in non-listed equity securities are

accounted at cost in the financial statement net of impairment.

The expected cash flow from these entities are regularly

monitored to identify impairment indicators.

NOTE 45: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The principles and techniques of fair valuation measurement of

both financial and non-financial instruments are as follows:

(a) Valuation principles

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell

an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly

transaction in the principal (or most advantageous)

market at the measurement date under current market

conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether

that price is directly observable or estimated using a

valuation technique.

For determination of fair value, financial instruments are

classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as

summarised below:

Level 1: Those where the inputs used in the valuation

are unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for

identical assets or liabilities that the Company has access

to at the measurement date. The Company considers

markets as active only if there are sufficient trading

activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of

the identical assets or liabilities and when there are

binding and exercisable price quotes available on the

balance sheet date.

Level 2: Those where the inputs that are used for

valuation and are significant, are derived from directly or

indirectly observable market data available over the entire

period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include quoted

prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,

quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive

markets and observable inputs other than quoted prices

such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities

and credit spreads. In addition, adjustments may be

required for the condition or location of the asset or the

extent to which it relates to items that are comparable to

the valued instrument.

Level 3: Those that include one or more unobservable

input that is significant to the measurement as whole.

(b) Valuation governance

The Company’s fair value methodology and the

governance over its models includes a number of controls

and other procedures to ensure appropriate safeguards

are in place to ensure its quality and adequacy. All new

product initiatives and their valuations are subject to

approvals by related functions of the Company.
