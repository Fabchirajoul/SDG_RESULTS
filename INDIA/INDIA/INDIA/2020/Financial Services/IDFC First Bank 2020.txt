Item No. 5

Appointment of Dr. Sanjay Kumar as a Nominee Director

representing Government of India.

The Bank received instructions from Department of

Financial Services, Ministry of Finance, Government of

India nominating Dr. Sanjay Kumar (DIN: 08764419) as a

Government Nominee Director on the Board of the Bank in

place of Ms. Anindita Sinharay (DIN: 07724555).:

Dear Shareholders,

The world is going through an extraordinary time, as the pandemic

hits its businesses, economies and lives.

The world’s economic landscape was already fraught with

uncertainties, ranging from trade tensions between US and China

to Brexit, which led to volatility in global oil prices and financial

markets.

For India, the financial year 2019-20 started on a positive note with

a landslide victory for the incumbent BJP led government, raising

hopes for ongoing reforms. The government did not disappoint

on this front and brought about some landmark changes such as

a sharp reduction in the corporate and Income Tax rates – both

applicable subject to the tax payer agreeing to forego all forms

of tax exemption.

However, despite policy actions by both the government and RBI,

the uncertainties with regard to the Twin Balance Sheet problem

persisted – troubles in the NBFC sector did not dissipate and

deleveraging in the corporate sector continued. Core inflation

remained on a downward trajectory and the government

announced reforms in the agriculture, coal and fertilizer sectors

and in regulations pertaining to labour.

The RBI supported the economy with a 110 bps cut in the repo

rate starting from April 2019 before pausing post October 2019

as a reaction to the spike in inflation. However, following the

COVID-19 crisis, it resumed its rate cut cycle with a 75 bps cut in

March 2020 and further 40 bps in May 2020.

From October 1, 2019, the RBI attempted to improve transmission

of its policy rate cuts by making it mandatory for banks to link all

fresh retail and SME loans to an external benchmark. It has been

a consistent endeavor of the RBI to maintain adequate liquidity in

the system and they have also announced some targeted long-

term repo operations for the banks to enable them to invest in

investment grade bonds of NBFCs.

During the year, the banking sector saw significant developments

including a mega merger of PSU banks which involved the folding

of 10 banks into four. The government announced a substantive

recapitalization of PSU banks. The industry also witnessed the

first instance of a financial sector entity, a large HFC, being

admitted for bankruptcy proceedings. The RBI also acted boldly

to provide liquidity support to the banking system to ensure that

The Bank has come through the merger process

very smoothly, strengthening the foundations

for a transformed organisation, while navigating

pressures of a highly uncertain external economic

environment, all at the same time. It is now well

positioned - with a strong capital base, superior

corporate governance, a disciplined approach to

risk, it is focused on growing its retail franchise

using new technologies and a relentlessly customer

first ethos.

Dr. Rajiv B Lall

Non-Executive Chairman

IDFC FIRST Bank:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to write this note for you on the

occasion of the Second Annual Report of the merged entity,

IDFC FIRST Bank.

Recap

In last year’s report, my note had described the circumstances

that led to the creation of IDFC FIRST Bank. To recap briefly,

IDFC Limited was a successful institution, which was initially

conceptualised for infrastructure financing in 1997, and

expanded into investment banking & institutional securities

(2007), Mutual Funds (2008), Infrastructure Debt Fund (2015),

and after acquiring a banking license in 2015, successfully built

corporate banking and had already commenced the build-up of

retail banking.

Capital First was founded in 2012, through a PE backed

leveraged buyout of an existing NBFC, and was singularly

focused on financing small entrepreneurs and consumers

who were largely un-banked in this country. The company

grew from ` 94 crore to ` 29,625 crore in 8.5 years, acquired

9 million customers, enjoyed a 5-year CAGR loan growth of 29%,

and a five year CAGR of 56% in profits, leading to a net profit of

` 327 crore for the year ended on March 31, 2018, the last

financial year prior to the merger. The company was first-time

credit provider to millions of people.

To recap, in last year’s Annual Report, with respect to the

Business model of the new bank, I had simplistically said that

the high-margin loan business of Capital First (NIM of 8.5%)

would be placed atop the low cost liabilities franchise of IDFC

Bank. That still holds, but this is an over-simplification intended

to drive home the simplicity of the model; that we will be a

predominantly retail bank. This does not mean we will exit

corporate banking, it’s an important business segment for us; it

has trade, forex, cash management, salary accounts, treasury

and related businesses, our Bank has developed excellent

systems for managing these services.

In December 2018, at merger, we defined our mission as “we

want to touch the lives of millions of Indians in a positive way by

providing high-quality banking products and services to them,

with particular focus on aspiring consumers and entrepreneurs

of our new India, using contemporary technologies.”

A new beginning

We were practically a new bank on merger. We had a new Board

of Directors, new management, a renewed focus and drive, and

we began building a new brand, IDFC FIRST Bank with new

colour, logo and positioning.

Like with anything new, say, a new car, new clothes or

shoes, with the newness comes a great deal of energy and

excitement. Say, if you are building a new house, you would

fuss over flooring, tiles, walls and what they would be made of.

Growth, you will agree, is not an issue

in India. Mid-teens ROE can be built for

sure, most good banks have achieved it.

Our incremental margins are strong. Our

business is highly scalable. We have a

very high level of corporate governance.

We focus on the customer. I believe it is

inevitable that value will be created in this

approach.

V Vaidyanathan: Managing

letter, and even in our internal

communication, we say this at large, so that if any employee

plans something inappropriate in any segment for pressure of

P&L, or tries fine-print banking, then their colleagues will hold

them back and point to our principles, which is an inherent

check and balance.

Creating value

That leads us to the next question - how do we create value

from here. In 2010-2012, I used to scribble the following sandbox

afresh on any rough paper I found, countless times the same

thing, to every new PE or employee I met, on how value will be

created or prospective senior employees.

The sandbox was very simple - the pitch was that significant

value can be created if we can (a) create Intellectual Property

(b) build a scalable business (c) grow at 25% (d) generate ROE

of 16-18%, and support it by exceptional corporate governance.

When I reflect on this sheet now, many years later, I find the

word Customer Experience missing in this theme though, which

is something I would fix if I were to remake this sheet today;

I’d place the Customer Experience at the center of this sheet.

Over time, I’ve added more elements to the theory, that the

businesses we build should be relevant to society, with ability to

evolve and other such things.

I believe all of these can be achieved in our Bank in due course.

Growth, you will agree, is not an issue in India. Mid-teens ROE

can be built for sure, most good banks have achieved it. We

have excellent intellectual property both on the liability side

and the asset side. We operate in our area of strength, our

incremental margins are strong. Our business is highly scalable.

We do business that is important for society. We are passionate

about serving our customers well. We borrow at 7% and lend:

letter, and even in our internal communication, we say this to them, so that

if any employee plans something inappropriate programme in any segment for pressure of P&L, or tries

fine-print banking, then their colleagues will hold them back and point to our principles, which is an inherent

check and balance.:

PERFORMANCE

AND

CONTRIBUTION

OF

SUBSIDIARY AND ASSOCIATE COMPANIES

IDFC FIRST Bank has one wholly owned Subsidiary

Company, namely IDFC FIRST Bharat Limited (‘IDFC FIRST

Bharat‘), which was formerly known as IDFC Bharat Limited.

IDFC FIRST Bharat is acting as a Business Correspondent

(‘BC’) for distribution of the products of IDFC FIRST Bank

and has given an added momentum to the financial inclusion

plan of the Bank.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of IDFC FIRST

Bharat had approved the change of name of the Company

from ‘IDFC Bharat Limited’ to ‘IDFC FIRST Bharat Limited’

and the consequential amendment to the Memorandum and

Articles of Association of the Company.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY

Currently, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum total

Capital Adequacy Ratio of 10.875%, of which minimum Tier

1 is 8.875% including Capital conservation buffer.

Our Bank is well capitalised and has a Capital Adequacy

Ratio (‘CAR’) under Basel III as at March 31, 2020 of 13.38%

(as against the RBI minimum requirement of 10.88%) & with

Tier-I Capital Adequacy Ratio being 13.30%.

With Preferential Issue of ` 2,000 crores (rounded off),

our Bank is availing an insurance for an emerging COVID

situation, that positions itself for strong growth going forward

and take the capital adequacy of our Bank to around 15%.

At such capital adequacy, our Bank shall be one of the

highest CET-1 capitalized banks in the country, which is far

higher than the regulatory requirements.

At high levels of Capital Adequacy, our Bank will continue

to enjoy the highest levels of confidence from the Indian

financial ecosystem including capital market participants,

depositors and our customers.

With the strong opportunities in India (India is an emerging

economy and an underserved and under-penetrated

market), the strong asset track record (combined with

Capital First and IDFC Bank) combined with robust liability

franchise, our Bank is well placed to grow its business in the

future. Also, the capital raise does give the buffer on account

of unforeseen circumstances on account of COVID.

As a Bank, it is our role to be strong and be strong

custodians of public depositors/ shareholders and such

Preferential Issue will help to further strengthen the balance

sheet immensely.

INFORMATION / CYBER SECURITY FRAMEWORK

IDFC FIRST Bank since its inception has put in place a robust

Information/ Cyber Security Framework. Our Bank being a

green field setup, has Information Security woven into our

banking platform and seamlessly merges both culturally and

technologically. A dedicated team of security professionals

are part of the Information Security Group (‘ISG’) who govern

the Information Security practices in the Bank. Our Bank has

put in place state of the art security technologies including

several industry ‘firsts’ technology solutions and adopted

‘defense in depth’ approach & industry best practices as part

of our security framework and architecture. This year the Bank

has put substantial effort in redesigning the cyber security

framework and posture. Besides this a complete review of

the overall security practices was also undertaken leading

to several changes in processes and automation of some

of the key security assessments undertaken in the Bank.

Our Bank is mindful of the need to always be on the guard

and monitors its environment 24x7x365. Given the changing

threat landscape and evolving technology platforms, the

attempt is to progressively move towards adoption of

proactive and adaptive platforms for automated detection,

response and recovery.

appointed Mr. Dayanand P. Kasabe, a senior retired

Central Banker as Internal Ombudsman for a period of
