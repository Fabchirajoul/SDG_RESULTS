*On deputation to other companies/foreign offices

(as on 31.08.2020):

Dear Stakeholders,

2020 marks the 101st year of operation of this great company. Let me

begin by thanking all of you who have reposed faith in the company

over these many years.

COVID-19 impact

The COVID-19 pandemic has redefined the world in many ways. Lives

have been lost, and livelihoods have been destroyed. The Collaborative

and agile approach between Government and the Regulator in the

pandemic situation is phenomenal. My prayers are with the families

of the people who lost their lives battling this dreaded disease. Team

New India salutes the untiring efforts of the healthcare workers who

are risking their lives to save ours. We are doing our bit for the cause

by managing the insurance scheme for these healthcare workers in

the frontline under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna. Each claim

received under this policy pains me to no end. We have ensured that

every claim under this policy that has the necessary documentation in

place is settled within 48 hours. The company also contributed ` 20

Crs towards the pandemic.

While the economy was sluggish throughout 2019-20, the impact of

the pandemic was felt only in the last quarter of the financial year, and

it has continued in the current financial year. However, I am proud to

say that the company has not allowed its operations to get disrupted.

Steps were taken to ensure business continuity with the majority of

employees working from home and only skeletal staff attending office.

No major renewal was lost. It was heartening to see the IT infrastructure

that the company had built over the past many years delivering to its

fullest potential by ensuring business continuity even under such a

challenging environment. To put things in perspective, New India is

probably the only major general insurer, which had a premium growth

in the first quarter of 2020-21 even when the entire industry recorded

a premium decline.

Performance in 2019-20

Coming to the year 2019-20, the company has performed remarkably

well. The gross written premium increased by 12% to ` 31,244 Crs

compared to the previous financial year. The profit after tax jumped

2.5 times to ` 1,418 Crs compared to the previous financial year. The

company continues to be the market leader in the general insurance

industry, with a market share of ~14%. The combined ratio, which

indicates the operational efficiency of a general insurance company has

come down from 123% to 116%. The solvency ratio of the company is

at 2.11x, which is significantly higher than the IRDAI mandated control

level solvency of 1.5x. The foreign operations of the company also

performed remarkably well in 2019-20 compared to the previous year.

In the year 2019-20, the company suffered significant losses on

account of catastrophes and COVID-19 related event cancellations.

The pension liability provision was significantly higher during the year.

Provisions were required to be made against certain investments, and

there was a decline in equity markets towards the end of the financial

year. Under these challenging circumstances, the performance of the

company has been excellent. I would like to thank our employees for

their hard work and continued commitment.

The Government of India has brought in many reforms

during the financial year. Increasing the FDI limit in

the insurance sector to 49% and in the insurance

intermediaries to 100% will go a long way in increasing the

capital flow into this sector leading to greater penetration.

Outlook

On the macroeconomic front, there are challenges galore.

While the company will be impacted by the poor auto sales,

the pandemic has increased the awareness of health

insurance and this line of business is expected to do well.

The GDP growth forecasts as on date remain uninspiring.

However, with good monsoons, the rural economy is

poised to do very well. The Government of India is taking

several proactive steps to ensure that the country comes

out of the COVID-19 induced slowdown at the earliest. I

am confident that these steps and other reforms initiated

would lead to the Indian economy recovering quickly, and

the situation would return to normalcy very soon. The

insurance penetration in India remains low and long-term

outlook for the sector remains robust.

Profitable growth, coupled with policyholder delight,

remains the goal for the company. The company

continues to be debt-free, well-capitalized, and well-

positioned to leverage the immense growth opportunities

in the general insurance industry.

I conclude this: letter by thanking our beloved customers

and all stakeholders and also assuring you that New India

Assurance will continue to lead the way in the industry

creating value for every stakeholder during the journey.

Atul Sahai

Profitable growth, coupled with

policyholder delight, remains

“ the goal for the company

From 18.9.2018:

letter dated May 30, 2019, wherein the Company has disputed the penalty since it was based on incorrect facts and figures.

The Company has sought for clarification from the Government of Karnataka on the parameters of penalty, reply from which

is still pending to be received for them. The Company is hopeful that the penalty will be dropped, hence no provision has

been made against this penalty during the year ended 31.03.2020.

28. Internal Controls: The company is in the process of strengthening internal controls and internal audit specially in area of

data input and validation in software, Reinsurance accounts, PMFBY and other Government sponsored Health schemes to

ensure the compliance of laid down operational guidelines.

29. Fraud Monitoring Cell: The Company has a fraud monitoring cell which monitors the external frauds reported to the

company. As per the assessment made by the Cell, there were no matters related to external frauds reported during the

year, which required any adjustments to the standalone financial statements of the company. Matters related to employees

of the company are dealt with by the vigilance department and are kept confidential and not subjected to audit. In the opinion

of the management there were no such matters that came to notice which required either disclosure or adjustments to the

standalone financial statements of the company.

30. In view of IRDAI circular no. IRDAI/NL/CIR/MOT/079/04/2020 dated April 02, 2020 and IRDAI/NL/CIR/MOT/090/04/2020

dated April 16, 2020, the Motor Thirty Party policies and IRDAI circular no. IRDAI/NL/CIR/MOT/078/04/2020 dated April 02,

2020 and IRDAI/NL/CIR/ MOT/091/04/2020 dated April 16, 2020 the Health policies which fell due for renewal from the 25th

March, 2020 up to the 3rd May, 2020 and who are unable to make payment of their renewal premium in time in view of the

prevailing situation in the country as a result of COVID-19, were allowed to make such payment for renewal of policies to

their insurers on or before the 15th May, 2020 to ensure continuity of insurance cover from the date on which the policy falls

due for renewal, so that any valid claim triggered during the grace period could be paid.

Accordingly, the Company has issued 19313 Motor Third party policies with premium of ₹ 1,190.84 lakhs and 9038 health

policies with premium of ₹ 1,249.02 lakhs, due for renewal till 31.03.2020. Impact on profits for the year ended March 31,

2020 is not material and hence not considered in the standalone financial statements.

31. Final dividend for FY 2018-19: During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company has paid final dividend for the year

2018-19 of ₹ 24,720.00 lakhs and the corresponding Dividend Distribution Tax was ₹ 5,081.27 lakhs.

32. The IPO expenses incurred by the Company during financial year 2017-18 amounting to ₹ 538.75 lakhs which were shown

as recoverable from Central Government has been adjusted against Share Premium Reserve during the year, as this amount

was no more recoverable from Central Government.

33. The IRDAI vide its Circular Ref No. IRDAI/F&A/CIR/MISC/099/04/2020 dt. April 24, 2020 which stated - “In view of the

emerging market conditions, and to conserve capital with the Insurance companies in the interests of policyholders and of

the economy at large, Insurers are urged to take a conscious call to refrain from dividend pay-outs from profits pertaining to

the financial year ending March 31, 2020, till further instructions. This position shall be reassessed by the Authority based on

financial results of insurers for the quarter ending September 30, 2020”

In light of the above IRDAI circular, the Company has not proposed any dividend for the financial year ended 31.03.2020.

34. World Health Organization declared outbreak of COVID-19 as a Pandemic on March 11, 2020. The economic impact of the

pandemic is largely disruptive for the entire world. The outbreak, which started in India in March 2020, is likely to continue for

more time.

As the pandemic is still not under control, General Insurance business will be impacted in FY 2020-21. Motor insurance

business is showing negative growth as not many new vehicles are being sold. Delay in commencement of new projects

can have impact on the property line of business. The overall sluggish economic growth can affect other lines of businesses

though they are not major ones. The overall premium growth in FY 2020-21 may hence be under pressure. However,

Covid-19 has increased awareness on the need for a health cover. The proactive steps of the Government and the Regulator

in introducing health / COVID-19 related products are expected to result in growth in health insurance business.

Equity market was adversely affected due to outbreak of COVID-19 in India in March 2020. The impact of the same is

already reflected in the company’s balance sheet as decrease in fair value change account. However, the market has started

showing signs of revival now. In the opinion of the Company, there is no need for any provision for the decline in equity as

on 31st March 2020. Investment income in FY 2020-21, may decline due to RBI reducing the interest rates and companies

reducing dividend pay-outs to conserve their resources.

In foreign operations, Motor and property business have been impacted during the last quarter of FY 2019-20. Due to

relaxation of lockdown in some areas, few territories are expected to resume to normalcy in the second quarter of FY

2020-21 but others may take some more time to get back to normal. Receivable in these territories may get delayed due to

continued lockdown; however, the management does not foresee any difficulty in recovering these amounts at this stage.:
