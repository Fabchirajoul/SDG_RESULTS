Dear Shareholders,

I am writing to you in truly unusual

times. The markets and the economy

had its ups and downs, but overall

seemed to be yet another year of

progress and development for most

parts of FY 19-20. The last quarter,

though, took a completely different

turn with the declaration of novel

coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as

a pandemic. The resultant lockdowns

took the world by storm and

reset priorities.:

Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

I am happy to once again share your Company’s annual performance.

We have seen healthy growth in profits and have been able to hold on to

a high market share in this rapidly-developing industry. Of course, we are

living through some precarious times, something no one could have ever

anticipated. We have had all possible risk management measures in place,

including a well laid out Business Continuity Plan (BCP), which we have

periodically been testing for any potential threats.

We would like to highlight that our

business

is

fully

functional

and

continues the way it has been despite

the lockdown. We took necessary steps

well ahead of time, to mitigate any risk

to our employees and customers, and

closed our sales and service branches.

At the start of the pandemic we

decided to quickly activate our BCP.

Our first priority was to ensure that all

critical functions worked seamlessly

from any location and that we were

able to also adhere to all regulatory

timelines.

Our

entire

team

was

provided

with

Work

from

Home

(WFH) infrastructure and continued

to engage with customers, partners

and

service

providers.

We

have

been successfully

working

with

our partners and service delivery

providers

remotely

utilising

our

cloud-based infrastructure.

“

”

We continue to

focus on effective

use of technology

to improve our

customers' user

experience and

make transacting

more convenient.
