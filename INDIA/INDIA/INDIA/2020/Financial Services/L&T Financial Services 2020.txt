Dear Shareholders,

Even as I write this, the global economy is being challenged like never

before, as economic activities and growth are being obstructed by the

ruthless pandemic. Life and lifestyles across the world are undergoing

a radical change — one that no one intimated us about or prepared

us for. As we fight each day adjusting to the new normal, most of us

cannot help but think of our lives after this crisis blows over. These are

difficult times and we must prepare to embrace the radical changes

in our lives and the way we work. A key lesson from this crisis has

been the need to re-strategise and adapt — at the organisation as

well as individual levels. It calls for designing a new plan of action

and adjusting to the new realities — rapidly and responsibly. As you

know, NBFCs play a critical role in the nation’s economic development

by providing a fillip to transportation, employment generation,

infrastructure development, wealth creation, credit delivery even

in the remotest corners of the country, and seamless funding for

small businesses, start-ups and MSMEs. They encourage micro-

entrepreneurship and imbue self-reliance by attending to various

financial needs of the unbanked. That is why the contribution of the

NBFC sector to the overall credit in the Indian economy rose to 19% in

FY19 from 12.8% in FY14. There is no doubt that these difficult times

have slowed us down, but they cannot diminish the sector’s importance

in nation-building. The long-term prospects for highly rated and good

quality NBFCs remains robust, and once things get back to normal, the

segment will continue to catalyse India’s economic growth.

This unprecedented phase in our lives is as much about rational

decision-making to prioritise sustainable practices in order to tide over

the uncertainties of the new normal as it is about fast-forwarding

our transition into the digital era. As futurist Roy Amara once said,

we tend to overestimate the impact of technology in the short run

and underestimate it in the long run. While we may be excited about

exponential technologies today, their applications in the long term

will transform us to abundance. I am glad to inform you that your

Company has been ahead of the curve by building a strong culture

of using digital and data analytics to streamline its credit-decisioning,

putting in place an institutionalised process of algorithmic lending.

Since 2017, your Company does not have any human intervention

when it comes to credit appraisals and sanctions for majority of

our businesses. It is all done by an AI-driven algorithm, which has

resulted in better asset quality and repayments, and a considerable

improvement in our turnaround time (TAT) to about 45 seconds in

some cases. Your Company is also prepared to fill the gap created by

the pandemic and is ready to push a completely new thinking driven by

exponential technologies.

Challenging times

Tough times invariably test a Company’s fortitude and sustainability.

It sure tested your Company’s mettle as well throughout FY20. It

presented us with a challenging macro-economic environment,

which worsened in the last two weeks of the financial year on

account of COVID-19. The overall business environment remained

subdued with demand slackening across high-growth sectors.

There was a visible slowdown in manufacturing activities, while

the services segment grew moderately. The GDP growth for FY20

plummeted to a 4.2%, as against the 6.1% in FY19. The only

exception was the rural economy, which emerged as a winner,

backed by favourable policy measures, healthy water-reservoir levels,

and increased sowing of Rabi crops.

Most NBFCs continued to face their own set of challenges: liquidity

and solvency issues, rising borrowing costs and limited funding

access. Therefore, lenders across all genres strongly preferred high-

rated NBFCs, such as your Company, with sound fundamentals,

strong parentage and high credit ratings. Despite the difficult

conditions in the economy, your Company remained strong because

of its robust business model.

I am proud to state that your Company, by the virtue of its proactive

and prudent strategies, remained alert while displaying its resilience

to ensure business continuity. I am equally happy to state that your

Company retained its leadership position amongst the principal

financiers across its focused businesses in FY20.

Apart from retaining our market share across businesses, your

Company also gained some in Two-Wheeler and Farm Equipment

segments. It posted satisfactory results barring the last few days of

March 2020, which witnessed a slowdown in disbursements and

collections owing to the nationwide lockdown.

Creating value for perpetuity

How we respond to a situation is an indicator of how well-

prepared we are even before it occurs. For your Company, most

of its strategies revolve around the ultimate goal to create value

for perpetuity. It is a shield that protects your Company from

unanticipated events. Over the past few years, your Company has

worked continuously towards building resilience. We understand our

markets and its uncertainties. Therefore, your Company consciously

decided to focus more on areas under its control — to withstand the

toughest of storms.

Your Company has worked on building efficiency in running down

the defocused portfolio; improving the ability to maintain NIMs and

fees in difficult conditions; boosting the capability to raise funds from

diverse sources at competitive costs; deploying right technological

resources for data analytics, risk management and early-warning

signals; making adequate provisioning, including for COVID-19;

enhancing execution abilities and TAT in delivering last-mile finance;

maintaining a robust portfolio quality; and last, but not the least,

consistently generating top-quartile RoE.

In line with prudent provisioning norms, your Company created

additional COVID-19 provisions of ` 209 Cr and also created

enhanced ECL provisions of ` 105 Cr on stage 2 assets. The

above provisions are in addition to the existing macro prudential

provisions of ` 350 Cr which highlight the underlying strength of

balance sheet. Together, these steps have helped your Company

considerably improve the asset quality and reach a potential that

has transformed it into a confident, competent, and consistent

organisation. As a result of these sustained efforts, your Company’s

AAA credit ratings were reaffirmed by India Ratings and CRISIL in

April and May 2020, respectively.

Life post COVID-19

FY21 will experience the impact of COVID-19 in the areas of

demand pickup, credit culture, repayment capacity and willingness

to pay. While we anticipate strong recoveries in rural India, there

may be a slow pick-up in the real estate and infrastructure financing

segments. Your Company is further leveraging its technology

infrastructure to strengthen its data analytics and increase

collections. Apart from doing stringent project monitoring, your

Company has also introduced tighter credit norms for fresh business

disbursements and undertaken several cost-rationalisation measures

for the overall enhancement of its business efficiencies.

Team

Your team is undergoing a swift and quick change in the wake of

the coronavirus outbreak. This process of transformation would

not have been possible without its 23,000+ employees across the

board. The team has consistently risen to the challenge and ensured

continued operating success. Even during the lockdown, and while

working remotely, the team displayed the same level of spirit and

energy as before. For this, I would like to sincerely thank the team

for their enormous contributions. I hope we continue working

together and moving forward with the same collective commitment,

passion and consistent engagement.

Sustainability and community well-being

Remaining true to our tenet of financing a sustainable future, your

Company’s investments into Renewable Energy are made keeping

in mind the imperatives of climate change and the increasing Indian

energy demand. Through the vast footprint of our rural lending

business, your Company is enabling entrepreneurship and self

reliance for the hard working men and women of our country.

The Company’s community engagement programme – Digital

Sakhi – aims at promoting women empowerment and nurturing

an ecosystem of digital financial transactions. Similarly, your

Company continued to work towards the improvement of water

availability in stressed areas through the Integrated Water Resource

Management (IWRM) system – Jalvaibhav – aimed at promoting

water-conservation techniques. We consistently monitor our social

investments and ensure that the best social value is delivered to the

communities.

Closing thoughts

In the end, I would like to extend my gratitude to our management

team, employees, bankers and all our stakeholders for their

commitment and contribution towards the growth of your

Company. Further, I would also like to show my appreciation for my

fellow Directors for providing us with valuable guidance amidst this

tough operating environment. I would like to offer my gratitude to

our loyal shareholders for their continued support. I assure you that

your Company will use all the lessons thrown up by this adversity

and continue driving ahead towards building a more resilient

and enduring organisation. We remain on the path to create an

organisation that delivers value to all stakeholders, for perpetuity.

After all, the best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best

today.

PARTICULARS OF CONTRACTS OR ARRANGEMENTS

WITH RELATED PARTIES

The Board of Directors has approved the policy on

transactions with related parties (“RPT Policy”),

pursuant to the recommendation of the AC. In line with

the requirements of the Act, RBI Regulations and the

SEBI Listing Regulations, the Company has formulated

the RPT Policy which is also available on the Company’s

website at www.ltfs.com/investors.html. The RPT Policy

intends to ensure that proper reporting, approval and

disclosure processes are in place for all transactions

between the Company and the related parties.

Key features of the RPT Policy are as under:

•

All transactions with related parties (“RPTs”) are

referred to the AC of the Company for approval,

irrespective of its materiality. The AC, also approves

any subsequent modification in the RPTs. The

process of approval of RPTs by the Audit Committee,

Board and Shareholders is as under:

a) Audit Committee:

All RPTs irrespective of whether they are in the

ordinary course of business or at an arm’s length

basis require approval of Audit Committee.

b) Board:

Generally, all RPTs are in the ordinary course of

business and at arm’s length price.

RPTs which are not at arm’s length and which

are not in the ordinary course of business are

approved by the Board.

c) Shareholders:

All material RPTs require prior approval of the

shareholders, based on recommendation of

the Board, through ordinary resolution passed

at the general meeting. However, approval

of the shareholders would not be required to

be obtained by the Company if the proposed

transaction is to be entered into with its wholly

owned subsidiaries.

Where any contract or arrangement is entered

into by a director or any other employee

without obtaining the consent of the Board or

approval by ordinary resolution in the general

meeting, it is to be ratified by the Board or the

shareholders at a meeting, as the case may be,

within three months from the date on which

such contract or arrangement was entered into.

•

All RPTs that were entered into during FY 2019-20

were on an arm’s length basis and were in the

ordinary course of business and disclosed in the

Financial Statements. There were no materially

significant RPTs made by the Company with

Promoters, Directors, KMPs or Body Corporate(s),

which had a potential conflict with the interest of

the Company at large. Accordingly, the disclosure

of RPTs as required under the provisions of Section:

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2020

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1.1 Statement of compliance:

The Consolidated financial statements of L&T

Finance Holdings Limited (the “Company”)

and its subsidiaries and associates (together the

“Group”) have been prepared in accordance

with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013

and the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)

notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time

to time) issued by Ministry of Corporate Affairs

in exercise of the powers conferred by section

133 read with sub-section (1) of section 210A

of the Companies Act, 2013. In addition, the

applicable regulations of Reserve Bank of Indi (RBI)

/National Housing Bank (NHB) and the guidance

notes/announcements issued by the Institute of

Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) are also

applied.

1.2 Basis of preparation:

The consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on the historical cost basis except for

certain financial instruments that are measured at

fair values at the end of each reporting period.

Fair value measurements under Ind AS are

categorized into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the

degree to which the inputs to the fair value

measurements are observable and the significance

of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its

entirety, which are described as follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in

active markets for identical assets or liabilities

that the Group can access at reporting date

•

Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted

prices included within level 1, that are

observable for the asset or liability, either

directly or indirectly.

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the

valuation of assets or liabilities

1.3 Presentation of financial statements:

The Balance Sheet and the Statement of Profit

and Loss are prepared and presented in the

format prescribed in the Division III of Schedule

III to the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

applicable for Non-Banking Finance Companies

(“NBFC”). The Statement of Cash Flows has been

prepared and presented as per the requirements

of Ind AS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”. The

disclosure requirements with respect to items

in the Balance Sheet and Statement of Profit

and Loss, as prescribed in the Schedule III to

the Act, are presented by way of notes forming

part of the financial statements along with the

other notes required to be disclosed under the

notified accounting Standards and the SEBI

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)

Regulations, 2015.

Amounts in the financial statements are presented

in Indian Rupees in Crore rounded off to two

decimal places as permitted by Schedule III to

the Companies Act, 2013. Per share data are

presented in Indian Rupee to two decimal places.

1.4 Basis of consolidation:

a) The

consolidated

financial

statements

incorporate the financial statements of the

Parent Company and its subsidiaries. For

this purpose, an entity which is, directly or

indirectly, controlled by the Parent Company

is treated as subsidiary. The Parent Company

together with its subsidiaries constitute the

Group. Control is achieved when the Group,

directly or indirectly:

•

has power over the investee.

•

is exposed, or has rights, to variable

returns from its involvement with the

investee; and

•

has the ability to use its power to affect

its returns.

b) The Group reassesses whether or not it

controls an investee if facts and circumstances

indicate that there are changes to one or more

of the three elements of control listed above.

c) Profit or loss and each component of other

comprehensive income are attributed to

the owners of the Parent Company and

to the non-controlling interests (NCI) and

have been shown separately in the financial

statements. Total comprehensive income of

the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners

of the Parent Company and to the non-

controlling interests even if this results in

the non-controlling interests having a deficit

balance.

d) Where necessary, adjustments are made to

the financial statements of subsidiaries to

bring their accounting policies into line with

the Group’s accounting policies. The financial

statements of all entities used for the purpose

of consolidation are drawn up to same

reporting date as that of the Parent Company.

e) All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity,

income, expenses, unrealised profits/losses

and cash flows relating to transactions

between the members of the Group are

eliminated on consolidation.

f)

The consolidated financial statements of the

Group combine financial statements of the

Parent Company and its subsidiaries line-

by-line by adding together the like items of

assets, liabilities, income and expenses.:

Managing Director of the Company together constitute the Chief Operating

Decision Makers (“CODM”) which allocate resources to and assess the performance of the segments of the

Company.

The Group has identified business segments as its primary segment and geographic segments as its secondary

segment. Business segments are primarily Rural, Housing, Infrastructure, Defocused and Other businesses.

Revenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under each reportable segment. Expenses

which are not directly attributable to each reportable segment have been allocated on the basis of associated

revenue of the segment and manpower efforts. All other expenses which are not attributable or allocable

to segments have been disclosed as others. Assets and liabilities that are directly attributable or allocable to

segments are disclosed under each reportable segment, Tax assets and liabilites are disclosed as Unallocated

and all other assets and liabilities are disclosed as others. The composition of the reportable segments is as

follows:

(i) Rural finance comprises of farm equipment finance, two wheeler finance, micro loans and consumer

finance.

(ii) Housing finance comprises of home loans, loan against property and real estate finance.

(iii) Infrastructure finance comprises of infrastructure business.

(iv) Defocused business comprises of structured corporate loans, debt capital market, commercial vehicle

finance, construction equipment finance, sme term loans and leases.

(v) Others comprises of asset management, wealth management etc.

(vi) Unallocated represents tax assets and tax liabilities.
