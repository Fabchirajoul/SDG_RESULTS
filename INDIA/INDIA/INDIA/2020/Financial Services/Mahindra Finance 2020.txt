Company are through NGOs, proper care is taken to

ensure that the NGOs selected are able to execute

the programs efficiently. The Company has a due

diligence process for some of the major projects

undertaken and one of the key parameters of

evaluation of the NGOs is the number of partnerships

the NGO has and the nature of the partnerships it

has with the government, other corporates and

local communities.

During the year under review, Mahindra Finance

CSR Foundation has been incorporated as a wholly-

owned subsidiary of the Company registered under

Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to promote
