| Annual Report 2019-20:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to place before you the highlights

of your Bank’s performance during the financial year 2019-20.

Details of the achievements and initiatives taken by your Bank

are provided in the enclosed Annual Report for the year 2019-20.

ECONOMIC OVERVIEW

World economy witnessed slow growth of 2.9% in 2019 compared

to 3.6% in the previous year. Both emerging and developing

market economies as well as the advanced economies slowed

down. While weak external demand dragged down the Euro

zone growth, tight monetary conditions and domestic policy

uncertainty in developing countries contributed to slow growth

momentum. China experienced its slowest growth amidst weak

domestic demand and trade skirmish with the US.

Global trade also experienced a setback with goods and

services trade growth below 1%, with exports and imports of

emerging markets being sharply hit. Meanwhile, supportive

monetary policies, diminished trade tensions and nascent signs

of stabilization of global economy provided necessary support

to financial markets early this year. However, the financial

volatility has significantly increased since March after the spread

of Covid-19 pandemic. Decline in asset and commodity prices

and drop in equity market has reached unprecedented levels.

Moreover, uncertainty around the prospect of production cuts

keeps oil price under pressure.

Against this backdrop, India’s growth in FY2020 moderated to

4.2% with lockdown related to Covid-19 impairing economic

activity in the last quarter (Jan-Mar’20). Looking ahead, the

outlook of the global economy has become very uncertain and

world is likely to experience a deep rooted recession next year. As

per RBI, Indian economy also is likely to witness a contraction in

FY2021. However, low oil prices will help in improving our external

balance, with India likely to experience current account surplus

despite an expected slump in exports due to falling world demand.

YOUR BANK'S PERFORMANCE

DEPOSITS GROWTH

In FY20, your Bank’s total deposits grew at a faster rate of

11.34%, compared to ASCB’s growth of 7.9%, to ` 32,41,621

crore from the previous year’s level of ` 29,11,386 crore. This

high growth in deposits pushed your Bank’s market share up by

46 bps to 22.84%. The foreign offices deposits grew by 20.45%

to ` 1,17,005 crore, while domestic deposits grew by 11.03%

to ` 31,24,616 crore. The term deposits grew at a faster rate of

12.23%, compared to CASA growth of 9.61%. While, your Bank

has maintained its robust CASA ratio at 45.16% in FY20.

CREDIT GROWTH

In line with the ASCBs decline in credit growth to 58-years low of

6.1% in FY20, your Bank’s domestic advances grew by 3.75% to

` 20,65,484 crore, while the foreign offices advances grew at a

robust pace of 18.05% to ` 3,57,360 crore. Therefore, the gross

advances of your Bank grew by 5.64% to the level of ` 24,22,845

crore in FY20 from the previous year level of ` 22,93,454 crore.

Much of the growth in domestic advances came from Personal

segment (Retail Per) including Home Loans. Overall, the

Personal loans showed a robust growth of 15.40% to ` 7,47,589

crore in FY20 which is in line with the Bank’s strategy towards

this segment. Within retail, Home Loans and Xpress credit grew

substantially by 13.86% to ` 4,55,865 crore and 34.64% to `

1,41,243 crore respectively in FY20. The growth in Xpress credit

is mainly driven by our YONO and INB platforms. Your Bank’s

Home Loan & Xpress credit portfolio now constitutes around

80% of the Personal loans.

However, Corporate Loan book has declined marginally by

-0.87% to `, 8,44,215 crore in FY20, which is in line with the

banking industry’s growth trend. Major share of the credit went

into sectors such as Infrastructure (Power, Roads & Ports) and

Services especially Commercial Real Estate and NBFCs. The

Corporate Loan book accounts 38.9% share of PSUs/Govt.

sector or the GoI undertakings. With the decline in credit to

corporates, the share of Retail segment (Personal, SME & Agri)

in the domestic loan book has increased to 59.13% from 57.22%

last year.

INVESTMENTS

Your Bank’s investment portfolio increased to ` 10,58,048 crore

(domestic portfolio was ` 10,10,599 crore and foreign portfolio

was ` 47,449 crore) in FY20 compared to ` 9,78,124 crore in

FY19, with the rise in SLR investments.

CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE

Your Bank’s various activities are centred on improving customer

experience by ensuring the seamless delivery of products and

services. For this your Bank has created the highest number

of touchpoints in terms of branches and other modes. The

Bank has 61,102 operating BCs, around 22,100 branches and

58,555 ATMs including 13,270 Automated Deposit & Withdrawal

Machines (ADWMs). Nearly 28% of the financial transactions of

your Bank are routed through ATMs/ADWMs. On an average,

over 1.23 crore transactions per day are routed through your

Bank’s ATM network.

Your Bank’s first global footprint was with the branch of Bank

of Madras in Colombo, Sri Lanka in July, 1864 (first amongst

Indian banks). With presence across all time zones through

233 offices in 32 countries, State Bank of India has gradually

spread its wings across the globe and has become a pioneer of

International Banking among the Indian PSBs. During FY2020,

your Bank has consolidated its overseas operations to achieve

capital conservation, cost efficiencies and synergies in the

overseas markets. Your Bank has rationalised its overseas

operations by closing four branches and further merging four

branches into two.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION

SBI has been incorporating technological advancements to

improve its back-end processes which in turn are helping

to deliver more efficient customer service. Your Bank has re-

engineered its internal processes to improve risk management

and encourage growth.

GLOBAL PRESENCE

Your Bank’s first global footprint was

with the branch of Bank of Madras in

Colombo, Sri Lanka in July 1864 (First

amongst Indian Banks). With a presence

across all time zones through 233 offices

in 32 countries, your Bank has gradually

spread its wings across the globe and

has become a pioneer of International

Banking among the Indian PSBs. These

offices are being managed by the IBG.

During

FY2020,

your

Bank

has

consolidated its overseas operations

to achieve capital conservation, cost

efficiencies and synergies in overseas

markets. Your Bank has rationalised its

overseas operations by closing four

branches-

Nassau

(Bahamas),

Paris

(France), Jeddah (Saudi Arabia), Tianjin

(China) and merged two branches-

Gulshan (with Dhaka, Bangladesh) and

Verdun Road (With Little India, Singapore).

During this period, a Sub-Office was

started in Melbourne to increase our

share in remittance and Trade Finance

business. Representative Office at Paris

and an extension counter at Motijheel

(Bangladesh) were also operationalized.

Also, 6 India Visa Application Centres

(IVAACs) were opened in Bangladesh

at Thakurgaon, Brahmanbaria, Comilla,

Sathkira, Bogura and Naokhali. Further,

in line with your Bank’s growth strategy in

SAARC region, Nepal SBI Bank Limited,

a subsidiary of your Bank has opened 22

offices. Thus, 9 foreign offices of SBI and

23 offices of overseas subsidiaries have

been added during the FY2020.

| Annual Report 2019-20:

Managing Director, supported

by Deputy: Managing

Managing Director, works under the

guidance and supervision of the Audit

Committee of the Board. Your Bank’s IA

function works in close co-ordination with

the Risk Management and Compliance

Departments to evaluate effectiveness of

controls, assess compliance with controls

and adherence to internal processes and

procedures. The IA function undertakes

a comprehensive risk-based audit of

the operating units of your Bank, in line

with regulatory guidelines relating to Risk

Based Supervision.

Keeping pace with rapid digitalisation in

your Bank, the IA function has initiated

technological interventions for providing

enhanced efficiency and effectiveness

through system driven and analytics-

based audits.

Some

key

initiatives

include

the

following:

z Web based, online Risk Focused

Internal Audit (RFIA) for assessing

compliance

with

controls

at

a

granular level.

z Analytics

based,

continuous

assessment of compliable controls

through remote evaluation of huge

data.

z System driven, analytics based off-

site monitoring of transactions.

z Concurrent Audit of business units

to ensure contemporaneous scrutiny

of compliances.

z Early review of sanctions to assess

quality of loans of `1 crore & above.

z Online self-audit by branches for

self-assessment by branches and

vetting by controllers.

As

part

of

RFIA,

IA

Department

conducts various audits, viz. Credit

Audit, Information Systems Audit, Cyber

Security

Audit,

Home

Office

Audit

(audit of foreign offices), Concurrent

Audit, FEMA Audit, Audit of Outsourced

Activities of your Bank, Expenditure Audit

and Compliance Audit.

Your Bank has created a new wing at IAD

to strengthen the overview of the audit

of banks aggregate risk assessment

processes.

In

addition

to

this,

it

undertakes

Management Audit of business verticals

to assess their strategic effectiveness

and Thematic audits as per the directions

of the Audit Committee or the regulators.

Branch Audit

IA

Department

undertakes

critical

review of the operations of auditee units

through RFIA, an adjunct to Risk Based

Supervision, as per RBI directives.

The domestic branches are broadly

segregated into three groups (Group

I, II and III) based on business profile

and advances exposures. Your Bank

has initiated a system driven process

for identification of branches for audit,

whereby,

analytical

algorithms

are

deployed to identify units displaying

significantly

different

behavioural

patterns. This enables your Bank to step

in with a prioritised audit to identify

the causative factors at these outlier

branches and flag the underlying problem

areas for early intervention.

| Annual Report 2019-20:

letter and spirit. With these aims, a

Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

is put in place for determination of

Vigilance angle strictly based on

CVC guidelines.

4.

In terms of the existing guidelines of

CVC, Internal Advisory Committees

(IAC) have been constituted to

scrutinise the disciplinary cases

with a mandate to determine the

existence of Vigilance angle or

otherwise therein and extend their

correspondence advice to the CVO.

At present, a two-tier structure of

IACs exists in your Bank, that is,

one IAC at Corporate Centre, which

scrutinises the disciplinary cases

related to all officers of TEGS-VI and

above and cases relating to CCG/

CAG/IBG/PFSBU and the other IAC

each at every Circle to scrutinises

the cases related to the officers

up to scale-V and award staff at

Circles. As IACs are spread across

the geographies in your Bank, it is

observed at times that interpretive

divergences figure and incongruent

views arise on the discernibility

of vigilance angle even where the

lapses under consideration are of

similar gravity. In light of this, IACs

are centralised at Corporate Centre

so that any element of bias in the

categorisation of cases as Vigilance

or Non-Vigilance could be prevented.

An independent and centralised set-

up will bring in more objectivity in

decision-making and will also impart

singular focus in handling the cases

that ultimately leads to improved

timelines.

5.

Vigilance Department has conducted

214 preventive vigilance programmes

and trained 4,005 officers. Suo-Motu

investigations have been conducted

in 764 branches to ensure preventive

measures are made effective.

6.

During the FY2020, your Bank has

introduced

a

technology-based

VCTS

(Vigilance

Case

Tracking

System). VCTS application will be

able to generate MIS for timely

closure of cases. It will also capture

the history of cases for analysis of

Vigilance matter and to effectively

monitor the cases.

7.

During the FY2020, a total of 1,993

cases (including 1,278 new cases)

were taken up for examination, out of

which 1,185 cases have since been

closed.

7. ASSET AND LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT

Efficient Management of Assets and

Liabilities (ALM) is vital for sustainable

and qualitative growth of banks. The

ALM aims to strengthen the balance

sheet

by

proactively

reviewing

the

market dynamics, capturing the signals

emanating from there and assessing the

regulatory requirements to ensure value

creation.

As part of sound risk management

practices,

your

Bank

has

been

continuously

reviewing

its

internal

policies on ‘Deposits’, ‘Asset and Liability

Management’, ‘Stress Test on Liquidity

and Interest Rate Risks’, ‘Contingency

Funding Plan’ and adapting changes in

the market conditions. Your Bank has

been carrying out Reverse Stress Test

to take care of the eventual risk that may

crop up as a worst-case scenario.

Studies are conducted at regular intervals

to assess the behavioural pattern of

customers (embedded options available

to customers) to give proper treatment

to the non-contractual items of assets

and liabilities while determining liquidity

position. Behavioural analysis is also

carried out to ensure accurate positioning

of outflows and inflows on account

of off-balance sheet exposures, the

impact of probable loan losses, amongst

others, for reporting of liquidity and

interest rate sensitivity statements. The

prevailing assumptions relating to non-

contractual items of assets and liabilities

are periodically updated based on the

outcomes of the latest studies.

The stock of High-Quality Liquid Assets

(HQLA) and cash outflows are effectively

monitored daily under dynamic market

environment to ensure the maintenance

of LCR as prescribed by the Regulator as

well as Bank’s ALM Policy benchmarks.

Your Bank has proactively implemented

the NSFR guidelines of RBI measuring

the long-term resilience of your Bank in

terms of liquidity, which is coming into

force effective 1st April, 2020.
