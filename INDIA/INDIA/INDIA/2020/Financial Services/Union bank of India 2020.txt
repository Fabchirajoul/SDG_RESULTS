EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

Item No. 2: Set Off the Accumulated Losses of the

Bank as of 31st March, 2020

Pursuant to the Amalgamation of Andhra Bank and

Corporation Bank into Union Bank of India Scheme, 2020

issued by Central Government vide gazette notification

dated March 4, 2020, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank

have been amalgamated into Union Bank of India w.e.f.

1st April, 2020. Amalgamation was done to create more

efficient and bigger public sector bank in the changing

environment to meet the credit needs of a growing

economy and to achieve operational efficiency by scale

of business.

In view of the aforesaid, it deems fit that the amalgamated

entity shall begin on its new path with a true and fair view

of its financial position and thus, the Bank proposes to

set off the accumulated losses of Rs.32758,49,47,263.10

(Rupees Thirty Two Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty

Eight Crores Forty Nine Lacs Forty Seven Thousand Two:

Dear Shareholders,

The Board of Directors are pleased to present the 101st

Annual Report of the Bank for the Financial Year 2019-

20 together with the ‘Audited Balance Sheet’, ‘Profit &

Loss Account’, ‘Cash-Flow Statement’ and the report on

‘Management Discussion & Analysis’. The ‘Corporate

Governance Report’ and ‘Business Responsibility Report’

also form part of the Annual Report 2019-20.

1. Economy Overview:

1.1 In the year 2019-20, global growth recorded its

weakest pace since the global financial crisis a decade

ago, registering a growth of 2.9% in 2019 compared

to 3.6% in the previous year. Rising trade barriers

and associated uncertainty weighed on business

sentiment and activity globally. Both emerging and

developing market economies as well as advanced

economies slowed down.

1.2 Towards end of the financial year, global growth

has hit unprecedented depths of despair amidst

Covid-19 outbreak. Global Lockdown due to the

pandemic saw major indices of manufacturing and

services across countries declining to record lows on

the back of supply-side disruptions. Global energy

prices plunged, Equity and debt markets saw sell-

offs dramatically in March 2020 which led to crashing

of benchmark equity indices and tightening of

bond yields. Governments and Central Banks have

taken unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy

measures to mitigate the adverse impact of Covid-19.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects global

output in 2020 to contract by 3 per cent with output of

advanced countries contracting more than emerging

market and developing economies.

1.3 Turning to Indian economy, even before the onset of

Covid-19 pandemic, the country was experiencing

slowdown. The country’s GDP grew at 4.2% in FY 20

lower than that of 6.1% in FY19. Several fiscal and

monetary actions were initiated by the Government

and RBI respectively, to lessen the adverse impact on

financial system due to COVID-19 related disruptions.

1.4 On the policy front, the year saw many measures

undertaken by the government and the regulator.

On part of the government, a mega amalgamation

exercise was undertaken and 10 Public Sector Banks

(PSBs) were amalgamated into 4 large entities, and

your Bank is poised to emerge as the 5th largest PSB

in the country with amalgamation of Andhra Bank and

Corporation Bank into Union Bank of India, with effect

from 01.04.2020. Similarly, on the regulatory front, the

introduction of External Benchmark Linked Lending

Rates (EBLR) to all Retail Segments will go a long way

in improving the monetary transmission.

2. Bank’s Performance

Established in the year 1919, your Bank has 4,284

branches including 3 overseas branches, 6895 ATMs

across 29 States and 5 Union Territories and 37,318

employees as on March 31, 2020.

Key achievements during FY 2019-20:

Ø Net Interest Income for FY 20 increased by 12% Y-o-Y

to Rs.11437 crore.

Ø Operating profit for FY 20 increased by 22% Y-o-Y to

Rs.9181 crore.

Ø PCR improved to 73.64% as on March 31, 2020

compared to 66.24% as on March 31, 2019.

Ø Net NPA ratio declined to 5.49% as on March 31, 2020

from 6.85% as on March 31, 2019.

During FY 2019-20, your Bank has undergone many

transformations/ adopted new processes as given below.

2.1 Amalgamation:

Initiating major reforms in the PSBs, a mega

amalgamation exercise had been taken up in FY

2020. Accordingly, 10 PSBs have been amalgamated

into 4 Banks. As part of this initiative, Andhra Bank

and Corporation Bank have been amalgamated into

Union Bank of India, w.e.f. 01.04.2020, making the

amalgamated entity, the 5th largest PSB in the country.

The amalgamation exercise aims to reap the economies

of scale from increased branch network, customer

base and synergies on account of cost rationalization

& technological assimilation. After amalgamation,

your Bank shall become stronger with more than 9500

Branches, 13300 plus ATMs, an employee strength of

over 75,000 and with a customer base of over 120

million. The amalgamation will also provide impetus

for adoption of the best practices among the banks

to improve customer service, productivity, leading to

higher profitability.

2.2 EASE(Enhanced Access and Service Excellence):

Enhanced Access and Service Excellence (EASE)

was launched by Government of India in 2018-19 to

increase the efficiency of PSBs across every domain

and being measured on quarterly basis. For FY 2019-

20, EASE 2.0 was launched by Government of India

which is built on the foundation of EASE 1.0 and

introduces new reform Action Points across 6 themes

to strengthen processes and systems.

Under EASE 2.0. your Bank secured 4th position in:

letter and spirit. A detailed

report on Corporate Governance is given in a separate section of the Annual Report. The Corporate Governance

report for financial year 2019-20 has no audit qualifications.

16. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):

16.1 Your Bank is committed to its Corporate Social Responsibility by contributing to the society. In this endeavor, Bank

has set up the “Union Bank Social Foundation Trust (UBSFT) in the year 2006 for spearheading CSR activities.

During FY 2019-20, your Bank was unable to contribute any fund towards CSR as the Bank suffered a loss during

FY 2018-19.

16.2 However, UBSFT has disbursed donations amounting to Rs.163.49 lacs during FY 2019-20 from the surplus funds

of the previous years.

16.3 The major activities undertaken by UBSFT during the year are under sectors such as Rural Development, Healthcare,

Community development, Education, Environment, Skill development & Heritage preservation.

17. Acknowledgement:

The Board places on record its gratitude to the Government of India, Reserve Bank of India, Securities & Exchange

Board of India, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, Central Vigilance Commission and other

institutions for the valuable guidance and support received from them. The Board also acknowledges unstinted

support of the financial institutions, correspondent Banks, valuable shareholders, esteemed customers and all

other stakeholders. The Board also expresses its deep appreciation for the dedicated service and contribution

made by members of staff in the overall performance of the Bank.
