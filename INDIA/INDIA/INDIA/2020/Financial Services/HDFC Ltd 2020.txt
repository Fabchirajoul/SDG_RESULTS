and regulations.

Corporate Portfolio

The Corporation has an established credit appraisal procedure leading to appropriate identification of credit risk.

Appropriate appraisals have been established for various types of products and businesses. The methodology

involves critical assessment of quantitative and qualitative parameters subject to review and approval by

Sanctioning Committee of Management (COM).

Corporation carries out a detailed analysis of funding requirements, including normal capital expenses, long-

term working capital requirements and temporary imbalances in liquidity. A significant portion of Corporate

Finance loans are secured by a lien over appropriate assets of the borrower.

Borrower risk is evaluated by considering:

• the risks and prospects associated with the industry in which the borrower is operating (industry risk);

• the financial position of the borrower by analysing the quality of its financial statements, its past financial

performance, its financial flexibility in terms of ability to raise capital and its cash flow adequacy (financial

risk);

• the borrower’s relative market position and operating efficiency (business risk);

• the quality of management by analysing their track record, payment record and financial conservatism

(management risk); and

• the risks with respect to specific projects, both pre-implementation, such as construction risk and funding

risk, as well as post-implementation risks such as industry, business, financial and management risks

related to the project (project risk).

For Lease rental discounting, the risk assessment procedure include:

• Carrying out a detailed analysis of lease rental receivables and the timing of the payments based on an

exhaustive analysis of Cash flow structure; and:

letter of intent is issued to the

borrower, which outlines the principal financial terms of the proposed facility, sponsor obligations, conditions

precedent to disbursement, undertakings from and covenants on the borrower.

After completion of all formalities by the borrower, a loan agreement is entered into with the borrower.

Project finance loans are generally fully secured and have full recourse against the borrower. In most cases,

the Corporation has a security interest and first lien on all the fixed assets. Security interests typically include

property, plant and equipment as well as other tangible assets of the borrower, both present and future. The

Corporation also takes additional credit comforts such as corporate or personal guarantees from one or more

sponsors of the project.

The Corporation requires the borrower to submit periodic reports and continue to monitor the credit exposure

until loans are fully repaid.

Further since both Lease Rental Discounting and Construction Finance Facilities are mostly serviced from

receivables from the projects/property financed, all the cash flows are charged to the Corporation, and are

ring fenced by way of Escrow mechanism. Under this mechanism all such receivables flow into Escrow Account

from where amounts are directly credited into the Corporation’s account.

Retail Loans

Our customers for retail loans are primarily low, middle and high-income, salaried and self-employed individuals.

The Corporation’s credit officers evaluate credit proposals on the basis of active credit policies as on the date

of approval. The criteria typically include factors such as the borrower’s income & obligations, the loan-to-value

ratio and demographic parameters subject to regulatory guidelines. Any deviations need to be approved at

the designated levels.

The various process controls such as PAN Number Check, CERSAI database scrubbing, Credit Bureau Report

analysis are undertaken prior to approval of a loan. In addition External agencies such as field investigation

agencies facilitate a comprehensive due diligence process including visits to offices and homes.

The Corporation analyses the portfolio performance of each product segment regularly, and use

these as inputs in revising our product programs, target market definitions and credit assessment

criteria to meet our twin objectives of combining volume growth and maintenance of asset quality.

Retail loans are secured by the mortgage of the borrowers property.

Risk Management and Portfolio Review

The Corporation ensures effective monitoring of credit facilities through a risk-based asset review

framework under which the frequency of asset review is determined depending on the risk associated

with the product.:
