deaR StakehoLdeRS,

These are uncertain times, and

we are doing our best to combat

the COVID-19 crisis, which has

severely impacted millions of lives

and livelihoods in all parts of the

world. However, we are hopeful of

an early reboot and revival of India’s

economy, with the help and support

of the Government of India and

the regulators.

I am glad to serve your Bank as

the Part-time Chairman; and it

is my privilege to be at the helm

of a rapidly growing institution.

As you all know, our mission is to

provide a wide range of financial

services to empower all sections of

society, especially the ‘economically

active’ poor, and remain committed

to building financial inclusion

in the country.

Despite challenges in the operating

environment, financial year 2019-20

saw us grow our physical and digital

outreach significantly. During the

year, we offered more products

and services to our customers,

and strengthened our Board by

adding new Board members.

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINg (“ipo”)

The Bank undertook an IPO that

was oversubscribed ~170 times.

this reflects the faith that retail and

esteemed institutional investors

have placed in our vision and

strategies. Our IPO in 2019 is now

widely considered to be the best IPO

of the past four years in the banking

and financial services sector.

the team put in significant efforts

to comply with the regulatory

guidelines and made this possible.

I thank all members of the team for

their commitment and efforts.

dRivinG FinanciaL

incLUSion

Financial inclusion has always been

a key priority of the Government

of India and the Reserve Bank of

India (RBI). The banking sector,

and ‘priority sector’ lending

has been the most explored

channels to bring majority of the

population under the ambit of

formal credit institutions. The

RBI granted ‘small finance bank’

licences in the year 2015 to make

banking services accessible and

affordable to the unserved and

underserved segments through

saving instruments; and providing

credit to small business units, small

and marginal farmers, micro and

small industries, and other

unorganised sectors.

In a short time span, we have

emerged as one of India’s leading

small finance banks in terms

of deposits, advances, branch

network and geographic spread.

today, we offer a comprehensive

suite of asset and liability

products and services that helps

attract new customers and

deepen our relationship with our

existing customers.

peopLe aRe oUR pRioRitY

We remain resolute in our ‘people

first’ approach, nurturing and

developing talent. Our focus has

always been on upskilling our

people. This led us to introduce

certified programmes like SFB

Certification by Indian Institute

of Banking and Finance (IIBF),

It certifications by Institute for

Development and Research in

Banking Technology (IDRBT) to our

people. During the year, we also

introduced several programmes on

SWAY@M, a self-paced learning tool

on different aspects of banking.

We have formulated and

implemented Ujjivan Small

Finance Bank-Employee Stock

Option Plan 2019, and Ujjivan

Small Finance Bank-Employee

Stock Purchase Scheme 2019, to

recognise and reward the effort

and commitment of our people, for

their association and performance

as well as to motivate them to

contribute to the growth and

profitability of the Bank.

LeadeRShip chanGe

During the year under review,

our founder Mr. Samit Kumar Ghosh

retired from his position as the: Managing

deaR ShaRehoLdeRS,

I am honoured to be a part of the

Ujjivan family, which commenced

its journey as a microfinance

institution 15 years ago, and

gradually forayed into banking

a pan-India outreach.

With a deep sense of responsibility,

Root Cause Analysis:

Dear Stakeholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Ujjivan

Small Finance Bank Limited (the “Bank or Ujjivan”), it is

our immense pleasure to present the 4th Annual Report

of the Bank along with the Audited Financial Statements

and Auditor’s Report thereon for the financial year ended

March 31, 2020.

Overview anD State Of affairS Of

the Bank

the financial year ended March 31, 2020, saw the

Bank continuing its track of growth, expansion and

profitability. the Bank closed the financial year on a

good note, delivering healthy performance in asset and

retail deposit businesses, maintaining a stable portfolio

quality, resulting in bottom line numbers in line with the

expectations. The business growth had moderated in the

third and the fourth quarters of the financial year as the

Bank had taken a cautious approach towards microfinance

lending in certain pockets including Indian state of Assam,

West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and parts

of North-East India where delinquencies were higher

due to natural calamities and other external factors.

The Bank also took a measured approach towards its

Micro and Small Enterprises (“MSE Business”) lending in

certain stressed pockets and limited its exposure to Non-

Banking Financial Companies (“NBFCs”) in its Financial

Institutional Group (“FIG”) lending business. With the

nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of

COVID-19 in the last week of March, 2020, the business

volumes for the month were significantly affected.

overall business traction was good during the financial

year, with a 28% Y-o-Y growth in the Assets under

Management (AuM). the Bank witnessed significant

Y-o-Y growth in its Housing Business (84%) and MSe

Business (66%) coupled with sustained growth in

microfinance book (17%). the FIG (Institutional) lending

recorded remarkable growth (144%) while the personal

loan business incepted last year gradually scaled up till

Quarter 3 when the Bank decided to re- align its credit

policies post a thorough portfolio quality review. the

Bank also forayed into a new business segment – Vehicle

Finance, starting with 2 wheeler loans for existing

customers and staff in select locations.

In response to the ‘CoVID-19 – Regulatory package’

announced by Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on March 27,

2020, the Bank provided moratorium for all segments of

customers, deferring the repayments for ~ 99 % of the

loan accounts. The RBI dispensation granted on Non-

performing asset classification of the portfolio under

repayment moratorium helped prevent any spike in credit

costs. Also, the Bank made a prudential provision to the

tune of `70 Crores in view of the CoVID-19 situation.

the Bank’s deposits book saw a 46% Y-o-Y growth,

largely driven by a healthy growth in retail deposits which

grew from 37% of total deposits in March, 2019 to 44%

at the end of March, 2020, with good traction in Current

Account Saving Account (“CASA”). Bank’s CASA balances

(as a % of total deposits) increased from 11% to 14%.

Committed to providing a comprehensive suite of

products and services to its customers, the Bank

expanded its bouquet of offerings during the year under

review. Kisan pragati Card was launched to primarily

cater to the financing needs of customers engaged

in agriculture and allied activities and Business Edge

product, targeted at the formal segment, was launched

for MSE customers. Privileged Savings Account product

with additional features and Rupay platinum card for

business and current account customers were launched

to diversify the deposit product offerings. the Bank

initiated Goal based deposits for the microfinance

customers and their families. The Bank also launched

digital saving and term deposit products for better

customer convenience and efficient onboarding besides

rolling out Internet Banking, UPI and QR code based

payment solutions during the year.

The Bank launched a digital evangelism program

to increase adoption of digital channels among its

customers. Neighbourhood cash collection points were

piloted and centre meeting deposits were launched

for Micro Banking customers and their families to

promote active usage of the accounts by providing

convenient alternative channels for transactions. For

better customer convenience, the Bank’s mobile banking

application has been developed in 9 (Nine) languages.

The number of customers using digital services has

grown by 3 (three) times in the past one year with digital

transactions constituting 25% of overall transactions as

against 8% in the previous year.

During the year under review, the Bank’s total customer

base grew by 17% Y-o-Y to 54.4 lakhs while Deposit

customers increased by 68% to 47.1 lakhs.

The Bank operationalised 101 Banking Outlets (“BO”)

including 24 in unbanked Rural Centres (“uRC”). By the

end of the year under review, the Bank had converted all

its asset centres into banking outlets, complying with the

requirement of converting the erstwhile Micro Finance:
