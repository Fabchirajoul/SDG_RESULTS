Letter to Shareholders: Dear Shareholders,

Greetings!

FY20 has been an eventful year in the history of the company

due to momentous changes that have unravelled, both

within and outside the walls of your company, over the past

few months.

The world economy and social dynamics have been impacted

by a virus in a way that few could have foreseen. No country,

and certainly no company, has been left unscathed. The

overall environment and sentiment had become dubious

however we are confident to sail through this difficult and

unprecedented phase through collective and united efforts

led by numerous institutions and countries.

India on move

India, however, has historically overridden global downturns

and exhibited its resilience and immense potential time and

again.

We flicked aside the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis when others

at the time faced bankruptcy; our markets picked up in quick

time after the dotcom bust of the early nineties; and our

robust exports sector helped us survive the Great Recession

of 2008-10 to help us emerge as the fifth largest economy

within a decade.

Through all the economic upheavals that the world

confronted, the Sensex – the barometer of our capital market

health – clocked an average CAGR of around 15% over four

decades.

Even during this trying time, after downgrading India’s

growth forecast twice in April, the second time to a low 0.8%,

Fitch Ratings says our growth rate would shoot up to 6.7%

in 2021-22. IMF is even more upbeat and sees our growth

touching 7.4% in FY22.

Rebooted NAM India

All this gives me great hope about our future as a country.

But as the ED & CEO of your company, what gives me even

more hope – and, if I may add, immense satisfaction – is the

fact that even as India starts rebooting, your company has had

a head start, because we began the process of rebooting for

the future even before the pandemic hit the Indian shores.

Last September, Nippon Life Insurance (NLI), Japan’s leading

private life insurer and our partner since 2012, became the

principal shareholder in your company.

We are now rebranded as Nippon Life India Asset

Management Ltd (NAM India).

The change of principal shareholder has made your company,

NAM India, the first venture that NLI has outside Japan

without a JV partner.

Naturally, it is a matter of great pride and humility for us that

NLI considers NAM India’s shareholders, its employees and

the management team their partners in this country.

We, too, are inspired by this level of commitment by our

principal shareholder as this has melded Japanese perfection

with Indian passion.

Dynamic Union

Let me explain what I mean by that.

NLI is a Fortune 500 company with more than $75 billion

in revenues in 2020, profits of over $2 billion and assets of

over $750 billion. It not only has worldwide reach but also

experience of 131 years.

NAM India is amongst the largest professionally-run,

independent asset manager in this country, with 25 years in

the business.

As on March 31st 2020, we are present in 287 locations,

with our 1,043 employees and 76,260 distributors reaching

investors big and small in every corner of India.

While other players look at “India”, we look at “Bharat” – the

real India beyond the top 30 cities – the segment where we

2 Statutory Report l Notice:

Dear Shareholders,

Your Directors take pleasure in presenting their 25th Annual Report on the business and operations of your Company, together

with the audited financial statements, for the year ended March 31, 2020.

Your Company endeavors to remain one of the leading players in the Asset Management business in India and keep enhancing

its global footprint as well.

During the year, Nippon Life Insurance Company (“NLI”) acquired additional equity shares of the Company and increased its

shareholding to 75% of Company’s issued & paid up equity share capital and thus became its holding Company. As a result of

this, your Company became the largest foreign owned Asset Management Company in India.

As a consequence of this development, NLI became the sole sponsor of the Mutual Fund managed by the Company. The

existing name of the mutual fund i.e. “Reliance Mutual Fund” was changed to “Nippon India Mutual Fund” and the name of your

Company was also changed to “Nippon Life India Asset Management Limited”.

NLI, a fortune 500 company, is one of the largest life insurers in the world managing assets of over USD 700 bn. NLI has a large

global network with presence across US, Europe, Asia, and Australia along with a 130-year track record in life insurance business

as well as global investments across asset management companies. This brings strong synergistic benefits that complement

the company’s domestic expertise in asset management business and its significant growth potential. The company expects

substantial upside in terms of increased AUM & adoption of best governance & risk management practices based on NLI’s

global positioning & relationships.
