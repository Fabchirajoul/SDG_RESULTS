Dear Shareholders,

I have great pleasure in welcoming you to the 48th Annual General

Meeting of your Company.

It was yet another eventful year for your Company. As part of our

consolidation drive, we set in motion a host of activities with the

aim of focusing on the bottom line. This was also necessitated by

the falling interest regime that we are witnessing, making it

obligatory on our part to show less and less of a reliance on

investment returns and focus more on generating profits from

our core operations - reinsurance. It was the third year in

succession where the globe was faced with major natural

catastrophes. This has resulted in your company showing an

overall loss, the second time in its 48 years history. Furthermore,

with the current pandemic situation which started in March and

has plagued the globe in a never before manner, the economy

and consequently the insurance and reinsurance sector is under

stress. However, with the slew of bottom line focused measures

taken up, coupled with the hardening of the market rates

following these successive catastrophes, we hope to do better,

going forward. The year also witnessed the operationalising of

our 100% owned subsidiary in Moscow, GIC Perestrakhovanie. Our

licence in Brazil was also upgraded to the status of an “Admitted Reinsurer”. With these steps, our dominance in the BRICS

reinsurance space seems complete. Additionally, our syndicate at Lloyds, GIC Re 1947 also finished its first full year of operation,

clocking a combined ratio of 94%.

Macro-economic and Industry overview

India’s gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to be ` 145.65 lakh crore (US$ 2.06 trillion) for 2019-20, growing

4.2 per cent over the previous year.

The Indian non-life insurance industry maintained robust growth during Financial Year 2020 and reported a gross direct

premium of ` 1.89 trillion as compared to ` 1.69 trillion in the previous year, registering a growth rate of 11.72% according

to data published by the General Insurance Council. Life insurance industry registered a growth of 20.60% for new business

premium during 2019-20 at ` 2.15 trillion. Mid-term outlook is blurred owing to the Covid-19 impacting the economic growth

with which the non-life insurance premium has a significant positive correlation.

The global non-life reinsurance premium reached approx. USD 190 Bn in 2019. The year 2019 continued to see global

catastrophic activity by way of hurricane Dorian and typhoon Hagibis that struck the US and Japan coasts respectively, though

less severe as compared to earlier years. Coming close on the heels of the catastrophes of 2017 and 2018, exacerbated by Covid-

19 giving rise to additional volatility in the financial markets impacting asset side of the (re)insurer balance sheets, the market

is showing distinct signs of hardening and this hard cycle may be expected to last at least for a couple of years.:

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2020:

letter of comfort given by the parent company provides support to the

company in order to maintain adequate capital, to meet solvency and policy holder liability requirements and financial

obligations.

3.3

Credit risk

The company has several exposures to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in

full when due. Key areas where the company is exposed to credit risk are:

•

amounts due from reinsurance policyholders;

•

amounts due from reinsurance contract intermediaries;

•

investments excluding equities; and

•

retroceded technical liabilities.

Exposure to individual policyholders and groups of policyholders are monitored as part of the credit control process.

Reputable financial institutions are used for investing and cash handling purposes.

Under the terms of the retrocession agreements, retrocessionaires agree to reimburse the ceded amount in the event that

a gross claim is paid. However, the company remains liable to its cedants regardless of whether the retrocessionaire meets

the obligations it has assumed. Consequently, the company is exposed to credit risk.

GIC Re South Africa Ltd reinsures with Sirius International Insurance Corporation which has been rated A (Excellent) by

A.M.Best and A- (Strong) by S&P Ratings.

Sirius International Insurance Corporation arranged a 70% whole account quota share treaty whereby 70% of the

claims are recovered from Sirius International Insurance Corporation. In addition to this GIC Re South Africa Ltd continues

to withhold 40% of the premium as premium reserve deposit and retain 100% of the outstanding claims reserve as an

outstanding claims reserve deposit.

None of the company’s financial assets exposed to credit risk are past 182 days due and are not impaired. The compnay

does not hold any collateral as security held for receivables.

Notes To The Financial Statements:

letter of credit to Lloyd’s (Funds at Lloyd’s) to collateralise its reinsurance obligations to the

Company and deposited an additional £30.8 million during the year (2018: £98.1 million).

Operational Risk

Since the Company only undertakes in a few transactions of its own, it has limited systems and staffing requirements. Therefore,

the Directors do not consider the Company’s operational risks to be significant. Close involvement of the Directors in the

Company’s key decision making and the fact that the Syndicates conduct a majority of the Company’s operations provides

control over any remaining operational risk.

Foreign Exchange

The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through the Syndicates’ liabilities under policies of insurance denominated

in currencies other than Sterling. The most significant currencies to which the syndicate is exposed are US Dollar, Canadian

Dollar and the Euro. Where possible, the Syndicates seek to mitigate the risk by matching the estimated foreign currency

denominated liabilities with assets denominated in the same currency. There is a natural matching to currency risk as claims are

normally paid in the currency of the original policy. The Company did not undertake any transactions of its own during the year

except for administrative expenses and a payment to a broker made directly by the Corporate Member.

Market, Credit, and Liquidity Risk

Other significant risks faced by the Company include its investment of available funds within its own custody. The elements of

these risks are interest rate, investment price, and liquidity risk. Liquidity risk would arise if the Syndicates have inadequate

liquid resources for a large claim and sought funds from the Company to pay the claim. In order to minimise interest rate,

investment price, and liquidity risk, the Company is supported by the: letter of credit and the funds provided by the Parent

Reinsurer at Fund’s at Lloyd’s.

Since the Company did not undertake many transactions of its own, the

letter of credit and funds of £129.6m provided by the

Parent to Lloyd’s (Funds at Lloyd’s) to collateralise its reinsurance obligations to the Company.

The Company manages credit risk at the Corporate level by ensuring that investments and cash and cash equivalent
