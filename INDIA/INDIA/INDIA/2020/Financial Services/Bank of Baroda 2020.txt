CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

Dr. Hasmukh Adhia

Chairman

Dear Stakeholder,

It gives me great pleasure to place before you the

highlights of the Bank’s performance during the

financial year 2019-20 (FY 2020). This was the

first year of the amalgamated entity after merger of

Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank into Bank of Baroda.

I am happy to say that the amalgamation process

was completed smoothly without any disruption

or inconvenience to the customers. Once the

changeover of the technology platform is completed

in the current financial year, the customers of all

erstwhile banks will have seamless benefit of

advanced level of bouquet of services.

FY 2020 was the year in which the change of MD and

CEO happened. Mr. P S Jayakumar completed his

tenure of 4 years in the Bank successfully, leaving

behind many innovative practices in the Bank. I

would like to express the gratitude of the Board of

Directors to him for steering the Bank through the

amalgamation. I would also like to welcome new

MD and CEO, Shri Sanjiv Chadha, who brings

with him the rich experience of the largest Public

Sector Bank - SBI. I am sure new milestones will

be achieved during his tenure in our Bank.

The Banking Landscape

One of the important areas of reform for the

Government has been increasing scale and size

of the Indian banks. As part of this strategy, Vijaya

Bank and Dena Bank were amalgamated with

Bank of Baroda. Continuing with this strategy, the

Government has announced consolidation of 10

PSBs into 4. This will be helpful in strengthening

balance sheet and underlying profitability to invest

in technology to gain market share. Large banks

will also be in a better position to raise capital from

the equity and bond markets.

Other than amalgamation, the Government has

implemented a number of reforms to increase

India’s growth. Notable among them are reduction

in corporate tax rate, GST, Insolvency and

Bankruptcy Code (IBC), opening up of mining

sector to private sector, proposed privatisation of

power distribution in Union Territories, investment

in infrastructure and focus on Ease of Doing

Business.

The benefit of these reform measures would be

visible in the medium-term. However, due to

cyclical factors, growth slowed down in FY 2020

which resulted in deceleration in credit growth of

SCBs to 6.1% towards end of financial year from

13.1% in the previous financial year. The lower

growth can also be partly attributed to outbreak of

COVID-19 at the end of the year.

The Reserve Bank of India reduced policy rate

by 250bps since February 2019 to support the

economy. It also introduced an external benchmark

linked lending rate for retail and MSME customers

to ensure faster transmission. RBI has also taken

steps to mitigate the impact of the slowdown due

to COVID-19 by injecting liquidity, reducing CRR

and advising banks to provide 6-month moratorium

to borrowers. Bank of Baroda too has extended

moratorium to its customers and has ensured

continuous operation of banking services during

the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. I would

Dr. Hasmukh Adhia

Chairman:

Chairman's Statement

like to salute all officers and staff of the Bank who

continued banking operations during lockdown

also. They too are the frontline warriors of the war

against COVID-19.

Bank of Baroda – The Continuing Transformation

We at Bank of Baroda have been investing in

technology to improve customer experience.

Initiatives such as digitising account opening through

TAB Banking, revamping our mobile application,

centralisation of back office operations, setting

up an Analytics Centre of Excellence (ACoE) and

Baroda Kisan platform for our farmers are efforts in

that direction. We are expanding our digital focus

even further with setting up of a dedicated Digital

Lending Department which will exclusively cater

to digital on-boarding and processing of loans for

Retail and MSME customers using internal and

external sources of information and state-of-the-art

machine learning and algorithms. These initiatives

have already resulted in lower turnaround time and

better customer experience. Our revamped mobile

application is rated amongst the top 3 large banks

in the country. Bank of Baroda has been ranked 2nd

in Government’s EASE ranking.

Financial Performance

The benefits from amalgamation of the three Banks

are visible in the first year itself in the form of cost

efficiency through reduction in cost to income ratio

to 47.86% in FY 2020, improvement in margins

through increase in CASA ratio to 39.07% and

better credit quality in the form of decline in non-

performing loans to 3.13%. The combined entity

has not only reported a much higher operating

profit, but also returned to positive profit in FY 2020.

This is despite the Bank increasing its provision

coverage ratio to 81.33% in the financial year. The

Bank also raised capital by way of AT-1 and Tier II

bonds of Rs 6,817 crore. The results of the Bank

show that Government’s reform initiative is in the

right direction of creating stronger banks which

can invest in technology, have higher profits and

raise capital from the markets leading to deeper

capital cushion.

Looking Ahead

The Board of Directors of our Bank is continuously

engaged with the management to set up business

goals which benefit all the stakeholders including

the shareholders. Our strategy this year will

be to consolidate the gains of amalgamation

and achieve better efficiency parameters while

delivering healthy growth in credit and profitability.

Also, we are conscious of the fact that the way

we do business has to change in the post COVID

world. We plan to strategise on these lines so that

the adversity is converted into an opportunity. As

the Chairman of the Bank, I am excited to be part

of this journey.

Managing Director and CEO

Dear Stakeholder,

It is a singular privilege to have the opportunity

to lead Bank of Baroda, an institution which has

a rich history and stellar record of serving all

stakeholders over a period of 112 years and it will

be my endeavour as MD and CEO to build on this

tradition of trust and service.

COVID-19 has had a serious impact on each one

of us, our working lives as well as our health and

well-being and I do hope everyone is well and

keeping safe. For our staff members in particular,

it has been a very testing time and each one of

them has at great personal risk made sure that the

Bank, not only as an essential service continues

to function as close to normal as possible but also

delivers on key projects including the complex

and critical amalgamation of Bank of Baroda with

Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank.

Successful Amalgamation a new template for

PSBs

Bank of Baroda was the first Public Sector Bank

chosen for three-way amalgamation with Dena

and Vijaya Bank effective from April 1, 2019 as

part of Government’s reform agenda of fewer but

larger PSBs which would have lower costs, higher

profitability, ability to raise capital from the markets

and consistently invest in technology. In the first

year of the merger itself, the amalgamated Bank

has been able to bring down its cost to income

ratio by more than 4%, improve the CASA ratio by

more than 1.8%, increase operating profit as well

as reduce non-performing assets. The merger is

being executed as per plan with the amalgamation

of retail branches of the merging banks, the

final step, now in progress and scheduled for

completion during FY 2021. Despite the dislocation

caused by the shutdowns, the team has continued

to press ahead and we remain committed to the

implementation schedule.

Enriching Customer Experience

Even while executing the merger process, the

Bank has simultaneously taken multiple steps to

improve and enrich customer experience. Some of

these such as TAB Banking which offer a paperless

digital on-boarding experience to our customers

have become an even more compelling proposition

in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. Almost

88% of savings bank accounts in key markets were

opened in paperless format using TAB Banking.

This has helped us in improving our productivity

and helped increase our CASA ratio. We have

extended this facility for on-boarding current

account customers as well.

An equally powerful tool to drive customer

engagement is mobile banking which has

emerged as the preferred mode for most of our

customers to transact with the Bank. Keeping the

centrality of this product and looking at the future,

we have revamped our Mobile Banking application

(M-Connect) and the new version is already, within

weeks of launch, ranked third best among top large

banks. We are constantly adding new services to

the app and aim to make it the one-stop shop for

all the banking needs of our clients.

The hedge/non-hedge (market making) transactions are recorded separately. In cases where the underlying is not subject

to mark to market the hedging derivatives are accounted for on an accrual basis. Trading derivative positions are marked-to-

market (MTM) and the resulting losses, if any, are recognized in the Profit and Loss Account. Profit, if any is not recognized.

Income and Expenditure relating to interest rate swaps are recognized on the settlement date. Gains/losses on termination of

the trading swaps are recorded on the termination date as income/expenditure.
