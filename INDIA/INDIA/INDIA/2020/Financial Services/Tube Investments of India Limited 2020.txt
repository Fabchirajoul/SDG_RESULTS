Dear Shareholders,

The year began with trends of a positive change in

the world economy with signs of stabilisation from

the accommodative monetary policies rolled out by

Governments of many countries to boost business.

However, geo-political posturing, protectionist trade

policies and stress in key emerging market economies

weighed down global economic growth, particularly

manufacturing and trade in the second half of 2019. The

Covid-19 pandemic impacted this further in great measure

and hence, global growth which was estimated to reach

3.3% in 2020 plunged to an all time low of -3% registering

a sharp decline in the fortunes of almost all countries

across the world.

The Indian Economy began the year with a slowdown in

core sectors such as automotive, construction, mining, iron

and steel, etc. It was further accentuated with muted market

growth, credit stress and deferred discretionary spends

dictating customer sentiment. Signs of a revival were

evident in the second half of the year with manufacturing

activity showing a moderate increase based on supportive

Government policies to accelerate growth. However, the

pandemic and the resultant lockdown in March brought all

business activity to a standstill with the GDP plunging to

1.9% for the fiscal 2019 -20.

The Indian automotive sector witnessed a weak market

response. The Government mandated transition from

BS IV to BS VI emission standards, a halt in the launch

of new technology products, inventory accumulation and

finally the lock-down, all of which, had a huge overall impact

on the sector. Sales in the last month of FY20 plummeted

to the lowest in four years, registering a drop of nearly

40-80% across segments.

TII with a large presence in the Auto sector was impacted

by the industry slowdown due to reduced offtake from

OEMs recalibrating their capacity utilisation. Despite the

fall in the order book, the Company increased its customer

engagement, partnering with auto majors and leveraging

its engineering expertise to develop new products for the

BS VI migration in Passenger Vehicles, tubular front fork

products for the two wheeler segment, and safety critical

parts in seating solutions for both the Indian and global

market. To counter balance the slowdown in the OEM

business, the Company’s strategic sectoral shift to mine the

opportunity in the Aftermarket, with innovative products

and an expanded channel, proved a game changer in a

challenging year.

An agility to adapt to a changing environment and embrace

new technologies has always been TII’s main forte. The

Company is focusing on its inherent strength and strong

business fundamentals to build a resilient edge.

An agility to adapt to a

embrace

new

technologies has always

been TII’s main forte.

The Company is focusing

on its inherent strength

and

strong

business

fundamentals to build a

resilient edge.:

Dear Shareholders,

2019-20 could be termed as a great testing year for both

the economy and for businesses across the world. Markets

in a mayhem, it was a year which demanded a rethink

of traditional methods of doing business, challenged

companies to reset priorities and necessitated the ability

to reinvent, to remain resilient. At TII, we did just that. We

focused on building the resilient edge.

A strong Balance Sheet, we believe, is built on strict

fiscal discipline, which serves as a strong buffer during

downturns. Our continued focus on the four cardinal

metrics of Revenue Growth, Profitability, Return on Capital

Employed and Free Cash Flow, for the past two years, has

stood us in good stead. However, the economic slowdown

during the year in core sectors, particularly the degrowth

of the Auto industry, impacted our Revenue metrics. In a

challenging year, each of our businesses have managed

their fiscal space with great frugality and care. This has

enabled us to improve our cost efficiencies, reduce debt

vulnerabilities and fine hone our discipline to manage

‘more with less.’

Here’s how the year played out, quarter by quarter, in

terms of Revenue and Profit Before Tax:

Earlier this year, the slowdown in both the Indian and

Global Economy, led to sluggish market demand and

muted customer sentiment. The core sectors such as

Auto, Construction, Infrastructure, Steel, Mining, etc,

bore the brunt of the downslide, with the domino effect

cascading to all related industries. Finally, the pandemic

and the resultant lock-down in March, in the last month

of the FY 2019-20, brought everything to a grinding halt.

Engineering

Despite challenging market conditions, the Engineering

Business comprising standard tubular products and

specialized, large diameter tubes registered a Revenue

of `2,258 Cr. and PBIT of `264 Cr. with a 4% growth in

ROCE from 37% to 41%.

Mr. Vellayan Subbiah (50 years, DIN-01138759) is

Dear Shareholders,

The Directors take pleasure in presenting the 12th Annual

Report together with the audited financial statements of

the Company for the year ended 31st March 2020.

1.

Business Environment

The country’s growth softened in 2019 as corporate

and environmental regulatory uncertainty together

with concerns about the health of the non-banking

financial sector weighed on demand and applied the

brakes on economic growth. Demand slowed more

sharply than expected amid stress in the non-banking

financial sector and a decline in credit growth. Added

to this, the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has come

to cast a long shadow over the much-anticipated

recovery, albeit expected to be a mild one, in the

Indian economy in 2020-21, with the World Health

Organisation (W.H.O.) declaring the virus outbreak a

pandemic.

India’s GDP decelerated to its lowest in over 6 years

during 2019-20 and just that when there were signs

of mild recovery of the economy with corporate

tax rate cut, the outbreak of the COVID-19 has

imposed fresh challenges. Steps taken to contain

its spread such as nationwide restrictions/lockdown

have brought economic activity to a standstill,

with serious implications for both consumption

and investment. Three major contributors to GDP-

private consumption, external trade and investments

are already affected. As per the projections of the

International Monetary Fund (IMF), India’s growth

rate is seen sliding all the way to 1.9% in 2020.

For the global economy too, the COVID-19 pandemic

is inflicting high and rising human costs worldwide.

As a result, the global economy is projected to

contract sharply by –3% in 2020, much worse than

during the 2008–09 financial crisis.

The automobile industry was on the brink of a revival

after a torrid year. Looking forward, the expectation

was that of a decent current year with a revival from

the second quarter onwards. However, the pandemic

inflicted lockdown has dealt a decisive blow to the

growth of automobile industry. As per the Society of

Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), the Indian

auto sector which contributes 9%-10% to the nation’s

GDP has delivered below potential growth over the

last 5 years with a CAGR of ~1.5% for passenger

vehicles (PVs) and two-wheelers (2Ws). During the

year under review, Indian auto sector witnessed

a de-growth of 18% in sales. In the four-wheeler

segment, the passenger vehicle and commercial

vehicle sale volumes were down by 18% and 29%

respectively. In the two-wheeler segment, scooters

sales and motorcycles were down by 17% and 18%.

16. Human Resources

The Company continued to lay emphasis on a high

performing work culture to achieve organisational

goals of the present as well as those of the future in a

sustainable way by establishing a culture of process

discipline, organisational oneness and achievement

orientation

across

its

businesses

through

simplification

and

digitization,

empowerment,

project-based working, customer centricity and

process discipline. The initiatives taken by the

Company are in line with its long-term Human

Resources Strategy which has been drawn up

with three broad thrust areas - capability building,

improved accountability and high-performance work

culture.

As part of the capability building initiatives, a

leadership program to create and develop a talent

pool for managing the various growth businesses

of the Company enabling the identified leaders to

operate with greater speed, efficiency and capability

aligned to the Company’s structure and strategy

was initiated during the year under review. All

critical positions have been mapped to ensure a

smooth succession planning. A structured career

path framework for those with high potential by

mapping them to business-critical projects as well as

for grooming internal talent among the management

staff was piloted during the year under review.

A framework covering building of trust, role

clarity, technical capability, change champions

and recognition/reward for high performers was

conceptualized in order to develop and improve

ownership and accountability among the blue

collared employees and rolled out during the year.

The framework is presently under implementation.

In order to achieve a high-performance work

culture through a systematic approach to managing

performance of organisations, teams and individuals,

various actions were implemented across three

themes viz., better, faster and more efficient.

The initiatives launched with the help of Japanese

consultants in the form of Total Quality Management

(TQM) for the Chains and the Tubes Divisions and

the Toyota Production System (TPS) for the Cycles

Division are making good progress, with a strong:
