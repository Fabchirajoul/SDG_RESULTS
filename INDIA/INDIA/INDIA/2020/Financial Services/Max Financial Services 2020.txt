Annual Report

2020:

Managing Director of Max Financial Services

Limited and Max India Limited, and Vice Chairman of Max

Ventures & Industries Limited (MaxVIL). In addition, he

serves on the Boards of Max Life Insurance and Antara

Senior Living.

During his stint at the Max Group, he has successfully

leveraged his strong relationships with institutional

investors, hedge funds, banks and private equity firms,

and led several complex corporate finance and financial

structuring deals to ensure adequate investment and

liquidity for the Group’s operations. He has played a

central role in executing key transactions including the

recent restructuring of Max India with divestment of its

healthcare and health insurance businesses. He is currently

driving the ongoing joint venture transaction between

Max Life and Axis Bank. Some of the other corporate

transactions in which he has played a key role include

the mega restructuring of the erstwhile Max India into

three new listed companies, which received a significantly

positive reaction from capital markets, setting up of Max

Bupa Health Insurance in 2010, joint venture partnerships

between Mitsui, Japan and Max Life, and Life Healthcare,

South Africa and Max Healthcare. He has also overseen

key transactions in MaxVIL, including the induction of

Toppan Group as a JV partner in Max Speciality Films, and

a 22.5% stake sale to New York Life’s subsidiary.

A veteran in the Corporate Finance and Investment Banking

industry, Mr Mohit Talwar has a wealth of experience in

Corporate Finance and Investment Banking, having spent

24 years in Wholesale Banking across global organizations

such as Standard Chartered, ANZ Grindlays and Bank of

Nova Scotia, prior to joining the Max Group.:

Managing Director of Dixon

business from inception including designing of products,

building the team, setting up the manufacturing facility,

operations and building relationships with leading brands

in India such as Panasonic, Godrej, LG, among others.

Letter: Dear Shareholders,

Greetings !

W

e have held the belief that Max Group’s growth and

progress have been shaped to a significant extent by its

very conscious and selective find of joint venture (JV) partners

and the success of these JVs over the last three decades. As a

result, our portfolio of JV partners is long and storied with names

such as New York Life, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, Bupa Plc,

Hutchison Telecommunications, Gist-Brocades, Motorola, Life

Healthcare, Toppan, among others.

This year, we have been fortunate to usher in another highly

respected name as a prospective JV partner. In April 2020,

Max Financial Services Limited (MFSL) signed definitive

agreements with Axis Bank, India’s third largest private bank,

to form a Joint Venture with MFSL’s sole subsidiary Max Life

Insurance Company (Max Life). In April 2020, Max Financial

Services Limited (MFSL) signed definitive agreements

with Axis Bank, India’s third largest private bank, and its

subsidiaries, to form a Joint Venture with MFS’ sole subsidiary

Max Life Insurance Company (Max Life). The agreement was

subsequently modified to allow Axis Bank and its subsidiaries

to collectively acquire up to 19% stake in Max Life.

In strategic importance, the proposed joint venture parallels our

partnership at the dawn of the millennium in 2000, with New

York Life (NYL), America’s largest mutual and most admired

Life Insurer. The JV with NYL and the Max Group helped build

expertise in critical functions such as underwriting, creation of a

gold standard Agency distribution network, etc. These valuable

skills helped Max New York Life (now Max Life) level the

playing field versus large bank owned life insurers, which were

supported by their parent brands’ and their branch network.

The company went on to establish itself as one of India’s most

respected life insurance specialists that till today stands for

need-based marketing, financial strength, service excellence,

and fair dealings with the customer, making it among the most

trusted life insurers.

Our upcoming partnership with Axis Bank has been a natural

culmination of a decade-long relationship. Like New York Life,

our JV with Axis Bank is well-timed and crucial. Axis Bank is

an exceptional partner with complementary skills, a matching

belief system, and a shared vision for the future of our life

insurance business. In the past, the two companies have

provided long term saving and protection products to over

20 Lakh customers. The total premium generated through this

relationship has aggregated to over ` 40,000 Cr. Both Max

Life and Axis Bank have also invested extensively in product

7.56%. This was based on the industry benchmarks and approval of the Nomination and Remuneration

Committee.

determinable.
