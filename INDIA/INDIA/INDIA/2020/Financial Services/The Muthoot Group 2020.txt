Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to

present to you the Annual Report

of Muthoot Finance for FY20. Our

extensive reach, deep understanding

of customer needs, efficiency, speed

of service, and reliability continue

to make us the preferred gold loan

financing company, even during

these challenging times. This is a true

reflection of our concerted efforts over

the years to live our purpose – driving

financial inclusion and empowering

people across the social pyramid.

That being said, India and the world

are going through a crisis that has

few parallels in recent history. What

started as a health crisis with the

outbreak of the novel coronavirus is

now a full-blown economic one with

significant ramifications that impact

life and livelihoods. The resilience of

businesses has been put to test.

At the same time, humanity’s collective

spirit and ingenuity are on full display.

Asset Liability Management (ALM)

The table below shows the maturity pattern of the assets and liabilities. In the case of loans, contracted tenor of gold loan is maximum of

12 months. However, on account of high incidence of prepayment before contracted maturity, the below maturity profile has been prepared

by the management on the basis of historical pattern of repayments. In case of loans other than gold loan, the maturity profile is based on

contracted maturity.
