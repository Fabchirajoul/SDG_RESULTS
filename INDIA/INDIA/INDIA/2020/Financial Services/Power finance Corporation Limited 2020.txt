In connection with our audit of the Standalone Ind

RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND

THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE

STANDALONE IND AS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for

the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with

respect to the preparation of these Standalone Ind AS

Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of

the financial position, financial performance, changes

in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance

with the accounting principles generally accepted

in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards

specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility

also includes maintenance of adequate accounting

records in accordance with the provisions of the Act

for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for

preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;

selection and application of appropriate accounting

policies; making judgements and estimates that are

reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation

and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,

that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy

and completeness of the accounting records, relevant

to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone

Ind AS Financial Statements that give a true and fair view

and are free from material misstatement, whether due

to fraud or error.

In

preparing

the

Standalone

Ind

AS

Financial

Statements, management and Board of Directors is

responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to

continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,

matters related to going concern and using the going

concern basis of accounting unless management

either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease

operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for

overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF

THE IND AS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance

about whether the Ind AS financial statements as a

whole are free from material misstatement, whether

due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report

that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance

is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee

that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will

always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are

considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,

they could reasonably be expected to influence the

economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these

Ind AS financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise

professional judgement and maintain professional

scepticism throughout the audit. We also::

Letter of Comfort (LoC):

The Company measures ECL on loan assets at an amount equal to the lifetime ECL if there is credit

impairment or there has been significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition.

If there is no SICR as compared to initial recognition, the Company measures ECL at an amount

equal to 12-month ECL. When making the assessment of whether there has been a SICR since initial

recognition, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information, that is available

without undue cost or effort. If the Company measured loss allowance as lifetime ECL in the previous

period, but determines in a subsequent period that there has been no SICR since initial recognition

due to improvement in credit quality, the Company again measures the loss allowance based on

12-month ECL.

ECL is measured on individual basis for credit impaired loan assets, and on other loan assets it is

generally measured on collective basis using homogenous groups.

The Company measures impairment on commitments under LoC on similar basis as in case of Loan

assets.

c)

The impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.

(iv) De-recognition of financial assets

The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset

expire, or when it transfers the financial asset along with all the substantial risks and rewards of ownership

of the asset to another party.

On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount

and the sum of the consideration received & receivable, and the cumulative gain or loss that had been

recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in Equity, is recognised in Statement of

Profit and Loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss

on disposal of that financial asset.:

letter vide D.O.No.32024 / 17 / 97 – PFC dated 23.09.1997 and O.M.No.32024 / 23 / 2001 – PFC dated

07.03.2003, irrespective of actual repayment schedule, moratorium period and duration of repayment. The

amount of interest subsidy received and to be passed on to the borrowers is retained as Interest Subsidy Fund

Account. Impact of difference between indicative rate & period considered at the time of claims and at the time

of actual disbursement can be ascertained only after end of respective schemes.

However, on the basis of projections made for each project (based upon certain assumptions that these would

remain same over the projected period of each loan / project), the Company estimated that there is no net

excess amount for both IX and X Plans as at 31.03.2020 (As at 31.03.2019 Nil and ` 16.04 crore respectively),

under AG&SP schemes.

The Company has a comprehensive project monitoring system that monitors and tracks project

construction and implementation status; identifies risks where intervention is required to minimise

the time & cost overruns and consequent slippages in disbursements.

For State sector projects, monitoring is carried out based on project progress details obtained regularly

from borrowers through progress monitoring reports, site visits, discussions with the borrowers,

information/reports available on Central Electricity Authority’s (CEA) website etc.:

Letter of Comfort of ` 180.47 crore (as at 31.03.2019 ` 186.71 crore)

The Company considers that loans to state sector have a low credit risk in comparison to lending to

private sector mainly due to low default/loss history in state sector and availability of government

guarantee in certain loans. Presence of Government interest in these projects also lowers the risk of

non-recoverability of dues.:

Letter of Comfort of ` 180.47 crore (as at 31.03.2019 ` 186.71 crore)

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

for the Year ended March 31, 2020:

Letter of Comfort (LoC):

The Group measures ECL on loan assets at an amount equal to the lifetime ECL if there is credit impairment or

there has been significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. If there is no SICR as compared to

initial recognition, the Group measures ECL at an amount equal to 12-month ECL. When making the assessment

of whether there has been a SICR since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable

information, that is available without undue cost or effort. If the Group measured loss allowance as lifetime ECL in

the previous period, but determines in a subsequent period that there has been no SICR since initial recognition

due to improvement in credit quality, the Group again measures the loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.

ECL is measured on individual basis for credit impaired loan assets, and on other loan assets it is generally

measured on collective basis using homogenous groups.

The Group measures impairment on commitments under LoC on similar basis as in case of Loan assets.:

letter of

award (LOA) is issued to the successful bidder.

ix. Dividend income from investments is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when

the Group’s right to receive dividend is established, which in the case of quoted securities is the

ex-dividend date.

x.

Dividend on financial assets subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss is recognised

separately under the head ‘Dividend Income’.

xi. Interest expense on borrowings subsequently measured at amortised cost is recognised using Effective

Interest Rate (EIR) method.

xii. Other income and expenses are accounted on accrual basis, in accordance with terms of the respective

contract.

xiii. A Prepaid expense up to ` 1,00,000/- is recognised as expense upon initial recognition.

6.12 Expenditure on issue of shares

Expenditure on issue of shares is charged to the securities premium account.:

letter dated 25 March 2019 and subsequently investment was written off. MoP

(d) Other covenants – Assignment of all project contracts, documents, insurance policies in favour

of the Company, Upfront equity requirement, Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA), Debt Equity

ratio, shareholders’ agreements, financial closure, etc.

(iii) Project Monitoring

PFC has a comprehensive project monitoring system that monitors and tracks project construction

and implementation status; identifies risks where intervention is required to minimise the time & cost

overruns and consequent slippages in disbursements.

For State sector projects, monitoring is carried out based on project progress details obtained regularly

from borrowers through progress monitoring reports, site visits, discussions with the borrowers,

information/reports available on Central Electricity Authority’s (CEA) website etc.

For private sector, where PFC is Lead Financial Institution (FI), PFC engages Lenders’ Engineers (LEs)

and Lenders’ Financial Advisors (LFAs), which are independent agencies to act on behalf of various

lenders/consortium members. The LEs conduct periodic site visits, review relevant documents,

discusses with the borrowers and submit its reports on progress of the project. LFAs submit the

statements of fund flow and utilisation of funds in the project periodically. In cases where PFC is not

the lead FI, the tasks related to LEs and LFAs services are coordinated with the concerned lead lender.

Also, the consolidated periodic progress report of certain projects is prepared comprising important

observations/issues viz. areas of concern, reasons for delay, issues affecting project construction/

implementation etc. and is reviewed by PFC on a regular basis.

PFC continuously monitors delays and/or default of borrowers and their recoverability. On occurrence

of default in the borrower’s account, PFC initiates necessary steps which may involve action(s)

including, but not limited to, Special Mention Account (SMA) reporting to RBI, credit information

reporting to Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) etc., regularisation of

the account by recovering all overdues, invocation of guarantees/ securities to recover the dues,

conversion of loan into equity as per loan agreement, restructuring of loan account, formulating

resolution plan with the borrower, change in ownership, Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process

(CIRP), sale of the exposures to other entities/investors, other recovery mechanisms like referring the

case for legal action before Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), SARFAESI, National Company Law Tribunal

(NCLT) (IBC -2016) etc. and other actions as specified under regulatory/legal framework.

B.

In respect of subsidiary, RECL

The credit risk is managed at different levels including at appraisal, disbursements and post disbursement

monitoring. RECL has "Integrated Rating Guidelines" and "Comprehensive Risk Management Policy". To

mitigate credit risk, RECL follows systematic institutional and project appraisal process to assess the

credit risk. These processes include a detailed appraisal methodology, identification of risks and suitable

structuring and credit risk mitigation measures. Further, on regular basis the projects risk are reviewed

and categorised as High/ Moderate/ Low based on different risk parameters and exposure of the project

as per Project Risk Categorisation Frameworks. The process for Credit Risk Management is as under::

Letter of Comfort (LoC) of ` 188.85 crore. (as at 31.03.2019 ` 186.71 crore.)

The Companies considers that loans to state sector have a low credit risk in comparison to lending

to private sector mainly due to low default/loss history in state sector and availability of government

guarantee in certain loans. Presence of Government interest in these projects also lowers the risk of

non-recoverability of dues.

Further, the Companies have a lending portfolio comprising of loans to generation (renewable and

non-renewable), transmission and distribution power projects spread across diverse geographical areas.
