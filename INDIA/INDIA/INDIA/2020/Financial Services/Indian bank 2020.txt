scenario.

ECONOMIC OVERVIEW

Global Economy:



Global economic growth remained muted at 2.9% in

2019 compared to 3.6% in 2018. While slowing global

trade and external demand combined with geopolitical

tensions

affected

developed

economies,

the

developing economies were more hit by the uncertainty

over global trade and supply chains. The US-China

trade wars and ambiguity around policy changes

veering towards nationalism, hit emerging markets

dependent on Foreign Investments and exports for

growth.

China which has been the engine of world

growth, is seeing its growth sliding to 1.5% in the first

quarter of 2020 compared to 6.1% in 2019.



The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the

global economic activity in 2020. There is a high degree

of uncertainty on the recovery as economies world over

face persistent lockdown and social distancing which

has affected the supply potential and productivity.

However, bright spots are visible as economies have

gradually reopened. Globally, fiscal and financial sector

policy measures taken have limited the economic

7/93/2019-BOA.I dated 30thAugust 2019, communicated that

the Alternative Mechanism (AM) after consultation with the

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided that Indian Bank and

Allahabad Bank to consider amalgamation of Allahabad Bank

into Indian Bank.

Notification of Government of India:

The Gazette of India, Extraordinary vide notification G.S.R.

156(E) dated 04.03.2020 approved the amalgamation of

Allahabad

Bank

(Transferor

Bank)

into

Indian

Bank

(Transferee Bank). As per this, the amalgamated Bank came

into being from 1 April 2020.

st

Rationale for amalgamation

The growth in the Indian economy with doubling in size in the

last six years to $ 2.8 trillion in FY2019 led to a massive

expansion in the banking space in terms of business as well as

the number of banks. To be more efficient in the changing

environment, banks in the public sector space need to be

bigger to meet the credit needs of a growing economy, absorb

shocks and have the capacity to raise resources from the

market without depending on the government.

Further, going ahead, to meet the financing needs of the

Government's envisioned $ 5 trillion economy, a strong and

resilient banking system is imperative. Public Sector Banks

which command more than 70% of the market share should be

strengthened to meet the credit demands of the growing

economy.

Indian Bank has been performing well with a sound capital

base and recording profit continuously. Allahabad Bank was

put under Prompt CorrectiveAction in January 2018 restricting

its lending capabilities. The Bank came out of PCAin February

2019.
