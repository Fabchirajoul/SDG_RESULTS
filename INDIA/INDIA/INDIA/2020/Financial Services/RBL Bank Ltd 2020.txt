DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

It is my pleasure to present to you

RBL Bank’s Annual Report for

FY 2019-20.

I hope all of you and your families are

keeping safe and well.

We are living through unprecedented

times as the COVID-19 pandemic

continues to impact every aspect of our

lives and livelihoods- across countries,

societies and economies. The size and

scale of the challenge leads us to believe

that India, as also the rest of the world,

will experience a prolonged and

signiﬁcant impact on the economy and all

its components. In view of this, we at

RBL Bank continue to be cautious,

conservative and committed to

preservation of this very valuable

franchise.

Our primary focus has been on taking

care of the health and safety of our

employees as only then can they

effectively serve the customers and

community. Our employees have

worked tirelessly over the last few

months ever since the nation-wide

lockdown was ﬁrst implemented.

98% of our branch network and 95% of

our ATMs remained operational and open

to serve our customers. While our

frontline branch staff ensured continuity

while adhering to strict safety protocols,

more than 75% of our employees are

currently ‘Working from home’ without

any impact on operations. We have

substantially strengthened our

information security and cyber security

risk measures to mitigate potential risk

and threats during this period.

In the backdrop of all the challenges, our

Bank has demonstrated stability, growth

and satisfactory proﬁtability.

EFFORTS IN THE SHORT TERM,

TO RESHAPE THE BANKING

LANDSCAPE IN THE LONG TERM

2020 started with great hope for the

ﬁnancial sector given emerging signs of

economic growth and healthier balance

sheets for the industry. However, the

COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent

lockdowns across the country has

caused signiﬁcant upheaval to our

economy, industries, small businesses as

well as individuals. The government and

the regulator have already initiated

several measures to the best of their

ability to restore conﬁdence, mitigate the

impact and hasten recovery.

I believe our return to normalcy is going

to be a gradual and protracted process

and the banking sector’s role is critical in

enabling this recovery. As such, the

overriding emphasis at our Bank shall be

on balance sheet protection and we will,

therefore, continue to tighten risk ﬁlters

further to manage and preserve credit

quality, maintain surplus liquidity and

remain well capitalised even as we

cautiously look for opportunities for

VISHWAVIR AHUJA: Managing

Managing Director and CEO

things start to normalize.

DIGITAL OFFERINGS / PAYMENTS

Our technology focus has led us to

ramp up our digital offerings

signiﬁcantly over the last few years.

Here are a few achievements of the

Bank in the year gone by:

• No. 1 player in the total number of

PoS terminals with 25% market share

• No. 3 player in Aadhaar Enabled

Payment Services (AEPS)

transactions processed

• Amongst the Top 5 banks in the

MEITY rankings in terms of digital

payment transactions

• More than 100 APIs across various

products and services offered - 40%

share of the total MFI disbursement

in the country

CONTACTLESS BANKING

Aligning ourselves to the ‘New Normal’

in the current scenario of physical

distancing and contactless transactions,

we have launched several contactless

banking initiatives, eliminating the need

for physical contact amidst COVID-19.

We introduced a host of digital initiatives

including WhatsApp banking, opening

instant bank accounts from anywhere in

India, with a completely paperless on

boarding, powered by Video KYC. We

also launched a virtual debit card in our

mobile banking app enabling contactless

transactions without the need for plastic

cards.

We have been advising customers to use

these tools to fulﬁl their banking needs.

This has led to a surge in the number of

digital transactions. The number of

digital savings account too has gone up

signiﬁcantly and we expect it to increase

going forward.

We launched our chatbot “RBL cares” in

January this year, which has already

seen high adoption. We are seeing more

than 1 million conversations per month

on this platform.

OUR PEOPLE

Our people have been an integral part of

our journey. With over 14,000 employees

in our talent pool (including our

subsidiary RBL FinServe Limited), we are

consistently working towards creating an

employee-friendly organisation. As I

mentioned earlier, the health and safety

of our employees remain our utmost

priority and the Bank has launched

several initiatives to ensure their physical

and mental wellness. We proactively set

up a Quick Response Team (QRT) to

handle the entire COVID-19 situation.

The QRT provided holistic support and

clear direction to the entire organisation

from an on-premises perspective and any

other decision making that had to be dealt

with.

CONCLUSION

I believe, the Bank has emerged a stronger

institution from the challenges and

learnings of the past year. We have

focussed on tackling the challenges we

faced, fortifying the balance sheet and

building on our core and lasting strengths.

Today our Bank is a ﬁnancially sound, well

capitalised institution with robust risk

management architecture and strong

technology led customer focus which will

hold us in good stead in the coming years.

I would like to take this opportunity to

thank all our external and internal

stakeholders for supporting us in our

journey.

We remain focused on our priorities and

will continue to build a trusted, compliant

and ﬁnancially strong bank which will

remain at the forefront to ﬁnd new ways to

generate value for all our stakeholders.:

Schedules

forming part of the standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020:

Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer (MD&CEO) /Chairman and other

Board members. The committee is responsible for evaluating the overall risks faced by the Bank including liquidity risk. The

potential interaction of liquidity risk with other risks is included in the risks addressed by the Risk Management Committee. At

the executive level, Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) ensures adherence to the risk limits set by the Board and

implements the liquidity risk management strategy of the Bank. ALM team within Treasury function of the Bank is responsible

for the day-to-day / intra-day liquidity management. ALCO channelizes various business segments of the Bank to target good

quality asset and liability profile to meet the Bank’s profitability as well as liquidity requirements.

High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) under LCR are divided into two parts i.e. Level 1 and Level 2 HQLA.

Level 1 HQLA comprises primarily of cash, excess CRR, government securities in excess of SLR , Marginal Standing Facility

(increased to 3% of NDTL w.e.f. Mar 27, 2020) and Facility to Avail Liquidity for Liquidity Coverage Ratio (FALLCR) as permitted

under prudential guidelines (Currently 14.5%, phase-wise increase to 15% till April 01, 2020).

Level 2 HQLA comprises of investments in highly rated non-financial corporate bonds, debentures, commercial papers issued

by non-financial institutes and are further considered at prescribed haircuts.

Cash outflows are calculated by applying prescribed outflow run-off factors to contractual outflows on account of various

categories of liabilities and cash inflows are calculated by applying prescribed weights and factors to the contractual inflows.

Additionally, probable outflows on account of contingent liabilities such as letters of credit (LC) and bank guarantees (BGs) and

undrawn commitments both for fund & non fund based exposures are considered by applying prescribed run-off factors. The

Bank has a very limited exposure to liquidity risk on account of its derivatives portfolio. Further, the Bank is not taking any benefit

of classifying any deposit as Operational Deposit on a conservative basis.

The Bank computes LCR on a daily basis in accordance with RBI guidelines. LCR is reported as a simple average of daily

observations for the quarter. The Bank believes that all inflows and outflows which might have a material impact under the

liquidity stress scenario have been considered for the purpose of LCR.

Banks are required to maintain a LCR of 100% with effect from January 1, 2019. Given below is the quarterly average LCR

maintained by the Bank for past years against the minimum prescribed by RBI.
