Dear Stakeholders,

It is my privilege to address you and release the Annual Report for the financial year 2019-20. Your Bank has made

material progress in several key areas during the financial year 2019-20 and has put in place some of the best practices

for the benefit of customers, while at the same time taking care of stakeholders’ interests. The Bank has continued to focus

its attention on creating efficiency at every step, with a view to generate value in discharge of its functions.

As we are aware, the novel Covid-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruptions across the world leading to

considerable adverse impact on the global economy. The country-wide lockdowns, as one of the unavoidable measures

that most countries have adopted to fight this invisible enemy, has resulted in slowdown, in production, consumer demand,

trade and commerce, etc. affecting both the supply side and the demand side of the economy. As per the latest IMF

projection of June 2020, Indian economy is likely to contract by 4.5% in 2020-21 and then to grow by 6.0% in 2021-22.

The banking system is an important driver of economic growth as it mobilizes savings and channelizes them into

productive investment. The Government of India announced recapitalization of public sector banks in 2019 and also took

various measures to strengthen the banking system. Banks have now moved towards risk based pricing, creation of

stressed asset verticals, cash-flow ring fencing, etc. with a view to improve efficiency. Such measures would inevitably

strengthen the efficacy of the banking system and increase credit flow in the economy. To ensure better transmission of

policy rates to the real economy, the banks have linked their various products to external benchmarks. This move would

further enhance the efficiency gains for the economy as a whole.

I am glad to report that your Bank has taken various initiatives during the year, such as organizational restructuring for

better focus on business, rationalization of retail lending products to suit the customers, setting up of Centralized Credit

Processing branches for retail loans, setting up of separate vertical for marketing in all regional offices, etc. Further, your

Bank has taken initiatives as regards analytics based business transformation programme, in the process of upgradation of

data warehousing, as well as for planning of MSME hubs, among others. All these efforts should take your Bank towards a

path of sustained efficiency and profitability. Going forward, the efficiency should be further boosted by the various reforms

undertaken, effective resolution of stressed assets, speeding up the process of recovery, having effective fraud control

mechanisms in place, improved transmission, etc.

The Government of India had announced reforms agenda for public sector banks in January 2018 under the Enhanced

Access & Service Excellence (EASE) Reforms Index. The EASE 1.0 (2018-19) and EASE 2.0 (2019-20) addressed

different issues of public sector banks in a systematic manner and thus paved the way for more effective governance by

the Boards and leadership. The reforms have resulted in the improvement in various dimensions such as underwriting,

monitoring, recovery, smart banking, etc. Thus, having laid down a strong foundation for robust banking in EASE 1.0 and:

Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer or Executive Director(s) or such other officer(s) of the

Bank as it may deem fit to give effect to the aforesaid Resolution.”
