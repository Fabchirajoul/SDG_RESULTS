Dear Shareholders,

India’s vision to become Atmanirbhar is pivoted on high

industrial and economic growth as we overcome the

challenges created by CoVID-19. The year gone by was

difficult for several nations across the globe as well as for

India. However, India’s long-term growth story remains

intact, fortified by pillars such as favourable demographics,

proactive reforms, infrastructure investments, and building

a sustainable energy economy. The demand for electricity

is thus expected to grow manifolds in the years to come

and will be a key driver of India’s growth story.

“India’s aspiration to build a self-reliant

economy with a thrust on manufacturing

is dependent on our ability to develop a

sustainable, competitive, and efficient

energy sector”

The Government of India has taken several reform

initiatives to strengthen the energy sector. In the power

sector we have witnessed announcement of liquidity

package for DISCOMs, household electrification through

Saubhagaya scheme, investments in transmission capacities

and regulations to revive stressed generation assets. On

the policy front, the government intends to introduce Draft

Electricity Bill, 2020 which is aimed at bringing significant

reforms in the power sector.

On regulatory front, the government intends to expand

and deepen the power markets with their inherent strong

benefits towards achieving ‘24*7 power for all’ vision and

support industry and economic growth in an efficient and

sustainable way.

As we move towards decarbonizing India and building a

sustainable energy economy, the government aspires to

increase the share of natural gas in the country’s energy

basket from 6% to 15% by 2030 as well as undertake

significant investments for expanding the gas pipeline

infrastructure. The recently announced Gas Exchange

Regulations is a step in the right direction towards

transforming the gas market.

In fiscal year 2020, your company recorded a 3.3% YoY

growth in electricity volumes and 6% YoY profit growth. We

worked towards investing in technology and deepening the

power market through new products such as Real-Time-

Market (RTM) launched on June 1, 2020. I would like to

congratulate our shareholders on the launch of India’s first

nation-wide delivery based automated gas trading platform,

Indian Gas Exchange (IGX), which started operations on

June 15, 2020. Inaugurated by Hon. Minister of Petroleum

and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, IGX will

transform India as a gas based economy.

We look forward to exciting times ahead. Your company is

equipped with all the right elements and has been leading

the power market transformation over the last 12 years.

We will continue to work in collaboration with government,

regulators, customers, and other stakeholders to develop

the energy market as well as leverage new growth

opportunities for IEX to maximize shareholders value.

Annual Report 2019-2020:

Managing Director and

Chief Executive Officer

MD & CEO’s Message: Dear Shareholders,

Fiscal year 2020 was both exciting and challenging. We

are proud to have made continued strides in providing

affordable and reliable access to energy to our customers

through the flexibility, price competitiveness and

transparency our Exchange offers. Yet, the industry had to

deal with a difficult economic climate further exacerbated

by the CoVID-19 pandemic towards the end of the year.

The Energy Sector has been thrust with a massive

opportunity to reinvent and transform. Its true potential

will manifest itself through the urgency with which a

supportive and agile new energy order is established.

This new order must embrace mega energy trends of

decarbonization, decentralization, digitization, and

democratization to allow greater sustainability, flexibility,

efficiency and choice for economic growth.

Exchange markets have a unique role in becoming the

pivot on which the future of energy revolves. This is

made possible with robust technology driven solutions,

accelerating hybridization and innovative products and

services that ease existing efficiency hurdles. IEX is well

positioned to be a reliable ally to government, industry, and

civil society with simple and clear objectives of offering

flexibility, 24*7 energy supply and lowest price points.

With the launch of new products and market segments and

several more on the anvil, India’s energy sector is set to

witness a markets and technology-led transformation. IEX

will be at the forefront in maximizing the digital dividend as

we enter the next chapter of smart, real-time, and ultra-

responsive ways to generate, use, and sell energy. We will

integrate technologies like AI, Blockchain, Robotics, and

other emerging solutions to deliver overall efficiency for

everyone in the energy value chain. We plan to continually

invest in modernizing our technology architecture to ensure

that we are futuristic and leading edge while according

highest priority to security and transparency of transactions.

The Green Shift

2030 is not far away and we have two significant pledges

in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainability Goals and the

Paris Climate Agreement to keep. Energy security and

Credit (LC) as Payment Security Mechanism under Power

Purchase Agreements by the distribution utilities. Under

this mechanism, the Power will be scheduled for dispatch

only after LC for the desired quantum of power with respect

to the generating stations has been opened. The measure

is expected to improve payments to the power generators

and improve sustainability in the Power Sector.

Smart Prepaid Metering to improve Distribution

Efficiency

10 lac smart meters were successfully installed across India

under Smart Meter National Programme (SMNP). These

smart meters, operational in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana,

and Bihar, aim to bring efficiency in the distribution

system leading to better service delivery. The SMNP aims

to replace India’s 250 million conventional meters with

smart meters. Installation of these smart meters along

with its associated communication and IT infrastructure

will enable the distribution utilities to obtain real-time

energy consumption data of each consumer for subsequent

analysis and will pave the way for initiating various smart

measures such as Time Of Day (TOD)/Time Of Use (TOU)

billing, prediction, and management of peak demand,

providing real-time energy consumption data to the

consumer, prepaid billing facility, remote connection and

disconnection of load, accurate billing, etc.

Deepening of the Electricity Market

The Government has been working on bringing in

alternative mechanisms to make existing long-term

contracts more flexible. The objective is to enhance the

quantum of electricity traded through markets and to

improve the liquidity in the short term market by enabling

increased participation from distribution utilities and

generation companies. Long-term contracts can act as

forward contracts while physical transactions can take

place through the short term market. The roadmap outlines

a series of initiatives such as the introduction of financial

products including Contracts for Differences (CFD) as

enablers, making markets efficient and transparent by

strengthening the data disclosure regime, better demand

forecasting, and power procurement optimization

approaches. Some other initiatives and discussion areas are:

Introduction of financial products such as derivatives for

hedging risks and improving liquidity, deepening of products

in markets to enhance clean energy, introduction of new

technologies such as battery storage to quickly provide

the primary response to grid fluctuations, introduction of

innovative models such as Demand Response which will

help signal new investments including storage, flexible

thermal, etc., introduction of competition in retail supply

business and developing a mechanism for unbundling

distribution companies into wires and supply business.

Renewable Energy Capacity Addition and Grid

Integration through REMCs

The Government has established 11 Renewable Energy

Management Centers (REMC) equipped with Artificial

Intelligence based renewable forecasting and scheduling

tools. These provide greater visualization and enhanced

situational awareness to the grid operators. REMCs are

co-located with the State Load Dispatch Centers in Tamil

Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya

Pradesh, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. They are also located at

RLDCs at Bengaluru, Mumbai, and New Delhi and at the

NLDC. Presently, 55 GW of renewable - solar and wind are

being monitored through the eleven REMCs. Besides, in

order to further promote the capacity addition of solar and

wind projects, the waiver available for use of Inter-State

Transmission System (ISTS) charges and losses has been

extended for use of ISTS for solar or wind power projects

commissioned until December 2022. The waiver shall be

applicable for the twenty-five years from the commissioning

of such projects.

Cost Optimization through National level Merit

Order Dispatch

In order to reduce the cost of power procured by the

distribution utilities, a new system has been put in place.

For Inter State Generating Stations (ISGS), the merit order

dispatch at the national level will be followed. Hence, the

cheapest generation will be available at the maximum
