CONTENTS:

letter, the world is going through one

of the most turbulent times with challenges that are

unprecedented. Every nation is striving to fight the

Covid-19 pandemic. Economic activity had almost come

to a standstill as we lived through a period of intense

uncertainties, and is only now beginning to resume. The

impact is sweeping across every segment of society and

every economic activity. However, amidst these challenges,

it is evident that these events have only accelerated the

pace of change and will redefine the way businesses,

people and governments engage. This will give rise to new

technological paradigms difficult to envisage at present.

Year 2020 is going to be a turning point for everyone and

in every way.

In the last two years, since the time I have joined as

Chairman, the Bank has demonstrated strength in steering

through challenging circumstances. Businesses have been

driven with a focus on risk-calibrated profitable growth.

The balance sheet of the Bank has been strengthened

substantially and risk management practices have focussed

on generating sustainable and stable growth in business.

The steps taken have enabled the Bank to emerge more

dynamic and this reflects in the performance of the Bank

in fiscal 2020.

During fiscal 2020, growth in the Bank’s core operating

profit was healthy and the capital and liquidity position

remains strong. The franchise has been strengthened

supporting robust flow of deposits during the year.

There has been an improvement in asset quality

parameters with a granular and stronger portfolio mix.

The performance in fiscal 2020 has also ensured value-

creation for all stakeholders, including shareholders and

customers. This has been achieved despite a challenging

operating environment for the Indian banking industry.

The Bank’s progress in fiscal 2020 only further increases

our confidence in its strategic priorities and the core

principles driving businesses.

The year saw some innovative products being launched

for the Bank’s customers. Designing solutions that are

all-encompassing has been made possible by placing

the customer at the centre of business operations and

harnessing digital capabilities. The Bank’s ability to

leverage technology combined with analytical insights

and partnerships have created new ways of serving

customers through digital journeys and one-stop solutions

for all banking needs. The insta-lending products, the

focus on seamless onboarding of customers, simplifying

The performance in fiscal 2020

has also ensured value-creation

for all stakeholders, including

shareholders and customers.

This has been achieved despite

a challenging operating

environment for the Indian

banking industry.: MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

The Bank measures and monitors risk of its derivatives portfolio using such risk metrics as Value at Risk (VaR), stop

loss limits and relevant greeks for options. Risk reporting on derivatives forms an integral part of the management

information system.

The use of derivatives for hedging purposes is governed by the hedge policy approved by ALCO. Subject to prevailing

RBI guidelines, the Bank deals in derivatives for hedging fixed rate, floating rate or foreign currency assets/liabilities.

Transactions for hedging and market making purposes are recorded separately. For hedge transactions, the Bank

identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at the inception of the hedge itself. The effectiveness is assessed at the

time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge derivative transactions are accounted for pursuant

to the principles of hedge accounting based on guidelines issued by RBI. Derivatives for market making purpose

are marked to market and the resulting gain/loss is recorded in the profit and loss account. The premium on option

contracts is accounted for as per Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India (FEDAI) guidelines.

Over the counter (OTC) derivative transactions are covered under International Swaps and Derivatives Association

(ISDA) master agreements with the respective counter parties. The exposure on account of derivative transactions

is computed as per RBI guidelines.
