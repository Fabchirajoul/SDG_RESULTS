Managing Director & CEO

It is a matter of great honour and utmost

satisfaction that we got this amazing

opportunity of being associated with you

and being worthy of your trust over the

past 25 years. During this period, we have

been through seasons of growth, plenty,

and challenges. Whether it was the financial

crisis in 2008, the oil crisis in 2014 or

demonetisation in 2016, each adversity felt

the most unsettling during the time when

we faced it. However, it is our response

to the adversity, not the adversity itself,

that determines how our story develops.

We, at AU Small Finance Bank (AU Bank),

are the outcome of the choices that we

make in our journey and we have always

focused on growing the right way to

build a resilient banking institution.”

not surprised by what they have achieved. I

these qualities make an institution that can

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

As I write my last: letter to you as

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

Greetings to you!

It gives me a deep sense of

gratitude and humility, as I took

charge as Chairman of the Board of

Directors at AU Bank. During this

period, when the world is going

through the most unprecedented

and trying times, I sincerely hope

that you and everyone around

is taking due care, and keeping

healthy and safe. We can only wish

we were in better times than these,

but nevertheless, we hope that

the tide will turn soon and normal

times will be back. As the COVID-19

pandemic is still unfolding, it is

widely believed that it will have a

severe impact on economic activities

around the world.

A spate of opinions and forecasts

from specialists across the globe

are consistently pointing towards

weakening of the global economy

and the global GDP. In its latest

World Economic Outlook, April

2020 IMF projects a long period of

recession and a sharp contraction

in global GDP by –3% in 2020, much

worse than that during the

FY 2008–09 financial crisis. However,

in certain other scenarios based on

big containment efforts and early

resumption of economic activities,

the IMF baseline projection

estimates global growth to be

around ~5.8% in 2021 on the back

of early recovery. Nevertheless,

there is extreme uncertainty around

India had a very timely and a resolute response to the

COVID-19 pandemic as it undertook numerous health,

social, economic, fiscal and relief measures at the national,

regional and local levels in the face of the difficult situation

on the ground, making efforts to contain the spread of the

pandemic within communities as far as possible.

the global growth forecast and it

will be greatly dependent upon the

resumption of employment and

economic activity.

India had a very timely and a

resolute response to the COVID-19

pandemic as it undertook numerous

health, social, economic, fiscal and

relief measures at the national,

regional and local levels in the face

of the difficult situation on the

ground, making efforts to contain

the spread of the pandemic within

communities as far as possible.

However, impacted by COVID-19,

the Indian economy is projected

to grow at a far lower rate of

around 1.9% in calendar year 2020,

down from the earlier pre-COVID

estimate of 5.9%. This figure may

further come down as the income

levels and employment numbers

continue their downward trend,

with muted demand considerably

undermining the growth potential

of the economy.

In an alternate scenario, the

economy may witness relatively

quicker turnaround based on sound

policies and coordinated measures

taken jointly by the Government

of India and the RBI, which are

already evident. On the back of

these expectations, we should see

faster recovery in post COVID-19

scenario. Based on these ground

realities, IMF projects India’s growth

to recover sharply to ~7.4% in

calendar year 2021.

‘‘I recently took

charge as Chairman of

the Board of Directors

at AU Bank, based

on the approval of

the Board and the

Reserve Bank of India.

During this period,

when the world is

going through the

most unprecedented

and trying times,

I sincerely hope

you and everyone

around is taking due

care, and keeping

healthy and safe.’’

• “AU Bank completed its

three years as a Bank and 25

years as an institution. While

seized by the impending

challenges, the Bank remains

charged with optimism, and

I have confidence in the

Bank’s ability to overcome

the challenges and scale

greater heights.”

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

FY 2019-20 was third year of

our operations as a Bank. I am

pleased to share that despite

several challenges including the

unexpected emergency imposed by

COVID-19, our overall performance

has remained satisfactory.

Concerns over the health of the

financial sector intensified due to

moratorium placed on deposits

withdrawal for a co-operative

Bank and then a private Bank.

Consumer demand, which had

already been subdued due to a

continued slowdown in overall

economic activity, was significantly

exacerbated by the onslaught

of COVID-19, and the situation

continues to remain fluid. Despite

these challenges, we delivered a

satisfactory financial performance.

We have always emphasised on

growing based on our strengths,

consistent operational performance

and optimal utilisation of capital

and funding sources. We are now

one of India’s fastest growing and

progressive SFBs with best-in-class

asset quality and a steadily growing

liability franchise.

As AU turns 25, I express my

gratitude to all those who have

been with us in this journey –

customers, employees, investors,

lenders, vendors and our

esteemed regulators. Achieving

this milestone would not have

been possible without your trust,

support and guidance.

Whole-Time

Director’s Message

Building a

strong

foundation

As AU turns 25, I express my gratitude to all those who have

been with us in this journey – customers, employees, investors,

lenders, vendors and our esteemed regulators. Achieving this

milestone would not have been possible without your trust,

support and guidance.

Looking back, I feel proud of what

we have achieved in our journey so

far. However, I believe this is merely

the beginning of even better things

to come. Our confidence stems from

the fact that first as an NBFC and

then as a Bank, we have successfully

navigated through many economic

cycles and, over the years, we have

been able to build a sustainable

growing platform founded on some

key first principles.

These principles include a focus

on primarily financing secured

and small ticket loans, which aid

income generation, pricing the

risk appropriately and contiguous

expansion. A key strength is our

deeply rooted vintage leadership

team, who is well connected to the

ground reality in their respective

domains. This, along with our

agile-minded staff, helps to quickly

and accurately relay intelligence

regarding changes in our ground

environment to key decision makers,

subsequent quick decision-making

and speedy execution of these

changes. This gives us considerable

flexibility to quickly capture

emerging opportunities and pre-

empt rising risks.

FY 2019-20 was another year

of sound performance, where

we expanded our outreach

to 647 touchpoints, grew our

disbursements by ~16% (to `18,634

crore) and, in turn, grew our Assets

Under Management (AUM) by 27%

to `30,893 crore. Notably, our

disbursement growth was negatively

impacted as we effectively could

not disburse in the last 10 days of

March (which is typically the busiest

month) due to the emergence of

COVID-19. We achieved a balance

sheet size of ` 42,143 crore. It was

the power of the Bank’s platform

that helped us expand our balance

sheet ~4.3 times in a short span

of three years as a Bank. We are

overwhelmed with the customer

confidence and look forward to the

countless opportunities before us in

the coming years.

REAPING BENEFITS OF A

CALIBRATED GROWTH

STRATEGY

One key reason for our higher

growth and profitability relative to

several peers is due to our ability to

adapt quickly to our environment.

For instance, we were able to

quickly act upon the opportunity in

used vehicles financing by rapidly

expanding our used car dealer

network and aligning our resources

in that direction. Notably, we are

probably the one of the fewest

early lenders to have successfully

built a scalable business model in

the used vehicle financing market

by formalising the connect with

the used vehicle ecosystem, similar

to what we have in place in new

vehicles financing. This helped

us counterbalance the impact of

the continued slowdown in new

WAY FORWARD

With our objective to emerge as a

preferred employer, we are investing

in our people and empowering

them with contemporary skills.

Besides, we are adopting data-

based decision-making and

preparing our people to embrace

automation. Going forward, we

will enhance engagement with our

people, encouraging them further

to espouse the latest technology

and management techniques. We

will also concentrate on retaining

our star performers, simultaneously

developing bench strength for key

positions to bolster our pipeline.

Since the very beginning, we set

high standards in building our

franchise on people, process

and products. We maintain high

standards by ensuring a safe

workplace, building best quality

offices and providing a conducive

work environment to our

employees.

The Bank, keeps its employees

at the core, considering them as

our biggest asset in building a

Banking franchise to trust upon.

The Bank also ensures fire safety

as a key area for the safety

of employees and a fire drill

training programme is organised

periodically at our offices.

During the drill, we ensure that

all employees exit the building on

time for practice. Our safety and

security team teaches employees

to react well during an emergency

and conduct demonstration of fire-

fighting using the fire extinguisher

at the premises. There were fire

drills organised throughout the

year, in our major offices, which

were manned with enormous

number of employees. We have also

disseminated adequate knowledge

on fire safety to our branches in

the form of mailers and posters.

With the objective of gender equality,

we always put our efforts to nurture

the talent of our employees.

The Bank is also sensitive towards

ensuring a conducive environment

for both the male and female

workforce, by having adequate

policies and procedures in place for

‘Prevention of Sexual Harassment

at Workplace’ which ensures a safe

work-place, for its employees. The

Bank has a zero tolerance policy on

sexual harassment at the workplace

and has constituted a committee to

address the issues. It also encourages

employees to feel free and raise

concerns by being whistle blowers.
