Glimpses of Events:

Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to share our Annual Report for the Financial Year 2020.

Let me begin by thanking all of you for the confidence bestowed on us,

which has helped us to deliver a strong Financial Year despite a challenging

environment.

You may recall, in my message in the Annual Report of 2016, I referred to the

Perfect Storm that challenged businesses and how (then) we beat the odds

and emerged stronger. But, now that Perfect Storm seems to have gathered

further strength and turned into a Tsunami Plus, with undimensioned and

profound impact over our lives and businesses. The global catastrophe

caused due to the outbreak of Covid-19 has changed our collective calculus

of uncertainty and has left Nations, Economies and Industries, grappling to

shift to a new World Order!

Closer home, in India, the pandemic has led to an intertwined quandary with

the overlap of an economic setback over a health crisis. Unfortunately this

pandemic has occurred in the midst of the nation’s pursuit of becoming a

US$ 5 trillion economy. Nevertheless, while we are still fighting the microbe,

the turmoil has encouraged our Government to change its economic vision

around ‘Self- Reliance’, through a smorgasbord of controls and reforms.

Not surprisingly, the last fiscal was an extremely challenging period for

Banks in India. Though Covid-19 appeared around the fag end of the

FY, the industry faced several other materially impactful events, be it the

announcement of PSB mergers, the unpleasant crisis around NBFCs, the

fall and resurrection of a Private Bank or some of the concerns around

governance practices in certain institutions. During these volatile times,

your Bank worked hard, to be an Island of Calm, relatively insulated from

the odds and delivering a strong financial performance. The resilience and

strength built on the back of strong fundamentals, contributed to the

robust operating momentum across many of the key metrices.

Last year, I spoke to you about our journey from ’Presence to Prominence’

in chosen geographies and ‘Prominence to Dominance’ in our home

market. We have seen consistent gains and recorded a healthy increase in

Market Share across key geographies and segments (Refer chart on page 7)

and our visibility among the top quartile Banks, both in terms of business

and governance has amplified in the last Financial Year. You may have noted

that our efforts were recognized with us receiving international mention by

Forbes, a leading business publication, who listed us among the Top 200

companies in the Asia Pacific with a topline of above a billion dollars.

We owe this recognition to our ever-expanding customer base which is the

bedrock of support for all our endeavors. With share gain in both Market

Share and Mind Share, we are now

Bankers to over 1 Crore Indians! The

testimony to having a granular customer

base is our strong Liability Franchise,

with Retail Deposits constituting over 90

per cent of the Total Deposits. Several

client engagement initiatives and the enhanced digital footprint were key in

leveraging this inherent strength to remain well-positioned in comparison

to our competition.

While we continue to strengthen our fundamentals and leverage the

attributes built through balanced growth efforts, we are acutely aware

of the extraordinary times that calls for an extraordinary operating plan.:

Malus/ claw back arrangement or a compensation recovery policy is provided, which will entail the Bank to recover proportionate amount

of variable compensation paid to the above functionaries on account of an act or decision taken by the official which has brought forth a

negative contribution to the bank at a prospective stage. If an Official covered under Compensation Recovery Policy, is responsible for any act

or omission or non compliance of regulatory guidelines resulting in a penalty being imposed by any Regulators or engages in a detrimental

conduct against the interests of the Bank, as determined by the Nomination Committee of the Board, within 36 months from the date of

payment of variable compensation, the Bank may require such covered official to reimburse the Bank within 6 months for all, or a portion of,

any bonus, incentive payment, equity based award or other compensation received by such Covered Official.

Committees to mitigate risks caused by an individual decision

In order to further balance the impact of market or credit risks caused to the Bank by an individual decision taken by a senior level executive,

MD & CEO or ED, the bank has constituted various committees to take decisions on various aspects:

•

Credit limits are sanctioned by committees at different levels.

•

Investment decisions of the Bank are taken and monitored by Investment committee and there is an upper limit in treasury dealings

where individual decisions can be taken.

•

Interest rates on asset and liability products for different buckets are decided and monitored by the Asset Liability Committee of the Board

(ALCO). Bank's exposure to liquidity risk are also monitored by ALCO.

Integrated Risk Management Department (IRMD)

In order to effectively govern the compensation structure, IRMD would assist the Remuneration Committee of the Board to monitor, review

and control various risks and balance prudent risk taking with the compensation paid out to top executives and other employees.

Compensation of risk control staff

The total fixed and variable compensation paid out to the employees of Risk and Financial Control Staff are independent of business param-

eters and rendering of effective support to the Remuneration Committee of the Board. The variable compensation component (Performance

Linked Incentive or PLI) will be subjected to a minimum and greater proportion of compensation will be fixed in nature to ensure autonomy

and independence from business goals.
