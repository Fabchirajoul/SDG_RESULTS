Dear Shareholders,

For ICICI securities Limited, Fy2020

has been another year of rewarding

and enriching experiences. As

Chairman of the very distinguished

Board of your Company with a highly

motivated and skilled Management,

it has been my privilege to be witness to

this interesting journey. The year was

marked by significant developments

in the business environment as well in

our efforts to transform the business

model of your Company.

your Company has been able

to successfully innovate and

transform itself over the last two

decades to remain a leading

edge player in a competitive

and technology-driven industry.

10 Annual Report 2019-20:

Managing director &

Chief executive officer

This, year we embarked on a journey to transform

the business model of your Company to a more

broad-based,

granular

and

comprehensive

marketplace for meeting financial investments,

protection and borrowing needs of our customers,

delivered

predominantly

through

a

digital

architecture. It has been an eventful year and

I am happy to report that our strategy helped us

emerge stronger.

an eventfUL YeaR

Fy2020 can best be described as a tale of three

distinct phases. In the first phase, which lasted till

about september 2020, we saw global economies

facing slowdown fears and India’s gDP growth

slowing down to 5.1% in Q2Fy2020, a 26 quarters

low. As a result, financial markets remained tepid

throughout the first half of Fy2020.

The second phase commencing from the beginning

of Q3Fy2020 to early part of Q4Fy2020 saw some

green shoots owing to the fear of us slowdown

fading and trade tensions between us and China

easing. During this period, interest rate regime was

turning expansionary, aiding liquidity and driving

global financial markets. Key policy interventions

by India, announced in Q2Fy2020 including

FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) policy reforms,

recapitalisation of public sector banks, and cuts

announced in corporate tax rate started helping

market sentiments and attracting flows into our

capital market despite weak macros, resulting in

a broader market rally with the NIFTy and sensex

touching their lifetime highs in January 2020.

It has been an eventful year and

I am happy to report that our

strategy helped us emerge stronger.: Dear Shareholders,

We, at ICICI securities,

cherish your association with

us and remain committed

to delivering value to you

sustainably.

performance of the Board, the Committees of the Board

and the individual members of the Board, which assessed

the performance of the Board on selected parameters

related to roles, responsibilities and obligations of the

Board and functioning of the Committees including

assessing the quality, quantity and timeliness of flow of

information between the Company management and the

Board that was necessary for the Board to effectively and

reasonably perform their duties. The evaluation criteria for

the Directors (including Independent Directors) was based

on their participation, contribution and offering guidance

to and understanding of the areas that were relevant to

them in their capacity as members of the Board.

With respect to the Whole-time Directors, the NRC has

oversight over payment of compensation. The NRC

defines key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) for Whole-time

Directors and the organisational performance norms. The

KPIs include both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The

NRC assesses organisational performance as well as the

individual performance of the Whole-time Directors.

POLICY/CRITERIA

FOR

DIRECTORS’

APPOINTMENT

The Company with the approval of its NRC has put in place a

policy on Directors’ appointment and remuneration including

the criteria for determining qualifications, positive attributes

and independence of a Director. The NRC evaluates the

composition of the Board and vacancies arising in the Board

from time to time. The NRC, as and when required while

recommending candidature of a Director, considers the

requisite special knowledge or expertise possessed by the

candidate. The NRC assesses the fit and proper credentials

of the candidate. The NRC also evaluates the prospective

candidate for the position of Director from the perspective

of the criteria for independence prescribed under the Act.

The NRC based on the above assessment makes suitable

recommendations on the appointment of Directors to the

Board. The NRC evaluates the performance of the Executive

Directors of the Company on an annual basis.:

Managing Director & CEO = 104:1

Ajay Saraf, Executive Director = 53:1

The ratio of remuneration for the Independent

Directors is as under:

Vinod Kumar Dhall, Chairman and Independent

Director = 4.11:1

Ashvin Parekh, Independent Director = 4.86:1

Subrata Mukherji, Independent Director = 4.60:1

Vijayalakshmi Iyer, Independent Director = 4.54:1

Non-executive Non-independent Directors do not

draw any remuneration from the Company.

(ii) The percentage increase in remuneration of

each director, Chief Financial Officer, Chief

Executive Officer, Company Secretary or

Manager, if any, in the financial year:

The percentage increase in remuneration of

Whole-time Directors, Chief Financial Officer and

Company Secretary ranged between 6% and 7.5%.

(iii) The percentage increase in the median

remuneration of employees, who are part of

the annual review plan in the financial year:

The percentage increase in the median remuneration

of employees, who were part of the annual review

plan, in the financial year was around 8%.

(iv) The number of permanent employees on the

rolls of Company:

Employee headcount at March 31, 2020 was 3,790.

year and its comparison with the percentile

increase in the managerial remuneration and

justification thereof and point out if there are

any exceptional circumstances for increase in

the managerial remuneration:

The average percentage increase in the salaries

of total employees other than the Key Managerial

Personnel for FY2020 was around 8%, while the

increase in the remuneration of the Key Managerial

Personnel was in the range of 6% to 7.5%.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Philosophy on Corporate Governance

The Company’s corporate governance philosophy

encompasses regulatory and legal requirements, which

aims at a high level of business ethics, effective supervision

and enhancement of value for all stakeholders.

The Company considers its stakeholders as partners in

success and the Company remains committed to maximising

stakeholders’ value. The Company believes that sound

corporate governance mechanism is critical to retain and

enhance stakeholders’ trust. The Company is committed

to exercise overall responsibilities rigorously and diligently

throughout the organisation, managing its affairs in a manner

consistent with corporate governance requirements. The

Company’s corporate governance philosophy is based on

an effective independent Board, the separation of Board’s

supervisory role from the executive management and

the Board Committees, generally comprising a majority

of Independent/Non-executive Directors and chaired by

Independent Directors, to oversee critical areas.:

on the financial statements and internal controls relating

to financial reporting has been obtained.

COMMERCIAL PAPERS

The Company, apart from its own funds, meets the

liquidity needs primarily through short-term borrowings

through Commercial Papers (‘CPs’) being commercially

most optimal. The Board of Directors had, at its meeting

held on January 14, 2019, accorded approval for

borrowing of money by issuance of CPs for a sum not

exceeding ` 25 billion outstanding at any point of time.

Accordingly, the Company had been issuing unlisted CPs

as and when required.

Pursuant to SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/IMD/DF2/

CIR/P/2019/104 dated October 1, 2019, mutual fund

schemes are not allowed to invest in unlisted CPs

effective January 1, 2020. Further, all the fresh

investments by mutual fund schemes in CPs could be

made only in listed CPs or to be listed CPs on a Stock

Exchange. SEBI vide Circular no. SEBI/HO/DDHS/

DDHS/CIR/P/2019/115 dated October 22, 2019 had

issued ‘Framework for listing of Commercial Paper’

specifying the details required to be submitted to the

Stock Exchange(s) for listing of CPs. Accordingly, the

Company had made applications for listing of CPs to

BSE Limited (‘BSE’) which were listed subsequently

and continues to list its CPs on BSE on an on-going

basis.

UDIN: F005533B000168553

Peer Review No: P2009MH007000

Place: Mumbai

Date: 20/04/2020:

Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva added

that she expected a recession that is as bad as or worse

than the 2008 global financial crisis.

COVID-19 is an evolving crisis that has already resulted in

tens of thousands of job losses around the world and the

near decimation of some sectors that are entirely reliant

on human mobility. Its economic impact will depend on

how efficiently countries are able to contain its spread.

Indian Economic Overview

During FY2020, India’s economic growth decelerated

continuously as the year progressed. As per provisional

estimates, real GDP growth for the first two quarters

of FY2020 came in at 5.2% and 4.4% respectively. A

variety of factors were responsible for this deceleration

in growth including delayed onset and spatially skewed

distribution of monsoon, continued slowdown in

manufacturing and weak private consumption. While

there were hopes of a turnaround in H2FY2020, the

economy’s performance slid further in Q3FY2020 as real

GDP growth plunged to 4.1% on the back of broad-based

deceleration in industry and services. However, strong

growth in government expenditure provided the

much-needed support to headline growth during the

first three quarters of FY2020 as the government tried to

cushion the impact of slowdown. Coronavirus and the

resultant lockdown weighed heavily on the economy in

the last quarter of FY2020 and real GDP growth plunged

to just 3.1%, taking full year growth to 4.2%.

Headline retail inflation, as measured by Consumer Price

Index (CPI), was benign in the beginning of FY2020. CPI

started inching up sharply from September-October 2019

due to higher food prices. However, towards the end of

FY2020, normalisation of food prices and easing oil prices

led to easing of inflation.

Equity Markets

FY2020 was a year of extreme volatility for Indian equity

markets. While the fiscal year started on a positive note for

equities, the market continued to remain polarised, with a

handful of stocks contributing to the bulk of the performance.

In the second quarter, risks of a global slowdown started

building up as the US yield curve inverted and the US

economy entered the longest period of economic expansion

in history in the backdrop of an escalating trade war and

other geo-political risks such as Brexit.

Acknowledging the risks to global growth, most central

banks such as the Federal Reserve System aka US Fed,

ECB (European Central Bank), and PBOC (People’s Bank

of China) turned dovish in the second half of CY2019,

thereby improving the outlook for interest rates and

global liquidity. This resulted in a pick-up in Emerging

Market (EM) equities, including that of India, from the

beginning of third quarter of FY2020.

Indian equities were also buoyed by tax cuts for the

corporate sector. The rising risk appetite resulted in a pick-up

in broader markets in the form of mid and small caps. The

NIFTY 50 index hit an all-time high in January 2020, only to

plunge in March 2020 due to fears of the COVID-19 impact:
