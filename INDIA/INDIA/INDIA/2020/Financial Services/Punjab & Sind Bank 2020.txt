The outbreak of Covid-19, which was declared as a Global Pandemic on March 11, 2020 by World Health Organization

(WHO), has contributed to a significant decline in economic activities and increase in volatility in financial markets all across

the world including India. The extent to which Covid-19 pandemic will impact the credit and recovery segment of bank

will depends on future developments which are highly uncertain. The Bank is evaluating the situation on ongoing basis.

The major identified challenges for the bank would arise from eroding cash flows and extended working capital cycles.

Despite these challenges, the management believes that no adjustments are required in the financial results as the Bank is

adequately capitalized and has sufficient liquidity to take care of its present and future operations and there would not be

any significant impact on Bank's performance in future and going concern assumption as at presently made.:

letter No.HR&IR/XIBPS/7944 dated 01.10.2019, Bank has made an adhoc payment of Rs.46.28 crore equivalent

to one month salary to all permanent workmen staff and officers on the rolls of the Bank as on 01.11.2017 and are still

continuing in service. The net provision held as on March 31, 2020 is Rs.243.72 Crore.

18.

The bank has made an additional provision in terms of RBI Circular DBR.No.BP.BC.45/21.04.048/2018-19 dated 7th June,

2019 on Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets amounting to Rs. 153.80 Crore.
