LETTER

Dear Shareholder,

This: letter should have been written to you by Nanoo Pamnani, who had taken over as the

Letter

8 BAJAJ FINSERV LIMITED

Let me begin with BFL. Despite losing out on eight days at the end of March on account of the

nation-wide COVID-19 lockdown, BFL has performed excellently. Here are some key facts:

l

New loans booked during FY2020 increased by 17% to 27.44 million.

l

Customer franchise increased by 24% to 42.60 million as of 31 March 2020.

l

Assets under management (AUM) grew by 27% to H 147,153 crore as of 31 March 2020.

l

Net interest income for FY2020 was up by 42% to H 16,913 crore.

l

Loan losses and provisions (expected credit loss) for FY2020 were H 3,929 crore versus

H 1,501 crore in FY2019. BFL took an accelerated charge of H 392 crore for two large accounts

and made a contingency provision of H 900 crore for COVID-19 . Adjusted for these one-time

provisions of H 1,292 crore taken in Q4 FY2020, loan losses and provisions for FY2020 would

have been H 2,637 crore.

l

Profit after tax (PAT) for FY2020 grew by 32% to H 5,264 crore even after absorbing

the above provisions.

l

The capital adequacy ratio (including Tier-II capital) as of 31 March 2020 stood at 25.01%.

The Tier-I capital stood at 21.27%.

l

During the year, BFL raised equity capital of approximately H 8,500 crore through

the QIP route.

Bajaj Housing Finance (BHFL), a 100% subsidiary of BFL, also did well in FY2020. It earned a net

interest income of H 1,030 crore; profit before tax (PBT) of H 567 crore; and PAT of H 421 crore.

What about the insurance companies? Both BALIC and BAGIC faced the turmoil of COVID-19 at the

end of FY2020 — and BAGIC had to deal with the costs of Cyclone Fani that hit Orissa. Yet, both

posted good results.

In general insurance, BAGIC’s results for FY2020 are synopsised below:

l

Some 26.9 million policies were issued in the year, versus about 20 million in FY2019.

l

Gross written premium rose by 15.6% for FY2020 to H 12,833 crore.

l

BAGIC’s market share in the industry, including standalone insurers, improved to 7.16% versus

6.86% a year earlier.

l

Net earned premium grew by 17.1% to H 8,206 crore.

l

The combined ratio, which is a measure of the profitability of the insurance operations,

was 100.8% and expected to be among the best in the industry.

l

PAT increased by 28.1% to H 999 crore.:

Letter

13th ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20 9

In life insurance, BALIC’s results for FY2020 were:

l

Individual rated new business premium increased by 10.6% to H 1,927 crore, which was

higher than the industry growth rate of 6.2%

l

Group protection new business premium increased by 29.1% to H 1,872 crore.

l

New business premium grew by 5.2% to H 5,179 crore.

l

Renewal premium rose by 16.2% to H 4,574 crore. Hence, gross written premium increased

by 10.1% to H 9,753 crore.

l

New Business Value (NBV), which is the metric used to measure profitability of life insurance

businesses, increased by 47.4% to H 227 crore.

l

PAT for FY2020 was H 450 crore.

l

13th month persistency remained steady; and 25th month persistency saw an improvement.

l

BALIC is soundly capitalised with a solvency ratio of 745% as on 31 March 2020, which is well

in excess of the minimum regulatory requirement of 150%.

Thanks to the commendable business and financial performance of BFL, BAGIC and BALIC, your

Company’s financials have also done well. Under Ind AS, when preparing consolidated financials,

your Company has had to provide for unrealised mark-to-market losses in respect of equity

holdings of the insurance companies of H 768 crore in Q4 FY2020.

l

Bajaj Finserv’s consolidated revenue for FY2020 was H 54,351 crore — representing a 28%

increase over the previous year.

l

Consolidated profit after giving effect to the COVID-19 impact of provision for loan losses and

unrealised equity losses was H 3,369 crore — up by 5% compared to the previous year.

For each of businesses that constitute Bajaj Finserv, the real challenge will be in FY2021, as their

managements design, operationalise and implement ways of dealing with the potentially

deleterious consequences of COVID-19 . Focusing on cost efficiencies, speedier deliveries and

leveraging the IT infrastructure to bring about significant improvements in ways of doing business

will be crucial. There are some positive trends also that are likely to emerge as customers

embrace digital ways of interacting with our companies.

On my part, while I acknowledge the challenges posed by COVID-19 , I remain confident

of the capability, zeal and resolve of the management teams in each of the companies.

Therefore, despite a seemingly grim scenario, I remain cautiously optimistic about your

Company and each of its businesses.

Stay safe.

With best wishes,

Sanjiv Bajaj

Included in this Report

Preface

As mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), India’s top 1000 listed entities

based on market capitalisation on the BSE Ltd. (BSE) and National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.

(NSE), are required to submit a ‘Business Responsibility Report’ (BRR) along with their Annual

Report for 2019-20. This Report is required to be in line with ‘National Voluntary Guidelines on

Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business’ (NVG), as released by the

Ministry of Corporate Affairs in July 2011.

As one of India’s leading companies in the financial sector, Bajaj Finserv Ltd. (‘BFS’ or ‘the

Company’) has adopted the NVG and BRR requirements both in: letter and spirit. All of the

Company’s commitments, business decisions and activities are aligned to the NVG principles.

In order to ensure strong governance around this, the business responsibility performance of the

Company is assessed annually by its Board of

Managing Director in the Annual Report.

l

The Company is a signatory to the Model Code of Conduct developed by the Confederation

of Indian Industry (CII) and the same is placed on the Company’s website

https://www.bajajfinserv.in/media/corporate/downloads/cii-code-of-conduct-signed.pdf

This Code of Conduct have specific anti-corruption clauses pertaining to payment and

acceptance of bribes and favours.

l

All material outsourcing agreements with vendors across BFS and its subsidiaries have

anti-corruption clauses and all vendors are required to abide by the same.

l

BFL and BHFL have relevant policies related to disciplinary action and grievance redressal,

fraud prevention and prevention of money laundering in line with the requirements of

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and National Housing Board (NHB) respectively.

Transparency

l

Transparency and fairness in dealings with customers is one of the stated principles of the

Company to which all the subsidiaries adhere to. None of the products withhold any relevant

information needed by the customers to make informed choices.

l

The Company follows a transparent investor communication protocol including investor

presentations, quarterly investor calls and uploading of call transcripts. Members of

the senior managements of the insurance subsidiaries participate in the investor calls,

underlining the importance of these calls. BFL, a subsidiary of the Company, is a listed entity

and carries out its own investor communications in line with the Group protocol.

l

After the end of each quarter, BFL voluntarily provides provisional key financial metrics

pertaining to that quarter to the stock exchanges. This is done to ensure symmetry of

information in line with the principles of fair disclosures.

l

The insurance companies endeavour to maintain complete transparency with its customers

and distributors through real-time online availability of account statements, policy

documents, receipts, etc. to all customers and agents. In addition, Life insurance being a

long-term commitment is backed by a goal based sales accompanied by a Key Feature

document and a benefit illustration that completely explains the product features, conditions,

etc. to every customer.:

BFS, BFL, BALIC and BAGIC hold higher number of Board meetings as against the

minimum of four required by law. This also facilitates familiarisation of independent

directors with respective companies’ businesses.

vi. Company Secretaries of BFS and its subsidiaries meet regularly to discuss and

implement issues of common applicability thereby ensuring consistency across

BFS group companies.

Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and

contribute to sustainability throughout their life cycle

Primarily, BFS is the Promoter of financial services companies. The Company and its subsidiaries

do not have consumption of raw materials nor do they produce any physical goods. However,

BFS has direct investment in 138 windmills with a total installed capacity of 65.2 MW.

This enables the Company to promote renewable energy production and low-carbon sustainable

growth, thereby contributing to India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change.

The wind-farms are maintained under the supervision of BFS engineers and supported by

comprehensive maintenance contracts. They are certified for management systems such as

ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 for quality, environment and health & safety respectively.

In 2019-20, the windmills generated 792 lakh units of net power. The Company and its

subsidiaries do not consume the minimum power needed to qualify for captive consumption and

hence, the power is wheeled to third party consumers.

The insurance subsidiaries of BFS offer products which are value-added, simple to understand

and responsive to the needs of their customers. Both the insurance subsidiaries have a wide

reach in providing insurance service in rural and social sectors. These include providing services

to unorganised sector and economically vulnerable or backward classes, which are otherwise

deprived of the benefits of financial inclusion. BALIC offers products in the savings, retail and

group protection segments and BAGIC offers products in the motor, health, crop insurance,

property and commercial lines of business. These products have been designed to help customers

meet their respective risk management objectives and life goals. Further, both the insurance:

Managing Director of the Company, was the

Chairman of CII, Western Region for the year 2019-20 as well as the Chairman of the CII National

Committee for Insurance and Pensions.

The Company proactively contributes to the discussions and resolutions within the scope of the

above-mentioned associations. Through these associations, BFS routinely puts forward its views

on formulation of new industry standards and regulatory developments pertaining to the non-

banking finance and insurance sectors. This includes aspects such as governance, administration,

economic reforms and inclusive development policies, among others. Furthermore, the

Company consistently attempts to balance the interests of various stakeholders while making

any recommendations. Both insurance subsidiaries are amongst the largest companies in their

respective industries and hence play a very active role in policy making along with the Regulator

through their contribution to various committees formed by IRDAI or through the Life and the

General Insurance Councils.

Principle 8: Businesses should support inclusive growth and equitable

development

The vision and philosophy of Late Jamnalal Bajaj, the founder of Bajaj Group, guide the Corporate

Social Responsibility (CSR) activities of the Group. He embodied the concept of trusteeship in

business and common good, and laid the foundation for ethical, value-based and transparent

functioning.

The Bajaj Group believes that true and full measure of growth, success and progress lies beyond

balance sheets or conventional economic indices. It is best reflected in the difference that

business and industry make to the lives of people. Thus, community development forms the core

of all CSR initiatives undertaken by Bajaj Group. These initiatives are designed to reflect the needs

of the target population. In order to ensure community ownership and sustainability of the CSR

programmes, key stakeholders such as governments, NGOs, local communities and other local

institutions are actively engaged during project planning as well as implementation.

On 26 March 2020, Bajaj Group committed H 100 crore towards the fight against the recent

outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, which has severely impacted the people of many countries,

including India. By working with the Government and Bajaj’s network of over 200 NGO partners,

Bajaj Group ensured that these resources reach those individuals who needed it the most.

As part of this initiative, support was provided to upgrade/strengthen key healthcare

infrastructure in Pune, while ensuring food supply, shelter, access to sanitation, rural care,

livelihood aid and awareness creation on COVID-19.

Further, to strengthen the fight against COVID-19, BFS and its subsidiaries and group employees

have together contributed over H 10 crore to the PM Cares Fund.:
