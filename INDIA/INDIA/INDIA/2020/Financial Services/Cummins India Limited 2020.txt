Dear Shareholders,

Mark Levett

Chairman,

Cummins India Limited

T

his annual: letter is intended to provide a review of

2019, which was a year of mixed sentiments for

Cummins India Limited. I want to start by thanking

you for all you did. The year marked Cummins Inc.’s

centennial anniversary and we successfully celebrated

this remarkable achievement in India with our

employees, families, customers, suppliers, and

community partners.

While 2019 will always remain a memorable year, it was

also a difficult one in many ways. In the second half of

the year, Cummins began to experience a decline in

sales due to market challenges in much of the world.

Demand for our on-highway products deteriorated faster

and more severely than anticipated. Weakness was also

evident in our off-highway businesses, where global

power generation, construction and mining sales started

to weaken as well.

In response, we worked towards restructuring several of

the Company’s operations to reduce costs, streamline

operations and match capacity with market demand.

Responding effectively to the challenges of market

cycles has helped us perform steadily during periods of

downturns.

As of this writing, several of our India plants and offices

are temporarily closed or at reduced capacity and our

community is being impacted in so many ways by the

COVID-19 global pandemic. We had planned for 2020

to be a difficult year with decreased demand in most of

our major markets, and that planning is serving us well

as we now navigate additional pandemic-related

challenges. Unfortunately, the worst is not over yet and

this challenging situation will continue for longer than

initially expected.

Cummins has always viewed challenges as opportunities

and has successfully tackled these head-on with

resilience and determination. As we look inwards

towards improving our operational efficiencies that have

a lasting impact, we also continue executing our strategy

for long-term growth, investing in new technologies and

Thank You,

Mark Levett

In closing, Cummins has always been focused on

powering a more prosperous world, be it financial

stability or sustainability for our stakeholders.

compliance with FEMA regulations relating to realization and

repatriation of foreign currency proceeds.



We assessed the trade receivables impairment methodology

provisioning rates against historical collection data. We assessed

whether the time value of money was considered in the expected

credit loss impairment model and tested the mathematical

accuracy of the calculations.



We performed various analytical procedures to identify any

unusual sales trends for further testing.

(refer note 1(n) and note 1(d) (accounting policy), note 3, note 19 and note 39(i) (financial disclosures) and note 35

(significant judgements and estimates) to the standalone Ind AS financial statements)

The Company issues product warranties under

which the performance of products delivered is

generally guaranteed for a certain period or term.

The reserve for product warranties includes the

expected costs of warranty obligations imposed

by the contract, as well as the expected costs for

additional policy coverage. In addition, the Company

periodically initiates voluntary service to address

various customer satisfaction, safety and emissions

issues related to engines sold. The estimated future

costs of the service are based primarily on historical

Our audit procedures included:



We obtained understanding of the warranty process, and the

assumptions used by the management in the process of

calculation of warranty provision, including design and

implementation of controls, testing of management review controls

and tested the operating effectiveness of these controls.



We evaluated management’s methodology and assumptions

used in the warranty provision calculations and assessed the

impact of any changes to the terms of warranty, if any, on account

of the COVID-19 pandemic.:

Managing Director’s statement, Director’s Report including Annexures to the Director’s

Report and the Business Responsibility Report of the Annual Report of the Company, but does not include the standalone Ind

AS financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the standalone Ind AS financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any

form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information

and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed,

we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have

nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Those charged with Governance for the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the

preparation of these standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial

performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the

accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section

133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also

includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the

assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate

accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation

and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and

completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone Ind AS financial

statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone Ind AS financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to

continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis

of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic

alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole are

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will

always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered

material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users

taken on the basis of these standalone Ind AS financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism

throughout the audit. We also:



Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, whether due to

fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is

sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting

from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.



Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate

in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether

the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating

effectiveness of such controls.



Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and

related disclosures made by management.:

COVID 19

During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (‘COVID-19’) spread

throughout the world and became a global pandemic. The pandemic triggered a significant downturn globally, including

in India, and the challenging market conditions could continue for an extended period of time. In an effort to contain the

spread of COVID-19, maintain the well-being of employees and stakeholders, match the reduced demand from our

customers and in accordance with the governmental requirements, offices and manufacturing facilities were shut

down. These closures expanded and continued into April/May 2020. While the downturn, closures and limitations on

movement are expected to be temporary, and though the lockdown restrictions have now been relaxed partially, the

duration of the production and supply chain disruptions, and related financial impacts, cannot be estimated at this

time.

The Group has assessed the impact of COVID-19 on its assets, including property, plant and equipments, receivables,

inventories etc. and it was concluded that the impact is not significant. However, the estimate of the impact of

COVID-19 may differ from the same ascertained up to the date of approval of these financial results by the Board of

Directors, based on how the COVID-19 situation evolves over a period of time.

Section E

Principle-wise Performance

Principle 1: Business should conduct and govern themselves with ethics, transparency and accountability.

The Company has designed and implemented a well-defined Ethics Policy which covers its employees as well as employees

of its joint ventures, associate companies, and distributors. Not only this, in their meeting held on January 28, 2005, the

Board of Directors have adopted the Code of Conduct which is devised in order to enable the Directors to strive to perform

their duties according to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, accountability, confidentiality and independence.

The Company’s view on ethics and fostering the right environment is reflected in the following statement from India Leadership

team where they mention, “Cummins is committed to fostering a physically and psychologically safe, integrity based,

respectful, inclusive, high performance culture that breaks down hierarchies and organizational boundaries, and engaging the

full talents of our diverse employees to delight all our stakeholders (employees, customers, partners, shareholders, suppliers,

communities) consistently.”

The Cummins Code of Conduct applies to all its employees, customers and business associates. In addition, the Cummins

Code of Conduct is also applicable to the joint ventures and its employees, customers and business associates. All

employees are expected to follow the Code of Conduct on or off company property when they are on Cummins business or

acting as an agent or on behalf of Cummins.

At Cummins, several principles under the Cummins Code of Conduct are implemented effectively to drive ethical behaviour at

all levels. The Cummins Code of Conduct covers ten basic principles:-



We will follow the law everywhere



We will embrace diverse perspectives and backgrounds and treat all people with dignity and respect



We will compete fairly and honestly



We will avoid conflicts of interest



We will demand that everything we do leads to a cleaner, healthier and safer environment



We will protect our technology, our information and our intellectual property
