ITEM NO. 8

In accordance to the provision of Regulation 16(1)(c) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,

2015 (“Listing Regulations”), Motilal Oswal Finvest Limited (MOFL), qualifies to be a material subsidiary of the Company as per the

financial statement of FY 2019-20. In view of the provision of Regulation 24(6) of the Listing Regulations, selling, disposing or leasing

of assets amounting to more than twenty per cent of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial

year shall require prior approval of shareholders of the holding Company by way of special resolution.:

Dear Shareholders,

The nature of FY2020 remained volatile and challenging

for the overall markets with various macro-level

headwinds like weak auto sales, muted growth in

personal and consumer loans and sluggish rural demand.

Adding to these woes was the default of a major housing

finance company, escalation in US-China trade tensions

and fall in oil prices. Even then, equity markets enjoyed a

bull run for most part of the year with the Sensex and

Nifty touching an all-time high in January. But with the

origination and spread of coronavirus and significant

lockdown imposed by the government, economic activity

was severely disrupted. India’s growth engines (private

consumption, private investment and exports) slowed

down significantly due to tightening credit and poor

customer sentiment. Despite such challenges during the

year, our company withstood the volatility and continued

to march towards achieving linearity in the business. We continue to remain optimistic on the

growth potential of all our business verticals given the robust fundamental structure and revival in

macro-conditions. Our consolidated revenues for FY2020 stood at ` 2,411 crores and consolidated

operating PAT for FY20 was at ` 398 cr, +56% YoY. Operating PAT is excluding MTM on fund based

investments. FY20 reported profit was lower at ` 183 cr on account of MTM loss on fund based

investments. Our RoE, excluding other comprehensive income, stands lower on YoY basis at 6.6%.

Going forward, our focus on knowledge, talent, processes, technology, brand & culture and inter-

segment synergies will pave the road for achieving milestones across all business verticals.

Despite regulatory changes on fees and AUM de-growth driven by market correction during the

year, PAT of our Asset Management business grew 9% YoY. Our AMC AUM which includes MFs,

PMS and AIFs stood at ` 29,691 crores at the end of FY2020. We firmly believe in our QGLP

(Quality, Growth, Longevity and Price) philosophy which has rewarded us over the years in terms

of performance and will continue to follow and improvise it. Our AMC business has always been

the promoter of trail based model and hence the ban on upfront fee structure has been in our

favour. Slab wise Total Expense Ratio (TER) changes has triggered higher redemption in 1st quarter

of the year resulting in negative net flows for the quarter. However, improvement in performance

of most of the schemes and effort of right communication to customers resulted in positive net

flows for the remaining quarters. The impact of TER change has been shared with distributors in

same proportion of commission sharing, so net impact to us is lower. During the year PE busienss

AUM has witnessed growth of 3% YoY to reach ` 6,530 crore led by successful fund raising of IREF-4

fund. We did not record any carry income during the year. Our Wealth Management business got

impacted on account of lower net sales during the year led by challenging market conditions and

adverse regulatory measures. Because of this, our AUM declined to ` 15,624 crores. But we have

been successful in adding new families. With the improvement in the vintage of RMs, the

profitability of our Wealth Management business is poised for further traction.

On the Capital Markets front, the suppressed sentiments and dip in FII flows had an impact on

primary and secondary markets. Despite such headwinds, we were successful in adding around

2.5 lakh clients taking the total Retail client base to ~14.5 lakh. Our distribution AUM has reached

above ` 9,034 crore and has huge head-room for growth as the client penetration stands at ~16%

of our retail client base. In Institution Equities business, our rankings and clientele continued to

remain robust. The Investment Banking business during the year remained under pressure as

primary market activities almost dried up as companies put their capital raising plans on hold. We
