the commercial losses caused to HUDCO and other expenses incurred by HUDCO since 1997-98 from the date

of completion of project subject to necessary approval/NOC of MoUD, Govt. of India.

letter has informed that the earlier decision for merger of IBHL with the parent bank was taken by the IBHL

Board on account of the then situation prevailing at that point of time. IBHL took various steps towards revival of housing finance

business. The authorized capital of the company was increased from ` 50 crore to ` 150 crore. The company initiated steps

for restructuring of capital by converting loan liabilities of Indian Bank into Compulsory Convertible Preference shares (CCPS)

carrying 0.01% rate for ` 130 crore. However, the required permission of RBI was not forthcoming and hence conversion of loan

liability to CCPS could not be carried out.

During the year 2019-20, IBHL has appointed M/s. SBI Capital Services Ltd as advisors for suggesting options available

to the company for enhancement of Housing Finance business through organic/inorganic means and IBHL is in touch with

prospective investors for infusion of funds, which will lead to dilution of HUDCO’s stake.

NHB, from time to time, has given certain relaxations from credit concentration norms considering the role envisaged for

infrastructure/ non-housing related activities) shall be capped at 50% of its NOF.

b)

in respect of State of Telangana and 100% of NOF for all other States. HUDCO is required to take suitable steps to

bring down the group exposure in respect of State of Telangana also to 100% within a maximum period of 3 years.

The conditions relating to compliance by the concerned State with the FRBM limits shall continue to be ensured by

HUDCO.

The Board of

letter no 1736/3.10.136/2019-20 dated 5th March, 2020 granted relaxation of credit concentration norms for
