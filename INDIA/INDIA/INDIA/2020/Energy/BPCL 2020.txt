dear Shareowners,

At the outset, i wish you and your loved ones the best of

health and well-being!

i am extremely happy to communicate with you for the

first time after taking over additional charge of Chairman

and: Managing director of your Company.

The year 2019-20 that progressed well until december

2019, witnessed unprecedented and confounding

changes, transitions and economic severities in the last

quarter. The Covid-19 pandemic brought the world to a

standstill, with most countries, including ours, resorting

to lockdowns and containment measures to check the

spread of the disease. As global economies gradually

open up and activity resumes, it reminds me of a famous

quote by Confucius, “our greatest glory is not in never

falling, but in rising every time we fall.”

Amidst these adversities, your Company emerged

stronger, exhibiting a resolute approach, identifying

opportunities, thus redefining resilience.

Playing a leading role in nation building, your Company

ensured uninterrupted supplies of petroleum products

and has been in the frontline of service during the

pandemic. Mindful of the evolving risks on various fronts,

we have focussed on safe operations, optimisation of

resources and enhancement of efficiencies, leveraging

technology and digitalisation to skilfully navigate through

these challenging times.

The extreme volatility in the crude oil prices and foreign

exchange rates and the pandemic-induced disruption in

economic activity at the end of the year 2019-20 severely

impacted the annual financial performance, resulting in

an overall decline in the profits of the Company for the

year. The profit after tax, on a standalone basis, declined

to ` 2,683 crores, mainly due to lower refining margins

and substantial inventory and foreign exchange variation

losses. However, your Company has been able to better

its physical performance, despite significant loss of sales

in March 2020 and achieved market sales and refinery

throughput of 43.10 MMT and 31.91 MMT respectively.

i am happy to share that your Company was the only

oil Marketing Company (oMC) amongst PSU oMCs to

register a growth in physical performance during the year.

The Board of directors declared a dividend of 165% in the

month of March 2020.

At the group level, the profit after tax attributable to BPCL

stood at ` 3,055 crores, while market sales and refinery

throughput were higher at 43.36 MMT and 38.30 MMT

respectively. Consolidating interests further, Bharat

oman Refineries Limited, hitherto our 50:50 Joint venture

Company, has undergone a change in its equity structure,

consequent to conversion of warrants into equity shares,

raising BPCL’s equity shareholding to 63.38%.

Leveraging organic and inorganic growth opportunities

over the years, your Company has expanded its footprint

across the hydrocarbon value chain and become a fully

integrated oil and gas player.

Pursuing the Go-GDP strategy, your Company has taken

definitive steps towards fostering a Greener environment,

permeating Digitalisation in all aspects of business and

firming up its footprints in the Petrochemicals portfolio.

our successful pilots of the newly launched “E-drive”

initiative - an innovative electric vehicle mobility model using

BPCL’s Retail outlets as battery swapping stations pave

the way for pan india expansion. our presence across the

alternate fuels / energy solutions will enable swift scale up

once these verticals prime up and economics improve.

The importance of digitalisation cannot be over-

emphasised in a world which is converging towards a

new normal post pandemic. Creating a digital ecosystem

has been our immediate priority and the Company

has taken major strides in proliferation of digitalisation

across operations, particularly refining operations and

management, and customer facing interfaces.

i am happy to share that the Propylene derivative

Petrochemical Project (PdPP) at Kochi Refinery (KR) for

manufacturing niche petrochemicals is completed and

will start commercial production soon. The project to

produce Polyols and related products at KR is on track

and will add to our growing petrochemicals portfolio,

generating substantial value going forward.

in a major step towards enhancing the distribution

network and reaching nearer to customers, your

Company commissioned 1,447 new Retail outlets across

the country, the highest in a financial year amongst the

PSU oMCs. BPCL also commissioned 118 vehicles fitted

with dispensers, once again the highest amongst PSU

oMCs, under the new initiative of door-to-door delivery of

diesel to stationary engines / generators and mining and

construction equipment. Customer centricity being an

integral part of BPCL’s culture, the Company has created

newer benchmarks in customer service and carved a

niche for itself.
