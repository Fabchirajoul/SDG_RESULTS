Letter to Shareholders

Partnering our way forward

Dear and Esteemed Fellow

Shareowners,

At the outset, it is my pleasant

duty to inform you that recently,

your Company has successfully

completed the Rights Issue of

₹53,124 crore. It was oversubscribed

1.59 times, cumulating to an overall

commitment of over ₹84,000 crore.

With feelings of pride and humility,

I would like to let you know that

this was the largest Rights Issue

in the last 10 years globally by a

non-financial institution, and the

largest ever in India. Your Company

thus created a new landmark in the

history of India’s capital market.

One of its significant features was that the

public portion was also subscribed 1.22

times, reflecting their widespread and

unwavering confidence in RIL’s vision of

the future. The Rights Entitlement (RE) was

actively traded with the prices always being

higher than the intrinsic value and these

healthy premia were a reflection of the

broad-based interest in the Rights Issue.

I convey my profuse and profound thanks

to all of you, both domestic and foreign

public shareholders, for your overwhelming

response to the Rights Issue.

The success of RIL’s Rights Issue becomes

all the more significant when seen in the

context of the prolonged nationwide

lockdown necessitated by the COVID-19

pandemic. It is a vote of confidence, by

both domestic and foreign investors, in the

intrinsic strength of the Indian economy.

I have no doubt that the Indian economy

will bounce back to follow a high-growth

trajectory in the times to come.

I dedicate the success of the

Rights Issue to our Founder and timeless

source of inspiration and guidance,

Shri Dhirubhai H. Ambani, who pioneered

people-oriented investment culture in

India. He taught us to remember, always,

that you are Reliance’s biggest source of

strength and that we must treasure your

trust as our greatest asset. I am therefore

both delighted and humbled by your

extraordinary show of confidence in the

future of Reliance.

We have recently raised over `1,68,818

crore through investments by global tech

investors into Jio Platforms of `1,15,694

crore and the Rights Issue of `53,124

crore. The combined capital raised has no

precedence globally in such a short time.

Both of these are also unprecedented

in Indian corporate history and have

set new benchmarks. This is even more

remarkable that this was achieved

amidst a global lockdown caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic.

amid global trade war, tariff-related

uncertainties and Brexit. The COVID-19

crisis has further impacted the slowdown.

The Indian economy grew by 3.8% in

FY 2019-20, remaining one of the fastest

growing major economies in the world.

Industrial activities remained healthy in

the beginning of the year, but saw some

weakness later. Auto sales suffered

due to weak credit conditions, demand

softness, and change in regulatory norms.

However, services credit averaged at a

healthy 10% y-o-y growth even as credit

growth deteriorated.

In a volatile environment, Reliance

recorded consolidated net profit of

₹44,324 crore (US$5.9 billion) during the

year, registering a growth of

11.3% y-o-y (before exceptional items

on account of COVID-19). Our consumer

businesses further strengthened their

leadership positions and recorded robust

growth on all operating and financial

parameters during the year. Both Reliance

Retail and Reliance Jio continue to work

towards providing superior products and

services to Indian consumers. Our O2C

business delivered sustained earnings

due to its integrated portfolio, cost

competitiveness, feedstock flexibility and

product placement capabilities.

The strong financial performance also

reflected the increasing contribution

of consumer businesses in Reliance’s

earnings. Consumer businesses now

account for 35% of our consolidated

segment EBITDA.

Retail business continues to scale new

heights, achieving important milestones

during the year – achieving a turnover

of `1,62,936 crore and a store count of

11,784. We are witnessing incredible growth

and strong traction across consumption

baskets, on the back of unmatched service

and value proposition.

It is heartening to see India embrace the

new possibilities of digital life. Reliance

Jio continues to add subscribers at a rate

unprecedented in the telecom world. With

387.5 million mobile data subscribers (as

of March 31, 2020), Reliance Jio has truly

become the digital lifeline of Indians.

Along with the stake sale to BP in the

petro-retail JV, the total fund raise is in

excess of `1,75,000 crore. Our net debt

was `1,61,035 crore, as on 31st March 2020.

With these investments, RIL has now

become net debt-free.

Dear Shareowners,

During these extraordinary times of

the COVID-19 pandemic, our Company

has been contributing positively to the

social and financial well-being of all our

stakeholders, above all, to the common

people of India. Value of human life is of

utmost importance, and this fundamental

principle continues to guide our business

and philanthropic activities. We have

come together as an organisation, with the

combined strengths of Reliance Industries,

Reliance Retail, Reliance Jio, Reliance Life

Sciences, Reliance Foundation and all the

members of the Reliance family, to deploy

a sustainable and resilient response to

this global pandemic. Our multifarious

activities, and our widely publicised motto,

#CoronaHaaregaIndiaJeetega, have won

much appreciation from the people, the

media, and the authorities at the central,

state and local levels.

Even as we help the nation battle this

crisis, we remain committed to growing

our traditional and new businesses, which

are guided by our long-term vision of a

prosperous Digital India.

During FY 2019-20, Reliance executed

on the next phase of its growth journey,

forging transformative partnerships

across businesses. Recognising the

pivotal role of Reliance Jio in India’s digital

transformation, global technology giants

Microsoft and Facebook have partnered

with us. With Facebook, the strategic

focus of the partnership is India’s Micro,

Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs),

farmers, small merchants and Small and

Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the informal

sector. Additionally, the partnerships

will empower people and enterprises

seeking state-of-the-art digital services.

Marquee technology-focused investors

have also endorsed our strategic direction

with significant equity investments into

Jio Platforms Ltd.

In the Energy businesses, Reliance is

working to complete the contours of a

strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco.

The partnership gives our refineries access

to a wide portfolio of value-accretive crude

grades and enhanced feedstock security

for a higher oil-to-chemicals conversion.

In the fuel retail business, Reliance and

BP formed a new JV to grow the retail

service station network and aviation fuels

business across India.

Our Consumer businesses continue to

establish new milestones every year,

with Reliance Retail and Jio collectively

having grown by 49.3% y-o-y of the

consolidated EBITDA. We delivered a

robust performance in our Oil-to-Chemicals

(O2C) business despite the weak global

economic environment and volatility in

energy markets. Our consolidated EBITDA

crossed the ₹1,00,000 crore mark, a first

by an Indian company.

The global economy grew at 2.4% in

CY 2019, slowing from 3.0% in CY 2018:

Letter to Shareholders (contd)

approximately 450 million unique

smartphone users. Over the past two years,

JioPhone has successfully transitioned

approximately 100 million erstwhile feature

phone (2G) users to the 4G network.

However, there are still millions of 2G phone

users in India, who cannot use the Internet

and are hence excluded from enjoying the

fruits of digital life. This highlights the urgent

need for India to transition fully from the

2G era into the 4G era and beyond, and the

opportunity Jio has in this transformation.

Jio’s success in building technology

specifically for India and its ability to

proliferate across the country has attracted

global technology leaders – Facebook and

Microsoft—to forge partnerships with it.

RIL, Jio Platforms and Facebook Inc. signed

binding agreements for an investment

of `43,574 crore by Facebook into Jio

Platforms. This partnership is aimed at

accelerating India’s all-round development,

fulfilling the needs of Indian people and

the Indian economy. The joint focus will

be to digitally enable and empower India’s

60 million MSMEs, 120 million farmers, 30

million small merchants and millions of

SMEs in the informal sector, in addition to

empowering people seeking various digital

services. Last year, we announced our

partnership with Microsoft. The aim of these

partnerships is to enhance the adoption of

leading technologies such as data analytics,

Artificial Intelligence (AI), cognitive services,

Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and

edge computing among SMEs to make

them ready to compete and grow, while

helping accelerate technology-led GDP

growth in India and driving adoption of

next-gen technology solutions at scale.

REFINING AND MARKETING

Global economic uncertainty and trade

tensions impacted oil demand, which

reached its lowest level since 2011, even

while the global oil supply grew. Despite

the global downturn, RIL continued to

outperform Singapore complex margins

with a premium of US$5.7/bbl, significantly

above its 5-year average. Our Petro-retail

segment outperformed the industry with

y-o-y growth of 9.8% in retail diesel and

14.7% in retail gasoline volume.

ROBUST CASH FLOWS AND

BALANCE SHEET

During the year, Reliance generated a

record EBITDA of ₹1,02,280 crore, up 10.4%

y-o-y, and its net profit of ₹44,324 crore, up

11.3% y-o-y. (before exceptional items on

account of COVID-19).

Reliance continues to tie up new financing

as well as refinance its existing loans as part

of its ongoing liability management exercise.

Reliance was awarded Best Issuer (Corporate)

– South Asia by The Asset, Asia’s leading

financial publication for issuers and investors.

During the year, RIL issued €405 million

Schuldschein. RIL’s inaugural Schuldschein

was tied up as a combination of fixed and

floating rate notes and a combined average

tenor of over five years. RIL is the first

non-European domiciled borrower and the

first Asian corporate to enter this traditionally

German-centric debt market utilising a broad

marketing strategy. This transaction was the

largest syndicated Schuldschein issuance by a

non-European company and the largest in the

Oil & Gas sector globally.

RIL also tied up two Export Credit Agency

(ECA) supported financing — US$200

million and JPY5.30 billion Korea Trade

Insurance Corporation (KSure) supported

financing — along with

€341 million direct facility from

Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) and

US$365 million facility guaranteed by KEXIM.

Our diversified earnings streams and

conservative Balance Sheet place

Reliance at an advantageous position to face

the ongoing macro challenges. We are

fully committed on our investment plans in

our consumer businesses and new

initiatives. We are at the doorsteps of a huge

opportunity and our Rights Issue and all other

equity transactions will strengthen Reliance

and position us to create substantial value for

all our stakeholders in the years to come.

SUSTAINABILITY

We are committed to making continuous

improvements across the Triple Bottom Line

(People, Planet and Profit) and enabling

positive change in our society. Our ability to

manage, utilise and transform the six capitals

– natural capital, human capital, manufactured

capital, intellectual capital, financial capital,

and social and relationship capital – is

the key to creating value for our multiple

stakeholders. In our relentless pursuit of

excellence, noteworthy capital investments

were undertaken, which led to the

resource optimisation and enhancement of

operational efficiency. We are committed to

becoming a leader in circular economy and

are one of the largest recyclers of plastics

in India. Integral to growing revenue is the

ongoing improvement of our social and

relationship capital.

Reliance Foundation is committed to bring

about a positive change in the lives of our

stakeholders. Our business objectives

are aligned with the global Sustainable

Development Goals, which is reflected

through our work in the areas of rural

transformation, health, education, sports

for development, disaster response, arts,

culture and heritage, and urban renewal. In

these testing times of COVID-19, Reliance

Foundation is running the world’s largest

food-distribution programme to serve the

ones worst hit by the pandemic.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC RESPONSE

We have been tirelessly working on a

multi-pronged prevention, mitigation,

adaptation and ongoing support strategy

with the government and civil society to

beat this pandemic. From hospitals and

equipment to catering to everyday needs

such as hunger and safety, we have

mustered all our resources to serve our

people and our country.

As soon as the COVID-19 crisis surfaced

in our country, Reliance Foundation set up

India’s first dedicated 100-bed COVID-19

hospital in Mumbai in just two weeks,

and is expanding the capacity to 250

beds. India’s frontline warriors needed

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in

this battle against COVID-19. So, we swiftly

established a unit in Silvassa to mass

produce high-quality PPEs. We produce

1 lakh PPEs per day and are the largest

producer of high-quality PPEs in India.

To further extend our services to those in

need, we launched Mission Anna Seva to

provide meals and support marginalised

communities and frontline warriors across

the nation. So far, RF has provided over

5 crore nutritious meals through ration kits,

food coupons and cooked meals across

17 states and a Union Territory of India.

This is the single largest meal distribution

programme ever undertaken in the world by

a corporate foundation.

During the crisis, Reliance Retail is working

to provide essential supplies every day to

millions of Indians through our stores and

home deliveries across over 200 cities.

Reliance Jio continues to provide seamless

connectivity in this time of distress and

help India fight COVID-19 through the use

of technology: enabling work-from-home,

learn-from-home, and health-at-home for

Indians; enabling continuity of service for

lower-end users of JioPhone; Government

of India’s Corona Helpline and Reliance

Foundation’s COVID India tool.

To ensure the health and well-being of our

employees and their families, we have set

up several initiatives such as the nationwide

emergency response infrastructure that

is available 24x7. We have also created

JioHealthHub app for free virtual video

consultation with all of our doctors and

developed resources for mental health,

emotional well-being, yoga, wellness,

nutrition and psychological guidance.

CONCLUSION

We are in a rapidly changing world where

digital connectivity, abundance of data

and intelligent harnessing of data are

reshaping value creation models across

verticals. Despite the volatility, in the

economic environment, we continue to

improve and evolve consistently, fostering

an entrepreneurial mindset across the

organisation. Overall, we have delivered

yet another year of robust performance,

achieving remarkable success across

our businesses.

At Reliance, our purpose has been to

solve the big problems before India and

the world. We started with the purpose of

clothing millions of Indians, ensuring that

every Indian gets a decent quality of life,

and then solving the problem of energy.

As we grew, we addressed India’s bigger

problems. With no prior experience, we

entered organised retail. Despite the

odds, we had the tenacity to stay and to

be persistent. With Jio, we brought India

into the Digital Age by connecting billions

of Indians with world-class and affordable

digital services. If we trace our history,

we have always embraced the future

with boldness, and have both inspired

and empowered future generations to

succeed by becoming entrepreneurial,

setting ambitious goals, taking more

risks and innovating constantly in their

enterprises. As we usher in the next

decade, we accept the responsibility as

custodians of the future.

Our vision is to build a New Reliance for a

New India. Our mission is to GROW INDIA,

AND GROW WITH INDIA. Your tremendous

vote of confidence in the Rights Issue

has yet again convinced us that you fully

endorse this vision and mission. Reliance’s

foundational trust-based relationship with

you has consistently spurred us to achieve

more. I assure you that Reliance will achieve

more in its ongoing Golden Decade than

it did in the previous four decades. As we

begin our journey in a new financial year,

we rededicate ourselves to the task of

contributing our utmost to India’s inclusive

and accelerated growth, propelled by

the adoption of digital technologies.

This will improve the lives of 1.3 billion

Indians and make India a leading DIGITAL

NATION in the world.

I would like to thank the entire team at

Reliance for their untiring efforts and

unflinching commitment to achieve the

lofty goals we have set for our Golden

Decade. I would like to convey my

sincere appreciation to the Board of

Directors for their guidance. I would also

like to express my heartiest gratitude to

all our stakeholders for their enduring

faith in Reliance.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,

DIGITAL SERVICES FOR ALL

Government of India has undertaken the

project BharatNet which is the world’s

largest rural broadband project to provide

broadband connectivity to all 2,50,000

Gram Panchayats covering 6,25,000

villages. Jio has in its own way tried to

boost the ‘Digital India’ initiative by covering

99% of population with an all-IP 4G-LTE

network. Jio with the widest 4G coverage

is the only provider of mobile data services

to almost 250 million citizens of the

country would play a pivotal role in digital

inclusion in India.

• Enabling continuity of service for

JioPhone users – Amidst the nationwide

lockdown, to enable continuity of

services, Jio provided additional

100 voice minutes and 100 SMS to

JioPhone users who have not been able

to recharge. Jio users could receive

incoming calls even if the validity of their

• Traffic surge handled with network

elasticity – Jio’s world-class

infrastructure (industry-leading capacity

and best-in-class technology) provided

seamless and uninterrupted services

despite the significant traffic surge

during the lockdown. Advantages of a

high degree of network automation also

came to the fore as physical movement

is restricted in majority areas.

• Government of India’s Corona Helpline

and Reliance Foundation, COVID India

Tool – Jio also extended its technology

expertise to the Government of India,

powering its official WhatsApp-based

helpdesk and providing a single channel

for all official queries/communication.

In addition, the Reliance Foundation

symptom checker tool allowed all Indians

to check symptoms from home and take

precautionary action.

• Introducing innovative channels of

recharge – To enable subscribers

who do not recharge through digital

platforms, Jio facilitated recharges

through ATM machines, SMS/Call

and individual calling by geography

representatives for those who need

help in recharging. Jio also launched an

application, JioPOS Lite, to allow peer-

to-peer recharge on a commission basis.:

OUTLOOK

Initial impacts of COVID-19 on the GDP

growth in many major economies is likely

to be significant in the short term, leading

to demand destruction. With gradual

opening up of economies and increasing

manufacturing activities, demand for most

petrochemical products is expected to

recover by the second half of 2020. In

the near term, demand for polymers and

polyester products is likely to be supported

by various applications in the healthcare,

hygiene & safety and packaging segments.:

Managing Director

Sh. Mukesh Ambani said, “We have

to always remember the values of our

Founder, Sh. Dhirubhai Ambani. For him,

purpose was most important. We always

say that for all of us at Reliance, it is India

first; Reliance, second; and self, last. I am

sure that many generations of Reliance will

carry this tradition forward.” In 2019, over

3 lakh people attended the celebrations

across various locations.

almost all of its businesses in the “essential

services” sectors, Reliance recognised the

special responsibility it bore to support

the nation and fellow citizens through the

COVID-19 crisis.

The evolving situation around COVID-19

was monitored closely and the resulting

and guidance documents regularly to

encourage early adoption of safety

measures and enable business continuity.

Communications were timely, accurate,

consistent and prioritised the physical

and mental wellbeing of all employees,

contractors and family members.

The Company also developed a

comprehensive compendium “RIL Info Pack

TALENT MANAGEMENT

RIL endeavors to meet all internal talent

requirements. It focuses on developing

high potential talent pools by providing

accelerated learning and growth

opportunities. There are various initiatives

taken by the organisation to achieve this,

including on-the-job trainings, digital

learning, coaching and workshops.

Some prominent Talent Management

practices are:

1. Career Acceleration Programme

Launched in 2015, the Career

Acceleration Program (CAP) is the

flagship mid-level cadre development

program to identify calibre and provide

an accelerated career growth. The

program offers a unique opportunity

to the participants to work on cross

business assignments, high-impact

action learning projects and to interact

with senior leaders.

2. Sapphire Coaching Programme

This programme provides focused and

customised development opportunities

to managers in the manufacturing

business. Using the Growth, Self-

Awareness, Authenticity (GSA)

development model for leadership

excellence, the programme emphasises

on 2 key tenets of being a successful

leader: delivering performance and

developing people.

3. First Line Young Engineers at

Reliance

First Line Young Engineers at Reliance

(FLYER) is a structured development

program for young engineers. In

association with IIM Bangalore, the

program is designed to equip Reliance

Engineers with requisite skills and

knowledge to build their careers at

Reliance. The first batch of 40 FLYER

participants were selected through a

robust process from a pool of 360 young

graduate engineers who had applied

to the program.

4. Step-Up Programme

A highly focused programme was

introduced in 2015 to prepare high

potential employees to be skill-ready for:

Reliance recognises the ‘corporate

responsibility to respect human rights’, as

outlined in the framework of United Nations

Guiding Principles on Business and Human

Rights (UNGP).

An internal complaints committee has

been set up at all operations locations

where employees can register their

complaint against sexual harassment.

This is supported by the Anti-Sexual

Harassment Policy, which ensures a

free and fair enquiry process with clear

timelines for resolution. There is also a

mandatory learning program in place on

“Creating a Respectful Workplace” for all

employees. Reliance continues to report

its progress against the 10 principles of

UNGC in the Sustainability report. The 10

principles cover the topics of human rights,

labour, anti-corruption and environment.

During the reporting period, there were

no cases of child labour, forced labour,

involuntary labour, sexual harassment and

discriminatory employment.

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION

At various sites, Reliance has registered

employee unions and associations.

Employees are encouraged to participate

in open and constructive dialogue with

the management, without fear of reprisal,

discrimination, intimidation or harassment.

Almost 100% of the non-supervisory

permanent employees at its manufacturing

locations are covered under the collective

bargaining agreements with trade

unions, which also comply with the local

and national laws.

GOVERNANCE AND

INTEGRATION

The HR function continues to raise the

bar of excellence in people policies,

practices, systems and data. This has been

accelerated by a transformation team

specifically focused on strategically driving

key people-focused transformational

initiatives across Reliance along with

adoption of progressive HR policies.

The function is managed through a

mature Human Resources – Governance,

Integration and Assurance process in place

with periodic reviews across various teams

DIGITAL PLATFORMS

The Reliance digital transformation

strategy is reformulating the Company’s

value proposition by integrating products

and digital services that respond to

current and future customer needs.

This has led to the deployment of a

variety of mobile and cloud native

capabilities to create or enhance value

propositions for the businesses and

markets in which Reliance operates.

By the year end, Reliance has fully

operationalised and enabled:

• Several digital services platforms

have gone live to support process

automation, increase business agility

and rapidly innovate new business

and digital products.

• An IT team that has been upskilled to

build, transition, operate and support

both close source and open source

technologies of legacy monolith and

cloud native application portfolios.

• Design thinking, Agile development

and DevSecOps practices and the

use of MVP (minimum viable product)

concepts based on cross functional

teams have been rolled out to drive

continuous improvement capabilities

and deliver new platform capabilities

at scale and at speed.

• A fully cloud native microservices

based architecture that leverages the

best of open source cloud scalable

technologies to enable plug and play

product and service innovations and

drive cost efficiencies at scale.

• To leverage business insights

from sources of structured and

unstructured big data repositories,

enterprise data governance

capabilities have been enabled to

integrate several data lakes which

underpin Smart Manufacturing, IIOT

and many other ML and AI capabilities

and initiatives.

• Increased collaboration with strategic

vendors to support the transition

of legacy business critical IT

solutions to the cloud.

• Increased collaborations with

educational institutes across India

to develop the next generation of IT

team with cloud native skills.

• A cloud IT backbone and

infrastructure to support and

transition legacy IT systems to

increasingly digitised business

processes on cloud native digital

platforms but also enable the Group’s

Work from Home requirements.

• A new security architecture that

supports the IT landscape in

transitioning to a fully cloud based

reality that is able to address the

cybersecurity and data privacy

challenges that lie ahead.

Moving to digital services platform

strategy has therefore been a strategic

investment in building integrated,

difficult-to-replicate capabilities that

deliver and sustain Reliance’s long term

strategy in a digital future.:

the parameters to be considered by the

Board of Directors of the Company before

declaring or recommending dividend.

The Company has had an uninterrupted

dividend payout since listing. In future,

The Board of Directors of the Company,

while declaring or recommending dividend

shall ensure compliance with statutory

requirements under applicable laws

Board of Directors, while determining the

dividend to be declared or recommended

shall take into consideration the advice of

the executive management of the Company

and the planned and further investments for

growth apart from other parameters set out

in this Policy.

The Board of Directors of the Company

may not declare or recommend dividend

for a particular period if it is of the view that

it would be prudent to conserve capital

for the then ongoing or planned business

expansion or other factors which may be

considered by the Board.

PARAMETERS TO BE CONSIDERED

BEFORE RECOMMENDING

DIVIDEND

The Board of Directors of the Company

shall consider the following financial /

internal parameters while declaring or

recommending dividend to shareholders:

liquidity requirements

• Any other relevant factors and

material events.

The Board of Directors of the Company

shall consider the following external

parameters while declaring or

recommending dividend to shareholders:

• Macro-economic environment –

Significant changes in Macro-economic

environment materially affecting the

businesses in which the Company is

engaged in the geographies in which the

Company operates

• Regulatory changes – Introduction

of new regulatory requirements or

material changes in existing taxation

or regulatory requirements, which

significantly affect the businesses in

which the Company is engaged

• Technological changes which

necessitate significant new investments

in any of the businesses in which the

Company is engaged.

UTILISATION OF RETAINED

EARNINGS

The Company shall endeavour to utilise

the retained earnings in a manner which

shall be beneficial to the interests of the

Company and also its shareholders.

The Company may utilise the retained

earnings for making investments for future

growth and expansion plans, for the

purpose of generating higher returns for

the shareholders or for any other specific

purpose, as approved by the Board of

Directors of the Company.

PARAMETERS THAT SHALL BE

ADOPTED WITH REGARD TO

VARIOUS CLASSES OF SHARES

The Company has issued only one class

of shares viz. equity shares. Parameters

for dividend payments in respect of any

other class of shares will be as per the

respective terms of issue and in accordance

with the applicable regulations and will

be determined, if and when the Company

decides to issue other classes of shares.

CONFLICT IN POLICY

In the event of any conflict between

this Policy and the provisions contained

in the Listing Regulations, the

Regulations shall prevail.

AMENDMENTS

The Board may, from time to time, make

amendments to this Policy to the extent

required due to change in applicable laws

and Listing Regulations or as deemed
