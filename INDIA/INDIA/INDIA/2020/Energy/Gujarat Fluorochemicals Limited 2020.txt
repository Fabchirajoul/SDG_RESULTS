Environment

Our business transpires

across geographies,

exposing us to various

geopolitical, social and

economic risks. These

risks are constantly

evolving, creating multiple

uncertainties. Factors

such as policy uncertainty,

access to funds, currency

volatility, rising interest rates,

social unrest and increased

inflationary effects might

also create impediments to

potential growth.

Slow economic growth

across the world has

weighed significantly on

consumer spending and

demand. Moreover, the

outbreak of COVID-19 has

halted economic activities

owing to countrywide

lockdowns in different parts

of the world. This has led to

further decrease in consumer

spending, resulting in a

demand slowdown in various

industries.

With rising awareness about

climate change, businesses

and consumers have

become more conscious

than ever. Consumers prefer

brands that showcase an

ecological concern and

offer environment-friendly

products and solutions.

Further, an inability to abide

by prescribed rules and

regulations might result

in penalties, stoppage of

operations and loss of

reputation.

We constantly monitor

the changing market

environment in countries

where we operate, thereby

safeguarding us from

potential risks. Further, owing

to our diverse geographical

presence, cyclic slowdowns

in a particular geography

or region does not have

any major impact on our

operations.

At GFCL, we have developed

multipurpose plants and any

sudden impact on demand due

to circumstantial changes can

be mitigated by a changing

product mix. Moreover, our

diverse and innovative product

portfolio has helped us to

establish a strong foothold in the

market, thereby allowing us to

minimise the overall impact on

the business, if any.

At GFCL, our R&D team is

dedicated to make our existing

product portfolio environment-

friendly and constantly strives

to develop green technologies

for manufacturing. Our eco-

friendly product range adheres

to international compliance

standards such as REACH

2020. We are one of the very

few companies working in

this segment, providing us an

opportunity to constantly improve

our offerings in this segment.

Financial

Financial

Financial

Natural

Our ability to successfully

navigate through an

uncertain and dynamic

market environment creates

an opportunity to further

augment our growth,

enhance returns and

diversify our offerings.

Lower demand for our

products in the short-

term might impact our

revenue, profitability and

return on investments,

resulting in lower returns

for our stakeholders.

Rising environmental

concerns compel us

to be cognizant of the

impact of our operations

on the environment. It

has also given us the

opportunity to explore

and expand our portfolio

of environment-friendly

(green) chemicals.

Social and

Relationship

Social &

Relationship

Competition

and entry of

new player

Given the scale of our

operation, we face stiff

competition from domestic

as well as international

players. Further, entry of new

players in the market might

reduce our market share.

The industry in which we operate

has a high entry barrier due to high

capex intensity, restricted access

to technology, low availability

of key raw materials and long &

stringent product development

& approval cycles. Further,

our scale and capabilities for

introducing specialized grades in

each category of Fluorpolymers

and PTFE is unique in itself.

This enables us to increase our

customer base and strengthen

our relationship with existing

customers. This, along with our

ability to offer cost competitive

solutions provide further impetus to

our products and favourably place

us against our competitors.

Competitive business

landscape enables us

to think differently and

innovate better ways of

serving our esteemed

customers
