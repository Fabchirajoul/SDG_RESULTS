Dear Shareholders,

As you read this, the world, more specifically humanity,

is in the midst of the most severe humanitarian crisis

in over a century. Since it first broke out in late 2019,

COVID-19 pandemic today has drastically disrupted

our life. It has invariably become the de-facto context

in which all discussions of the present and most near-

term planning are based. However, we in the energy

industry know that every such crisis also brings an

opportunity for growth and a trigger for human

ingenuity and collaboration. Interestingly, the situation

has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies

across all facets of our operations and we, at ONGC,

see that as a ‘big positive’. We believe that soon

the world will come out of this challenging situation

stronger and wiser with sustainability and human

equity as key elements of the new growth narrative.

At this hour of crisis, your Company salutes the tireless

dedication and incredible courage of all the frontline

workers fighting this crisis – the medical community,

sanitation workers, essential service providers and

law enforcement agencies.

This highly uncertain stretch offers an opportunity for

individuals and organizations that excel at crafting

solutions. Over the years, energy has been central to

our pursuit of devising, driving and deploying those

solutions at scale. As one of the country’s leading

energy entities and its foremost energy explorer,

ONGC has been at the forefront of enabling and

delivering solutions and growth to the industry. You,:

Managing Director:

Managing Director (CMD) of ONGC, is also the Chairman

of ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) and

ONGC Group of Joint Venture companies namely ONGC Petro additions Limited, ONGC

Tripura Power Company Limited, ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Limited and Mangalore

SEZ Limited. He is also on the Board of Petronet LNG Limited as a Director.

A Petroleum Engineer from Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad,

Shri Shashi Shanker also holds MBA in Finance. He has also received advanced executive

education from prestigious institutes like IIM, Lucknow and ISB, Hyderabad.

As CMD of ONGC, he has set his priority towards expeditious development of the East Coast

discoveries, rejuvenating the mature fields of Western Offshore and Onshore and improvement

in Reservoir Management. During his tenure so far, ONGC has declared 37 discoveries with

421.88 (3P) MMTOE in-place volume accretion and 137.49 (3P) MMTOE of EUR reserves.

His leadership in acquiring the 51.11% Govt. stake in HPCL has helped ONGC find strong

foothold in downstream portfolio.

Under his stewardship, ONGC has adopted cutting-edge IT solutions that drive growth,

streamline performance and promote efficiency. His brainchild, Project DISHA ushered in a

revolution in ONGC’s working-file processing system by completely replacing the age-old

paper based system with a digital system- bringing in speed, accountability and efficiency

and saving thousands of trees in the process. Taking the digitalization drive to the next level,

he is personally steering the establishment of Integrated Shared Service Centre (ISSC), which

will cater to location agnostic services paving the path for a future-ready organisation.

Shri Shashi Shanker has drawn up Energy Strategy 2040 (ES-2040), the long term strategic

roadmap of the Company that reframes the vision in light of the changed environment. ES-

2040 envisages ONGC to continue playing the anchor role in India’s energy security till 2040

while simultaneously preparing itself for energy transition by consolidating its presence across

low carbon business like Petchem & Renewables. To realize the aspirational targets of building

a significant renewable portfolio, he played a stellar role in inking MoU with NTPC aimed

at exploring and setting up renewable power assets including offshore wind, in India and

overseas, and further exploring opportunities in the fields of sustainability, storage, e-mobility

and environmental, social and governance (ESG) compliant projects.

His vision and dynamic leadership has resulted in numerous operational process and policy

improvements for navigating though many turbulent times including the COVID-19 pandemic

during which ONGC has not only been able to sustain its operations but as a responsible

corporate it stood by the fellow countrymen through its significant supports and contributions.

letter dated May 31,

2019 has assigned the Panna-Mukta fields w.e.f.

December 22, 2019 on nomination basis to the

Company on expiry of present PSC without any

cost to ensure continuity of operation. Being a

non-monetary grant, the Company has recorded

these assets and grant at a nominal value (refer

note no. 5.2).:

letter dated December 24, 2019

has extended the timeline for submission of

FDP by 25 months.

In view of the definite plan for development of

all the clusters, the cost of exploratory wells

in the block i.e. ` 52,998.53 million has been

carried over.:

letter

dated July 4, 2011 MoP&NG has advised the

Company not to participate in the arbitration

initiated by RIL and BGEPIL under Panna Mukta

and Tapti PSCs. MoP&NG has also stated

that in case of an arbitral award, the same

will be applicable to the Company also as a

constituent of the contractor for both the PSCs.

A Final Partial Award (FPA) was pronounced by

the Tribunal in the arbitration matter between

RIL, BGEPIL and Union of India.

RIL and BGEPIL the Joint Operating partners

have challenged the FPA before the English

Commercial Court. Pending final quantification

of liabilities by the Arbitration Tribunal and

decision of English Commercial Court, the

same has been shown as Receivable from GoI

under ‘Advance Recoverable in Cash’. (Figures

in ` are restated).

15.2 In Ravva Joint Operation, the demand

towards additional profit petroleum raised by

Government of India (GoI), due to differences

in interpretation of the provisions of the

Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in respect of

computation of Post Tax Rate of Return (PTRR),

based on the decision of the Malaysian High

Court setting aside an earlier arbitral tribunal

award in favor of operator, was disputed by

the operator Vedanta Limited (erstwhile Cairn

India Limited). The Company is not a party

to the dispute but has agreed to abide by

the decision applicable to the operator. The

Company is carrying an amount of US$ 167.84

million (equivalent to ` 12,668.92 million) after

adjustments for interest and exchange rate

fluctuations which has been recovered by GoI,

this includes interest amounting to US$ 54.88

million (` 4,142.34 million). The Company

has made impairment provision towards this

recovery made by the GoI.

In subsequent legal proceedings, the Appellate

Authority of the Honorable Malaysian High

Court of Kuala Lumpur had set aside the

decision of the Malaysian High Court and the

earlier decision of arbitral tribunal in favour

of operator was restored, against which

the GoI has preferred an appeal before the

Federal Court of Malaysia. The Federal Court

of Malaysia, vide its order dated October 11,

2011, has dismissed the said appeal of the

GoI.

The Company has taken up the matter

regarding refund of the recoveries made in

view of the favorable judgment of the Federal

Court of Malaysia with Ministry of Petroleum

and Natural Gas (MoP&NG), GoI. However,

according to a communication dated January

13, 2012, MoP&NG expressed the view that the

Company’s proposal would be examined when

the issue of carry in Ravva PSC is decided in

its entirety by the Government along with other

partners.

In view of the perceived uncertainties in obtaining

the refund at this stage, the impairment made

in the books as above has been retained and

netted off against the amount recoverable

as above in the Financial Statements for the

year ending March 31, 2020. (Figures in ` are

restated).

15.3 The Ravva PSC stipulates Base Development

Cost of Ravva JV to be at US$ 188.98 million

with a cap of 5% increase. Accordingly, the

development cost stated in the PSC is US$

198.43 million. However, actual cost incurred

by JV is more than amount stipulated in the:

letter dated August 8,

2006 from the contractor / JV for an amount

of US$ 166 million as short paid on account of

cost recovery of Development cost in excess of

Base Development Cost.

In August 2008 three JV partners excluding

ONGC

had

invoked

arbitration

against

Government of India (GoI) on the issue. The

contention of claim as operator was that it

should be allowed 100% Cost recovery of the

Base Development cost. The issue was argued

at various levels including court of Appeals

and Malaysian Federal Court. The decision of

court was in favour of JV partners. After Federal

court of Malaysia decision, the case was filed

with Delhi High court for enforcement of award

in India. Delhi High Court vide order dated

February 19, 2020 allowed enforcement of the

Arbitration Award including declaratory relief.

GoI has filed an SLP in Honorable Supreme

Court of India against the said order and the

matter pending with Honorable Supreme Court

of India.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG),

GoI vide: letter dated October 10, 2018 issued

a recovery notice to Oil Marketing companies

(OMCs) for US$ 52 million plus applicable

interest towards short payment of Government

share of Profit Petroleum on account of dispute

of Cost recovery of Base Development cost

from the payments made to the Company

towards the sales proceeds of Crude Oil and

Natural Gas. During the year OMCs deducted

and deposited the sales proceeds of Crude

Oil and Natural Gas to MoPNG and the entire

amount of US$ 83 million ($ 52 million along

with interest of $31 million) (` 6264.84 million)

has been recovered. In view of the uncertainties

in obtaining the refund at this stage, provision

has been created against the said receivables

from OMC’s.

15.4 Farm Out Agreements (FOA) was signed

between

the

Company

and

Petrobras

International Braspetro B.V (PIB- BV) for the

3 Blocks KG-DWN – 98/2 (15% PI); MN-

DWN-98/3 (40% PI) & CY- DWN- 2001/1(25%

PI) in India effective from June 04, 2007.

The conditions precedents were satisfied in

the Blocks. Government of India approval

for assignment of PI to PIB-BV was granted

in the year 2008-09 in respect of Blocks

KG-DWN-98/2, CY-DWN-2001/1 and MN-

DWN-98/3. Subsequently, PIB-BV separately

notified its intention to withdraw from KG-

DWN-98/2 and MN-DWN-98/3. PIB-BV resolved

the issues with the Company and re-assigned

its Participating Interest (PI) to ONGC in KG-

DWN-98/2.

However, PIB-BV’s attempted withdrawal in

respect of MN-DWN-98/3 Block could not

materialise, due to unresolved issues with

PIB-BV in respect of Interim Period costs and

pending cash calls in the Block. As regards CY-

DWN-2001/1 Block, cash calls were also not

paid by PIB-BV.

The Company invoked Arbitration against

Petrobras Petroleo Brasileiro S.A (Petrobras)

and

PIB-BV

in

respect

of

outstanding

dues in the Blocks MN-DWN-98/3 and CY-

DWN-2001/1. London Court of International

Arbitration (LCIA) passed the First Partial Award

on 6th March, 2017, whereby it was held that

Petrobras is neither a party to the FOA nor to

the arbitration agreement contained in Article

10.2 thereof; hence the Tribunal opined that it

lacks substantive jurisdiction over Petrobras.

Accordingly, it was decided to accept the First

Partial Award and persue the arbitration against

PIB-BV only. The Company made a total claim

of US$ 60.57 million (Block MN-DWN-98/3 –

US$ 46.84 million & Block CY-DWN-2001/1 –

US$ 13.73 million). LCIA in its Final Award of

December 26, 2018 passed order in favour of

the Company for US$ 46.84 million in respect

of block MN-DWN-98/3 and US$ 4.13 million

in respect of block CY-DWN-2001/1 along with

interest till the date of payment at the Reference

Interest Rate specified in Article 1.12 of the

FOA. Consequently, provision against cash

call amounting to ` 3,207.62 million was written

back during the previous year. An amount

of US$ 54.20 million (Equivalent ` 3,722.23

million) has been remitted to the Company by

PIB-BV in April 2019.

letter

dated July 4, 2011, had directed the Company

not to participate in the arbitration initiated by

the JV Partners. MoP&NG has also stated that

in case of an arbitral award, the same will be

applicable to the Company also as a constituent

of the contractor for both the PSCs.

Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH),

vide letters dated May 25, 2017 has informed

the Company that on October 12, 2016, a Final

Partial Award (FPA) was pronounced by the

Tribunal in the said arbitrations. However, details

of proceedings of the FPA are not available

with the Company. DGH, vide their: letter dated

May 25, 2017 and June 04, 2018, marked to

the Contractors, has directed the payment of

differential Government of India share of Profit

Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be payable

by

Contractors

pursuant

to

Governments

interpretation of the FPA (40% share of the

Company amounting to US$ 1,624.05 million,

including interest upto November 30, 2016)

equivalent to ` 122,583.29 million @ ` 75.48

(closing rate as on March 31, 2020). In response

to the letters of DGH, the JV partners (with a copy

marked to all Joint Venture Partners) have stated

that demand of DGH is premature as the FPA

does not make any money award in favour of

Government of India as quantification of liabilities

are to be determined during the final proceedings

of the arbitration. Further the award has also been

challenged before the English Commercial Court

(London High Court). Based on the above facts,

the Company has also responded to the letters of

DGH stating that pending the finality of the order,

the amount due and payable by the Company

is not quantifiable. In view of the Company, any

changes approved, if any, for increase in the

Cost Recovery Limit (CRL) by the Management

Committee (MC) as per the terms of the PSCs,

the liability to DGH, would potentially reduce.

The English Court has delivered its final verdict

on May 02, 2018 following which the Arbitral

Tribunal re-considered some of its earlier findings

from the 2016 FPA and ruled in favour of BGEPIL

and RIL (Revised Award). The Government of

India, BGEPIL and RIL have challenged parts of

the Revised Award.

In January 2018 the Company along with the

JV partners has filed an application with MC

for increase in CRL in terms of the PSCs. The

application has been rejected by MC. Pursuant

to the rejection, the JV partners have filed a claim

with Arbitral Tribunal.

DGH vide letter dated January 14, 2019 has

advised to the contractors to re-cast the accounts

for Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti Fields

for the year 2017-18. Pending finalization of the

decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, the JV partners

and the Company have indicated in their letters

to DGH that the final recasting of the accounts is

premature and the issues raised by DGH may be

kept in abeyance.

Pending finality by Arbitration Tribunal on various

issues raised above, re-casting of the financial

statements and final quantification of liabilities,

no provision has been accounted in the financial

statements. The demand raised by DGH,

amounting to US$ 1,624.05 million equivalent

to ` 122,583.29 million has been considered as

contingent liability.

49.1.2 A contingent asset is a possible asset that

arises from past events and whose existence

will be confirmed only by the occurrence or

non-occurrence of one or more uncertain

future events not wholly within the control

of the entity. During the normal course of

business, several unresolved claims are

currently outstanding. The inflow of economic

letter dated May 25, 2017,

June 4, 2018 and January 14, 2019 had asked

contractor for re -casting of accounts of the

PMT JV and for remitting the respective PI

share of balance dues including interest till the

date of remittance. As the Holding Company

is not a party to the arbitration, the details of

the proceedings of arbitration and copy of the

order of London High Court are not available

with the Holding Company. The Holding

Company has responded that The English

high Court has delivered its final verdict on May

2, 2018 following which the Arbitral Tribunal

re-considered some of its earlier findings

from the 2016 FPA (Revised Award); Pending

finalization of the decision of the Arbitral

Tribunal, the Holding Company have indicated

in their letters to DGH that the final recasting

of the accounts is premature and the issues

raised by DGH may be kept in abeyance and

therefore no provision for the same has been

considered necessary and the same has been

considered as contingent liability.

Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial

Statements is not modified in respect of these

matters.

letter dated July 4, 2011

MoP&NG has advised the Company not

to participate in the arbitration initiated by

RIL and BGEPIL under Panna Mukta and

Tapti PSCs. MoP&NG has also stated that

in case of an arbitral award, the same will

be applicable to the Company also as a

constituent of the contractor for both the

PSCs. A Final Partial Award (FPA) was

pronounced by the Tribunal in the arbitration

matter between RIL, BGEPIL and Union of

India.

RIL and BGEPIL the Joint Operating

partners have challenged the FPA before

the English Commercial Court. Pending

final quantification of liabilities by the

Arbitration Tribunal and decision of English

Commercial Court, the same has been

shown as Receivable from GoI under

‘Advance Recoverable in Cash’. (Figures in

` are restated).

19.2

In Ravva Joint Operation,.In Ravva Joint

Operation, the demand towards additional

profit petroleum raised by Government

of India (GoI), due to differences in

interpretation of the provisions of the

Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in

respect of computation of Post Tax Rate

of Return (PTRR), based on the decision

of the Malaysian High Court setting aside

an earlierarbitral tribunal award in favor of

operator, was disputed by the operator

Vedanta Limited (erstwhile Cairn India

Limited). The Company is not a party to

the dispute but has agreed to abide by the

decision applicable to the operator. The

Company is carrying an amount of US$

167.84 million (equivalent to ` 12,668.92

million) after adjustments for interest

and exchange rate fluctuations which

has been recovered by GoI, this includes

interest amounting to US$ 54.88 million (`

4,142.34 million). The Company has made

impairment provision towards this recovery

made by the GoI.

In subsequent legal proceedings, the

Appellate Authority of the Honorable

Malaysian High Court of Kuala Lumpur had

set aside the decision of the Malaysian High

Court and the earlier decision of arbitral

tribunal in favour of operator was restored,

against which the GoI has preferred

an appeal before the Federal Court of

Malaysia. The Federal Court of Malaysia,

vide its order dated October 11, 2011, has

dismissed the said appeal of the GoI.

The Company has taken up the matter

regarding refund of the recoveries made in

view of the favorable judgment of the Federal

Court of Malaysia with Ministry of Petroleum

and Natural Gas (MoP&NG), GoI. However,

according to a communication dated

January 13, 2012, MoP&NG expressed the

view that the Company’s proposal would

be examined when the issue of carry in

Ravva PSC is decided in its entirety by the

Government along with other partners.

In view of the perceived uncertainties in

obtaining the refund at this stage, the

impairment made in the books as above

has been retained and netted off against

the amount recoverable as above in the:

letter dated August 8,

2006 from the contractor / JV for an amount

of US$ 166 million as short paid on account

of cost recovery of Development cost in

excess of Base Development Cost.

In August 2008 three JV partners excluding

ONGC had invoked arbitration against

Government of India (GoI) on the issue. The

contention of claim as operator was that it

should be allowed 100% Cost recovery of

the Base Development cost. The issue was

argued at various levels including court

of Appeals and Malaysian Federal Court.

The decision of court was in favour of JV

partners. After Federal court of Malaysia

decision, the case was filed with Delhi High

court for enforcement of award in India. Delhi

High Court vide order datedFebruary 19,

2020 allowed enforcement of the Arbitration

Award including declaratory relief. GoI has

filed an SLP in Honorable Supreme Court of

India against the said order and the matter

pending with Honorable Supreme Court of

India.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas

(MoPNG), GoI vide: letter dated October

10, 2018 issued a recovery notice to Oil

Marketing companies (OMCs) for US$ 52

million plus applicable interest towards

short payment of Government share of Profit

Petroleum on account of dispute of Cost

recovery of Base Development costfrom the

payments made to the Company towards

the sales proceeds of Crude Oil and Natural

Gas. During the year OMCs deducted and

deposited the sales proceeds of Crude Oil

and Natural Gas to MoPNG and the entire

amount of US$ 83 million ($ 52 million

along with interest of $31 million) (` 6264.84

million) has been recovered. In view of the

uncertainties in obtaining the refund at this

stage, provision has been created against

the said receivables from OMC’s.

19.4

Farm Out Agreements (FOA) was signed

between the Company and Petrobras

International Braspetro B.V (PIB- BV) for

the 3 Blocks KG-DWN – 98/2 (15% PI);

MN-DWN-98/3 (40% PI) & CY- DWN-

2001/1(25% PI) in India effective from June

04, 2007. The conditions precedents were

satisfied in the Blocks. Government of India

approval for assignment of PI to PIB-BV

was granted in the year 2008-09 in respect

of Blocks KG-DWN-98/2, CY-DWN-2001/1

and MN-DWN-98/3. Subsequently, PIB-BV

separately notified its intention to withdraw

from KG-DWN-98/2 and MN-DWN-98/3.

PIB-BV resolved the issues with the

Company and re-assigned its Participating

Interest (PI) to ONGC in KG-DWN-98/2.

However, PIB-BV’s attempted withdrawal in

respect of MN-DWN-98/3 Block could not

materialise, due to unresolved issues with

PIB-BV in respect of Interim Period costs

and pending cash calls in the Block. As

regards CY-DWN-2001/1 Block, cash calls

were also not paid by PIB-BV.

The Company invoked Arbitration against

Petrobras Petroleo Brasileiro S.A (Petrobras)

and PIB-BV in respect of outstanding dues

in the Blocks MN-DWN-98/3 and CY-

DWN-2001/1. London Court of International

Arbitration (LCIA) passed the First Partial

Award on 6th March, 2017, whereby it was

held that Petrobras is neither a party to

the FOA nor to the arbitration agreement

contained in Article 10.2 thereof; hence the

Tribunal opined that it lacks substantive

jurisdiction over Petrobras. Accordingly,

it was decided to accept the First Partial

Award and persue the arbitration against

PIB-BV only. The Company made a total

claim of US$ 60.57 million (Block MN-

DWN-98/3 – US$ 46.84 million & Block

CY-DWN-2001/1 – US$ 13.73 million). LCIA

In respect of subsidiary company OVL,

Major customers, of the Company are

reputed Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs)

/ International Oil Companies (IOCs) /

National Oil Companies (NOCs) which have

highest credit ratings, carrying negligible

credit risk.

In respect of subsidiary company HPCL,

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to

the company if a customer or counterparty

to a financial instrument fails to meet their

contractual obligations. The risk arises

principally from the Group’s Receivables

from

Customers

and

so

also

from

Investment Securities. The risk is managed

through credit approval, establishing credit

limits and continuous monitoring of the

creditworthiness of Customers to whom the

Group extends credit terms in the normal

course of business. The Group recognizes

a loss allowance towards Doubtful Debts by

estimating its expected losses in respect of

Trade Receivables, Investments and Other

Receivables.

The

maximum

exposure

to credit risk in case of all the financial

instruments covered below is restricted to

their respective carrying amount.

Trade receivables:

The Group’s exposure to credit risk

is influenced mainly by the individual

characteristics of each customer.

At March 31, 2020, the company’s most

significant customer accounted for `

8,433.40 million of the trade receivables:

letter

dated June 2, 2017 has terminated the PSC

and all operations in the field were called off.

Since the appointment of official liquidator,:

to all Joint Venture Partners) have stated that

demand of DGH is premature as the FPA

does not make any money award in favour

of Government of India as quantification of

liabilities are to be determined during the

final proceedings of the arbitration. Further

the award has also been challenged before

the English Commercial Court (London

High Court). Based on the above facts, the

Company has also responded to the letters

of DGH stating that pending the finality of the

order, the amount due and payable by the

Company is not quantifiable. In the view of the

Company, any changes approved, if any, for

increase in the Cost Recovery Limit (CRL) by

the Management Committee (MC) as per the

term of the PSCs the liability to DGH would

potentially reduce.

The English Court has delivered its final verdict

on May 02, 2018 following which the Arbitral

Tribunal re-considered some of its earlier

findings from the 2016 FPA and ruled in favour

of BGEPIL and RIL (Revised Award). The

Government of India, BGEPIL and RIL have

challenged parts of the Revised Award.

In January 2018 the Company along with

the JV partners has filed an application with

MC for increase in CRL in terms of the PSCs.

The application has been rejected by MC.

Pursuant to the rejection, the JV partners have

filed a claim with Arbitral Tribunal.

DGH vide letter dated January 14, 2019 has

advised to the contractors to re-cast the

accounts for Panna-Mukta and Mid and South

Tapti Fields for the year 2017-18. Pending

finalization of the decision of the Arbitral

Tribunal, the JV partners and the Company

have indicated in their letters to DGH that the

final recasting of the accounts is premature

and the issues raised by DGH may be kept in

abeyance.

Pending finality by Arbitration Tribunal on

various issues raised above, re-casting of the

financial statements and final quantification of

liabilities, no provision has been accounted in

the financial statements. The demand raised

by DGH, amounting to US$ 1,624.05 million

equivalent to ` 122,583.29 million has been

considered as contingent liability.

During the year the PSCs for Panna Mukta and

Mid & South Tapti have expired on December

21, 2019. In terms of the Panna Mukta Field

Asset Handover Agreement, the Contractors

of PMT JV are liable for this pre-existing liability.

National Green Tribunal. As the plants of HBL are in Gangetic Basin and due to National

Mission for clean Ganga, CPCB is very strict in implementation of pollution norms. The

Management had given various representation to CPCB for seeking waiver from the said

charges, however no reprieve was allowed therefore after obtaining relevant legal opinion, the

to

the

Companies

(Indian

Accounting

Standards)

Second

Amendment

Rules, 2018 (the ‘Rules’), the Group

has now opted to recognize the

non-monetary

government

grant

at nominal value. Accordingly the

Group has changed the accounting

policy of recognizing the non-

monetary government grant from fair

value to nominal value as it accord

better

presentation

with

certain

broad concepts of accounting, viz.

more accurate reflection of assets

and liabilities, better matching of

costs and revenues, more accurate

allocation of costs of physical assets

and therefore provides reliable and

more relevant information about

the effects of transactions and

conditions on the entity’s financial

position, financial performance and

cash flows.

This change in accounting policy has

resulted in reversal of carrying value

of assets received in earlier years as

non-monetary grant and recognized

at fair value with corresponding

reversal of liabilities.:
