Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is our privilege and honour

to present the Twenty-Second Annual Report along with Audited

Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditors’

Report thereon for the financial year ended 31st March, 2020.

COVID-19

During the year 2019-20, the world at large suffered with Novel

Coronavirus (COVID-19). The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)

has infected more than a million people in more than 150

countries – a scourge confronting all of humanity, impacting

lifestyles, businesses, economies and the assumption of

common well-being that all of us have largely taken for granted.

Despite adverse circumstances, the Company continued to

deliver its best in its operations and also effectively contributed

towards the society at large by undertaking various activities

under corporate social responsibility.

PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE

The financial year 2019-20 saw the Company operating its Dahej

Terminal at 17.25 million tonnes throughput as compared to

15.97 Million tonnes in the previous year 2018-19. The demand

for LNG was consistent throughout the year. During the financial

year 2019-20, the Dahej Terminal handled 263 LNG Cargoes

and supplied 885.06 Trillion BTU (TBtu) of RLNG as compared

to 241 cargoes during financial year 2018-19 wherein supplies

were 820.15 TBtu. During the financial year 2019-20, 2598 LNG

Road Tankers were also loaded and dispatched from Dahej

Terminal and 290 Trucks from Kochi Terminal. The utilization of

Kochi Terminal remained low in the absence of pipeline network

for gas evacuation. 12 Cargoes were handled at the Kochi

Terminal during the financial year 2019-20 as compared to 9

Cargoes (including loading) during the year 2018-19. During the

year 2019-20, Kochi terminal supplied 42.78 TBtus of RLNG as

compared to 24.07 TBtus financial year 2018-19.

SHIPPING ARRANGEMENTS

Three LNG ships, namely ‘Disha,’ ‘Raahi’ and ‘Aseem’ carry the

entire LNG volumes from RasGas under a long-term contract

to Dahej. Besides Japanese companies, Shipping Corporation

of India (SCI) is also an equity partner in the ship-owning

companies. All these ships are manned, managed, maintained

and operated by SCI. The ships operate on a long-term time

charter basis with Petronet as the charterer.

The fourth LNG vessel ‘Prachi’ was delivered on 30th November

2016. The duration of the charter is 19 years. Besides Japanese

Companies NYK, MOL and K-Line, Shipping Corporation of

India (SCI) is an equity partner in the ship-owning company. PLL

has taken 26% equity in this LNG ship. As is the case with the

above mentioned first three ships, the fourth ship is also being

manned, managed, maintained and operated by SCI. Supply of

LNG from Gorgon is now on delivered basis and “Prachi” has

been novated to Exxon Mobil.

PLL imports 7.5 MMTPA of LNG from Ras Laffan, Qatar on

FOB basis through its long term chartered LNG vessels Disha,

Raahi and Aseem. The duration of the charter is 25 years for

each vessel. These vessels are owned by a consortium of M/s

NYK Line, M/s K-Line, M/s MOL and M/s SCI Ltd. The technical

management, manning and operations are carried out by M/s

SCI Ltd.

Supply of LNG from Gorgon, Australia is now on DES basis and

under this agreement our fourth long term chartered LNG vessel

“Prachi” has been novated to Exxon Mobil. Prachi is owned by a

consortium of M/s NYK Line, M/s K-Line, M/s MOL and M/s SCI

Ltd including PLL with 26% equity. The technical management,

manning and operations of Prachi is also carried out by M/s SCI Ltd.

During FY 2019-20, the overall shipping operations have run

smoothly and the jetty utilization has been optimized without

any downtime. LNG vessel Aseem had a contact damage in the

month of March 2019 and was not in service for a period of about

two & half months. LNG vessel Disha was not in service for a

period of about two months due to a breakdown. Cargoes of

these vessels were transported by hiring substitute LNG vessels

from market without incurring any downtime or commercial loss

to PLL.

DAHEJ LNG TERMINAL

Dahej Terminal which now has name plate capacity 17.5 MMTPA

operated at about 17.25 MMTPA capacity utilization during the

FY 2019-20. Your Company has added Regasification Capacity

of 2.5 MMTPA at Dahej Terminal in the month of June 2019

and total Regasification Capacity of Dahej Terminal has now

been enhanced to 17.5 MMTPA. Accordingly, Dahej Terminal is

now catering higher gas demand and its share of gas supplies

has consequently increased in the energy mix of India. The

additional Regasification unit for enhancing the Regasification

Capacity has been added at an approximate cost of Rs. 415

crore without raising any external debt. Your Company is also

planning seventh and eighth LNG Tanks. Also, feasibility study

for a standby third jetty has started, which will enhance reliability

of LNG ship receiving.

KOCHI LNG TERMINAL

During the year, the Kochi Terminal of name plate capacity 5

MMTPA operated at average capacity utilization of about 17%.

BPCL-Kochi Refinery and FACT plant were the only major

consumers throughout the FY 2019-20. Off-take of RLNG from

Kochi Terminal is expected to increase in FY 2020-21 in view

of RLNG evacuation pipeline connectivity to Mangalore likely

to get completed. RLNG evacuation pipeline to Mangalore is

almost completed and expected to commission soon. ‘Taral’

LNG supplies continued with trucks to various consumers

not connected on pipeline. LNG Dispensing facility was also

commissioned and LNG filling in bus started for trial running.

During the financial year 2019-20, your Company achieved a

turnover of Rs. 35,452 Crore as against Rs. 38,395 Crore in

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities

that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far

as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions,

without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding

through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out market positions. Due

to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Company treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability

under committed credit lines.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company’s liquidity position (comprising the undrawn borrowing facilities below)

and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. This is generally carried out at local level in the operating

companies of the Company in accordance with practice and limits set by the Company. These limits vary by location to take into

account the liquidity of the market in which the entity operates. In addition, the Company’s liquidity management policy involves

projecting cash flows in major currencies and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance

sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining debt financing plans.:
