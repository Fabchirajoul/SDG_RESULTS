Letter of Co-

operation with two US companies, ExxonMobil and Chart

Energy Inc., on February 25, 2020 for delivering LNG in

ISO containers to Indian cities that are not connected to

pipeline networks. Conceived as virtual pipelines to fuel

industries, households and vehicles in cities not connected

to the gas grid, the use of ISO containers will enable easy

and economical multimodal transportation of LNG through

road, rail and waterways, and will also help in export of

LNG to neighbouring countries.

IndianOil has commissioned a 5-tonne per day bio-

methanation plant at Faridabad in September, 2019, which

shall convert municipal bio-waste to CBG. Arrangements

have been made to supply the gas from this IOT-enabled

plant free of cost to ISKCON for their midday meal kitchens

for Govt. school children.

IndianOil has put in place an improved procedure for

procurement of crude oil through the trading desk

mechanism (i-TRADE), and procured the first such cargo

in March, 2019. The new mechanism provides significant

flexibility to the process to take advantage of opportunities

in the market and to negotiate with the counter-parties to

achieve the best price for a cargo.

The first ever overseas agreement to licence IndianOil’s

INDMAX technology was concluded when the process

licensor Lummus Technology Inc, USA, signed the

agreement

with

Serbia’s

Naftna

Industrija

Srbije

(NIS). IndMax FCC technology will be used in the FCC

modernisation project of NIS’s refinery at Pancevo for

enhanced production of valuable olefins and higher-octane

naphtha. This breakthrough has opened up new vistas for

expanding the global footprint of AtmaNirbhar- ‘Make in

India’ products.:

letter dated April 27, 2018. However, the formation of the JV is not carried forward on account of subsequent

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note - 48 : OTHER DISCLOSURES

9.

The Company is consistently valuing its inventories at Cost or Net Realizable Value (NRV) whichever is lower. For this

purpose, NRV is derived based on the actual realization in the specified subsequent period as per regular practice.

Due to COVID-19 a global pandemic and changes in Oil market scenario there was a significant fall in oil prices which

lead to write down in valuation of inventories below cost for the specified period of ₹ 6,855.35 crore. However, on

account of unprecedented situation of lockdown from March 25, 2020 in the country precipitated by the outbreak of

COVID-19 pandemic and consequent significant decline in demand for petroleum products, as a one time measure, a

longer time period is considered for better estimation of NRV considering the most reliable evidence available in line

with the provisions of Ind AS 2 “Inventories”. As a result of considering a longer time period, the write down in valuation

of inventories increased to ₹ 11,304.64 crore. Considering the nature and size, the total write-down in valuation of

inventories of ₹ 11,304.64 crore is treated as Exceptional Item in the Statement of Profit and Loss account in the current

year.

10. Pursuant to the introduction of Section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 vide Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance,

2019 the company has an option to pay corporate income tax at the rate of 22% plus applicable surcharge and cess (lower

rate) as against the earlier rate of 30% plus applicable surcharge and cess, subject to certain conditions. Considering all

the provisions under said section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 the Company has decided to avail the lower rate

from FY 2019-20.

Accordingly, the Company has recognized Provision for Income tax for the year ended 31st March, 2020 and re-measured

it’s net Deferred Tax Liabilities on the basis of the rate prescribed in the said section.

The net impact on deferred tax due to this change is ₹ 4,461.78 Crores of which ₹ 58.80 Crores has been accounted in

Other Comprehensive Income. The MAT balance as on April 1, 2019 amounting to ₹ 1,921.13 Crores has not been carried

forward as per provision of Section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the same would be available for

utilization against any tax liabilities pertaining to past periods.

During the financial year the Government of India has introduced Vivad se Vishwas scheme for settlement of Income Tax

disputes vide The Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Act, 2020, which is optional and can be availed upto December 31, 2020.

The Company has referred certain issues/queries to CBDT for necessary clarifications, relating to claiming of benefit

in subsequent years for disallowances of timing nature for which tax to be paid under the said scheme. The Company

is awaiting for such clarifications and may take an appropriate decision of opting for the scheme in the Financial Year

2020-21.

11. The Company has assessed impact of impairment of its Equity Investment as at March 31, 2020 and has recognized

₹ 1,345.24 crore and ₹ 86.41 crore as impairment in the carrying value of IndOil Global BV and IOCL (USA) INC.

respectively during the year. Further, an amount of ₹ 316.66 crore recognized as impairment in earlier years in respect

of its investment in Indian Oiltanking Ltd. has been reversed as the recoverable amount of the asset has increased

significantly.

12. The outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) globally and in India has impacted businesses and economic activities in

general. The spread of COVID-19, along with nationwide lockdown starting from March 25, 2020, has caused serious

threat to human lives and resulted in reduction in global demand and disruption in supply chain, which have forced the

businesses to restrict or close the operations in short term.

During the lockdown, petroleum business continued its operations under the “Essential Services”. The company’s supply

chain of petroleum products acts as a backbone of the country, whose continued functioning is all the more critical

during times of crisis.

In response to the lockdowns, the company launched a massive program to ensure business continuity of its services

which allows employees to work remotely from the safety of their homes, while continuing to provide uninterrupted

support services to our customers. The Company has also taken all necessary steps to comply with internal controls

during the period of lockdown.

Petroleum products demand growth for the current year till February 2020 was moderate, however, the demand

decline in March 2020, made the growth subdued. Further, the COVID-19 has triggered volatility in international crude,

petroleum prices and exchange rate. Due to the reduction of benchmark prices, inventories were written down below

cost and valued at net realizable value. The financial impact on inventories, investment etc. have been given separately.

The Company has assessed internal and external information upto the date of approval of the financial statements

while reviewing the recoverability of assets & financial resources, performance of contractual liability & obligations,

ability to service the debt & liabilities. Based on such assessment, the Company expects to fully recover the carrying

amounts of the assets and comfortably discharge its debts & obligations. Hence, the management does not envisage

any material impact on its financial statements. The Company is positive on the long-term business outlook as well as

its financial position. However, it will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions as

the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve in India and globally.
