Managing Director’s overview

The principal

message that I wish

to convey to our

shareholders is that

from a competence

perspective Aban is

securely positioned

and can weather this

storm.

Overview

It would not be prudent to begin a review of

the last financial year without a reference to

the novel Coronavirus.

the largest pandemic effect in the recorded

history of the world has affected most

countries on account of its abruptness, speed

and impact. the result has been a watershed

for mankind.

the virus-induced lockdowns across the world

impacted the offtake of a number of products,

including those that are petroleum-based.

this unpredictable environment has put a

premium on de-risking and leveraging one’s

core competence.

the principal message that I wish to convey to

our shareholders is that from a competence

perspective Aban is securely positioned and

can weather this storm.

Priority

In a business which is highly capital-intensive,

the priority is to maximise capacity utilisation.

In our business, where we are dependent

on long-term contracts, the focus lies in

marketing our services to customers the

world over with the objective to keep our rigs

continuously in operation, cover fixed costs

and generate a surplus. In turn, we believe that

by the virtue of possessing modernised assets,

we promise our customers with a high uptime

and superior HSe standard that would fetch

superior returns for clients coupled with high

operational safety.

I am pleased to report an improvement

in this regard related to our performance

during the financial year under review: the

capacity utilisation of the assets at our disposal

increased from 38% in 2018-19 to 55% in 2019-

20.

this increase in rigs under deployment

indicates that there was a growth in exploration

activities the world over as the price of oil

stabilised through the course of the year.

Besides, the enhanced deployment indicates

a decline in the number of available rigs on

account of some scrapping and a relative

decline in the ability of some rig providers to

compete. On the other hand, your company

strengthened its competitiveness through

an ongoing culture of training coupled with

enhanced compliances benchmarked with

some of the most demanding standards of

global oil companies.
