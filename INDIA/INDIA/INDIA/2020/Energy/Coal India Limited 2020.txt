Managing Director who is assisted by four other Functional Directors namely Director (Technical), Director (Personnel &

Industrial Relations), Director (Finance) and Director (Marketing). As such, at present, there are five Board level posts in CIL including CMD. All

the Board functionaries are handling their responsibilities as per their job description and the tasks assigned to them. In addition, CIL Board

consists of 2 Government nominee Directors and 7 Independent Director posts, out of which, 5 posts in the process of getting filled by the Govt.

of India.The business scenario in which CIL operates is rapidly changing globally in the current times. To cater to futuristic business models, there

is a need for an additional Board level post that can drive the Company's future business, increase its revenue, identify and developnew Business

opportunities, build and expand the presence of the Company both locally as well as in the global markets. All the said tasks are strategic in nature

and it can be managed only by a separate Board level post to lead the Organization, as all other Board level postsbasically meet the existing

functional needs of the Organization. In case, the above works are combined with the existing functional setup in the Organization, requisite

focus and thrust are feared to get somewhat compromised. CIL is already in the process of investing substantial amount in diversification projects

namely Solar Power, Revival of Fertilizer Plants, acquiring coking coal assets in Australia and Canada, Coal Gasification, CBM, Rail Wagon

procurement etc. in the coming years. Some of such significant initiatives undertaken by CIL are as under:

a)

Acquisition of coking coal assets abroad - CIL has signed MoUs with two Russian entities in the areas of coking coal mining in the Russian

Far East and the Arctic Region.Further, CIL has undertaken initiatives for acquiring stakes in coking coal assets in Australia, Canada & USA.

Few potential coking/ semi coking coal assets have been identified in Australia & Canada and consultants are being engaged for the said

purpose.

b)

Revival of fertilizer projects

i.

Setting up of natural gas based ammonia-urea complex at Gorakhpur, Sindri and Barauni – HURL [JV of CIL, NTPC, IOCL, FCIL &

HFCL]

ii.

Setting up of coal based ammonia-urea complex at Talcher – TFL [JV of RCF, CIL, GAIL & FCIL]

c)

Setting up of Coal to Methanol plant at Dankuni Coal Complex (DCC) – Consultants are engaged for carrying out various pre-project

activities.

d)

Entering into solar and thermal power generation:– An MoU has been signed between CIL & NLC India Ltd. to form a Joint Venture

Company for Solar Power generation of 3,000 MW and Thermal Power projects of 2,000 MW capacity.

All these strategic initiatives have to be monitored at the highest level of the Management for overall growth of the Organization. Further, alike

other Board level functions likeTechnical, Personnel and Finance, the said function of Business Development also has to be taken care by a Board

level Director Post not only at CIL level but also at the Subsidiary level of CIL for creating more focused approach to achieve the desired objective

of the Organization. Furthermore, all the said tasks are strategic in nature and those can bemanaged well only at the Board level to lead the change

in the Organization. As such, there is a need to create one additional Board level post namely Director (Business Development) in CIL & its

Subsidiaries.

The existing below Board verticals of Director (Technical) like Coal Videsh, International Co-operation, New Initiatives are proposed to be

placed under the proposed new Director (Business Development) post. Hence,considering the business imperatives, it is necessary to have a

separate Board level postat CIL as well as at Subsidiary level to cater to the business development needs of CIL& its Subsidiaries.

These posts arenot proposed in lieu of any other existing posts at below Board level. The pay scale of Director in Schedule 'A' CPSE is `1,80,000

to 3,40,000 and that of Schedule 'B' CPSEs is `1,60,000 to 2,90,000. In case of addition of Director level post at CIL, one additional Independent

Director has to be appointed to comply with the provisions of the LODR Regulations.

the period April-June’ 20 during 12th -19th March 2020. 1.34 Mt coal has been booked by 9 successful bidders at notified price.

During 2019-20, under Para B (iv) of SHAKTI policy, CIL has received requests for coal linkage from the State of Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and

Madhya Pradesh. Regarding the availability of coal along with other details including sources and conditions of such supply, CIL had informed

the concerned State authorities.

Under Para B (v) of SHAKTI policy, CIL had received requests from MOP through MOC for earmarking 10 MT coal. Accordingly, CIL has offered

the desired quantity of 10 MTPA towards this futuristic requirement.

A model agreement for issuance of linkage under both the clauses is under finalization.

B.

Auction of coal linkages to Non-Regulated Sector (NRS):

Fresh linkages to consumers in Non-Regulated Sector are granted through auction of linkages conducted in terms of the policy formulated by the

government on 15.2.2016. The coal against the linkages secured in the linkage auctions are supplied under the FSAs to be executed for a period

of 5 years, the tenure of which can be extended further for 5 years upon mutual consent. In the case of the Steel Sector, the FSA tenure has been

increased from 5 years to 10 years, with a provision of mutual extension by another 5 years.

The Linkage auction for Tranche-IV, Others (coking), was conducted during 2019-20, where linkage of 2.17 MTY was secured by the consumers

at an average premium of 18.43% of the notified price. In the four tranches of auctions conducted between the years 2016-17 and 2019-20, total

linkage of 80.53 MTY had been granted at a weighted average premium of 20.2% over the notified price. The additional premium shall be

applicable throughout the tenure of these FSAs over the notified price applicable from time to time for the supplies.

Further, the Linkage auction for Tranche-V for Steel (Coking) & Sponge sub sectors was also conducted in 2019-20 where linkage of 5.49 MTY

was secured by the consumers at an average premium of 10.45% of the notified price. The process of auction for Cement, CPP, Others & Others

(Coking) sub sectors under Tranche V was put on hold due to certain changes in the normative calculation methodology in the scheme/system

as per direction of MoC. The process of Tranche V auction shall be resumed upon incorporating such changes in the system.

3.3

Long term demand committed through FSAs:

Considering the FSAs executed earlier with the power plants under the provisions of NCDP and the FSAs executed under various provisions of

SHAKTI, there exists long term linkage for a total quantity of about 565 MTPA with the Power Sector as on 31.3.2020.

For the year 2019-20, the total commitment for non-power sector is about 100 Mill Tes comprising of about 85 Mill Tes linkages granted under

NRS Linkage Auction and about 15 Mill Tes erstwhile non power FSAs and FSAs for State Nominated Agencies.

To cope up with any scenario of deficit in availability of coal at various coal companies, supplies under the FSAs have been pegged at various

levels of commitment.

Consumer satisfaction

z

3.4.1 Quality Management

For enhanced customer satisfaction, special emphasis has been given to Quality Management of coal from mine to dispatch point.

Now, all the consumers of CIL have the option for quality assessment of the supplies through independent third party sampling agencies.

In order to monitor coal quality, a portal ‘UTTAM’ (Unlocking Transparency by Third Party Assessment of Mined Coal) has been

launched by CIL to capture the entire cycle of sample. With the help of this portal, information of coal quality on regular basis will be

accessible to both Coal Companies and Consumers.

As many as 49 coal testing laboratories across the subsidiary companies of CIL are now NABL accredited and accreditation process is

underway in respect of another 08 labs.

z

3.4.2 Linkage Rationalization

Under the linkage rationalization initiatives undertaken to reduce the cost of transportation of coal and generation cost of power, linkages

of the State/Central Gencos to the tune of 61.11 MT have been rationalized so far. The total annual savings for the consumers due to this

Managing Director (CMD) and Chief Executive officer (CEO) from 1st Feb’2020 on the

superannuation of Shri Anil Kumar Jha Chairman cum: Managing

letter dated August 18, 2020 for the purpose of consideration

in our Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Coal India Ltd for the Financial Year 2019-20, in respect of profitability of CCL

arising out of reassessment and increase in the Mine Closure Plan (MCP) claims by Rs.251.47 crores during the financial year.

The CAG holds the view that such amount should have been treated as event pertaining to prior years in compliance to the Significant

Accounting Policy (clause no.2.24.1.2 (Note No.02) of the Consolidated Financial Statements of CCL and adjusted against Retained

Earnings rather than booking the same as income for the year. According to the CAG, this has resulted in over statement of Other Income

as well as Profit for the year by Rs.251.47 crores in case of CCL.

Such adjustment has not been given effect in the Consolidated Financial Statements of CCL as the above amount has been accounted for

as Other Income in the Financial Year 2019-20 based on outcome of MCP claims audit in the current year and hence the income is not

in the nature of prior period adjustment. Based on the available information and Independent Auditor's Report on the Consolidated

Financial Statements of CCL by the subsidiary auditor, the MCP claim of Rs.251.47 crores has been accounted for, as Other Income in the

Consolidated Financial Statements of Coal India Ltd.

Our opinion is not qualified in respect of these matters

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial

statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole,

and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below

to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Key Audit Matter:

1.

Adjustment of revenue and proper application of Ind AS 115 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” in the consolidated financial

statements in respect of accuracy of revenue recognition and adjustments for coal quality variances involving critical estimates.

The revenue recognized by the Group in any particular contract is dependent on the sale agreement / allotment in e-auction for the respective

customer. Subsequent adjustments are made to the transaction price due to grade mismatch/slippage of the transferred coal.

The variation in the contract price if not settled mutually between the parties to the contract is referred to third party testing and the group

estimates the adjustments required for revenue recognition pending settlement of such dispute.

Such adjustments in revenue are made on estimated basis following historical trend.

Refer Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.:

letter for inclusion of CAG comments in respect of CCL

consolidated Financial Statements.

crore pertaining to the FY 2012-2013” from second paragraph, and to delete the word “other” in the third paragraph,

(iii)

Our remarks on Item 3 of Part I of Directions issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India of “Annexure-A” is suitably

modified to add the words “In respect of CMPDIL, funds received/receivable for specific schemes from Central/State Agencies were

properly accounted for /utilized as per its terms and conditions” and “In case of Holding Company, as per the information and

explanations given by the management, the company has received fund of Rs 1,72,32,663 /-from Central Agencies and the same has

been properly accounted for and utilized as per its terms and conditions.” and

Appendix C of Ind As 12 as during the financial year 2019-2020 there exists for the group no uncertainty regarding any tax treatment

under applicable tax laws in determining its taxable profit, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates.

the original audit report dated June 26, 2020

of net loss after tax of Rs. 0.99 crore and total comprehensive income of Rs. (0.99) crore for the year ended as considered in the

consolidated financial results, in respect of three joint ventures, whose financial statements have not been audited by us. These financial

statement have been audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the Management upto June 26, 2020 and our

opinion on the consolidated financial results, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries

and joint ventures, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors after considering the requirements of Standard of Auditing (SA 600)

on ‘using the work of another auditor including materiality’ and the procedures performed by us as already stated above.

c)

The consolidated financial results also includes the Group’s share of net loss after tax of Rs. 0.18 crore and total comprehensive income

of Rs. 0.40 crore and for the year ended March 31, 2020 as considered in the consolidated financial results, in respect of one joint venture,

whose financial statement has not been audited by us. This financial statement is unaudited and has been furnished to us by the

Management and our opinion on the Statement, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of this joint

ventures, are based solely on such unaudited financial statements. In our opinion and according to the information and explanations given

to us by the Management, these financial statements are not material to the Group.

d)

The financial results of the foreign subsidiary Coal India Africana Limitada prepared as per General Accounting Plan for small entities in

Mozambique (PGC-PE) and audited by other auditor have been considered for consolidation. No adjustment has been made for the

differences between such financial results prepared as per General Accounting Plan for small entities in Mozambique (PGC-PE) and

Indian Generally Accepted Accounting principles (GAAP) being insignificant as per the management and relied upon by us.

In case of ECL, MCL and NCL, attention is invited to Note 36 "Tax Expenses" of the financial statements and amendment to Ind AS 12

"Income Taxes" where in Appendix C to Ind AS 12 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties to income taxes. The interpretation is to be

applied to the determination of taxable profit/ (tax loss), tax base, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there are

uncertainties over income tax treatment under Ind AS 12. On the basis of information and explanations available to us and in compliance

to the said standard, it is to state that, the adoption of Appendix C to Ind AS 12 does not have any material impact on the financial

statements of the Company.

respect of the above matters with respect to our reliance on the work done by the other auditors and their reports and unaudited financial

statements as certified by the management.:
