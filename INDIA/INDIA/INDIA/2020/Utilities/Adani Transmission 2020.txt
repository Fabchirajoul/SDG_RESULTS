Dear Stakeholders,

The Webster definition of resilience

is “the capability of a strained body

to recover its size and shape after

deformation caused especially by

compressive stress”. It’s hard to

believe that it was less than three

months ago, on 11th March 2020

that the World Health Organization

declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as

a pandemic, meaning COVID-19 has

spread worldwide. If there ever has

been a time when the need for global

resilience has been critical, it is now.

The Power to Overcome

At times like this, one looks for

inspiration. In this context, Wayne

Muller, a well-known author,

writes that for thousands of years

humankind has suffered famine,

war, plague, hunger, and countless

injustices; it has experienced

numberless births and deaths. Each

community of people has had to

find some way to speak about what

sustained them or brought them

grace—even in the midst of terrible

sorrow. We have struggled to name

this human trait, the universal force

that makes the grass improbably

push its way through concrete,

the force that turns the earth, the

energy that we seem to possess

and blesses all life, the essential

presence in our deepest nature that

can never be spoken of with perfect

accuracy but yet makes us what

we are. History is one big story of

human overcoming. It’s what we are

born to do and it is what we have to

overcome with collective wisdom of

scientists, doctors and society.

Decisive Governance

What we must realise is that there

are no absolute right or wrong

ideas. What is required during an

unprecedented, hard to model crisis

like COVID-19, is a Government that

is willing to make decisions based

on best available information at a

given point of time and constantly

adapting as new information

becomes available. For this, the

Indian government and bureaucracy

must be complimented. Countries

with greater resources than ours

have struggled and while our battle

with the virus is far from over, I have

no hesitation in stating that had

the decisions that got made been

delayed, we could have been facing

unmitigated health infrastructure

challenges that would have been far

more painful. Yes, the economy and

business has suffered immensely,

lives and jobs have been impacted,

and the migrant worker crisis

saddened the entire nation, but

the consequences of the unknown

alternates could have been far

grimmer. The direction that leaders

of our nation, the doctors, the

healthcare workers, the police, the

army, the utility service providers,

small street side vendors, and the

citizens have taken to support each

other is truly what defines India and

its resilience. Added to this is the

fact that the government is now able

to do direct benefits transfer as a

result of the integrated approach it

has proliferated to a large section

of mass population through the

Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and mobile-

linked payments , which have paid

dividends. There could not have

been a more apt time to reap the

benefits of the infrastructure that

the government has the vision

to put in place.

The Possibilities

Sitting where we are today, I can say

that history is in process of being

scripted. I will be the first to admit

that I have no way of predicting the

short or mid-term possible economic

outcomes as a result of COVID-19.

However, there cannot be any

denying of the fact that India, over

the next several decades, will be a

market continuously on the up and

one that simply cannot be ignored.

It will be one of the world’s top

consumption centres, manufacturing

and service hubs and a beacon of

stable democratic governance. If

there was a time to make a bet on

India, there may not be a better time

than now. What I can predict is that

on the other side of this crisis will

emerge massive new opportunities,

will emerge great new leaders,

will emerge terrific businesses

and a few stronger nations. Those

that succeed will be the ones that

understand that resilience is built

on the other side of the tunnel of

crisis and we are already getting

ready for this.

Intent (LOI) for Transmission Project

bid under TBCB in Maharashtra,

from Maharashtra State Electricity

Transmission Company Limited

(MSETCL) for the Project 400 kV

Kharghar Vikhroli Transmission

Private Limited. This will be the

first ever 400 kV substation

facility in the city of Mumbai and a

harbinger of our approach that will

see us continue to explore growth

opportunities by leveraging our

strong transmission network.

Group’s Sustainability Journey

Our journey towards sustainability

accelerated over the past 12 months.

We are now leading the clean energy

transformation taking place not just

in India but globally, and our Group is

building one of the largest integrated

energy portfolios. Our vision is to

become the world’s largest solar

power company by FY25, and the

largest renewable power company by

FY30. I must mention here that our

Group and TOTAL signed definitive

agreements to deepen our existing

partnership and commitment for

developing multi-energy offerings

for the Indian energy market. We are

fully committed to supporting our

nation in diversifying its energy mix

through partnerships in natural gas

and solar energy.

Growth with Goodness

We, at the Adani Parivar, are fighting

the COVID-19 battle unitedly. Our

Foundation has contributed ` 100

Crores to the Prime Minister’s

Citizen Assistance and Relief in

Emergency Situations Fund (PM

CARES Fund). I am equally grateful

to our workforce in India for

contributing `4 Crores for the battle

against COVID-19. It is because of

the solidarity demonstrated by this

workforce of over 17,000 people

that our Foundation could add

another ` 4 Crores, collectively

contributing another ` 8 Crores

towards COVID-19 relief projects in

India. As a responsible corporate, we

will continue to stand by the nation

in various capacities in this hour of

need. On that note, I must also take

this opportunity to thank our teams

for the following measures:

• Adani Foundation contributed

` 5 Crores to the Gujarat CM-

Relief Fund and ` 1 Crore to the

Maharashtra CM Relief Fund;

we have also contributed to

Kattupalli District Collector

COVID-19 Fund and the Bhadra

District Administration.

• The Foundation is also

contributing to the CM-Relief

Funds of many other states

such as Kerala, Jharkhand, and

Andhra Pradesh.

• Women cooperatives aided by

Adani Saksham produced more

than 1.2 Lakh masks to help

economically disadvantaged

sections of the population.

• Gujarat Adani Institute of Medical

Sciences (GAIMS) is the only

hospital equipped for handling

COVID-19 cases in Kutch, India’s

largest district.

In times such as this, the spirit and

compassion of our people reinstates

my belief in our core philosophy of

Growth with Goodness. Let all of us

contribute to help our nation rise

above this crisis. It may take time but

there is ample optimism to show that

it is possible.

Together, we will stay resilient and

hopeful in these testing times.

Gautam Adani

Dear Stakeholders,

FY20 was marked by profound

changes around the world, posing

challenges to life, livelihood and

businesses, especially towards

middle of the fourth quarter.

The differentiated strategy and

preparatory drills in respect of

business continuity, which we

had put in place at ATL to deliver

sustainable long-term value to

our stakeholders, enabled us

to successfully navigate this

challenging period. We continue

to demonstrate a high level of

operational performance, even

in the period of lockdowns

and cautiousness.

We remain focused on adopting

the global best practices, thereby

continuously improving our

operational efficiencies.

Our differentiated growth paradigm

leverages our balance sheet strength

and our ability to make prudent

capital allocation decisions. At ATL,

we remain committed to playing a

pivotal role in unlocking India’s

long-term energy potential and

are well positioned to continue

delivering value-accretive growth.

Robust Underlying Strength

The increasing demand for

electricity, along with the

government push towards the

development of smart grid networks,

bodes well for the electricity

industry. In addition, a significant

rise in investments toward

cross-border grid network, coupled

with the growing integration of

renewable energy with the grid

network, is stimulating the business

environment. The expansion of

the existing grid infrastructure,

along with customer inclination

towards integrating Artificial

Intelligence (AI) systems, is likely to

further propel the transmission and

distribution industry.

On the transmission side, we have

a solid pipeline of projects won

through TBCB auctions, which are

in different phases of construction.

We have engaged with regulators

and vendors to adjust our plans

and complete the projects as per

Adani Transmission Limited:

Dear Stakeholders,

We, at ATL, are committed to shaping a

common future through environmental

stewardship, social responsibility and

business performance. I am delighted

to present to you our sustainability

priorities and performance for FY20.

ATL’s commitment towards the

economic, social and environmental

aspects of its business lends credence

to its vision of achieving leadership

in the transmission sector. The way

we report our performance not only

reflects on where we stand today,

but also outlines the steps we need

to take towards a shared future of

sustainable growth.

As strategy, we have a robust capital

management programme targeted

at reducing interest costs, extending

maturities and optimising our capital

structure, resulting in the highest

growth adjusted ROCE among global

peers. During the year, the Company

has raised a total of $ 2.3 Billion from

the international debt market and

$ 452 Million by way of strategic sale

to QIA - sovereign wealth fund of the

State of Qatar.

As a part of a fund raising programme,

we concluded our maiden US Private

Placement (USPP) of $ 400 Million

30-year paper, the first of its kind

in the transmission space. We are

also the first Indian company in

over a decade to carry out such a

transaction. In light of the current

market environment, the successful

conclusion of the USPP underscores

the strength of ATL’s assets. The

underlying assets are rated BBB,

a notch higher than the sovereign

rating by Fitch, subject to the issue

rating being capped eventually at the

sovereign rating of BBB- and rated

Baa2 by Moody’s.

We also completed the first ever US

Dollar bond issuance of $ 1 Billion by

a private integrated utility (AEML)

from India in February 2020. This was

the largest single tranche issuance

by an Adani Group Company with

an over-subscription of 5.9x. Capex

plans drawn up at AEML Mumbai GTD

business, and rolling capex facility of

$ 400 Million has been tied-up. ATL

also raised $ 500 Billion amortising

over 16.5 years in the second tranche

to eliminate short-term refinance risk.

Adani Transmission Limited:

Dear Stakeholders,

The rapid changes sweeping the

society today are likely to leave

an indelible imprint on our life,

livelihood and business.

The T&D sector is undergoing

a transformation with greater

penetration of renewable energy,

the advent of smart systems and

distributed generation. Rapidly

evolving technologies and the

global interconnected supply chains

mean that organisational ability to

deal with Volatility, Uncertainty,

Complexity and Ambiguity (VUCA) is

a critical competency. Sustainability

and long-term value creation have

ever-increasing relevance.

This expectation from businesses is

not only to drive long-term growth

but to create a positive impact for all

stakeholders, including safeguarding

the environment and addressing

societal needs.

At ATL, we are committed to putting

our stakeholders at the centre of

our decision making through our

Stakeholder Relationship Matrix.

Our foray into the distribution

business has expanded our

ecosystem of stakeholders,

including millions of customers.

We are focused on fostering

lasting partnerships with vendors,

communities and technology

partners, thereby enabling us to

create value for all stakeholders in a

responsible and efficient manner.

Our materiality analysis shows that

customer satisfaction, employee

engagement, addressing climate

change and supporting our

communities are critical to our

business. As an important early

initiative, we have executed a large

formal outreach to our employees,

vendors, communities and investors

to guide our future decision making.

We have also taken various steps to

reinforce the culture of sustainability

and the stakeholder mindset. During

the year, we saw the introduction

of a number of key processes

that will be critical to long-term

value creation – enterprise risk

management, business excellence

and a safety culture.
