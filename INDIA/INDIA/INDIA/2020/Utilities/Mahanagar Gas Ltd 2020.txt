Dear Shareholders,

Mahanagar Gas Limited

014

Annual Report 2019-20:

Managing Director

I am pleased to inform that we have

ended yet another year by continuing to

grow our business profitably, backed by

proficiency and deep domain knowledge

of a dedicated team.

During FY 2019-20, we converted

with 105,317 domestic households

and supplied piped gas to a cumulative

customer base of more than 1.26 million

households. We also did set up 21 new

CNG stations and upgraded 21 more.

Besides, we connected a total of 26

industrial and commercial customers.

This period also saw our revenue

from operations grow by 6.79% in

comparison to the previous year to

reach a turnover of H 32,645 million.

Our EBITDA registered a growth of

18.90% YoY to reach H 1,052.84 crores

in FY 2019-20 as compared to H 885.45

crores in FY 2018-19. Our PAT increased

from H 546.39 crore in FY 2018-19 to

H 793.50 crore in FY 2019-20,

registering a growth of 45.23%.

In the first three quarters, the financial

year had witnessed modest growth in

gas consumption but even such gain

petered out in the last quarter as we

witnessed slowing of growth in gas

offtake which became more pronounced

as disruptive effects of COVID-19

started setting in and reaching its

culmination upon imposition of a

complete lockdown. For 9 months

ending 31st December 2019 in FY2019-

20, we registered an overall sales

volume growth of 2.6% as compared to

the previous year. Our CNG sales volume

grew by 1.8%, domestic sales volume

increased by 6.9%, while industrial and

commercial sales volume expanded by

2.6% during the same period. But this

growth got set off in the last quarter.

The overall stagnation in sales happened

due to lower consumption in some

of the segments despite addition to

our physical customer base as well as

roll out of additional PNG and CNG

infrastructure. However, on the back

of better operational and financial

performances, we managed to improve

our profitability duly aided by lowering

of corporate tax rates. Taking into

account the highest ever PAT and the

momentous occasion of being the Silver

Jubilee Year, a final dividend of 225%

has been recommended in addition

to an interim dividend of 95% for FY

2019-20.

While restoration of normalcy from

the ongoing pandemic and a general

economic upswing assume great

urgency for improving our performance,

the sectoral outlook is encouraging.

With the Government’s stated objective

to achieve high levels of economic

growth in an environmentally benign

manner, reliance on usage of Natural

Gas is slated to rise and share of

Natural Gas in India’s total energy mix

is expected to increase to 15% by

2030. Apart from its environmental

benefits, the growing preference for

Natural Gas is also stemming from

it being a safe, convenient, reliable

and affordable source of energy.

Government’s emphasis on creation of

infrastructure along the entire gas value

chain is also going to play an important

role in making Natural Gas available

across the country. All these factors are

contributing to make Natural Gas an

excellent choice of energy for a better

tomorrow.: Dear Shareholders,

We registered an overall sales

volume growth of 2.6% as

compared to the previous year. Our

CNG sales volume grew by 1.8%,

domestic sales volume increased

by 6.9%, while industrial and

commercial sales volume expanded

by 2.6% during the same period

Other Financial Assets

The Company maintains exposure in security deposits, reinstatement charges receivable, cash and cash equivalents

and term deposits with banks and corporates.

In case of security deposits and reinstatement charges, majority of which are given to Municipal authorities (which are

government controlled entities) towards pipeline laying activity, the credit risk is low. However, historically the company

has experienced a delay/ non receipt of these amounts and hence allowances have been taken into account for the

expected credit losses of these security deposits and reinstatement charges.

In case of bank /corporate fixed deposits regular quotations for interest rate are invited and based on best offered rate

the bank deposits are placed with banks/corporates having reasonably high net worth. Exposures of deposit placed are

restricted to limits per bank/corporate as per policy and limits are actively monitored by the Company. We understand

that the credit risk is very low to moderate for such deposits.:
