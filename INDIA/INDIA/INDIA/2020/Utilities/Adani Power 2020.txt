Dear Stakeholders,

Adani Power Limited:

Dear Stakeholders,

Sudden and unforeseen events

help separate the well prepared

from the complacent. Testing times

bring out the best in humankind,

and extraordinary situations

bring extraordinary people with

unconditional commitment to the

fore. The COVID-19 pandemic has been

devastating to many that suffered

directly, and it has been unkind to

many that had to bear the brunt of

the inevitable lockdown. All of us have

participated in the unprecedented

global effort to hold the pandemic at

bay, and now we are all working hard

to restore normalcy to our daily lives,

and to bring succour to those that

suffered the most.

At the same time, we have the unique

opportunity to question the basis

of every routine and ritual that has

defined our daily lives, and to find

new ways to adjust to the emerging

reality. The basic necessities of human

existence, and aspirations of all human

beings are still the same, but we are

starting to reimagine and reengineer

how we go about fulfilling them.

Your Company is a leading provider

of the essential service of power

generation, which runs a large part of

India’s economic engine. During the

COVID-19 lockdown, your Company

stood by all its commitments, as a

matter of duty to the nation, and

ensured maximum availability of its

capacity to generate power, so that

the supply of power to the consumers

continues uninterrupted. We were

able to achieve this while following all

safety guidelines, maintaining strict

social distancing, and minimising the

workforce at the offices as well as

the plants. The credit for this goes

to the hard work and dedication of

our team members, as well as to the

efforts we have put in over the years to

develop a robust and agile Operations

& Maintenance practice and industry

leading capabilities in fuel and

logistics management.

Adani Power Limited:

Letter of

Credit to power plants for payment of coal instead of the

existing requirement of cash advance for supply of coal

under Fuel Supply Agreements (FSA).

Coal demand and supply

Over the years, overall coal consumption has increased

continuously. However, FY 2019-20 witnessed a decline in

domestic coal consumption due to tepid growth in power

demand, and higher generation from renewable energy

sources, including hydropower.

Coal production in India during FY 2019-20 registered

a small growth of 1.2% at 738 MT vis-à-vis 729 MT in

FY 2018-19. In comparison, coal production had grown

by 2.4% in FY 2017-18 and 7.6% in FY 2018-19. Coal India

Ltd. (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL)

produced 666 MT of coal in FY 2019-20 as against 671 MT in

FY 2018-19. However, coal offtake from both the producers

reduced by 4.7%, down from 676 MT in FY 2018-19 to 644

MT in FY 2019-20. The offtake of coal by the power sector

from the two suppliers was lower by 5.7%, down from 547

MT in FY 2018-19 to 516 MT in FY 2019-20.

A slowdown in offtake of coal was observed in March

2020 due to the slump in demand after emergence of the

coronavirus crisis led to a higher inventory of domestic

coal. Coal stocks at thermal power plants of the country

have risen to the highest-ever inventory of 52 MT at the

end of March 2020, sufficient for 28 days. Coal inventory

at mines also increased steeply to 80 MT, equivalent to 40

days of requirement.

Coal imports have been increasing through the last

few years, with slower than expected growth in

domestic production and rising demand from power and

other sectors.

Slowdown in the demand for thermal coal from China

during 2019 has impacted international coal prices

significantly. HBA prices for March 2020 were 26% lower

y-o-y at $67.1/Tonne, while Newcastle coal prices were 43%

lower at $64/Tonne.

Letter of Credit and Inland: Letter of Credit.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

The

Company

derecognises

financial

liabilities

when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are

discharged, cancelled or have expired. An exchange

with a lender of debt instruments with substantially

different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment

of the original financial liability and the recognition

of a new financial liability. Similarly, a substantial

modification of the terms of an existing financial

liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of

the original financial liability and the recognition of

a new financial liability. The difference between the

carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised

and the consideration paid and payable is recognised

in profit or loss.

Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company

are those contracts that require a payment to be

made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs

because the specified debtor fails to make a

payment when due in accordance with the terms of

a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are

recognised initially as a liability at fair value through

profit or loss, adjusted for transaction costs that are

directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.

Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher

of the amount of loss allowance determined as per

impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the

amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.

g

Derivative financial instruments

The Company enters into a variety of derivative

financial instruments to manage its exposure to

interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including

foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate

swaps, cross currency swaps, principal only swap

and coupon only swap. Further details of derivatives

financial instruments are disclosed in note 41.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the

date the derivative contracts are entered into and are

subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end

of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is

recognised in profit or loss immediately.

Embedded derivatives

Derivatives

embedded

in

non-derivative

host

contracts that are not financial assets within the

scope of Ind AS 109 - “Financial Instruments” are

treated as separate derivatives when their risks and

characteristics are not closely related to those of

the host contracts and the host contracts are not

measured at FVTPL. These embedded derivatives

are measured at fair value with changes in fair value

recognised in profit and loss.

h

Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint

ventures

Investments

in

subsidiaries,

associates

and

joint ventures are accounted for at cost. (Also

refer note 3(v))

i

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net

realisable value. Costs include all non-refundable

duties and all charges incurred in bringing the

goods to their present location and condition. Cost

is determined on First in First out (FIFO) for coal

inventory and on weighted average basis for other

than coal inventory. Net realisable value represents

the estimated selling price for inventories less all

estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

j

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet

comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term

deposits with an original maturity of three months

or less, that are readily convertible to a known

amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of

changes in value.

For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash

and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term

deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank

overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of

the company’s cash management.

k

Business combinations

Acquisitions of business are accounted for using the

acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a

business combination is measured at fair value, which

is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair

values of the assets transferred and liabilities incurred

by the Company to the former owners of the acquiree

and the equity interest issued by the Company in

exchange of control of the acquiree. Acquisition

related costs are added to the cost of investment.

Business combination involving entities or businesses

under common control are accounted for using the

pooling of interest method. Under pooling of interest

method the assets and liabilities of the combining

entities / business are reflected at their carrying value.

Purchase consideration paid in excess / shortfall

of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities

including contingent liabilities and contingent assets,

is recognised as goodwill / capital reserve respectively,

Letter of Credit and Inland: Letter of Credit.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and

only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged,

cancelled or have expired. An exchange with a lender

of debt instruments with substantially different terms

is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original

financial liability and the recognition of a new financial

liability. Similarly, a substantial modification of the

terms of an existing financial liability is accounted

for as an extinguishment of the original financial

liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.

The difference between the carrying amount of the

financial liability derecognised and the consideration

Derivative financial instruments

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial

instruments to manage its exposure to interest

rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including

foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate

swaps and cross currency swaps, Principal only

Swap (POS), coupon only swap (COS) etc. Further

details of derivatives financial instruments are

disclosed in note 47.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the

date the derivative contracts are entered into and are

subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the

end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or

loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately, except

for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which

is recognised in OCI and later reclassified to profit

or loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss

or treated as basis adjustment if a hedged forecast

transaction subsequently results in the recognition of

a non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

Embedded derivatives

Derivatives

embedded

in

non-derivative

host

contracts that are not financial assets within the

scope of Ind AS 109 “Financial Instruments” except for

the effective portion of cash flow hedges (refer note

(h)) are treated as separate derivatives when their

risks and characteristics are not closely related to

those of the host contracts and the host contracts are

not measured at FVTPL. These embedded derivatives

are measured at fair value with changes in fair value

recognised in profit and loss.

h

Hedge Accounting

The Group designates certain hedging instruments,

which includes derivatives and non-derivatives in

respect of foreign currency risk, as cash flow hedges.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the

Group documents the relationship between the

hedging instrument and hedged item, along with

its risk management objectives and its strategy

for

undertaking

various

hedge

transactions.

Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on

an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the

hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting

changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item

attributable to the hedged risk.

Cash flow hedges

Changes in the fair value of derivatives / hedging

instruments that are designated and qualify as

cash flow hedges are deferred in the “Cash Flow

Hedge Reserve”.

The effective portion of the gain or loss on the

hedging instrument is recognised in OCI while any

ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the

statement of profit and loss. The Effective portion

of cash flow hedges is adjusted to the lower of the

cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument

and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged

item. The Group uses forward currency contracts

as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk

in forecast transactions and firm commitments.

The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency

contracts is recognised in finance costs.

The Group designates only the spot element of a

forward contract as a hedging instrument. The

forward element is recognised in OCI.

The amounts accumulated in OCI are accounted for,

depending on the nature of the underlying hedged

transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently

results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the

amount accumulated in equity is removed from the

separate component of equity and included in the

initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged

asset or liability.

For any other cash flow hedges, the amount

accumulated in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss

as reclassification adjustment in the same period or

periods during which the hedged cash flows affect

profit or loss.

i

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net

realisable value. Costs include all non-refundable

The Company through Share Purchase Agreements (“SPAs”) dated 29th June, 2019 with the owners and lenders

Adani Power Limited:

letter dated 13th March, 2020, APMuL has requested to convene

a meeting of concerned department of state government for an early resolution to enable APMuL to take further

steps towards operationalise of the mine.

APMuL expect to resolve all matters relating to Jitpur mine and will be able realise value of ` 122.16 crores spent as

at reporting date.

45 (a) The Hon’ble Supreme court (“SC”), vide its order dated 2nd July, 2019, allowed appeal dated 8th November, 2011

of APMuL, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, for termination of long term Power Purchase Agreement

(PPA) (“Bid 2”) with GUVNL, (the PPA since transferred to APMuL w.e.f. 31st March, 2017 in terms of Scheme of

Arrangement approved by National Company Law Tribunal order dated 3rd November, 2017), for supply of 1000

MW power with effect from 4th January, 2010 and allowed APMuL right to claim compensatory tariff thereof

as may be decided by CERC. SC has directed CERC to decide the said matter in the light of the provisions of

Section 62 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and CERC (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) Regulation 2009, within

three months from the date APMuL approaches CERC. Based on the SC order, APMuL has filed its petition on

2nd September, 2019 and based on Record of Proceedings also submitted additional information on 7th January,

2020 and 5th March, 2020 with CERC for determination of compensatory tariff. The proceedings in the matter

are in progress and the compensation claim is not yet finalised by CERC.

In the meantime, the Company and GUVNL both have filed petitions with CERC to settle claims and contractual

arrangement in terms of Bid 1 and Bid 2 PPAs.

Pursuant to SC order, GUVNL has discontinued scheduling power w.e.f. 10th July, 2019 under the said Bid 2 PPA

(including subsequent amendments thereof). Post discontinuation of scheduling, APMuL is selling power under

merchant sale basis. The management does not foresee any adverse financial impact on future operating cash

flows of APMuL due to termination of Bid 2 PPA considering the expected compensation on account of such

termination of the 1000 MW PPA (1234 MW as per amended PPA) and merchant sale of power.

Apart from above, APMuL has evaluated the factors based on which the future cash flow projections have

been prepared for computing the recoverable amount / value in use of its Mundra power generation plants

of 4620 MW capacity. The management’s long term assessment for recoverable amount of APMuL’s power

generation assets has also factored better operational parameters such as coal prices, borrowing cost, power

tariff, leading to better operational and financial performance of APMuL. The management believes that over

foreseeable future, APMuL would be able to establish profitable operations and meet its liabilities as and when

they fall due and hence, no provision / adjustment is considered necessary to the carrying value of its property,

plant and equipment aggregating to ` 19,403.53 crores as at 31st March, 2020.

(b) APML, UPCL, APRL. REL and REGL have determined the recoverable amounts of the Power Plants over their

useful life under Ind AS 36, Impairment of Assets on the basis of their Value in Use by estimating the future

cash inflows over the estimated useful lives of the Power Plants. Further, the cash flow projections are based

on estimates and assumptions relating to tariff, operational performance of the Plants, availability of domestic

coal under fuel supply agreement / coal linkage as per the directives of Competent Authority, life extension

plans, market prices of coal and other fuels, exchange variation, inflation, terminal value etc. which are

considered reasonable by the Management.

On a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Management of APML, UPCL, APRL. REL and REGL have

concluded that the Recoverable values of the Power Plants are higher than their carrying amounts as at 31st

March, 2020. However, if these estimates and assumptions change in future, there could be corresponding

impact on the recoverable value of the Plants.
