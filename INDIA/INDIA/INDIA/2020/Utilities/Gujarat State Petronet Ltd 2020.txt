(i) Others

a) UPL Limited (UPL) a customer of erstwhile Gujarat Gas Company Limited(now known as Gujarat Gas Limited) filed a complaint

before Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) against erstwhile GGCL alleging charging of tariff illegally under the

City Gas Network Distribution Agreement entered into between the Parties. The matter was decided against the Group by PNGRB.

The Group has preferred an appeal at Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) against the PNGRB Order. The Group has also

sought an interim stay on the PNGRB order which was granted by APTEL. The APTEL has in its order stated that it is an interim

order without considering the merits of the case. The Group has submitted bank guarantee of ₹ 4,000 Lacs in favor of UPL.

b) Erstwhile Gujarat Gas Company Limited and Erstwhile GSPC Gas Company Limited (Now collectively known as Gujarat Gas

Limited “GGL”) had signed Gas supply agreement with Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPCL) for purchase of Re-

gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG). As per the provision of said agreement, GGL has to pay interconnectivity charges to GSPCL

for the supply and purchase of RLNG at Delivery point which is charged to GSPCL by their supplier i.e. PLL Off takers (GAIL

India, BPCL, IOCL).

PGNRB had vide its orders dated 13.09.2011 of Chairman and dated 10.10.2011 of the majority members (three member panel of

Board) unanimously held that GAIL had adopted Restrictive Trade Practices by blocking off direct connectivity to GSPC and further,

directed Respondents to immediately give direct connectivity to GSPC at Dahej Terminal.

The PLL Off takers (GAIL) filed appeals against the said PNGRB orders before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). On

23rd February, 2012 APTEL had issued an interim order for shifting the Delivery Point from GAIL-GSPL Delivery Point to GSPL-

PLL Delivery Point. On 18th December, 2013 APTEL issued its judgment and required GSPCL to pay the amount of the difference

between ` 8.74/MMBTU (exclusive of Service Tax) – earlier connectivity charges and ` 19.83/MMBTU (Exclusive of Service Tax)

- HVJ/DVPL Zone-1 tariff to GAIL for the period from 20th November, 2008 to 29th February, 2012."

GSPCL has filed an appeal against the APTEL’s above referred judgment before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (GSPCL vs. GAIL

& Others, Civil Appeal No. 2473-2476 of 2014) and the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India had passed the Interim Order on 28th

February 2014. The Court has stated that the ends of justice would be met if as a matter of interim arrangement, the appellant is:

letter from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT)

asking to comply the Hon’ble Supreme Court judgment dated 24th October 2019 on definition of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR)

for the purpose of determining the license fees and asking to submit the audited AGR data pertaining to FY 2009-10 to FY 2013-14.

On 1st February, 2020, the GIPL has filed Review Petition before the Hon’ble Supreme Court for seeking review of its judgment

dt. 24th October 2019. GIPL has also made Government representation to Chairman DCC & Secretary in this regards. GIPL has

received another: letter dated 15th February, 2020 from DOT asking to pay dues of AGR Fees along with applicable interest, penalty

and interest on penalty. Then, the GIPL has paid ` 5.00 Crores towards AGR dues as an ad-hoc payment under protest.

Further, the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 18th March, 2020 directed that no exercise of self-assessment / re-assessment

to be done and dues which were placed before Supreme court have to be paid including interest and penalty as affirmed vide SC

judgment dated 24th Oct, 2019. The Hon’ble Supreme Court is yet to hear the application made by Central Government with

respect to giving reasonable time and cease interest after particular date.

Since the GIPL has not received any demand notice from the DoT as on date and the matter being sub judice, there is no crystallized

liability with regards to AGR matter. Estimated liability of ` 27.93 Crores for AGR dues that may arise under the above judgment

is disclosed under contingent liability.

(ii) In case of GSPL India Transco Limited (GITL or a Joint Venture Company), PNGRB vide its Order dated 21.06.2019 has granted

initial time extension for completion of Mallavaram-Bhopal-Bhilwara-Vijaypur natural gas pipeline (MBBVPL) project till March’

2020, subject to quarterly reviews of the project and achievement of certain parameters with the condition that if the progress will

not be achieved as per the implementation schedule till March’2020, then a joint venture company would not be given further

time extension and the process would be initiated to levy penalty and/or terminate the authorization entirely or partially. The Joint

Venture Company is not able to achieve these conditions for balance phase till 31.03.2020. In view of that, the board vide its order

dated 19.03.2020 stated that it will be initiating the proceedings under section 28 and/or Chapter IX of PNGRB Act, 2006 and

Board reserves right to take action against GITL. GITL has disclosed the same as contingent liability. GITL has made representations

to MoPNG, PNGRB, Dept of Fertilizers for financial/ non-financial support for implementation of balance section of the MBBVPL

Project and decisions on the same are awaited. GITL management is making all sincere efforts to implement the balance section

of the Project looking into the growing gas transportation business in India due to increased demand and favorable gas prices.

Additionally, PNGRB has also not taken any decision regarding penalty/ termination for balance section of MBBVPL project as on

the balance sheet date. Further, being a public sector unit, GITL is hoping positive view from PNGRB.
