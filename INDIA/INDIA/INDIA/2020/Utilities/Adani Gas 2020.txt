Dear Shareholders,

The Webster definition of resilience is “the

capability of a strained body to recover its

size and shape after deformation caused

especially by compressive stress”. It’s hard to

believe that it was less than 3 months ago,

on 11th March 2020 that the World Health

Organization declared the outbreak of

COVID-19 as a pandemic, meaning COVID-19

has spread worldwide. If there ever has been

a time when the need for global resilience

has been critical, it is now.

The Power to Overcome

At times like this one looks for inspiration.

In this context Wayne Muller, a well-known

author, writes that for thousands of years

humankind has suffered famine, war, plague,

hunger, and countless injustices; it has

experienced numberless births and deaths.

Each community of people has had to find

some way to speak about what sustained

them or brought them grace—even in the

midst of terrible sorrow. We have struggled

to name this human trait, the universal

force that makes the grass improbably push

its way through concrete, the force that

turns the earth, the energy that we seem

to possess and blesses all life, the essential

presence in our deepest nature that can

never be spoken of with perfect accuracy

but yet make us what we are. History is one

big story of human overcoming. It’s what we

are born to do.

Dear Shareholders,

AGL’s roadmap to the future is centered around building an

integrated energy organization that helps contribute towards

building a sustainable environment for all. If the country wants

to achieve its goal of reducing carbon emissions by 33%, by

2030, as committed by our Hon’ble Prime Minister in COP21 Paris

Convention, it needs to seriously direct its efforts to increase

the use of green energy. Natural gas is among the preferred

energy resources that can help us achieve the targets of the

Paris-agreement. Its affordability, safety, eco-friendly nature,

convenience and multifold usage as an alternative and reliable

energy resource to liquid fossil-fuels, makes it a dependable

resource for a better tomorrow.

AGL is a leading private company in the

city gas distribution sector, marching

ahead to build a sustainable environment,

underpinned by its competitive and

integrated business model. Several

regulatory enablers duly responded to in

widespread response to 9th and 10th rounds

of PNGRB CGD bidding have increased the

focus on the sector. These two bidding

rounds brought a larger part of the

population near natural gas network. From

a mere 3% of area coverage in 2009, the

city gas distribution network is expected

to cover 53% of the country’s area, post

execution of projects in the 9th and 10th CGD

bidding rounds.

AGL - at the forefront

We believe India stands at the cusp of an

energy transition, with consistent increase

in consumption of natural gas. AGL remains

at the forefront of this transition, positioned

to capitalize the emerging opportunities,

backed by several encouraging reforms and

regulations. The infusion by TOTAL Group

for 37.4% equity stake in AGL, marked the

largest foreign direct investment in India’s

city gas distribution sector. The capital

infusion by TOTAL Group brings on board

long-term business synergies to strengthen

our value-creation philosophy. First, the

investments would be largely directed

towards strengthening the infrastructure

Dear Shareholders,

I feel proud and privileged to present the

FY 2019-20 performance of your company.

Keeping up with the promise of a robust

double-digit growth, your company has

performed extremely well for the year gone by.

The year, recorded some key financial

milestones for your company. While our topline

grew by 9% to H 1,991 crore, our EBITDA rose

by 18% to H 639 crore, from H 541 crore in the

previous year. Our PAT also registered a high

growth ending at H 436 crore, from H 229 crore

in the previous year.

The financial highlights were a result of

sustained efforts of our entire team who

focused on delivering performance with

execution of planned strategies. Our

consistent and balanced revenue inflow from

the CNG & PNG segment have contributed

effectively to the year’s performance. In

uncertain times like Covid-19, our equated

revenue-model is unique in the industry we

operate and provides us with lot of stability.

Innovation remains at bedrock of everything

that we will do at AGL during these uncertain

times. During the year, we pushed our

boundaries of innovation in some key areas.

We initiated digitization and adoption of

technology to provide our customers a

seamless experience.

One of the important milestones in the year

was induction of TOTAL Group as a major

shareholder of our company. Let me take

this opportunity to welcome them on Board

and we are confident of building unmatched

synergies that will help in creating value

in the entire value chain of our business.

TOTAL Group’s international best practices

and policies are going to help AGL to further

upgrade its operating processes. We expect

TOTAL Group’s induction to bring in a lot of

efficiencies in our upstream operations and

drive margins with enhanced sourcing control.

Going forward, the year FY 2020-21 is going

to be challenging with uncertainty looming

for every industry and organization in the

world. However, I see the City Gas Distribution

sector at an inflection point in our country and

we plan to relentlessly work towards seizing

the emerging opportunities. I would like to

emphasize here that our resilient business

model, diversified across segments will drive

profitable growth. I am also confident that

given the management expertise and our

ability to navigate the challenges, we will

ensure we deliver value for our stakeholder

community in the coming times.

Parag Parikh

Chief Financial Officer

Our consistent and

balanced revenue

inflow from the CNG

& PNG segment have

contributed effectively to

the year’s performance.
