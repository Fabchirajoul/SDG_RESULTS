Letter of Intent

by Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission and selected as the

successful bidder to own the licence for the distribution and retail

supply of electricity in Odisha’s five circles that constitute the Central

Electricity Supply Utility of Odisha.

National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) has awarded us

a 250 MW solar project under the Central Public Sector Undertaking

(CPSU) scheme of ₹ 1,505 crore. It is our biggest single order from

a third party so far and consolidates our commitment to the “Make

in India” mission. It has also taken Tata Power Solar’s order book to

around 1,500 MW with value of approximately C 7,500 crore. This

underscores our competitive and quality offering as a leading Solar

EPC player in the country, achieving leadership position among

utility scale, rooftop solar and solar pump business.

Renascent Power Ventures Private Limited (Renascent), a 100%

subsidiary of Resurgent Power Ventures Pte. Limited (Resurgent),

completed the acquisition of 75.01% Equity ownership in Prayagraj

Power Generation Company Limited (PPGCL). This has augmented

our generation capacity by 1,980 MW. However, this is likely to be

amongst the last investments in coal-based power plants as we

turn our sights completely towards cleaner energy.

It is noteworthy that reviving the existing thermal power plants and

augmenting their efficiency marginally reduces the carbon footprint

of existing capacities.

With our extensive expertise and deep knowledge of the sector, Tata

Power aims to transform the Indian power sector, particularly in our

Distribution service. A variety of our service offerings has culminated

into 26.2 lakh satisfied customers.

We have set up a new subsidiary – TP Renewable Microgrid Limited

(TPRML), in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation, to become

the world’s largest microgrid developer and operator. The aim is to

provide access to affordable, clean and reliable power supply and

also enable rural entrepreneurs to generate economic wealth and

help eradicate energy poverty. TPRML has test charged 18 microgrids

so far, while 25 more microgrids are in an advanced stage of project

execution. Further, a pipeline of 30 projects has been created in Uttar

Pradesh and Bihar.

Our cash flow from operations, on a consolidated basis, has increased

by 61% this financial year from FY19 due to prudent working capital

management. There has been an increase in operating profit by

13% due to optimisation of operating costs across Tata Power and

its subsidiaries. This has resulted in higher realisation of cash in hand

as on 31st March 2020.

We are proud to be associated with Jaguar Land Rover India

Limited (JLR India) for end-to-end charging solutions for its range

of electrified vehicles to be launched in India. As India’s leading

integrated player in the EV charging space, we will provide JLR

India’s EV customers with easy, universal and seamless charging

experience at their homes, offices and public places. This

partnership is also an endorsement of their faith in us and our ability

to deal with the electrified range of vehicles that JLR will bring

in India.

Club Enerji, our nationwide resource and energy conservation

initiative with a strategic focus on nation-building, sensitised over

26.4 million people while saving more than 31.8 million units of

energy across seven cities – New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad,

Bengaluru, Kolkata and Ajmer since 2007.

The initiative also reached out to its digital audiences through its

website, social media handles and an online module themed “Save

water”. During the current financial year, the Company initiated

four fresh campaigns, including 'I have the Power', 'I Live Simply',

'#SwitchOff2SwitchOn' and 'I Can' to further the success of Club Enerji

among the youth of India. These campaigns were also promoted on

popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram etc., and

managed to reach a large number of young audiences. The Club

now has created 3.6 lakh Energy Champions along with 4.1 lakh

Energy Ambassadors across the country since its inception, reaching

533 schools in the process.

We believe that inculcating the value of sustainability and a broad

understanding of our dependencies on scarce resources must

start early in our children’s lives. Tata Power has been conferred the

prestigious “Edison Award” for its “Club Enerji #Switchoff2SwitchOn”

campaign under Social Innovation category and Social Energy

Solutions subcategory. Apart from India, Tata Power Club Enerji also

has followers overseas in countries such as France, Germany, the

United States, Ireland, Philippines, Bangladesh, United Arab Emirates,

South Africa and Nepal. The Club is a case study in IIM-Ahmedabad

and was showcased on the prestigious TEDx platform.

Our efforts have been recognised by the industry, with the Business

Insider ranking us at the top of India’s ‘Most Respected Companies’.

As part of our plans to maintain leadership in renewable energy, our

rooftop solar solutions are now available in 26 states and 7 Union

territories, with our solar arm — Tata Power Solar Systems Limited

— having an installed capacity of 421 MW under EPC contracts for

customers as well as operating assets under PPA. Rooftop solar is

an ideal solution for consumers who are looking for a sustainable

source of clean energy that has the in-built capacity to pay for itself

in the long run.

Furthermore, with the cost of diesel and electricity rising, solar

powered water pumps can emerge as the perfect alternative for

farmers as these have a low maintenance cost and a long product

life. When combined with new distribution solutions like microgrid,

solar rooftop and solar water pumps will play a big role in improving

the energy access across the country, in both urban and rural areas.

All these initiatives are poised to take our share of ‘clean and green’

energy from 30% in 2020 to around 50%-60% in 2025.

One of the biggest trials facing humanity today is that of fighting

climate change. Mitigating the impacts of global warming requires

reconciliation of economic growth with the decrease in GHG

emissions. This will only be possible through the transition to a

decarbonised energy model. To contribute our share in overcoming

this challenge, we are continuously exploring green technology

and its applicability for our customers. We are confident of being

#FutureReady and continue lighting up lives of our consumers!

Yours sincerely,

Praveer Sinha

As a policy, Mr. N. Chandrasekaran,

Letter

of Credit (LoC) in August 2019 to ensure payment security.

This has led to some improvements in receivables.

As per the 7th Annual Integrated Rating, a methodology

formulated by the Ministry of Power for evaluation of

performance of the State Power Distribution utilities on

a range of parameters covering operational, financial,

regulatory and reform measures, 16 out of 41 Discoms

were rated as A+ or A as against 7 Discoms in the

previous rating.

While a few state Discoms have started considering a

distribution franchisee route in certain areas to help

reduce the AT&C losses, many Discoms like Rajasthan,

Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha are evaluating

options of privatisation through the PPP model. Central

Electricity Supply Utility (CESU), Odisha has been

privatised and the process of privatisation of the remaining

Discoms of the state (WESCO, NESCO and SOUTHCO) are

at advanced stages. The distribution sector is expected

to pave the way for opportunities in the services segment

like smart meters, smart grids, LED street lighting and

advisory services projects.

The Government of India has made steadfast progress

towards universal electricity access by covering 99.93%

households through the Saubhagya scheme. The focus

is now on penetrating deeper into the isolated regions of

the country and ensuring 24x7 power supply for all. The

microgrids will play a crucial role in enabling this.

Power Trading

Around 140 billion units (BUs) of electricity were traded in

the short-term power market during FY20, as compared

to a total of 145.2 BUs traded during FY19. Out of this,

about 35% of trading took place using power exchange

platforms. The trading margins were under immense

pressure due to high competition amongst traders. The

competition grew fierce due to an increase in the number

of CERC licensed traders – from 11 in FY05 to 37 in FY19.

At ` 3.005 per unit, the average clearing price for spot

markets in FY20 decreased by 22% as compared to the

previous fiscal. The decrease in spot price is largely

attributable to lower demand, primarily because of

the downward impact of COVID-19 in March 2020 on

the economy and the manufacturing sector, and the

availability of higher merchant capacity for power sale on

exchange platforms.

Regulatory And Policy Developments

Regulatory and policy reforms in the sector are critical, given

the current challenges across the value chain. The Ministry of

Power released a revised draft of the Electricity Amendment

Bill 2020 that seeks privatisation of Discoms through

franchisees or sub-licencing, recommends formation of

Electricity Contract Enforcement Authority (ECEA) for

enforcement of contractual obligation and proposes the

National Renewable Energy Policy for promotion of RE

generation. It also proposes retail tariff determination to be

without subsidy and introduced the Direct Benefit Transfer

(DBT) scheme for any subsidy disbursal.

The following are some of the important regulatory and

policy changes introduced in FY20:

Maharashtra:

y Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC)

notified the Multi Year Tariff (MYT) Regulations, 2019,

applicable for the Control Period from FY21 to FY25,

wherein the Commission has linked the recovery

of additional Return on Equity (RoE), in addition to

the base RoE to improvement in efficiency in actual

performance of the Generating Company, Transmission

Licensee and Distribution Wires Business. Additionally,

the Regulations provide that rate of RoE, including

additional rate of RoE, shall be grossed up with the

effective tax rate of respective financial year instead

of the earlier approach of reimbursement of tax on

income computed on Profit Before Tax (PBT).

Management Discussion & Analysis

182 The Tata Power Company Limited Integrated Annual Report 2019-20:

Managing Director). The Code of Conduct for Non-Executive Directors (NEDs), and for Independent

Directors (IDs), carries explicit clauses covering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, there are explicit clauses in the

TCoC prohibiting any employee - including the: Managing Director (MD) and Executive Directors (EDs) - from accepting

any position of responsibility, with or without remuneration, with any other organisation without Company’s prior written

approval. For MD and EDs, such approval must be obtained from the Board.

Board independence

and minority

shareholders’

interests

The TCoC, which defines the governance philosophy at Tata Power, emphasizes fairness and transparency to all

stakeholders. Shareholders can communicate any grievance to the Company Secretary’s office through a well-publicized

channel, where complaints are tracked to closure. The Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of

these complaints. The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is another forum where they can interact with the Board.

Values, Ethics and

compliance

Tata Power consistently adheres to the highest principled conduct and has earned its reputation for trust and integrity in

the course of building a highly successful global business. The Company’s core values are SCALE viz. Safety, Care, Agility,

Learning and Ethics.

TCoC, which every employee signs at the time of joining the Company, serves as a moral guide and a governing framework

for responsible corporate citizenship. Periodic refresher courses are conducted to ensure continued awareness of the

code, and employee communications from the leadership reiterate the importance of our values and the TCoC.

Customers and suppliers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through inclusion of specific

clauses in proposals and contracts. The Tata Power Supplier Code of Conduct is shared with suppliers as part of the

procurement process and is published on the Tata Power website.

Changes to legislation are closely monitored, risks are evaluated and effectively managed across our operations. Avenues

have been provided for all employees and stakeholders to report concerns or non-compliance which are investigated and

addressed by following due process. At the apex level, the Audit Committee oversees compliance to internal policies and

external regulations.

Report On Corporate Governance

“The Tata philosophy of management has always been, and is today more than ever, that corporate enterprises must be

managed not merely in the interests of their owners, but equally in those of their employees, of the consumers of their products,

of the local community and finally the country as a whole.”

- Jamsetji N. Tata

Company’s Philosophy on Corporate

Governance

The essence of Corporate Governance is about maintaining

the right balance between economic, social, individual and

community goals. At Tata Power, good corporate governance

is a way of life and the way we do our business, encompassing

every day’s activities and is enshrined as a part of our way of

working. The Company is focused on enhancement of long-

term value creation for all stakeholders without compromising

on integrity, societal obligations, environment and regulatory

compliances. Our actions are governed by our values and

principles, which are reinforced at all levels of the organisation.

These principles have been and will continue to be our guiding

force in future.

For your Company, good corporate governance is a synonym

for sound management, transparency and adequate disclosure,

encompassing

good

corporate

practices,

procedures,

standards and implicit rules which propel a company to take

sound decisions. As a Company with a strong sense of values

and commitment, Tata Power believes that profitability must

go hand in hand with a sense of responsibility towards all

stakeholders. This is an integral part of Tata Power’s business

philosophy. The cardinal principles such as independence,

accountability, responsibility, transparency, trusteeship and

disclosure serve as means for implementing the philosophy of

Corporate Governance.

This philosophy is reflected and practised through the Tata

Code of Conduct (TCoC), the Tata Business Excellence Model

and the Tata Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading

and Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices. Further, these

codes allow the Board to make decisions that are independent

of the management. The Company is committed to focus its

energies and resources in creating and positively leveraging

shareholders’ wealth and, at the same time, safeguarding the

interests of all stakeholders. This is our path to sustainable and

profitable existence and growth.

The Company has adopted Governance Guidelines to help

fulfil its corporate responsibility towards its stakeholders.

The Governance Guidelines cover aspects related to composition

and role of the Board,

Trade Receivables

The Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a

provision matrix. The expected credit loss allowance is not calculated on non current trade receivable on account of dispute.

The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward looking information. The

expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the days the receivables are due and the rates as given in the

provision matrix. The provision matrix at the end of the reporting period is as follows:

letter dated

23rd April, 2007 conveyed its decision to the GNCTD upholding the Group’s view. As GNCTD has refused to accept the

DERC decision as binding on it, the subsidiary company has filed a writ petition in the Hon’ble Delhi High Court and the

matter was made regular on 24th October, 2011. No stay has been granted by the High Court in the matter for refund of

consumer security deposits and payment of interest thereon.

d) In the earlier years, the Group had received demands in respect of entry tax on imports of fuel for Trombay plant. During

the year ended 31st March, 2019, the Group had recognised provision of ₹ 345.00 crore (including interest and provision

for contingency of ₹ 78.00 crore and ₹ 45.00 crore respectvely) towards settlement of entry tax demands under the

Amnesty scheme notified by the Government of Maharastra. Further during the year, the Group has received final

settlement order under the said scheme and pursuant to the said order, the Group has reversed the excess provision

related to entry tax under the head ‘Cost of Fuel’ and corresponding recovery from customers under the head ‘Revenue

from Operations' amounting to ₹ 68.78 crore.

e) With respect to Standby litigation with Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (Adani Electricity), the Hon'ble Supreme Court

during the year ended 31st March, 2020 has upheld Appellat Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) order dated 20th December,

2006 directing the Group to pay ₹ 354.00 crore along with interest at 10% p.a. from 1st April, 2004 upto the date of

payment. In the past, in accordance with the Hon'ble Supreme Court directives the Group has deposited ₹ 227.00 crore

with the Registrar General of the Court which was withdrawn by Adani Electricity on furnishing the required undertaking

to the Court. Consequently, the Group has recognized an expense of ₹ 276.35 crore net of amount recoverable from

customers including adjustment with consumer reserves and security deposit.

f) The Group have acquired private land for setting up solar power plants. In certain cases, these acquisitions have been

challenged on grounds such as unauthorised encroachment, inadequate compensation, seller not entitled to transact

and/or consideration has not been paid to all legal/ beneficial owners. In these cases, the Group has not received any

demand for additional payment and these cases are pending at District Court/High Court Level. The Management

believes that the Group has a strong case and outflow of economic resources is not probable.:
