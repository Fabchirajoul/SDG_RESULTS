CONTENTS:

Dear Shareholders,

We are in the midst of a global public health crisis which is threatening the entire humanity. The spread of COVID-19 virus has

presented extraordinary challenges to the global economy and human livelihood. Our Government has taken steps for containing

the spread of COVID-19. Everyone has been rightfully applauding the front line Corona warriors including medical professionals

and essential service providers. Your Company is also provider of essential services.

Electricity is an essential part of our lives. Its importance has further increased during this period as it is critical in providing

emergency services and facilitating lifesaving equipment. Electricity supply along with internet services has been the key to keep

the businesses, hospitals, schools and offices running as a majority of people have started working from home. This has clearly

brought additional responsibility on your Company and the work being done at the power stations to keep up the generation is

noteworthy and needs to be acknowledged and applauded.

At the same time, your Company has taken all the measures to keep the generators on bar to meet the grid demand while complying

with the required protocols as specified by the Government of India, State Government and local administration where we have

operations and the situation is being reviewed on a daily basis. Further, your Company has maintained constant communication

and dialogue with all the stakeholders. Your Company has also taken proactive measures to prioritize the health of its employees

and their families.

As a responsible organization, your Company has extended support to Government agencies in every possible manner. This has

been done by supplying essential food items for the needy as well as providing medical equipment and hospital facilities to the

local authorities.

Before presenting the performance highlights, I would like to say thanks to each one of you for your continued support and

investment in NTPC. This is also wishing that all of you stay safe and healthy.

Physical Performance:

Your Company had shown outstanding performance in FY’20 as well and achieved several milestones in operations, new capacity

addition and on the renewable energy front.

Your Company has set a new benchmark by adding 5,290 MW of commercial capacity, which is the highest ever achieved in any

year since inception. Another important event has been the acquisition of Government of India’s stake in NEEPCO and THDC which

has added substantial hydro capacity to your Company’s portfolio. Even during the COVID period, 984 MW of commercial capacity

has been added, which demonstrates NTPC’s inherent resilience. With all these, your Company has become a 63 GW Company.

On the generation front, the Company’s group generation stood at over 290 BUs in FY 20. There is slight decrease in the total

generation when compared to previous year due to reduction in demand and extended monsoon season. However, we could

significantly reduce the under recovery of capacity charges when compared to previous years and improved machine availability.

In FY20, your Company’s PLF has consistently maintained a positive difference of over 12% as compared to the National PLF.

Company’s coal stations achieved a PLF of 68.20% during the year 2019-20 as against National PLF of 55.89% and four stations of

NTPC figured in top ten stations list of the country in terms of PLF.

Your Company has recorded the highest ever single day generation of 977.07 MUs on July 28, 2020. Additionally, your Company’s

1st and the oldest Unit, Singrauli Unit#1 which was put to commercial operation in 1982 has registered a PLF of 101.96% in Q1 FY21,

which is the highest in the country. The feat achieved by the 38 years old Unit strongly reflects the Operation and Maintenance

practices being adopted by your Company and the competency of people operating the Units.

Financial Performance:

In FY’20, your Company recorded a profit of ` 10,112.81 Crore. The profit before tax is ` 14,465.92 Crore as against ` 12672.52

Crore in the previous year, registering an increase of 14.15%. The total income has crossed ` 1,00,000 Crore for the first time and

the Company declared dividend of ` 3,117 Crore to shareholders. This is the 27th consecutive year that the Company has paid

dividend.

In FY’20, your Company incurred capital expenditure of ` 36,618 Crores (including ` 11,500 Crores for acquisition of GoI stake in

THDC and NEEPCO).: Letter to Shareholders

Letter of Credit as Payment Security Mechanism: Under

this mechanism, w.e.f. 1 August 2019, Power will be

scheduled for dispatch only after: Letter of Credit (LC)

for the desired quantum of power with respect to the

generating stations has been opened. It shall be ensured

of non-opening of LC or advance payment, has no access

to procure power from the Power Exchange(s) and they

shall not be granted Short Term Open Access (STOA). The

measure is expected to improve payments to the power

generators and improve sustainability in the Power Sector.

5.

Renewable Energy Management Centre (REMC): REMCs

have been commissioned to help in Grid integration

of Renewable Energy by taking care of intermittency

of RE generation and, facilitating real time forecasting,

scheduling and real time tracking of Renewable Energy

Generation. Till May 2020, 11 such centres have been set

up in various states.

plants including private generators which do not have

PPAs, allowing Coal Linkage for a period of minimum 3

months and upto a maximum of 1 year, provided further

that the power generated through that linkage is sold in

in short term by a transparent bidding process through

Discovery of Efficient Energy Price (DEEP) portal.

8.

Real Time Market (RTM): Government has introduced

Real Time Market in electricity from June 2020. This real

time market is likely to provide an alternate mechanism

for DISCOMs to access a larger market. It may also be

beneficial for generators for selling their un-requisitioned

surplus power.

letter dated 29 April 2013 has informed ONGC that the block is

cleared conditionally wherein block area is segregated between No Go zone, High-risk zone and Permitted zone. As the

permitted area is only 38% of the total block area the consortium has submitted proposal to DGH for downward revision

of MWP of initial exploration period. DGH has agreed for drilling of one well and have instructed to carry out airborne

Full Tensor Gravity Gradiometer (FTG) survey in conditionally & partial cleared area in lieu of MoD proportionate reduced

317 Sq. Km. 3D survey, 589 LKM of 2D survey and drilling of 2 wells.

cost of unfinished minimum work programme from the consortium with NTPC’s share being USD 7.516 million. During the

year, provision in this respect has been updated to ` 101.04 crore from ` 85.14 crore along-with interest. The Company

has sought waiver of the claim citing force majeure conditions at site leading to discontinuation of exploratory activities.

The Company has accounted for expenditure of ` 16.03 crore (31 March 2019: ` 12.10 crore) towards updation of

liabilities relating to MWP and other liabilities of M/s Geopetrol International, the operator to complete the winding up

activities of the Block. The Company’s share in the assets and liabilities are as under:

Provision of ` 8.26 crore as at 31 March 2020 (31 March 2019: ` 8.26 crore) has been made towards the assets under

exploration and estimated obsolescence in the inventory.

For the year ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, there are no income and operating/investing cash flow from

exploration activities. The value of assets reported above is based on statement received from the operator in the earlier years.
