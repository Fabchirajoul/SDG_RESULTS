Non-current Assets held for sale and Discontinued Operation

Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction

rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying

amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits,

financial assets and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.

1. Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is

recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative

impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset

(or disposal group) is recognised at the date of de-recognition.

= Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or

indirectly observable.

Stores, spares and consumables are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on moving weighted

average basis.

(m) Inventories

4. Financial instruments (including those carried at amortised cost).

monitors the operating results of the business as a single segment, hence no separate segment needs to be disclosed.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and deposits with banks and corporations. The Company considers all highly liquid

investments with original maturities of three months or less and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be

cash equivalents.

(x)

Dividends

(ab) Prior Period Adjustments and Pre-Paid Expenses.

Contingent assets are not recognised in financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never

be realised. However, Contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits

will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held

at call with financial institutions and other short term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less

that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Contingent liabilities are not provided for and if material, are disclosed by way of notes to financial statements.

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the

occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.

(u)

Segment Reporting

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a

non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or

expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of

the Company are segregated.

The Company recognises a liability for dividends to equity holders of the Company when the dividend is authorised and the

dividend is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a dividend is authorised when it is

approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.

= In case of loss of asset /goods by transferring, either the carrying cost of the relevant asset / goods or insurance value

(subject to deductibles), whichever is lower under the head “Claims Recoverable-Insurance”.

= In case insurance claim is, less than carrying cost the difference is charged to Profit and Loss statement. As and when claims

are finally received from insurer, the difference, if any, between Claims Recoverable-Insurance and claims received is

adjusted to Profit and Loss statement.

Certain occasions, the size, type or incidence of an item of income or expense, pertaining to the ordinary activities of the

Company is such that its disclosure improves the understanding of the performance of the Company, such income or expense

is classified as an exceptional item and accordingly, disclosed in the notes accompanying to the financial statements.

External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as unquoted financial assets. Involvement of external

valuers is decided upon annually by the Valuation Committee after discussion with and approval by the management. Selection

criteria include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. Valuers are

normally rotated every three years. The management decides, after discussions with the Company's external valuers, which

valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether

transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is

Note 54 IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC

The Company is in a single line of business of Sale of Natural Gas.

Subsequent to the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) followed by countrywide lock down, the Company continued its

uninterrupted supply of Natural Gas to its customers based on their requirement. However, the lockdown had an impact in

the immediate natural gas demand, mainly from Industrial and CNG customers. As restrictions are being lifted gradually in

many of Company’s operating areas, demand has started showing up an increasing trend both in industrial and CNG

category.

The Company has considered the possible effects of the pandemic on the carrying amount of current assets and assessed

the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, investments, inventories, receivables and other current assets.

Based on internal and external sources of information and economic forecasts, the Company expects the carrying amount

of these assets will be recovered and sufficient liquidity would be available as and when required to fund the business

operations. The company also invoked the provision of Force Majeure under the gas purchase agreement with its suppliers

to secure itself from any liability.

The Company currently has a comfortable liquidity position and continues to assess its cash flow and liquidity position, in

both normal and stressed situation. The Company has not availed moratorium from term loan lenders and continues to

service its debt obligations. The Company’s financial management is further supported by its strong external credit ratings.

The Company has adequate financial reporting and control system and has been operating throughout while adhering to

internal financial controls. The Management does not see any risks to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern

and meet its liabilities as and when they become due based on the current indicators.

A definitive assessment of the impact, at this stage, is not possible in view of the highly uncertain economic environment

and the situation is still evolving. The Company is continuously monitoring material changes in such information and

economic forecast

None of the customer account for more than 10% of the total revenue of the Company.
