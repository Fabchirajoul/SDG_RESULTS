INDUSTRY

STRUCTURE

AND

DEVELOPMENTS

India is one of the fastest developing economies

in the world. The existence and development of

adequate infrastructure is essential for sustained

growth of the Indian economy. Power is one of

the most critical infrastructural component for the

economic growth and welfare of nation. India’s power

sector is one of the most diversified in the world.

Power sector comprises generation, transmission and

distribution utilities. Sources of power generation

range from conventional sources such as coal, lignite,

natural gas, oil, hydro and nuclear power to viable

non-conventional sources such as wind, solar and

agricultural and domestic waste.

Electricity demand in the country has increased rapidly

over the years and is expected to rise further in future.

The Government of India’s focus on attaining ‘Power for

all’ has accelerated the capacity addition programme

in the country to meet the increasing demand for

electricity by adding to installed generation capacity.

Indian power sector is undergoing a significant

change that has redefined the outlook of the industry.

The total installed capacity of all the power stations in

India as on March 31, 2020 was 3,70,106 MW with the

contribution of 2,30,600 MW, 45,699 MW (including

4,785 MW Pumped Storage Scheme), 87,027 MW and

6,780 MW from Thermal, Hydro, Renewable Energy

Sources and Nuclear power respectively1. The total

electricity generation from conventional sources in

the country during the financial year 2019-20 was

1,252.61 billion units as compared to 1,249.33 billion

units during the previous financial year, registering a

growth of 0.26%2.

HYDROPOWER POTENTIAL IN INDIA

Water is one of the nature’s invaluable renewable

gifts, which can be harnessed for least cost power

generation. Our country has an enormous hydro

power potential and ranks amongst the topmost

nations in the world for possessing feasible hydro-

power capacity, of which most of the capacity is yet

to be tapped. The re-assessment study of the hydro-

electric potential of the country was done by the

Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in 1987. According

to it, the hydropower potential in terms of installed

capacity is estimated at 1,48,701 MW, comprising

1,45,320 MW potential capacity from hydro-electric

Risk management framework

The Company’s activities make it susceptible to various risks. The Company has taken adequate measures to address

such concerns by developing adequate systems and practices. Company has a well-defined risk management policy to

provide overall framework for the risk management in the Company. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility

for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk management framework.

The Company is exposed to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

i)

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer

contract, leading to a financial loss. The company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade

receivables/leased assets) and from its financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions.

ii)

Liquidity risk.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations

without incurring unacceptable losses.

iii)

Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes

in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk: currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other price

risks, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and

borrowings, deposits and investments. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a

financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the

fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The company operates in a regulated environment. Tariff of the company is fixed by the Central Electricity

Regulatory Commission (CERC) through Annual Fixed Charges (AFC) comprising the following five components:

1. Return on Equity (RoE), 2. Depreciation, 3. Interest on Loans, 4. Operation & Maintenance Expenses and 5. Interest on

Working Capital Loans. In addition to the above Foreign Currency Exchange variations and Taxes are also recoverable

from Beneficiaries in terms of the Tariff Regulations. Hence variation in interest rate, currency exchange rate variations

and other price risk variations are recoverable from tariff and do not impact the profitability of the company.

(B) Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing

activities, including deposits with banks and other financial instruments.

Trade Receivables, unbilled revenue & lease receivables :-

The Company extends credit to customers in normal course of business. The Company monitors the payment track

record of the customers. Outstanding receivables are regularly monitored. The Company evaluates the concentration:

letter dated 2nd August 2019 has raised demand on Teesta-V Power

Station for ` 35.80 Crore towards acquisition of land and compensation for appurtenant houses and other

structures on the said Land which were purportedly damaged by Dam water during FY 2014. The claim

has been refuted by the management on the grounds that the land is not required by the Power station

and also damages were not on account of construction activities which were completed back in FY 2008.

The damage has apparently happened due to existence of old slide zones in the area. The notification

for acquisition of land under the RFCTLARR Act, 2013 published in the Sikkim Government Gazette on

06.03.2018 is unilateral and without the consent of the Power Station and as such is legally not tenable. The

matter is currently under discussion with the State Government and pending further review and discussion/

agreement on the matter and considering that the demand pertains to the Land which has not been

requisitioned by the Company for Power Station and as such no cash outflow is expected in this respect.

2.

Contingent Assets: Contingent assets in respect of the Company are on account of the following:

a)

Counter Claims lodged by the company on other entities:

The company has lodged counter claims aggregating to ` 915.84 Crore (Previous year ` 875.05 Crore)

against claims of other entities. These claims have been lodged on the basis of contractual provisions

and are being contested at arbitration tribunal/ other forums/ under examination with the counterparty.

It includes counter claims of ` 28.16 Crore (Previous year ` 28.16 Crore) towards arbitration awards

including updated interest thereon.

Based on Management assessment, a favourable outcome is probable in respect of the claims aggregating

` 803.37 Crore (Previous year ` 780.09 Crore) and for rest of the claims, the possibility of any inflow is

remote.Accordingly, these claims have not been recognised.

b)

Late Payment Surcharge:

CERC (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) Regulations 2014-19/2019-24 provide for levy of Late Payment

Surcharge by generating company in case of delay in payment by beneficiaries beyond specified days

from the date of presentation of bill. In view of significant uncertainties in the ultimate collection from the

beneficiaries, an amount of ` 239.48 Crore (previous year ` 109.35 Crore) as estimated by the management

has not been recognised.

c)

Revenue to the extent not recognised in respect of power stations:

Tariff orders for 2019-24 are pending in respect of all Power stations and Tariff order for 2014-19 is pending

in respect of TLDP-IV Power Station. Management has assessed that additional revenue of ` 545.31

Crore (Previous year ` 1246.79 Crore) is likely to accrue on account of tariff revision which has not been

recognised due to significant uncertainty for the approval thereof.

d)

Business Interruption Losses

Insurance Claims due to Business Interruption Losses in respect of Power Stations are recognised when no

significant uncertainty of ultimate collection exists. Management has assessed the claim of ` 210.05 Crore

(Previous Year ` 202.26 Crore) in this respect which has not been recognised. Power Station-wise details

of claims are given at Note 34(23) of the standalone Financial Statements.

e)

Other Cases

Claims on account of other miscellaneous matters estimated by Management to be ` 374.59 Crore

(Previous year ` 157.18 Crore) has not been recognised.

letter dated 15th May 2020 and corrigendum dated 16th May 2020 has

conveyed the decision of the Government of India to provide rebate of 20-25% on fixed cost billed

to beneficiary DISCOMs. Accordingly, the proposal of rebate estimated to be of ` 185 Crore is under

consideration to be provided amongst beneficiary DISCOMs during FY 2020-21.

In respect of projects under construction / under survey & investigation, the management does not

foresee any large-scale contraction in demand which could result in down-sizing of its project portfolio.

No contraction in the demand for the Company’s debt instruments which could result in an increase in the

cost of borrowings to fund future capital expenditure is foreseen.

Trade receivables amounting to ` 3818.34 Crore forms a significant part of the financial assets carried

at amortised cost, which is valued considering provision for loss allowance using the expected credit

loss method. Beneficiaries of the Company are mostly State DISCOMS and considering the infusion of

liquidity declared by the Government of India to these beneficiaries under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Special

Economic & Comprehensive Package, the Company does not anticipate any enhancement of credit risk in

realization of trade receivables.

A significant part of the financial assets of the Company are classified as Level 1 and the fair value of

these assets which are mainly investments in liquid equity and debt securities is marked to an active

market which factors in the uncertainties arising out of COVID-19. In respect of Financial Assets carried:

Risk management framework

The Group’s activities make it susceptible to various risks. The Group has taken adequate measures to address such

concerns by developing adequate systems and practices. Group has a well-defined risk management policy to provide

overall framework for the risk management in the Group. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the

establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.

The Group is exposed to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

i)

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer

contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade

receivables/leased assets) and from its financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions.

ii)

Liquidity risk.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations

without incurring unacceptable losses.

iii)

Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes

in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk: currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other price

risks, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and

borrowings, deposits and investments. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a

financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the

fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The Group operates in a regulated environment. Tariff of the Group is fixed by the Central Electricity Regulatory

Commission (CERC) through Annual Fixed Charges (AFC) comprising the following five components:

1. Return on Equity (RoE), 2. Depreciation, 3. Interest on Loans, 4. Operation & Maintenance Expenses and 5. Interest on

Working Capital Loans. In addition to the above Foreign Currency Exchange variations and Taxes are also recoverable

from Beneficiaries in terms of the Tariff Regulations. Hence variation in interest rate, currency exchange rate variations

and other price risk variations are recoverable from tariff and do not impact the profitability of the Group.

(B) Credit Risk

The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing

activities, including deposits with banks and other financial instruments.

Trade Receivables, unbilled revenue & lease receivables :-

The Group extends credit to customers in normal course of business. The Group monitors the payment track record of

the customers. Outstanding receivables are regularly monitored. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with:

letter dated 2nd August 2019 has raised demand on Teesta-V Power

Station for ` 35.80 crore towards acquisition of land and compensation for appurtenant houses and

other structures on the said Land which were purportedly damaged by Dam water during FY 2014. The

claim has been refuted by the management on the grounds that the land is not required by the Power

station and also damages were not on account of construction activities which were completed back

in FY 2008. The damage has apparently happened due to existence of old slide zones in the area. The

notification for acquisition of land under the RFCTLARR Act, 2013 published in the Sikkim Government

Gazette on 06.03.2018 is unilateral and without the consent of the Power Station and as such is legally not

tenable. The matter is currently under discussion with the State Government and pending further review

and discussion/agreement on the matter and considering that the demand pertains to the Land which has

not been requisitioned by the Group for Power Station and as such no cash outflow is expected in this

respect.

3.

Contingent Assets: Contingent assets in respect of the Group are on account of the following:

a)

Counter Claims lodged by the Group on other entities:

The Group has lodged counter claims aggregating to ` 915.84 Crore (Previous year ` 875.05 Crore)

against claims of other entities. These claims have been lodged on the basis of contractual provisions

and are being contested at arbitration tribunal/other forums/under examination with the counterparty.

It includes counter claims of ` 28.16 Crore (Previous year ` 28.16 Crore) towards arbitration awards

including updated interest thereon.

Based on Management assessment,a favourable outcome is probable in respect of the claims aggregating

` 803.37 Crore (Previous year ` 780.09 Crore) and for rest of the claims, the possibility of any inflow is

remote. Accordingly, these claims have not been recognised.

b)

Late Payment Surcharge:

CERC (Terms & Conditions of Tariff) Regulations 2014-19/2019-24 provide for levy of Late Payment Surcharge

by generating Group in case of delay in payment by beneficiaries beyond specified days from the date of

presentation of bill. In view of significant uncertainties in the ultimate collection from the beneficiaries, an

amount of ` 239.48 Crore (previous year ` 109.35 Crore) as estimated by the management has not been

recognised.

c)

Revenue to the extent not recognised in respect of power stations:

Tariff orders for 2019-24 are pending in respect of all Power stations and Tariff order for 2014-19 is pending

in respect of TLDP-IV Power Station. Further, Truing up order of 2014-19 are pending for approval of

CERC in respect of IndraSagar and Omkareshwar Power Stations. Management has assessed that additional

revenue of ` 561.10 Crore (Previous year ` 1246.79 Crore) is likely to accrue on account of tariff revision

which has not been recognised due to significant uncertainty for the approval thereof.:

letter dated 15th May 2020 and corrigendum dated 16th May 2020 has

conveyed the decision of the Government of India to provide rebate of 20-25% on fixed cost billed

to beneficiary DISCOMs. Accordingly, the proposal of rebate estimated to be of ` 185 Crore is under

consideration to be provided amongst beneficiary DISCOMs during FY 2020-21.

In respect of projects under construction / under survey & investigation, the management does not

foresee any large-scale contraction in demand which could result in down-sizing of its project portfolio.

No contraction in the demand for the Group’s debt instruments which could result in an increase in the

cost of borrowings to fund future capital expenditure is foreseen.:
