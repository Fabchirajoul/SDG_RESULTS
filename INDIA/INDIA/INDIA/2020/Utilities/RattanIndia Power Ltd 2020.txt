Dear Shareholders,

As you read this, the world’s economy and financial landscape continues to reel under

never-before witnessed turmoil as a result of the fast growing threat of the COVID-19

pandemic, which, if it to continues to persist, poses a far greater threat to economic growth

than even the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. As per the IMF’s estimates, the global economy

is expected to shrink by 3% - the steepest slowdown since the Great Depression of the

1930s.

The Indian economy too has been severely impacted due to the prolonged lockdown in

most parts of the country. While India grew at 4.2 percent in 2019, it is expected to contract

by 4.5% following a longer period of economic lockdown and a slower than anticipated

recovery. As per Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), released

data for the first quarter (April, May, June) of the current financial year, GDP contracted by

24%. Though, the Government was quick to respond with a slew of policy measures and

fiscal packages to provide much needed comfort to businesses and its citizens alike, its

impact, in terms of economic recovery, will take some more time.

Inspite of the onset of the pandemic in the latter half of Financial Year 1920, it has been an exciting and extra-ordinary year for

your company. The stress that the company had been facing over the past many years has been finally resolved. I am delighted to

share that, on 31 December 2019, your company concluded a ‘One Time Settlement’ Scheme (OTS) with the original lenders (a

group of 12 lenders with Power Finance Corporation Limited as Lead Lender) to the Amravati Project. All the lenders unanimously

agreed on assigning the entire debt (post restructuring), to a set of new lenders and investors, backed by reputed international

fund houses, for ` 4,050 Crores.

This is the first successful scheme to have been closed post the RBI Circular of 12 February 2018 and one of the biggest resolution

schemes to have been closed outside the NCLT framework, attracting global investors, without any change in the existing

management.

This comes in the backdrop of significant sectoral challenges that the Indian power sector has been undergoing in terms of

dealing with stressed and non-performing assets. Given that this process has attracted some of the leading international funds,

including the likes of Goldman Sachs and Varde Partners (through the Aditya Birla ARC Limited), in the backdrop of global financial

markets continuing to fight turmoil, it clearly highlights the high quality of the assets, and the strong reputation of the management

team of your Company.

Whilst the government has done incredible work in improving the business atmosphere, prima facie, the focus has been limited

to sectors where the government is either a service provider or a facilitator. However, the sector wherein the Government is a

supplier or consumer of goods has been totally ignored. For e.g., in the Power Sector, Independent Power Producers (IPPs)

procure coal from Coal India Limited (a government owned company); coal transportation is primarily through the Indian Railways

(another government owned organisation) and electricity generated by the generators is supplied to Discoms (most of which are

government owned). Here, supplier of raw material (coal), services (transportation) and the procurers of electricity are directly

under Central or State Governments. To improve the business atmosphere in the power sector, a lot of work needs to be done to

improve efficiency – viz., quality and quantity of coal supplied to IPPs, allotment of rakes by Indian Railways, timely payment of

bills by Discoms, etc. In this regard, the recent initiatives to open up coal mining (which has been under the monopolistic domain

of government-owned Coal India) to commercial mining and sale to improve quality of coal at efficient market driven prices.

In order to support the recovery of the economy post the pandemic and the expected push to stimulate demand, electricity will

continue to play a pivotal role in the recovery and in setting the country towards regaining lost ground. The power supply

position of the country continues to improve with each passing year. During the 12th five year plan, electricity generation grew at

a compounded growth of 5.74%. Peak power demand recorded was 164.07 GW, of which 160.75 GW was met. Per-capita

consumption of electricity has increased to 1,122 units and is expected to increase further as the government initiatives and

focus on manufacturing initiatives during the years will start paying-off. While the overall demand for power in the country was

considerably impacted as a result of the necessary containment steps taken in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the gradual

reopening of the economy, and supported by measures to stimulate recovery by the Central Government, demand for electricity

continues to improve each day. This increasing demand for power can only be satisfied by ensuring that the country keeps on

adding new generation capacity, much of which is likely to come from the private sector. Although the current focus of the

government policies is tilted towards renewable energy sources and reducing the carbon footprint of the country, more than 65%

Chairman’s Message

Mr. Rajiv Rattan

Chairman:

letter of intent from

elstwhile lenders with respect to the Binding Settlement Proposal. Subsequently, post various rounds of discussions, the Company,

on 31 December 2019, successfully concluded a One Time Settlement (OTS) Scheme for resolution of its Debt.

Successful Resolution of Debt through a One Time Settlement Scheme for Amravati Thermal Power Project

Your Company successfully closed a One Time Settlement (OTS) of its debt with existing lenders in the 1,350 MW Amravati Power

Plant, whereby foreign funds (rupee-based loan) replaced Indian banks and institutions. This one of its kind debt resolution in the

power sector by foreign funds without any change in management and not only reaffirms faith in the current management but

also reposes faith in power sector in the country.

As part of this One Time Settlement (OTS) of debt, the existing Indian lenders (12 lenders led by PFC and SBI) have assigned the

existing principal debt of approx. ` 6,574 Crores to a set of new foreign investors and lenders, led by marquee foreign funds like

Goldman Sachs and Varde Partners through the Aditya Birla ARC Limited for ` 4,050 Crores.

Sinnar Thermal Power Limited is in active discussion with lenders for successful resolution of the its debt. STPL has received: letter

of intent for execution of PPA of 507 MW (net capacity). Lenders have also shown interest in starting operations and in granting

required working capital and non-fund based facilities to implement aforementioned PPA with MSEDCL.

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS

Your company has following competitive strengths which will enable it to achieve a strong position in the Power Sector:

Statutory and Non-statutory Clearances

Your company has obtained all required clearances, necessary for sucessfull operations of the Amravati Thermal Power Project

and Nasik Thermal Power Project.

For theAmravati Thermal Power Project, the Company has leased 1,350 acres of land from Maharashtra Industrial Development

Corporation, signed a Fuel Supply Agreement for 5.493 MTPA coal with South Eastern Coalfields Limited, obtained 87.6 million

cubic meter water allocation from upper Wardha dam from Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation and has secured the

consent to operate from Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board.

For Nasik Thermal Power Project, Sinnar Thermal Power Limited has leased 1,069.35 acres of land in Nasik SEZ, have coal allocation

for total 5.226 MTPA coal from South Eastern Coalfields Limited & Mahanadi Coalfields Limited and 36.5 million cubic meter

water allocation from Water Resource Department, Nasik.

Management Discussion and Analysis (contd.)

letter of Intent

from MSEDCL for entering into a PPA for supplying 507 MW from Nasik thermal power project for period of 25 years.

Fuel Security

Your Company has Fuel Supply Agreements (FSA) with Coal Companies, supplying coal at prices notified by Ministry of Coal,

covering the entire requirement for operating the plant at normative PLF. This puts your Company in a very strong competitive

position as compared to the present mechanism wherein coal linkages are granted through e-auction process where bidders

either offer premium over notified prices of coal or offer discount on the tariff for supply of power under PPA.

Execution Team

One of key strengths of your company is the team of experts who have vast experience of constructing, commissioning and

operating large power projects. Senior management people of the Company comprises of people from Navratna Companies of

the country - like NTPC, BHEL to name a few and who have vast experience in the implementation and operation of thermal

power projects. This team is capable of addressing the challenges currently being faced by thermal power projects in the country.

STRATEGY

The key elements of the Company’s strategy include:

Capitalizing on the opportunities in Indian power generation sector

Your Company has planned significant long term initiatives to capitalize on the huge potential presented by the Indian power

sector. With a growing economy, there will be increase in electricity demand and therefore, significant investment will be required

in generation, transmission and distribution to fulfill this demand and fulfill Government of India’s ambitious target of providing

‘Power for All’. We have the expertise, ability to raise capital and execute large scale power projects to reap the benefits of

growth in the sector.

Leveraging of project execution and operating skills

Your Company has developed good project planning and project execution capabilities and keeping in mind the complexity of

power projects, we have hired project managers with the ability and skill sets to drive projects to successful completion and

commissioning. Your Company has a robust workforce with good project execution and plant operating skills that will enable the

Company to build world class power plants with a focus on operational efficiency.

Ensuring fuel security

Your Company has adequate coal linkages/FSA with Coal India Limited to ensure a steady supply of coal to fire the power plants.

Further, any shortfall in coal supply will be met through the use of imported coal in line with prevailing procurement guidelines

and the PPAs. The Company is also actively evaluating the opportunities currently available for securing coal blocks for mining of

coal for captive use under the auction process.

Engaging in an optimal mix of off-take arrangements with state-owned and industrial consumers

Your Company intends to maintain an appropriate mix of off-take arrangements. Your Company believes that secured off-take

arrangements will provide a level of committed revenues whilst short-term arrangements will enable the Company to realize

higher tariffs from time to time, depending upon market conditions. The Company intends to utilize its marketing and trading

capacities an capabilities to secure off-take arrangements with state-run utility companies and industrial consumers, as well as

carry out merchant sales of power at market rates. The Company intends to enter into bilateral contracts on a term-ahead basis

with industrial consumers and Discoms through open access. Government of India has created the DEEP portal through MSTC for

conducting bid process for short term purchase of power by Discoms. Your Company is also exploring opportunities for short

term sale through this portal.

BUSINESS REVIEW

The financial year 2019-20 was a phenomenal year for the Company, which saw it achieve a one- time full and final settlement

(“OTS”) of its outstanding debt with the consortium of various banks and financial institutions (“Erstwhile Lenders”), enabling

the Company to ward off the challenge of NCLT proceedings, while at the same time achieving a substantial reduction in the

humongous amount of the external debts, which had been a constant cause of serious concern, of the Company.

Prior to the effectuation of the OTS the fund based bank and institutional debt of the Company was around ` 8074.55 crores

The Company had in the past two years, been working extensively with the Erstwhile Lenders, for the purpose of bringing about

a restructuring of its burgeoning debt and the resultant financial stress, which was threatening to assume proportions which

would completely impede the growth and progress of the Company, ultimately impacting the continuance of its business existence.

All the efforts in this direction, were being made within the ambit and framework of the various schemes and guidelines as had

issued by the RBI, as in force at the relevant points of time. These majorly included the RBI’s Scheme for Sustainable Structuring

lakhs is adjusted in retained earnings.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Contd.)

of RattanIndia Power Limited for the year ended 31 March 2020

(All amount in ` Lakhs, unless otherwise stated):

letter of intent to STPL for execution of PPA of 507 MW (net capacity). STPL was

required to furnish Contract Performance Guarantee (CPG) in 3 months. Lenders of STPL have also shown interest in starting

operations and in granting required working capital and non-fund based facilities so as to implement aforementioned PPA

with MSEDCL. Considering the effect of COVID 19, the Company was not able to furnish the requested CPG, and have

requested additional time till 30 September 2020 to furnish CPG with MSEDCL.

Conditions explained above, indicate existence of uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on STPL’s ability to continue

as a going concern due to which STPL may not be able to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of

business. However, on expectation of resolution of debt with lenders within the available time frame and implementation

of PPA soon, management is of the view that STPL’s going concern basis of accounting is appropriate and believes no

additional provision for impairment is required to be created against the amount in investment and loans (net of provision

for impairment).

letter of intent to STPL for execution of PPA of 507 MW (net capacity). STPL was

required to furnish Contract Performance Guarantee (CPG) in 3 months. Lenders of STPL have also shown interest in starting

operations and in granting required working capital and non-fund base facilities so as to implement aforementioned PPA

with MSEDCL. Considering the effect of COVID 19, the Company was not able to furnish the requested CPG, and have

requested additional time till 30 September 2020 to furnish CPG with MSEDCL.

Conditions explained above, indicate existence of uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on STPL’s ability to continue

as a going concern due to which STPL may not be able to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of

business. However, on expectation of resolution of debt with lenders within the available time frame and implementation

of PPA soon, management is of the view that STPL’s going concern basis of accounting is appropriate and believes no

additional provision for impairment is required to be created against the amount in investment and loans (net of provision

for impairment).
