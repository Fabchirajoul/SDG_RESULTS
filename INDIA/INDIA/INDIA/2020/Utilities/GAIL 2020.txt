Further, your Company has a joint venture with ONGC and GSPC

i.e. ONGC Petro- Additions Limited (OPAL) which has a 1,400 KTA

capacity plant at Dahej.

Overall production from the Pata Petrochemicals complex in

FY 2019-20 was 788 KTA. A combined volume of approx. 1,000 KTA

of polymers including that of BCPL was marketed by your Company

during the year. Your Company also exported 9 KTA of polymers to

various Asian markets. Your Company has successfully maintained its

market share in the domestic polyethylene market and remained the

second largest player in the Indian petrochemical market with a

portfolio of over 1,000 KTA of polyethylene. Your Company and

BCPL together have a combined production share of 17.4% of the

High Density and Liner Low Density Polyethylene (HDPE & LLDPE)

market in the country.

BCPL has achieved 100% capacity utilization in FY 2019-20 also,

making it two consecutive years of achieving its capacity utilization of

more than 100% production.

Your Company has 5 LHC plants at four locations across the country

having production capacity of 1.4 Million MT. In FY 2019-20, total

liquid hydrocarbon production was 1.266 Million MT, 90% of which

Your Company is committed to reduce carbon emissions and

implement renewable projects. Further, your Company has a total

installed capacity of 130.26 MW of alternative energy; out of which

118 MW are wind energy projects and 12.26 MW are solar energy

projects. Your Company is implementing a 1.8 MW captive Solar

Energy PV Project at Vijaipur unit in Madhya Pradesh. The power

generated from the plant will substitute the power drawn from the grid

which will help your Company in reducing its carbon footprint in

addition to optimization of the power cost.

Managing Director. In the changing business scenario and expansion

of your Company into various other activities, business risk and their

mitigation plans are assessed on regular basis. Top corporate level key

risks are as under:

1.

Market Risk of LNG, linked with HH, in case of adverse movement

of crude oil price, continuously suppressed spot LNG prices and

expected increase in domestic gas volumes.

Ø

Polymer, LPG and other LHC

Ø

Foreign Exchange Fluctuation Risk

Ø

Commodity Price Risk

Ø

Natural or Man-made Calamity Risk

Risk Management Framework

•

LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement with Gazprom for sourcing

up to 2.85 MMTPA, i.e. around 10.26 MMSCMD of LNG

(primarily from Yamal Liquefaction terminal) with supplies

commenced from 2018-19.

The aforesaid LNG contracts were entered by your Company

with the primary objective of meeting the demand of a growing

Indian economy and ensure energy security of the nation. During

the finalization of the Sale Purchase Agreement(SPA) of above,

power sector was envisaged as the key buyer. However, power

produced from LNG doesn't come under the Merit Order

Dispatch due to availability of cheaper alternative power

including renewables.

To mitigate the above risks, your Company is exploring

opportunities to market LNG volumes in the international

markets either directly and/or through its Singapore based

subsidiary, GGSPL.

In parallel, your Company has also optimized LNG sourced from

the US through destination swap transactions to optimize cost of

shipping HH LNG to the Indian ports resulting in efficient

management of the portfolio.

Your Company has also executed agreements for LNG supply to

the upcoming/revived Fertilizer units in the domestic market.

Efforts are also on to market RLNG to anchor customers like

refineries and steel plants along upcoming and existing pipelines.

Since FY 2016-17, your Company undertook hedging

transactions for a part of the LNG volume used for your

Company's internal consumption and sale to domestic and

international customers, to mitigate the price risk and fix the

margins. Such mitigating measures of commodity hedging are

underway based on the regular assessment of managing cash

flows from trading transactions.

Present tariff methodology requires tariff to be levied separately for

each pipeline resulting in additive tariffs for multiple pipelines. Such

pipeline tariff is not viable for new customers located in far-flung

regions. There is a constant demand for equitable tariffs to manage

input costs for maintaining competitiveness of their end-

products/service. Integration of natural gas pipelines and

determination of unified/pooled tariff for such an integrated pipeline

system provides an optimal solution to tide over wide variation in tariff

structure across regions and can lead to an equitable gas based

economic development. Unified/Pooled tariff removes the distortion

in the tariffs applicable to the existing and new customers as the

pipeline network expands.

To facilitate equitable market growth, while granting the capital grant

for JHBDPL, the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA)

inter-alia directed MoP&NG to examine your Company’s request for

Unified/Pooled tariff for all its inter-connected cross-country pipelines

for ensuring financial viability and sustainability of such infrastructure

projects. It also empowered MoP&NG to either vest the responsibility

of fixing such a tariff by the nodal Ministry itself or by PNGRB through

suitable directions based on the parameters of phase-wise

actual/anticipated capacity utilization, operating expenses (including

unaccounted gas loss), future capital costs for last mile customer

connectivity etc. to ensure 12% post-tax return on GAIL’s investment.

In this regard, draft regulations have been framed, public consultation is

complete and the matter is under deliberation by PNGRB.

India is increasing its renewable energy capacity at a brisk pace with an

aim to reduce Carbon emissions. With an increase in the renewable

energy portfolio, the stability of grid is a major concern for industry.

Natural gas-based power plants can act as a balance to provide grid

Risk of reduction in margin of Petrochemicals due to lower

industry demand, lower sale price & high input cost.

4.

Risk of delay in Project Execution due to delay in obtaining Right of

5.

Risk of Underutilization of pipeline due to sluggish growth in gas

Risk of unfavorable regulatory changes.

10. Risk on further investment in RGPPL/ KLL.

As covered in the preceding paras, identified risks have been deeply

examined and reasonable mitigating measures/safeguards have been

initiated. Your Company endeavours to pro-actively initiate measures

towards maintaining financially stable business operations.

Your Company believes in continuous interaction with investor community

with transparent & symmetric information for creating value for all

stakeholders. Your Company delivers on this front through continuous

letter dated August 2, 2018 for meeting MWP target by March 2020 and

reiterated host of factors beyond control of MGL causing a shortfall. No

further written communication is received from PNGRB. The Company has

st

achieved connection targets as per catch up plan up to 31 March 2019 and

the progress on pipeline inch Kilo Meters is being expedited. The Company

has received critical permissions from various authorities for laying pipelines as

of April 2019. The management is of the view that it will be able to make

substantial progress on the required work by March 31, 2020 and that the

penalty can be avoided. Accordingly, no provision is deemed necessary in

relation to the bank guarantee issued to the PNGRB at this stage.

a) In Extraordinary General Meeting the board has approved the extension of

the terms of Compulsory Convertible Debentures (“CCD”) of face value

₹ 56,150 Million with the end date of 02.07.2019 and revised it to

02.01.2021. The revised agreement was executed dated 03.07.2019 with

the existing investor This transaction is accounted as extinguishment of

existing liability by the company because the terms are substantially

different and the difference between the carrying amount of the existing

financial liability and the new finance liability of 6,264.47 Million is

recognized in profit or losses as exceptional loss on extinguishment of

CCD. The fair value of the new liability portion of a CCD is determined by

using market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond. On

account of extension of CCD the equity component increased by

6,211.47 Million and corresponding impact is given in retained earnings.

b) The company has set up Petrochemical complex in Special Economic Zone,

Dahej (SEZ). Due to change in market scenario, sale of its products in

domestic market has become inevitable. However, the same is not viable

due to the duty structure. As assessed by company after exit from SEZ,

there shall be a significant improvement in margins based on direct saving

on Basic Custom Duty over the entire life of the complex. Further,

Petrochemical analysts have held the view that net backs to company in

domestic markets are better than exports. Therefore, Board of Directors

has accorded exploratory approval to exit from SEZ. Initially SEZ exit

liability was worked out to ₹ 16,816 Million. In current scenario amount of

liability initially worked out may reduce which cannot be estimated at this

juncture. Application for SEZ exit is under consideration with competent

authorities. A final decision on exit or not to exit can be taken based on the

terms and conditions stipulated for exit. Accordingly, no financial impact has

been taken in books of account.

a) Based on the proposal submitted earlier by the company in line with initial

condition for implementation of Assam Gas Cracker Project and

recommendation of an Inter-Ministerial Committee, the Government of India

has approved the feedstock subsidy for BPCL for 15 years of plant operation in

current financial year. As per approved methodology for computation of feed

stock subsidy, BCPL has carried out the revised study of the project to

ascertain the IRR considering the current scenario w.r.t polymer, naptha and

crore for the period from 02.01.2016 to 31.03.2019 based on the audited

financial statements has been submitted to the administrative Ministry and

considered as “Exceptional Items in Statement of Profit and Loss, whereas,

feedstock subsidy of ₹ 645.79 crore for the current financial year has been

accounted for as other operational income on accrual basis based on the

projection/estimate as per the methodology.

b) In accordance with JV agreement signed among the promoters of the

Company, Government of Assam (GoA) has considered the proposal of

BCPL to extend exemption/reimbursement of VAT on natural gas (input)

for a period of 15 years from the date of commissioning of the plant.

Accordingly, the State Government (Government of Assam) has approved

the exemption of VAT on natural gas to BCPL, however, the same is yet to

be notified by the State Government and based on the

conditions/procedures to be prescribed in the notification, the company

will submit its claim for re-imbursement of estimated amount of ₹ 278.30

crore VAT amount paid on consumption of natural gas for the period from

st

date of commissioning of plant till 31 March, 2020 and account the same in

the year of claim.

c) Based on the proposal submitted earlier by the company in line with initial

condition for implementation of Assam Gas Cracker Project and

recommendation of an Inter Ministerial Committee, the Government of India

has approved the feedstock subsidy for BCPL for 15 years of plant operation in

current financial year. As per approved methodology for computation of feed

stock subsidy, BCPL has carried out the revised study of the project to

ascertain the IRR considering the current scenario w.r.t polymer, naptha & gas

prices, actual capital cost, other costs etc. Accordingly, claim of ₹1705.35

The Company has awarded 3 contracts for remaining work of laying steel

pipelines at Agra to contractor M/s Taurant Projects Limited. Contractor even

after receiving almost all the payments through running bills had subsequently

raised a claim of ₹ 531.85 lakh towards miscellaneous charges related to the

said project through Arbitration. Wherein further the company had launched a

counter claim of ₹ 1030.82 lakh on the contractor for delay in project and loss

of profit to the company. The case was under arbitration, Arbitration Claims

lodged by M/s Tauras Projects Limited as well as in all three clunter claims filed

by M/s Green Gas Limited, final award has been passed by the learned sole

arbitrator on 12.05.2018. According to the said award almost all the claims of

contractor found baseless thus were rejected and also the counter claims of

GGL have been allowed upto approximately ₹ 42.9 lakh along with entire cost

of proceeding which was to be paid by M/s TPL to M/s GGL. Being aggrieved b

the awards dt. 12.05.2018 M/s TPL has filed appeals against all three awards

before the Commercial Court Lucknow duly registered as Misc. Case No.

15,16 and 17 of 2018 wherein our objection is already filed. Last hearing of

aforesaid cases was on 20.03.2020 which got adjourned for next hearing.

a) The company is required to complete minimum residential connections for

piped gas under the terms of contract awarded by PNGRB. Failing to

complete the minimum number of connections would make the company

liable for penal consequences, against which the company has submitted bank

guarantee to PNGRB. The company has received notices for delays in

minimum installations The charges for not completing minimum number of

connections cannot be measured at this stage and also the company has

represented the matter to the concerned authorities as a delay is on account

of various factors most of them being beyond the control of the company.

b) In respect of City Gas Distribution activities in Kakinada, PNGRB in May,

2013, invoked the PBG and claimed ₹ 1.34 crore for non-achievement of

milestones as set out in the authorization. Challenging this, Writ petition

was filed immediately in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, which has

granted stay. The matter is sub judice. BGL has suomoto filed writ petitions

is in November 2015 before the Hon’ble High Court of A.P. and Telangana

against PNGRB to stay any invocation of PBGs amounting to ₹ 10 crore and

₹ 4 crore issued to them for the GAs of Hyderabad and Vijayawada

respectively, on the grounds of force majeure conditions for non-

performance. Interim stay has been granted and the matter is sub judice.
