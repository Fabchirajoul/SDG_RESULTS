MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

AND: MANAGING DIRECTOR

A resilient

business with a

growth agenda

We aim to become a 10 GW company over

the foreseeable future, with Renewable

Energy as the central theme of our

growth plans.

Dear Shareholders,

FY2020 was a challenging year for the Indian power sector

marked by subdued economic growth and weak industrial

production. The fag end of the year evidenced the outbreak

of Coronavirus, leading to hugely dislocated economic

conditions and significantly disrupted way of life at a

global level.

At JSW Energy, we have been largely resilient to the overall

economic weakness during the year, as well as to the

disruptions caused by Covid-19. This has come about

through significant de-risking of our business over the past

few years with more than 80% of our capacity tied-up under

long-term contracts and a very efficient cost structure

encompassing both O&M and finance costs. We have also

put in place an agile and proactive response mechanism

encompassing human, operational, financial and strategic

aspects for tackling the unprecedented situation caused

by Covid-19.

FY2020 in Perspective

FY2020 witnessed subdued power demand growth of 1.3%

led by twin headwinds of overall weakness in economic

activity and Covid-19 related impact towards the end of

the year. Thermal PLF in India declined to 56.0% during the

year, its lowest level in almost three decades. Growth in

domestic coal production was flat at 729 million tonnes

during FY2020, whereas coal imports grew by 3.3% to 243

million tonnes.

In FY2020, we commissioned our 18 MW Thermal power

plant at Nandyal with long-term PPA tied-up under Group

Captive scheme. During the year, while our total net

generation was marginally lower by 3.8%, generation at

our Hydro plants was higher by 14.4% due to better water

availability in the Sutlej basin. However, generation from

our Thermal plants declined by 9.5% primarily due to lower

offtake by long-term customers across plant locations.

Nevertheless, our profitability was largely insulated as

majority of our capacity is tied under long-term PPA with

two-part tariff, wherein we receive fixed capacity charges

based on our plant availability, which was above normative

across all the plants, with fuel costs fully pass through

at actuals. We also continued to improve our operational

efficiencies by following global best practices, and further

reduced O&M expenses during the year, thereby cementing

our position as one of the lowest O&M cost power

generators in the industry.

JSW Energy has been constantly evaluating multiple

opportunities for organic and inorganic growth and to this

effect announced two acquisitions during the year – 1050

MW GMR Kamalanga Energy Ltd and 700 MW Ind-Barath

Energy (Utkal) Ltd. While the GMR Kamalanga transaction

has been put on hold given the ongoing Covid-19 related

uncertainties, the Ind-Barath acquisition is awaiting

necessary approvals from the National Company Law

Tribunal. On the organic growth front, we commenced

preparatory construction work for our 240 MW Kutehr

Hydropower plant in Himachal Pradesh, pursuant to the

strong impetus provided by the Government to boost

Hydropower generation in the country through measures

Managing Director:

Letter of Intent

pursuant to the approval of its Resolution Plan from

Committee of Creditors of Ind-Barath Energy (Utkal) Limited,

which owns a 700 MW (2x350 MW) power plant in Odisha.

Subsequent approval by the National Company Law

Tribunal for the same is under process.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW

The Company’s net generation in FY2019-20 stood at 21,252 MUs

income of `8,560 Crore in the current financial year compared to

`9,506 Crore in the previous year. The deemed PLF was 66.01%

for FY2019-20 as against 65.18% for FY2018-19.
