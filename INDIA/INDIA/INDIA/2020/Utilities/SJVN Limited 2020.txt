LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS: Dear Shareholders,

nd

It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you to the 32 Annual General Meeting and to present the Annual Report of your Company for the financial year

2019-20. Your continued interest and support for SJVN is one of our greatest motivations to rise to high standards you expect from us. I consider it my privilege

to be associated with this esteemed organization for over 12 Years in different capacities.

The Audited Financial Statements of the Company along with the Reports of the Auditors and

Dear Shareholders, Over the past many years Hydro Power Industry has been subjected to a plethora of legislative and administrative hurdles which cause

delays in execution and increased costs and ultimately render the Hydro Projects economically unviable. The problem is compounded by the rock bottom costs

of power from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, coupled with stringent environmental laws and high land acquisition costs. The entire Hydro

Power Industry has been paralyzed by these systemic impediments, so much so that only a few projects have seen the light of day in the past decade or so.

When confronted with similar problem for our projects in the State of Himachal Pradesh, your Company’s Management was absolutely resolute that, it will

neither abandon its unviable projects nor push them on backburner. Founded on this sentiment of firm determination and reinforced by innovative thinking

and proactive action, we have managed to discover a way out of this stalemate which would serve as a model for the entire Hydro Power Industry to replicate in

the times to come. SJVN took the initiative and after multiple rounds of deliberations, it succeeded to convince the Himachal Pradesh Government to provide

concessions like deferment of free power, reimbursement of 50% of State GST and booking of 1.5% LADF to any head other than project cost, BOOT/ BOOM for

70 years etc., with an objective to bring down hydro tariff to around `4.5 per unit. We were able to convince and establish before the State Government, that this

would be a win-win situation for the Power Producers as well the State concerned. Our efforts were fruitful and on these lines, Govt. of Himachal Pradesh signed

MoUs with 3 CPSUs viz. NTPC, NHPC and SJVN for setting up 10 hydropower projects of 2917 MW on Chenab river entailing an investment of about ` 28,000

crore. SJVN’s initiatives have also received support and endorsement of Ministry of Power which is now urging other States to replicate this model for Projects.

On business expansion front, the Company has secured three more Hydro Electric Projects namely Bardang HEP (138MW), Purthi HEP (210MW), Reoli

Dugli HEP(430MW) in the Chenab river basin in State of Himachal Pradesh adding 778 MW to Company’s Project Portfolio. We have already established

Project Offices to expedite works related to these newly allotted projects. Six pre-DPR chapters for Jangi Thopan Powari HEP have been submitted to CEA,

Survey work has been completed and finalization of project layout is under progress.

Your Company has also entered into a series of MoUs this year, as a part of its expansion spree for maximizing its reach to achieve the Vision of New India

2022 as outlined by Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi in CPSE Conclave 2018.

In a series of domestic roadshows for attracting investment and for ensuring economic activities, Govt. of Himachal Pradesh, organized the “Power Conclave”

and “Rising Himachal Global Summit” in the month of November 2019. During the course of these events, SJVN signed MoUs for eight hydro projects

totaling 2388MW. These projects are located in Satluj, Beas and Chenab river basins in Himachal Pradesh. The development of these projects will usher in an

investment of ` 24,000 crores and will also result in employment opportunities. We are overwhelmed by the unrelenting support and trust posed by GoHP on

our Company.

Another, MoU was signed with NEEPCO to Collaborate & Co-operate for development of Power Projects in India & Abroad with an immediate focus of

Northeast and Eastern States of India. SJVN & NEEPCO have agreed to work in alliance in the form of Joint Ventures (JVs), Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and

consortiums.

SJVN & BHEL also entered into an MoU for development of Solar Power projects in India. This MoU aims at building a closer strategic partnership between the

parties for jointly pursuing commercial solar power projects through participation in tariff/viability gap funding based competitive bidding process.

Dear Friends, you all would be glad to know that your Company has become the first PSU in the country to achieve Level-3 of People Capability Maturity

Model (PCMM) Integration. Committed to continuous improvement and closing the capability gap, SJVN achieved Level-2 certification in April, 2018. This

achievement is a testimony to SJVN’s commitment to excellence in HR practices and its belief in its human capital capability as a key lever to the realization of its

Shared Vision.

Amongst other major accomplishments, Financial Closure for 900 MW Arun-3 HEP was achieved in February 2020. Ground breaking ceremony of 210 MW

Luhri Stage – I HEP & 66 MW Dhaulasidh HEP was done in an event presided over by Hon’ble Union Minister of Home Affairs, Shri Amit Shah.

Government of India has selected SJVN as Nodal PSU for execution of 1000 MW Solar Energy Development in Himachal Pradesh. This will further add to the

installed capacity of the company and SJVN will contribute in achieving the renewable energy capacity addition targets set by Gol.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR 2020-21: Dear Shareholders, after an unprecedented and historic Nationwide Lockdown due to COVID -19, the month of June 2020 saw unrolling of UNLOCK-1 in India

with every citizen getting back stronger on his feet with each passing day. The activities of our projects in Construction and Pre-Construction stage had slowed

down due to global pandemic crisis. However, the dedication of our employees has once again seen steady progress in the works. We are striving hard with

Acceleration Plans to recover the setback of progress suffered by the projects under development during COVID Lockdown.

I am indeed delighted to inform our Members that, during the month of August 2020, SJVN has bagged quoted capacity of 100 MW in Dholera Solar Park,

Gujarat through open bidding process @ Rs. 2.80 /Unit on Build Own and Operate basis. The tentative cost of the project is Rs.450 crore. The project is

Dear Shareholders, the world economy, which was already slipping into a phase of economic slowdown in FY 2019-20 was hit by COVID-19 pandemic in the

earlier part of this year, resulting in a massive global economic upheaval. No Country, no Industry, no Business has remained untouched by this cataclysmic

event of epic proportion. These are tough and testing times not only for businesses but also for the Nations and Societies at large, rather I would say the entire

Human Race. Against the ferocity of this pandemic, even the most developed Nations have been brought to their knees. The only way, that we knew, to control

the pandemic was through lockdowns and isolation. Therefore, most economies came to a grinding halt, manifesting what IMF calls 'The Great Lockdown'.

Owing to which, experts predict a 3% contraction of global GDP, meaning over $9 trillion slash in the global growth over the next 20 months following

lockdown. The Indian economy is likely to witness tough times ahead as compulsory lockdown takes a toll on discretionary consumption. The situation might

even prevail for quarters after the lockdown eases. The Economy has suffered a big jolt, especially sectors such as MSMEs, Tourism & Hospitality, Aviation,

Automobile and Real Estate. The situation has caused deep financial stress in all sections of society, especially the down trodden.

Thankfully, owing to its typical business structure, operational and financial performance of your Company has largely remained unaffected from any direct

impact to a large extent. However, the Company may face indirect impact from overall economic damage caused to the world economy by COVID-19

Pandemic. Thus, the impact on Company’s Operational Projects is expected to be minimal whereas that on Projects under Development is likely to be moderate

to severe.

On Government Policy front, availability of reliable and affordable energy is the key for development of any country. Several steps have been taken by the

Government to reform and strengthen the power sector as a whole including power generation, transmission & distribution.

Government has continued its thrust on its flagship Power Sector reform schemes like - Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA), Deendayal

Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Smart Metering, Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), One

Nation-One Grid-One Frequency etc.

During the year, Union Cabinet approved Guidelines for operationalizing the various measures to promote Hydropower Sector which include - Declaring Large

Hydropower Projects (>25 MW) as Renewable Energy; Hydropower Purchase Obligation (HPO); Tariff rationalization measures; Budgetary support for flood

moderation component; Budgetary support for enabling infrastructure like bridges, roads etc.

The Central Government has taken a major step to address the problem of mounting outstanding dues towards Generating Companies by the Distribution

th

Companies by issuing an Order on 28 June, 2019 regarding Opening and maintaining of adequate: Letter of Credit (LC) as Payment Security Mechanism under

st

Power Purchase Agreements by Distribution Licensees. This mechanism has been made effective w.e.f 1 August, 2019. The measure is expected to improve

payments to the power generators and improve sustainability in the Power Sector.

Eight Regional Energy Management Centers (REMS) have been commissioned during 2019. These REMCs would help in Grid integration of Renewable Energy

by taking care of intermittency of RE generation and, facilitating real time forecasting, scheduling and real time tracking of Renewable Energy Generation.

In Order to promote the capacity addition of Solar and Wind Power Projects, the waiver available for use of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS transmission

charges and losses) has been extended for use of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) for transmission of electricity by Solar or Wind power projects

commissioned till December 2022. The waiver shall be applicable for the twenty five years from the commissioning of such projects.

Ministry of Power has formally launched a pan-India real-time market in electricity, which allows consumers to buy power just one hour before delivery. Real-

time market (RTM) enables consumers, including distribution companies (DISCOMs) and captive users, to buy power on exchanges just an hour before

delivery. Real-time market will make the power market dynamic as auctions will be conducted every 30 minutes. There will be 48 auction sessions during the

day. The real time market would provide an alternate mechanism for DISCOMs to access larger market at competitive price.

FUTURE PROSPECTS

My dear friends, SJVN has already set foot on the path of becoming a transnational diversified world class power company. To sustain this performance

and transform SJVN, your Management has identified four focus areas. First, speeding up the process of Survey & Investigation and obtaining various

clearances in timely manner to bring the projects into construction stage. Second, completion of Projects Under Construction without time and cost overruns.

Dear Shareholders, Your Company’s resolve towards its social and environmental obligations is amply displayed, in the way it functions and operates. We

believe in optimum utilization of resources, for environment friendly socio-economic development resulting in growth with sustainability. The challenges

ahead are big, but I am sure that the expertise and drive of our employees will see us vanquishing them.

Your Company has formulated and adopted a well perceived Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Policy, which is in consonance with the

Companies Act, 2013 and CSR guidelines issued by DPE. The company’s CSR Policy statement embeds the concerns of its stakeholders and strives to maintain a

good standard of CSR and Sustainability in its business activities. To meet this commitment, SJVN will continue to respect the rule of law, local communities and

societies at large, and make conscious efforts to enhance the quality of life as well as environmental sustainability through its CSR and Sustainability programs.

The focus areas of CSR and Sustainability programs encompass the activities as laid down under schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013 which includes

healthcare & hygiene; education & skill development; empowerment of vulnerable sections of society; promoting gender equality; infrastructure &

community development; promotion & preservation of culture; heritage and sports; sustainable development; and assistance during natural disasters.

Your Company spent a total amount of ` 36.35 crore on CSR and Sustainability activities during FY 2019-20 which is more than 2.00% of the average

net profit during last three years. This demonstrates your Company’s firm commitment towards its social obligations in: letter and spirit.

It gives me great satisfaction to share that CSR initiatives of your company have stood the test of time and have been widely acclaimed at various national and

international forums.

Here I would also like to add that, being a socially responsive organization with conscience, SJVN stood by the Nation and its people in the dire situation

emerging due to worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, going beyond obligatory CSR Mandate. The Organization contributed ` 25 Crores to the PM CARES Fund. In

addition, SJVN Employees have also voluntarily contributed a sum of ` 32 Lakhs to the fund from their salaries. A financial support of ` 2 Crores was also

provided to GoHP for procuring ventilators, PPEs, masks, Sanitizers etc. Further, a provision of ` 2.95 Crores has also been made by the Organization for

assisting in fight against the pandemic. SJVN has also taken a major step to provide relief to the Power DISCOMS of our beneficiary States by extending a rebate

of ` 58 Crores for the lockdown period in the energy bills of May 2020. I assure our stakeholders and countrymen that we will continue to contribute to

the fight against COVID-19 by our Nation by all means available at our disposal.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Dear Friends, As a listed company, SJVN has been complying with the requirements of Corporate Governance under the SEBI (LODR) Regulations and also

Guidelines issued by Department of Public Enterprises, Government of India. In this regard, your company has been constantly achieving "Excellent" rating for

compliance with ‘DPE Guidelines on Corporate Governance’ under the ‘Corporate Governance Grading System’ prescribed by DPE.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

floating rates.

2. Refinancing

3. Actual interest is recovered through

tariff as per CERC Regulation

Recognised financial liabilities not denominated in

Foreign exchange rate variation on

loans is recovered through tariff as

per CERC regulation

The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to manage finances for

the Company’s operations. The Company has loan and other receivables, trade and other receivables, investments and cash and short-term deposits that arise

directly from its operations. The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks:

i) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The company

is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities including deposits with banks and financial

institutions.

ii) Liquidity risk.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations without incurring unacceptable losses.

iii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market prices comprise

three types of risk: currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other price risks. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings,

deposits, investments. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in

foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market

interest rates. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held as at 31st March, 2020 and 31st March, 2019.

The company operates in regulated environment. Tariff of the company is fixed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) through Annual Fixed

Charges (AFC) comprising the following five components: 1. Return on Equity (RoE), 2. Depreciation, 3. Interest on Loans, 4. Operation & Maintenance Expenses

and 5. Interest on Working Capital Loans. In addition to the above, Foreign Currency Exchange Variation and Taxes are also recoverable from Beneficiaries in

terms of the Tariff Regulations. Hence variation in interest rate, currency exchange rate variations and other price risk variations are recoverable from tariff and

do not impact the profitability of the company.

The company's risk management is carried out as per policies approved by Board of Directors from time to time.

(A) Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks

and other financial instruments.

a) Trade Receivables

The Company extends credit to customers in normal course of business. The Company monitors the payment track record of the customers. Outstanding

customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are

mainly state government authorities and operate in largely independent markets.

CERC tariff regulations 2019-24 allows the Company to raise bills on beneficiaries for late-payment surcharge which adequately compensates the Company for

time value of money arising due to delay in payment. Further, the fact that beneficiaries are primarily State Governments/ State Discoms and considering the

historical credit loss experience for trade receivables, the Company does not envisage either impairment in the value of receivables from beneficiaries or loss

due to time value of money due to delay in realization of trade receivables.

b) Financial assets at amortised cost

Employee Loans: The Company has given loans to employees at concessional rates as per the Company's policy which have been measured at amortised cost at

Balance Sheet date. The recovery of the loan is on fixed instalment basis from the monthly salary of the employees. Management has assessed the past data

and does not envisage any probability of default on these loans.

letter of credit

The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to manage finances for the

Group’s operations. The Group has loan and other receivables, trade and other receivables, investments and cash and short-term deposits that arise directly from its

operations. The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks:

i)

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The

company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities including deposits with banks and

financial institutions.

ii) Liquidity risk.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations without incurring unacceptable losses.

iii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market prices comprise

three types of risk: currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other price risks. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings,

deposits, investments. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in

foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market

st

st

interest rates. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held as at 31 March, 2018 and 31 March, 2017.

The group operates in regulated environment. Tariff of the company is fixed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) through Annual Fixed

Charges (AFC) comprising the following five components: 1. Return on Equity (RoE), 2. Depreciation, 3. Interest on Loans, 4. Operation & Maintenance

Expenses and 5. Interest on Working Capital Loans. In addition to the above, Foreign Currency Exchange Variation and Taxes are also recoverable from

Beneficiaries in terms of the Tariff Regulations. Hence variation in interest rate, currency exchange rate variations and other price risk variations are recoverable

from tariff and do not impact the profitability of the group.

The group's risk management is carried out as per policies approved by Board of Directors from time to time.

(A) Credit Risk

The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and

other financial instruments.

a) Trade Receivables

The Group extends credit to customers in normal course of business. The Group monitors the payment track record of the customers. Outstanding customer

receivables are regularly monitored. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are mainly state

government authorities and operate in largely independent markets.

CERC tariff regulations 2019-24 allows the Group to raise bills on beneficiaries for late-payment surcharge which adequately compensates the Group for time

value of money arising due to delay in payment. Further, the fact that beneficiaries are primarily State Governments/ State Discoms and considering the

historical credit loss experience for trade receivables, the Group does not envisage either impairment in the value of receivables from beneficiaries or loss due

to time value of money due to delay in realization of trade receivables.

b)

Financial assets at amortised cost

Employee Loans: The Group has given loans to employees at concessional rates as per the Group's policy which have been measured at amortised cost at

Balance Sheet date. The recovery of the loan is on fixed instalment basis from the monthly salary of the employees. Management has assessed the past data

and does not envisage any probability of default on these loans.
