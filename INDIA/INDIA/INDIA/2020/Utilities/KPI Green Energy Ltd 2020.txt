Dear Shareholders,

Let me begin with wishing you all - the best of health and spirit.

FY2019-20 has been a truly historic and momentous year. While the

world witnesses and combats with one of the biggest healthcare crises

humanity has ever faced, it is essential to pause, reflect, and assess the

vulnerabilities - of organisations, nations, and companies and address

them to come out of this stronger than before.

For us at KPI Global Infrastructure, this year, in particular, has been

memorable for altogether different reasons. This year marked many

significant developments in the operations of your company. First, the

company commissioned a significant 25 MW of solar power generation

capacity under its IPP business vertical. It is noteworthy to mention that

this project holds the distinction of being the first and only solar power

project to be financed by Power Finance Corporation Limited (PFC)

under a third party private PPA, to the tune of 86 Crores. This project

has been executed at our existing Solarism site in Village Sudi, Bharuch

District, Gujarat. Given our existing 15 MW base, this means a year-

on-year humongous growth of 150% in our power generation portfolio.

The company now has a cumulative 40 MW of solar power generation

capacity. The company generated 461 Lakh Units of clean energy

compared to 187 Lakh Units in the previous financial year, registering

a 146% growth in power generation. Our expanded power generation

capability was the principal reason behind our healthy revenue from

operations growth; the company recorded a 72% increase with 59.28

Crores revenue from operations in FY2020 compared to 31.56 Crores in

FY2019. Incremental revenue from our power generation business not

only compensated for the reduction of Sale of Industrial Plots business

but also transformed the nature of our top-line and bottom-line. With

the growing prominence of IPP business, the company is witnessing a far

more sustainable and consistent revenue stream. This trend is expected

to grow further since the company has an additional ~40 MW of power

generation assets in the pipeline that is planned to be commissioned by

the end of FY2020-21. The company envisages an 80+ MW portfolio to

be available for operations by end of current financial year.

As far as our CPP business is concerned, we witnessed a 52% growth

in this business vertical and the highest ever sales since the advent of

this business. The company energised solar power generation assets, for

Captive Power Producers, to the tune of 3.12 MW in FY2020, taking

the cumulative capacity commissioned to 6.20 MW. The performance

of this vertical could have been better if not for COVID-19 and its

subsequent complete lockdowns impacting all our target clients. The

company missed out on some project completion milestones due to a

delay in execution because of the lockdown, the same revenue has been

deferred and will be recorded in the subsequent quarters of FY2020-21.

As far as the impact of COVID-19 is concerned on the performance

of the company, it is safe to say that the IPP business segment has

been relatively unaffected due to the adversities of this crisis. Power

generation and off-take were as anticipated. However, the CPP business

witnessed some challenges with respect to construction activities on-site,

since all projects were near-completion stage when the lockdown was

imposed, there were no significant cost overruns. The outlook of business

development for CPP will be tapered for the coming year, given the cost

cutting and investment-deferral spree across Indian corporates.

Nonetheless, the long-term prospects of Solar and Renewable energy

seem brighter than ever, supported by factors such as cost-efficient power

generation, massive policy support, and increasing awareness about

climate change. Renewables will be the most crucial source of power

to fulfill the growing needs of India. We strongly support the vision of

our Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to grow the share of

renewable energy capacity to 60% by 2030. Before I conclude, I wish to

thank all my Board Members, regulatory authorities, management team,

shareholders and our beloved employees for their continued guidance,

support and belief in our organisation.
