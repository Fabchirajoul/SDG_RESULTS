Dear Stakeholders,

The webster definition of resilience is “the capability

of a strained body to recover its size and shape after

deformation caused especially by compressive stress”.

It’s hard to believe that it was less than three months ago,

on March 11, 2020 that the World Health Organization

(WHO) declared the outbreak of Covid-19 as a pandemic,

meaning Covid-19 has spread worldwide. If there ever has

been a time when the need for global resilience has been

critical, it is now.

What I can predict

is that on the other

side of this crisis will

emerge massive new

opportunities, will

emerge great new

leaders, will emerge

terrific businesses,

and will emerge a few

stronger nations.

Resilient Group performance

I am pleased to report that each

one of our six publicly traded

companies has performed well

even as we started to confront the

trying circumstances following the

first few weeks of 2020. While we

may have to do need-based course

correction in our strategies in the

wake of the challenge that we are

facing, the roadmap remains clear.

Our businesses are closely aligned

to the lifeline of the economy,

providing essential services to

enhance the quality of life of citizens

and addressing critical national

infrastructure priorities. We look at

our Group companies as individual

growth drivers that complement each

other’s strengths.

Dear Stakeholders,

Operational excellence and sustainability have been hallmark of the way we

conduct our business. After having listed in June 2018 and publishing our

first Sustainability Report in FY19, we are now geared up for the next stage

with more ambitious plans and targets. I present to you our first ‘Integrated

Report’ for FY20 that showcases our integrated thinking and approach

towards economic, environmental and social performance, and our long-term

value creation.

We are proactively addressing

Environmental, Social and

Governance (ESG) issues with a view

to realising sustainable growth as well

as enhancing enterprise value. These

issues play a pivotal role in all our

business decisions.

Investing in people

The collective capabilities of our

people have taken us far, and we

will continue to invest in them and

introduce industry-leading practices.

Our people are passionate about

thinking ahead of the curve and

accelerating the pace of innovation

in this period of dramatic change. We

value each other’s individuality and

system of beliefs and work together

to enhance their own capabilities.

Progressing further

Our vision is to become the world’s

largest solar power company by FY25

and the largest renewable power

company by FY30. We expect to more

than double our existing portfolio of

renewable power generating assets

of over 2.5 GW by FY22. We have

secured pipeline of projects, which

will grow our operational capacity

to 14+ GW by FY25. We will continue

to build on our strong foundation

and achievements in our journey of

excellence. Equipped with strong

growth enablers and streamlined

operations, we have a clear gliding

path to the future.

I take this opportunity to thank our

shareholders for their continued trust

and support. I would also like to thank

all our stakeholders and bankers for

supporting our vision and initiatives.

Dear Stakeholders,

AGEL’s vision is a world that runs entirely on green energy. We develop,

construct and operate wind farms and solar farms. We are committed to

delivering value to our stakeholders in a safe, secure, environmentally and

socially responsible manner with utmost ethics and transparency. Intending to

disclosures through an independent

third party; their assurance

statement forms part of this Report.

In addition to material issues,

this Report also articulates our

disclosures on CSR initiatives focused

on education, community health,

sustainable livelihood, and rural

infrastructure development activities.

In consecutive years, AGEL has

established strong governance

and management practices to

ensure proactive monitoring and

management of our key focus

areas. Our Board takes stock of

the emerging sustainability trends

and the Company’s sustainability

performance through quarterly

reviews. Our Enterprise Resource

Planning (ERP) mechanism helps

capture performance parameters

on material procurement, project

operations, employees and workforce,

waste generation and disposal,

among others. Data related to

energy consumption, safety, training,

and grievance, among others, are

captured and aggregated at the site

level after due validation.

Our people are critical to our success.

We rely on their commitment, skills

and knowledge to execute our

strategy. In addition to fostering a

high-performance culture based on

opportunity, equality, and diversity,

we prioritise procedures, values and

behaviours that promote health,

safety, and security. During the year,

we organised 1,438 safety training for

over 34,429 hours.

As stewards of the environment,

we are working to conserve energy,

reduce waste and build awareness of

environmental issues. We undertake

rigorous risk assessments at every

stage of a project and put in place

robust systems and processes to

minimise any adverse impact, without

compromising on our commitment to

safety. We have identified projects

for improving green cover in our

locations of operations and identified

mangrove areas for afforestation

and conservation. We are creating

solar parks for better provision

of infrastructure. Also, we have

installed waste module recycling

facilities at all of our sites during the

reporting period. We are committed

to encouraging ecosystem

biodiversity by establishing new and

sustainable projects in a way that

fosters harmonious coexistence and

conserves, protects and promotes

the development and growth of

natural heritage.

To reiterate, responsible value

creation is a continuous process, and

we will endeavour to improve as we

move ahead. You too have a pivotal

role to play in this value creation

journey, by providing your valuable

As at

As at

(a) The Group has received demand for liquidation damages for various projects completed

beyond the contractually agreed dates. The Group has filed appeal with appellant

authorities. The management believes the reason for delay were not attributable to

the Group and the facts underlying the Group’s position, it believes that the probability

that it will ultimately be found liable for these assessments currently does not seem

probable and accordingly has not accrued any amount with respect to these matters

in its financial statements. The Group does not expect the impact of these demands to

have a material adverse effect on its financial position and financial statements.

(d) The Honourable Supreme Court of India vide its order dated 28th February, 2019 held that ‘Basic Wages’ for the

contribution towards Provident Fund (PF) should only exclude [in addition to specific exclusions under Section 2(b)

(ii) of the Employees Provident Fund Act, 1952]:

a)

amounts that are payable to the employee for undertaking work beyond the normal work which he / she is

otherwise required to put in and

b)

allowances which are either variable or linked to any incentive for production resulting in greater output by an

employee and that the allowances are not paid across the board to all employees in a particular category or

were being paid especially to those who avail the opportunity.

With reference to the above-mentioned judgement, the Group’s Management is of the view that there is

considerable uncertainty around the timing, manner and extent in which the judgement will be interpreted

and applied by the regulatory authorities. Management has evaluated the probable impact of the same and

concluded that there is very insignificant impact of the same on the Group, accordingly no impact in the books

of account has been considered.

letter and/or offering circular and/or

listing particulars.

The Board recommends the said resolution for your approval.

None of the Directors or any key managerial personnel or

any relative of any of the Directors of the Company or the

relatives of any key managerial personnel is, in anyway,

concerned or interested in the above resolution.

For Item No. 5:

As per Provisions of Section 14 of the Companies act

2013, Alteration of Articles of Association of requires

shareholders’ approval by passing necessary resolution as

a special resolution.

Currently, the definition of term Security as captured in

the prevailing Articles of Association is as follows:

“1. [2] (b) “Securities” means the securities as defined

in clause (h) of Section 2 of the Securities Contracts

(Regulation) Act 1956.”

In order to have better flexibility with regard to fulfilling

requirements of funds for various purposes in day to

day operations or for capex funding requirements of

the Company, it is proposed to include the Perpetual

Instruments

in

the

aforesaid

definition.

Perpetual

Instruments are long term financing solutions having a

pre-defined coupon rate with a very long term maturity

period. Considering its long term maturity period, they are

generally not considered as debt in networth computation

and allows companies to have access of funds for a longer

period without diluting the ownership rights of existing

shareholders. Although, the current definition of Securities

in the Articles of Association allows the issuance of such

Securities indirectly as being inclusive in nature, to have a

more explicit enablement as a matter of abundant caution,

the current modification is being proposed by addition of

perpetual securities, perpetual debt or perpetual bonds as

a part of the said definition.

The alteration of Articles of Association of the Company

needs approval of shareholders of the Company by way of

a Special Resolution.

A copy of Articles of Association of the Company with

the proposed alteration is available for inspection at the

Registered Office of the Company at any working day

during business hours.

The Board of Directors recommends the above resolution

for your approval as Special Resolution.

None of the Directors or any key managerial personnel or

any relative of any of the Directors of the Company or the

relatives of any key managerial personnel is, in anyway

concerned or interested in the above resolution.

For Item No. 6:

The existing Registered Office of the Company’s is located

at “Adani House”, Nr. Mithakhali Six Roads, Navrangpura,

Ahmedabad-380009, which is within the local limits of

Ahmedabad. The Company has set up new office premises

in the name of “Adani Corporate House” which is situated

at Shantigram, Near Vaishno Devi Circle, S. G. Highway,

Khodiyar, Ahmedabad 382 421. The following are some

of the advantages for shifting of registered office of the

Company to the new address:

• The Adani group has built its own new multi-storied and

spacious office building for integration of operations of

all group companies at one central office place.

• Synergy of operations leading to administrative

convenience.

• Single point of contact for all the stakeholders of

the Adani Group of Companies and its subsidiaries/

associates etc.

• To

avoid

multiple

office

locations

and

reduce

rental and incidental costs for managing offices at

different locations.

The proposed registered office falls outside the local

limits of Ahmedabad city and pursuant to the provisions

of Section 12(5) of the Act, shifting of registered office to

the new address as mentioned in the Special Resolution,

outside the local limits of the city, requires approval of the

members by way of a Special Resolution.

The Board of Directors recommends the above resolution

for your approval.

None of the other Directors or key managerial personnel or

their relatives is, in any way, concerned or interested in the

said resolution.
