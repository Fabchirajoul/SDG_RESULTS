Letter’, harboring a sharper, leaner and greener

version of the Company. The five pillars of the new

ZEE 4.0 or the 5G approach as I have termed it,

will encompass a robust focus on – Governance,

Granularity, Growth, Goodwill and Gusto. As a first

step in this direction, the Board of the Company

has been reconstituted with new members who

bring in the required blend of experience and

expertise. I am confident that a Board with majority

independent directors will be instrumental in

setting the standards for corporate governance

going forward. We have also adopted a more

granular and transparent approach for business

reporting which will help all stakeholders make

well-informed decisions. We will be rolling out

detailed disclosures of business KPIs, segmental

reporting, a refreshed Corporate Social

Responsibility (CSR) policy, and measurable ESG

goals, to achieve the same.

Over the years we have grown, vertically and

horizontally, becoming one of the most loved

content brands in India and around the world.

Going forward, we will continue to maintain a sharp

focus on growth as we invest our time and energy

in maximizing our core, expanding into adjacent

spaces and exploring new areas of business.

We have initiated a strategy exercise within the

Company to carve a 5-year roadmap, to transform

the organization and its strategic approach with

consumer centricity and profitable growth as the

two cornerstones.

All our plans and strategies would not fructify

unless we nurture our most important asset – our

people. I truly believe that one does not build a

business; but builds people who then build the

business. ZEE is extremely fortunate to have a

strong professional leadership team at the helm

to drive this new strategy forward with renewed

energy and gusto.

The unprecedented times brought upon by the

COVID-19 pandemic are leaving us with a lot of

food for thought. Businesses across the globe

have suffered unprecedented losses and some

are going through extremely difficult situations. We

have been more fortunate, and I believe the primary

reason for that has been our unrelenting focus

on customer centricity. The speed and agility with

which our teams adapted to the situation have been

instrumental in maintaining business continuity and

ensuring undisrupted entertainment to our viewers.

We believe that in this rapidly evolving media

& entertainment landscape, only the ones who

adapt to change will survive in the future. These

will be the companies which succeed in adapting

themselves best to the environment while ensuring

a strong hold on the pulse of their consumers and

a keen eye on growth and profitability.: Dear Shareholders,

ZEE, in its illustrious history of 27 years, has not only created a multi-faceted entertainment

content company but has also played a pivotal role in shaping India’s media and

entertainment industry. Today, ZEE stands on the threshold of a new beginning, to create a

stronger version of itself and define the future of the media & entertainment landscape in the

country. The last financial year has been a year of transformation. A year of leaving behind

our old selves, creating a newer version and taking a leap to create a legacy that will elevate

the Company to greater heights. The new beginning, which I term as ZEE 4.0, will be the

harbinger of enhanced consumer focus, further innovation in content creation, and leveraging

technology to deliver a heightened entertainment experience to all our consumers across

multiple consumption platforms.

The mantra at ZEE has always been to lead by example, and we have demonstrated that

effectively through our success across markets and businesses. Every challenge we faced

on this path was met with an equal determination to overcome and forge ahead. Though we

cannot go back and alter our decisions, no one can stop us from creating a brand new future.

The year gone by

FY20 was a year of highs and lows for our

business. While we reported a decline in our

advertising revenue for only the second time in

more than a decade, on the operating front we

achieved new feats. Our broadcast business

now has the widest language footprint in the

country, making it a truly pan-India network for

consumers. New Tariff Order upset the equilibrium

in the distribution space with the slew of changes

it introduced. However, the network not only

withstood the challenges of the transition, it

emerged much stronger post implementation,

expanding its reach and revenue in most markets.

ZEE5 took giant leaps towards becoming India’s

leading digital entertainment platform. Over a short

period, ZEE5 has become the biggest producer

of digital exclusive content in the country. It is

also gradually strengthening its presence outside

India, which will help us remain relevant in markets

which are transitioning to digital. Zee Music

Company continues to grow, and I am happy to

report that it turned profitable last year, validating

our decision to venture into music publishing

business 5 years ago. Zee Studios fell short of our

expectations for the in-house production business,

but the distribution segment delivered a string of

successful films.

Despite a decline in advertisement revenues,

the topline of the Company grew by 2.5%. This

domestic subscription led growth is a reflection of

the increasing balance of our revenue portfolio.

The macro-economic slowdown experienced last

year, coupled with the fall in consumer demand

led to a decline in advertising. In India, brands

still look at advertising as a cost to be incurred

in good times and not as a lever for building

resilient consumer connect. As we move into an

extremely cluttered world, we will see a gradual

change towards a more holistic approach which

has advertising as an integral part of the brand.

Meanwhile, our aim is to insulate the growth of the

Company from the macro-economic cycles, as far

as possible, by offering holistic solutions to our

partners. Despite the slowdown, we continued to

invest in growth opportunities which will enable us

to grow ahead of the industry once the economy

recovers. Continued investments coupled with the

fall in advertisement revenue led to a decline in

EBITDA margin to 27.5%. Next fiscal is also going

to be challenging, as advertising revenue will

decline further in the first half due to the impact

of COVID-19. However, I believe that this phase

is just a blip in India’s long-term growth story, and

the economy will bounce back with vigor once the

impact of the pandemic subsides.

Our fight against COVID-19

The pandemic left many vulnerable to its harsh

impact, and in such times, we focused on the

need to come together and support each other.

Acknowledging the work done by frontline

workers, we stepped up our efforts in all directions

to support the nation in strengthening its medical

infrastructure, providing essential equipment like

ambulances, personal protective equipment kits,

oxygen humidifiers and daily meals to families

affected by the pandemic. As a responsible player

in the media & entertainment sector, we also

ensured that the lives and livelihoods of the daily

wage earners in our content production ecosystem

were least impacted, by supporting them

financially during the lockdown. The Company also

used the massive reach of its network to increase

awareness about the pandemic.

Vote of thanks

I would like to thank all the shareholders for their

continuous trust in the Company. It is your undying

faith that enables us to strive towards achieving

greater heights, growing at a faster clip than the

industry, and generate higher value year on year.

I would also like to thank all our partners who

help us in creating content, ensuring its delivery to

the consumers and most importantly monetizing

it. And lastly, I would like to convey my gratitude

to all our people, who relentlessly work towards

turning our vision into reality. It is the confidence in

their collective ability that enables me to say with

conviction that we are on our way to successfully

build a new version of ZEE.

Until then, celebrate endings, for they precede

new beginnings. For us at ZEE, a new and exciting

journey has just begun.

letter of

comfort by the Company or its subsidiary in the

course of the business.

Exchange rate fluctuations

The Company has operations outside India, and

a portion of its revenues and expenses are in

foreign currencies. Thus, the Company is exposed

to fluctuations in the exchange rates. Any extreme

fluctuations of foreign currencies against Indian

Rupee could have an impact on its revenues and

expenses.

IT Security Threats

COVID-19 has forced organisations to embrace

remote working and new technologies. This has

created an ideal situation for cyber criminals to

attack IT infrastructure and launch a range of

hacking strategies. A security breach or disruption

to IT infrastructure could lead to loss of sensitive

data or information, legal and regulatory non-

compliance, reputational damage as well as

revenue loss.

Regulatory Risk

Uncertainties in rules and regulations

The M&E industry is governed by the rules

and regulations framed by the authorities and

regulatory bodies of the different countries the

Company operates in. Further, COVID-19 has

forced governments to bring new regulations

which companies need to adopt swiftly and

effectively. Any changes in laws and regulations

could have a material impact on the revenues and

cost of doing business for the Company.

Internal Risks

Increase in content costs

The Company spends a significant amount for

acquisition of rights to movies and music across

its broadcast, digital and international business.

With increasing competition, content creation and

content acquisition costs could rise to a level not

commensurate with the monetization potential and

estimated cost recovery.

Failure to hire and retain best talent

The Company’s ability to attract, develop and

retain a diverse range of skilled people is critical

if to compete and grow effectively. The loss

of management or other key personnel or the

inability to identify, attract and retain qualified

personnel could make it difficult to manage the

business and could adversely affect operations

and financial results.:

Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer

of the Company for a period of 5 (five) years with effect from January 1,

2020, on the terms and conditions including remuneration as set out in

the Statement annexed to the Notice convening this meeting with liberty

Punit Goenka: Managing

Letter of Comfort (LOC) issued in May 2016, by

the Company to Yes Bank Limited (Bank) in connection with a borrowing by Liv-

ing Entertainment Limited (LEL), a related party, from the said Bank, confirming,

among other matters, to support ATL Media Limited (ATL), a wholly owned sub-

sidiary of the Company, by way of infusion of equity/debt for meeting various

requirements of ATL, including honouring a Put Option entered into by ATL with

LEL, which was renewed on 29 July 2019 to be valid until 30 December 2026,

to purchase 64.38% of the issued share capital held by LEL in Veria Interna-

tional Limited (VIL), another related party of the Company, at the exercise price

of $52.50 Millions (` 3,927 Millions) as at 31 March 2020, which was assigned

by LEL in favour of Axis Bank Limited, DIFC branch, the security trustee for the

benefit of the Bank, to secure the said borrowing by LEL. In view of the alleged

defaults by LEL in repaying its dues to the Bank and ATL also not settling the

amount called by the Bank under the Put Option, subsequent to the year-end,

the Bank filed a plaint in the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay on the grounds,

among other matters, seeking an interim application with a main prayer that the

aforesaid LOC is a guarantee given by the Company. The Hon’ble High Court

has refused the ad-interim relief sought by the Bank. The Bank has preferred

an appeal against the Order and the Company is contesting the Bank’s claim

in the Hon’ble High Court. Consequently, the Management has not considered

the LOC as a financial guarantee and since the matter is sub-judice, has not

accounted for any liability in respect of the LOC and the aforesaid contention

of the Bank.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

In view of the confirmation given by the Company in the LOC issued to the Bank

to fund ATL through debt/equity, such LOC partakes the character of an execu-

tory contract under Ind AS 37 on ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contin-

gent Assets’ which needs to be assessed for any onerous commitment. In the

absence of sufficient appropriate audit evidence, we are unable to determine if

the LOC is an onerous commitment and whether any adjustment is required to

be made in this regard in the books of account and on compliances required

with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, Foreign Exchange Management

Act (FEMA), SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,

2015 (as amended) in relation to the issue of LOC and its consequential impact

on our reporting responsibilities under the Companies Act, 2013.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs)

specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Stan-

dards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the

Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of

the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of

Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that

are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provi-

sions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder and we have fulfilled our other

ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s

Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient

and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion on the standalone

financial statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were

of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the

current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the

standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,

and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have deter-

mined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communi-

cated in our report.

with a borrowing by Living

Entertainment

Limited

(LEL),

a related party, from the said

Bank, confirming among other

matters, to support ATL Media

Limited (ATL), a wholly owned

subsidiary of the Company, by

way of infusion of equity/debt for

meeting various requirements

of ATL, including honouring a

Put Option entered into by ATL

with LEL, to purchase 64.38% of

the issued share capital held by

LEL in Veria International Limited

(VIL), another related party of the

Company, which was assigned

by LEL in favour of the Bank, to

secure the said borrowing by

LEL. The exercise price of the Put

Option is $52.50 Millions (` 3,927

Millions) as at 31 March 2020.

Subsequent to the year-end, the

Bank filed a plaint in the Hon’ble

High Court of Bombay on the

grounds, among other matters,

seeking an interim application

with a main prayer that the

aforesaid LOC is a guarantee

given by the Company. The

Management has not considered

the LOC as a financial guarantee

and since the matter is sub-judice,

has not accounted for any liability

in respect of the LOC and the

aforesaid contention of the Bank.

We considered this as key audit

matter on account of the amount

of the claims, the matter being

sub-judice and due to any other

consequential impacts.

This matter is also a subject

matter of qualification included

in the Basis of Qualified Opinion

section above.

Refer note 35 of the standalone

financial statements.

• Circulated

direct

balance

confirmations requests to the bankers

of the Company, including Yes Bank

Limited, for balances as at 31 March

2020;

• Perused the legal opinions obtained

by the Management from various

lawyers

based

on

which

the

Management has concluded that LOC

is not in the nature of guarantee;

• Perused the briefs for the legal

opinions provided by the Management

to the lawyers;

• Independently

obtained

a

legal

opinion from an external law firm to

evaluate the Management’s assertion

that the LOC is not in the nature of a

guarantee on the Put Option;

• Considered if the LOC met the

requirements of an executory contract

and if so whether it could be onerous

in nature requiring a provision under

Ind AS 37 on ‘Provisions, Contingent

Liabilities and Contingent Assets’.

Letter of Comfort (LOC) to Yes Bank Limited confirming,

among other matters, to support ATL Media Limited, its wholly owned subsidiary,

by infusing equity/debt for meeting all its working capital requirements, debt

requirements, business expansion plans, honoring the Put Option, take or pay

agreements and guarantees. The Company’s financial reporting process did not

have controls to identify the issuance of such LOC and assessing if it could be in

that nature of an executory contract which may be onerous requiring adjustment

in the books of account under Ind AS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and

Contingent Assets’.

A ‘material weakness’ is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in

internal financial control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable

possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim

financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Qualified Opinion

In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations

given to us, except for the possible effect of the material weakness described

in Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph above on the achievement of the

objectives of the control criteria, the Company has maintained, in all material

respects, adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting and such

internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as

of 31 March 2020, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria

established by the Company considering the essential components of internal

control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

We have considered the material weakness identified and reported above in

determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit

of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31

March 2020, and this material weakness has affected our opinion on the said

standalone financial statements of the Company and we have issued a qualified

opinion on the standalone financial statements of the Company.:

by a related party to a Mutual Fund. The said related party had made partial redemption of the NCDs prior to the due date of redemption, that is, 8 July

2020. But, due to COVID-19 pandemic, its business was severely impacted and therefore it was unable to redeem the balance portion of the NCDs on the

redemption date.

Subsequent to the year end, the Company has purchased these NCDs from the Mutual Fund for an amount aggregating to ` 445 Millions. These NCDs

are secured by first pari- passu charge over the current assets, movable fixed assets including all rights, title, interest, benefits and claims / demands of the

related party i.e. the Issuer Company. The tenure of NCDs have been extended by 1.5 years.

@

The Company has received legal notices of claims / lawsuits filed against it relating to infringement of copyrights, defamation suits etc. in relation to the

programs produced / other matters. In the opinion of the management, no material liability is likely to arise on account of such claims / law suits.

b) The Company has preferred a legal case against The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for premature termination of media rights contract for

telecast of cricket matches between India and other Countries in neutral territories outside India. The Hon’ble Arbitration Tribunal in November 2012 has

passed an Arbitral award of ` 1,236 Millions (plus interest) in favour of the Company. BCCI has filed a petition before the Hon’ble High Court of Judicature

at Madras challenging the Tribunal Award. The Company has also filed an execution petition in April 2018. Accordingly, pending final outcome, effect has

not been given in these financial statements. During the previous year, Company has received ` 300 Millions which is accounted as deposits received in

other financial liabilities.

Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed for capital expenditure not provided for (net of advances) is ` 121 Millions (` 301 Millions).

b)

Other commitments as regards media content and others (net of advances) are ` 6,830 Millions (` 8,333 Millions).

c)

Uncalled liability / contractual obligation on investments committed is ` 40 Millions (` 55 Millions).

35. ATL Media Limited (ATL), an overseas wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, engaged in broadcasting business. Living Entertainment Limited,

Mauritius (LEL), a related party of the Company, which is a content provider. During the financial year ended 31 March 2016, ATL had entered into a Put

Option Agreement with Living Entertainment Limited (LEL) to purchase 64.38% of the issued share capital held by LEL in Veria International Limited

(VIL) (another related party of the Company) for $ 105 Millions, the exercise period of the Put Option was from the agreement date till the expiry date,

i.e. 30 July 2019. In order to secure a borrowing from Axis Bank Limited and Yes Bank Limited (Bank), LEL had assigned all its right, title, benefit and

interest under the said Put Option Agreement in favour of Axis Bank, DIFC Branch, the security trustee for the benefit of Axis Bank Limited and Yes Bank

Limited. The Put Option Agreement was amended by the parties (ATL and LEL) on 29 July 2019 and extended till 30 December 2026, based on certain

representations made by LEL and the exercise price was set at $52.50 Millions (` 3,927 Millions) for the same number of shares and LEL extended the

assignment of the Put Option to the security trustee. During the year, the Bank has enforced the Put Option pursuant to the assignment and demanded

ATL to pay the exercise price. Subsequent to year end, upon inquiry, ATL became aware of certain misrepresentations by LEL at the time of renewal of the

Put Option agreement and consequently, ATL has rescinded the Put Option from the date the Put Option was extended as well as filed a suit against LEL

and the security trustee of the said Bank in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Mauritius for inter-alia declaration that the amended Put Option agreement has

been properly rescinded and no longer binding and enforceable. The matter is now sub-judice.

In May 2016, the Company had issued a: Letter of Comfort (LOC) to the said Bank confirming its intention, among other matters, to support ATL by

infusing equity/debt for meeting all its working capital requirements, debt requirements, business expansion plans, honouring the Put Option, take or

pay agreements and guarantees. The Company has received communication from the Bank mentioning defaults committed by LEL in repayment of their

loans to the Bank and calling upon the Company to support ATL in connection with honouring the Put Option, which would then enable LEL meet its loan

repayment obligations to the Bank, however the Bank and LEL remained in discussion to settle the borrowing.

The Company is of the view, based on legal advice, that the LOC neither provides any guarantee, commitment or assurance to pay/repay any obligation of

LEL. Subsequent to the year-end, the Bank filed a plaint seeking ad-interim relief in the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay on the grounds that the aforesaid

LOC is a guarantee. The Hon’ble High Court of Bombay Vide Order dated 30 June 2020, has refused the ad-interim relief sought by the Bank. The Bank

has filed an appeal before the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay Division Bench against the said Order. The Company is contesting the Bank’s appeal in the

Hon’ble High Court and the matter is sub - judice.

Since the matters are sub-judice and based on legal advise obtained by the Company, the LOC has not been considered as a guarantee by the

management and does not create any transaction that requires recognition of a liability in the books of account of the Company or require any

compliances with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), or with the SEBI (Listing Obligations and

Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended).

Letter of Comfort

(LOC) issued, in an earlier year, by the Parent to the aforesaid Bank in connection

with the said borrowing by LEL, from the Bank, confirming among other

matters, to support ATL, by way of infusion of equity/debt for meeting various

requirements of ATL, including honouring the aforesaid Put Option entered into

by ATL with LEL.

In view of the alleged defaults by LEL in repaying its dues to the Bank and

ATL also not settling the amount called by the Bank under the Put Option,

subsequent to the year-end, the Bank filed a plaint against the Parent in the

Hon’ble High Court of Bombay on the grounds, among other matters, seeking

ad-interim application with a main prayer that the aforesaid LOC is a guarantee

given by the Parent. The Hon’ble High Court has refused the ad-interim relief

sought by the Bank. Consequently, the Parent has not considered the LOC as

a financial guarantee. The Bank has preferred an appeal against the Order and

the Parent is contesting the bank’s claim in the Hon’ble High Court. Since the

matters are currently sub-judice, we are unable to determine whether any further

adjustment, in addition to any adjustments on the Put Option by ATL referred

above, is required to be made in respect of such LOC given by the Parent, in the

books of account and on compliance with the requirements of the Companies

Act, 2013, Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), SEBI (Listing Obligations

and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) in relation to

the issue of LOC and its consequential impact on our reporting responsibilities

under the Companies Act, 2013.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance

with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143 (10) of the Act

(SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associate and

joint venture in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute

of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements

that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the

provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled

our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and

the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us

and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports

referred to in the sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Other Matters section below,

is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified audit opinion on

the consolidated financial statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of

most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the

current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of

the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion

thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have

determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be

communicated in our report.

Key Audit Matter

Auditor’s response

Matter of litigation relating to the

Put Option issued by a wholly owned

subsidiary which was assigned in

favour of Yes Bank Limited (Bank)

and the: Letter of Comfort (LOC)

issued by the Parent to the Bank

to support the subsidiary meet

its obligations:

Principal audit

procedures performed:

Subsequent

to

year-end,

ATL

claims to have been made aware of

certain misrepresentations by LEL

at the time of renewal of the Put

Option agreement on 29 July 2019.

Consequently, ATL has rescinded

the Put Option on grounds of

misrepresentation and also filed a

suit against LEL and the security

trustee of the said Bank in the

Hon’ble Supreme Court of Mauritius.

The Parent had, in May 2016, issued

a Letter of Comfort (LOC) to Yes

Bank Limited in connection with the

aforesaid borrowing by LEL from

the said Bank, confirming among

other matters, to support ATL by

way of infusion of equity/debt for

meeting various requirements of ATL,

including honouring a Put Option

entered into by ATL with LEL.

Subsequent to the year-end, the

Bank filed a plaint in the Hon’ble High

Court of Bombay on the grounds,

among other matters, seeking ad-

interim application with a main prayer

that the aforesaid LOC is a guarantee

given by the Parent. The Parent

has not considered the LOC as a

financial guarantee.

We considered this as key audit

matter on account of these being

sub-judice and due to any other

consequential impacts.

This matter is also a subject matter of

a qualification included in the Basis of

Qualified Opinion section above.

Refer note 36 of the consolidated

financial statements.

• Perused the copies of the Put Option

agreements and the suit filed by ATL in

the Supreme Court of Mauritius;

• Discussed the legal opinions obtained by

ATL with the auditors of ATL;

• Reviewed the basis of qualification

reported by the auditors of ATL and

discussed with the auditors of ATL their

basis of conclusion.

Letter of

Comfort (LOC) to that Bank confirming, among other matters, to support

its subsidiary by infusing equity/debt for meeting all its working capital

requirements, debt requirements, business expansion plans, honoring the

Put Option, take or pay agreements and guarantees. The Parents financial

reporting process did not have controls to identify the issuance of such

LOC and controls surrounding the consideration of the valuation of the Put

Option entered by the subsidiary company when preparing the consolidated

financial statements. This could potentially result in adjustment in the books

of account or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.

A ‘material weakness’ is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,

in internal financial control over financial reporting, such that there is a

reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual

or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a

timely basis.

Qualified Opinion

In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations

given to us and based on the consideration of the reports of the other

auditors referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, except for the

possible effects of the material weaknesses described in Basis for Qualified

Opinion paragraph above on the achievement of the objectives of the control

criteria, the Parent and its subsidiary companies and a joint venture which are

companies incorporated in India have maintained, in all material respects,

adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting and such internal

financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as of 31

March 2020, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria

established by the Parent considering the essential components of internal

control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

Date: 24 July 2020:

Letter of Undertaking to secure 650 units of rated, unlisted, secured redeemable non-convertible debentures (NCDs) issued by a

related party to a Mutual Fund. The said related party had made partial redemption of the NCDs prior to the due date of redemption i.e. 8 July, 2020. But, due

to COVID-19 pandemic, its business was severely impacted and therefore it was unable to redeem the balance portion of the NCDs on the redemption date.

Subsequent to the year end, the Company has purchased these NCDs from the Mutual Fund for an amount aggregating to ` 445 million. These NCDs are

secured by first pari- passu charge over the current assets, movable fixed assets including all rights, title, interest, benefits and claims / demands of the

related party i.e. the Issuer Company. The tenure of NCDs have been extended by 1.5 years.

* Income Tax demands mainly include appeals filed by the Group before various appellate authorities (including Dispute Resolution panel) against disallowance

of expenses / claims, non-deduction / short deduction of tax at source, transfer pricing adjustments etc. The management is of the opinion that its tax cases

are likely to be decided in its favour and hence no provision is considered necessary.

# The amount represents the best possible estimate arrived at on the basis of available information. The Group has engaged reputed advocates to protect its

interests and has been advised that it has strong legal positions against such disputes.

@ The Group has received legal notices of claims / lawsuits filed against it relating to infringement of copyrights, defamation suits etc. in relation to the

programs produced / other matters. In the opinion of the management, no material liability is likely to arise on account of such claims / law suits.:

Letter of Comfort (LOC) to the said Bank confirming its intention, among other matters, to support ATL by infusing

equity/debt for meeting all its working capital requirements, debt requirements, business expansion plans, honouring the put option, take or pay agreements

and guarantees. During the year, the Company has received communication from the Bank mentioning defaults committed by LEL in repayment of their loans

and calling upon the Company to support ATL in connection with honouring the Put Option, which would then enable LEL meet its loan repayment obligations

to the Bank, however the Bank and LEL remained in discussion to settle the borrowing.

The Company is of the view, based on legal advice, that the LOC neither provides any guarantee, commitment or assurance to pay/repay any obligation of

LEL. Subsequent to the year-end, the Bank filed a plaint seeking ad-interim relief in the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay on the grounds that the aforesaid LOC

is a guarantee. The Hon’ble High Court of Bombay Vide Order dated 30 June 2020, has refused the ad-interim relief sought by the Bank. The Bank has filed

an appeal before the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay Division Bench against the said Order. The Company is contesting the Bank’s appeal in the Hon’ble High

Court and the matter is sub-judice. Since the matters are sub-judice and based on legal advice obtained by the Company, the LOC has not been considered as

a guarantee by the management and does not create any transaction that requires recognition of a liability in the books of account of the Company. Further,

the Group has concluded that the matter of LOC will not impact the consolidated financial statements since this is an intra-group arrangement and will in any

case be eliminated during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

(B) The Group has preferred a legal case against The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for premature termination of Media Rights contract for

telecast of cricket matches between India and other countries in neutral territories outside India. The Hon’ble Arbitration Tribunal in November 2012 has

passed an Arbitral award of ` 1,236 Millions (plus interest) in favour of the Group. BCCI has filed a petition before the Hon’ble High Court of Judicature at

Madras challenging the Tribunal Award. The Group has also filed an execution petition in April 2018. Accordingly, pending final outcome, effect has not

been given in these financial statements. During the previous year, Group has received ` 300 Millions which is accounted as deposits received in other

financial liabilities.

37. During the previous year, considering the increasing competition and content cost inflation, the Company adopted an aggressive differentiated movie library

expansion strategy and entered into strategic content partnerships with major production houses, movie studios and creative partners for movies monetization

on Zee5, domestic and international broadcast businesses. Accordingly, the Company had provided advances to content aggregators and their agencies

(sub-agents) for movie library acquisition and advances aggregating ` 2,450 million (net of inventories acquired) were outstanding as on 31 March 2019. During

the year, the Company has received inventories of the value of `1,950 million and refund aggregating to `500 million from the parties, along with interest of

` 19 million which is accounted under the head ‘Other Income’.

Further, during the previous year, as part of the aforesaid business strategy, the Company had entered into certain output deals for future rights and given

unsecured interest-free deposits aggregating ` 6,930 million for a period of eleven months to the aggregators. During the year, the Company has received

rights aggregating ` 2,205 million and has received refund of ` 525 million. The balance amount has been renewed as an advance.

38. Operational cost, Employee benefits expense and other expenses are net off recoveries ` 295 Millions (` 335 Millions).:
