our Transformational approach

LeTTeR To STaKeowneRS

Dear Friends,

A satisfying journey in a challenging

environment – that sums up FY 2019-20

for IndiaMART. Driven by our sustained

focus on changing lives, we continued

dedicatedly,

through

the

year,

to

transform our vision for a better India

into real, on-ground achievements. A

series of notable milestones underscored

the success of our concerted efforts to

create value for every person whose life

we touch, across the stakeholder fabric

– from the Shareholders to Customers,

to our Employees and the Community

at large.

IndiaMART’s successful listing on the

National Stock Exchange and Bombay

Stock Exchange in 2019 was aligned

to this commitment, as we further

honed our growth strategy to become

stronger and better. Our decision to go

public was rooted in our sustained focus

on generating greater value for our

shareholders, and was further motivated

by their continued support and trust.

The

post-IPO

environment

led

to

significant churn in our operational

business environment, encouraging us to

further enhance our customer proposition

of enabling ease of doing business,

particularly among small enterprises

which have emerged as the backbone of

the country’s economic growth agenda.

With the roll-out of our new brand promise

of `Bada Aasaan Hai’, we have further

simplified the procession of facilitating the

growth of SMEs/MSMEs, to enable them to

become big with total ease. In our quest

to establish IndiaMART as a brand that is

synonymous with the concept of ease of

use, we continued to invest judiciously in

advanced technologies across platforms,

to make the online digital business

environment

more

affordable

and

accessible for the enterprises.

While the benefit of this approach

percolates to every level of our huge

database, the SMEs/MSMEs, with their

low Internet penetration, stand out as

the biggest beneficiaries of our approach.

Our thrust remains on simplifying the

business systems and processes for the

SMEs to support their on-boarding on

the e-commerce platform. Our mission

is to create an empowered business eco-

system for the country, and we intend to

invest more forcefully in Fintech and SaaS

solutions to advance our goals, going

forward.

We are fully cognisant of the criticality

of our people in furthering our business

strategy, and hence remain committed to

nurturing the development and progress

of our large base of employees. From

learning interventions to motivational

initiatives, our Human Resource policy

is crafted to ensure the sustained

growth and well-being of our people

in a gender-neutral, transparent and

positive environment. The fact that 121

of our employees have been with us for

over 10 years validates the success of this

approach. The COVID crisis brought in

new challenges for employees and we are

closely working with them to help them

adapt to the new normal of working in

the COVID era. We are encouraging them

to take up online learning courses and

develop new skills while working safely

from home.

As a responsible corporate, we also remain

steadfastly focussed on serving the

bigger Community through our robust

and well-formulated Social Responsibility

framework. By helping the SMEs/MSMEs

explore their unknown capacities and

capabilities, we are enabling them to

scale up their business and contribute

exponentially to the nation’s economic

progress. We have also contributed to

setting up computer centres in Purur and

Thakore Schools with solar back-up, since

neither of these institutions have power

connectivity.

As we move ahead in our journey

of collective long-term growth and

progress, we shall continue to invest in the

development of each of our stakeholders

even more proactively, because we

believe that their support and trust is vital

to IndiaMART’s continued success.

The journey ahead seems promising,

notwithstanding the short-term pangs

caused by the nationwide lockdown

triggered by the global COVID pandemic.

It is my sense that in the long run, the

marketplace will see wider adoption

of e-commerce, in particular by a

growing expanse of small and medium

businesses, amid the new normal that

this unprecedented crisis has ushered in.

dinesh agarwal

CEO

IndiaMART’s successful listing on the National

Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange in 2019

was aligned to this commitment, as we further honed

our growth strategy to become stronger and better.
