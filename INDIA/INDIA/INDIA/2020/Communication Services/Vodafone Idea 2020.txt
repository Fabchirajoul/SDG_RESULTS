Letter to Shareholders

Dear Shareholder,

Covid-19 and the associated lockdowns across

countries have triggered a once-in-a-century

crisis for the society and the economy in 2020.

January now seems like a month of a bygone

era — such has been the enormity of change.

This is a defining period in human and business

history: one that will test the resilience

of individuals, societies, corporations, and

nations.

Given the fog of uncertainty all around, it

is hard to be prescient in these times. But

there is little doubt on one reality: companies

with quality leadership, sound business

fundamentals, and a track record of winning

in turbulent times, will emerge as champions

in the new global order.

Global Economy

It has been several months since the pandemic

engulfed the world and yet there is a lot of

uncertainty with respect to the extent of the

economic contraction due to this crisis, and

the subsequent pace of recovery.

This year will see an economic contraction,

but this 2020 recession is turning out very

different from the past recessions. It has been

too sudden – almost off the cliff; its spread

has been all-encompassing – affecting almost

every economy and sector, and the plunge in

economic activity levels and employment has

been unprecedented.

On the positive side, this recession is likely to

be one of the shortest, assuming no second:

On March 16, 2020, DoT also filed a modification application with

the Hon’ble Supreme Court to allow reasonable time to the TSPs,

a particular date. Subsequently, on March 18, 2020, the Hon’ble

Supreme Court heard the matters and inter alia ordered that no

exercise of self-assessment / re-assessment is to be done and the

AGR dues which were placed before the Hon’ble Supreme Court

have to be paid including interest and penalty. At the same hearing,

the Hon’ble Supreme Court stated that the DoT’s modification

application would be considered on the next date of hearing.

On June 11, 2020, the modification application filed by DoT came

file their proposals, within 5 days, as to the time frame required

by the TSPs to make the payment and what kind of securities,
