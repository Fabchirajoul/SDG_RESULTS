Letter from the Chairman I 05: Letter from the

Letter from the Chairman I 06

By staying true to its purpose and its values,

and helping its employees, customers and

communities use the power of technology

to realize their potential, your company is the

embodiment of stakeholder capitalism in the

true spirit of the Tata ethos. Over the last five

decades, your company has shown itself

to be very purpose-driven, resilient and

adaptable, staying relevant to its customers

through multiple economic and technology

cycles, and doing good for all its stakeholders.

This is the secret behind its longevity and

sustainability.

The sharp shift in consumer preferences will force enterprises

to significantly accelerate their digital transformation

initiatives. They will also invest heavily in building resilience

at every level, on the front-end as well as in back-office

operations. Having pioneered Location Independent Agile™

and the Machine First™ Delivery Model, both of which are of

immense value to organizations looking to build operational

resilience and agility, your company is very well positioned

to benefit from these trends.

Stepping back from the enterprise level and taking a more

global view, I believe that the new world in which digital

channels become mainstream, which I described in my book

Bridgital Nation, will offer countries like India, a unique

opportunity to implement large scale digital interventions

that would provide its citizenry easier access to essential

services, while creating millions of new jobs. Your company

has been at the forefront in enabling several such high-

impact initiatives. TCS’ Financial Inclusion Network supports

over 210 million no-frills accounts set up under the Pradhan

Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. The scheme has created jobs for

over 100,000 banking correspondents who go out to remote

villages with handheld devices to provide banking services

to the unbanked.

There are several other examples: the Passport Seva project

which completely reimagined the issuance of passports,

the digital transformation of India Post, the platform that

supports Ayushman Bharat – the world’s largest, fully funded

health insurance scheme covering 500 million of India’s

poorest, and so on. Each of these initiatives showcases the

innovative use of technology to transform citizen services,

enhance inclusivity and reduce inequity in society.

By staying true to its purpose and its values, and helping

its employees, customers and communities use the power

of technology to realize their potential, your company is the

embodiment of stakeholder capitalism in the true spirit

of the Tata ethos. Over the last five decades, your company

has shown itself to be very purpose-driven, resilient and

adaptable, staying relevant to its customers through multiple

economic and technology cycles, and doing good for

all its stakeholders. This is the secret behind its longevity

and sustainability.

The next few months will be difficult, but your company

is strong with deep relationships with customers and

partners, enviable scale, a diversified business mix, a robust

and resilient business model, and strong financials. It is well

positioned to weather the storms ahead and take advantage

of opportunities that come up during the downturn to

acquire new capabilities and gain market share. In the post-

pandemic world, technology will play an ever larger role in

helping enterprises adapt to the new normal and differentiate

themselves. Your company is well poised to take the lead

in partnering customers to recover and rebound on to their

growth and transformation journeys.

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Tata Consultancy

Services, I want to thank you for your continued trust,

confidence, and support.

Warm regards,

N Chandrasekaran

Letter from the CEO I 09

TCS Annual Report 2019-20

For over five decades, TCS has been helping

individuals, enterprises, and communities

use technology to realize their potential.

This organizational purpose has served

as a beacon that has guided our customer-

centric strategy, our policies and our

decision-making over the years.

Our greatest accomplishment has been

to imbue every TCSer with this same

purpose-driven worldview.:

letter to their

shareholders every year for the last three years. The strength

of these relationships and the trust we enjoy is what gives us

the confidence that we will come out of these difficult times

stronger together.

The same purpose-driven worldview shapes the community

initiatives we take up across the world, for building skills

and fostering entrepreneurship to bridge the digital divide,

to encourage STEM education and careers, and to enable

better healthcare and wellness.

We pick programs that are scalable and which can make

a big, measurable impact on the local community. These

programs are estimated to have benefited over 840,000

people across the world. Our employees have also been

doing their bit for worthy social and environmental causes

in their respective communities, collectively contributing

over 780,000 volunteering hours in FY 2020.

Looking forward

We are entering the new fiscal year at a time when all major

economies have been brought to a standstill. The impact has

been very fast and widespread, and the next few months will

be very difficult for everyone, individuals and organizations.

On the other hand, the economic downturn is not due to any

structural problem in any industry, but due to an externality

that has hit the pause button on all economic activity.

Whenever that externality is removed, an equally quick

recovery should follow.

We are staying close to our customers, aligning ourselves

to their evolving priorities, staying lean and nimble, finding

newer ways to create value, and launching newer offerings

that address current imperatives.

Many of the innovative frameworks and methodologies that

we pioneered are of even greater relevance to our customers

today. The TCS thought-leading Business 4.0™ framework

that we launched three years ago to help enterprises

leverage digital technologies for their growth and

transformation agendas, continues to guide them today.

Business levers such as mass personalization, creating

exponential value, leveraging ecosystems, and embracing risk

coupled with core technologies such as agile, automation,

intelligence, and cloud are some of the foundational pillars

helping enterprises respond and recover from the crisis.: Letter from the CEO I 10

TCS Annual Report 2019-20

TCS’ customer-centricity and commitment

to helping customers succeed in their

businesses, has helped us establish enduring

customer relationships and abiding trust.

Our oldest customer relationship goes back

over four decades. We have stayed close

to our customers through good times and

bad, helping them navigate challenges

and speed bumps, harnessing the power of

technology to solve their business problems

and enabling competitive differentiation.

Revenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under each

Allocation of such assets and liabilities is not practicable and any forced allocation

Letter of Credit has been made available to Epic for

`3,319 crore (US $440 million) as ﬁnancial security in order to stay execution

of the judgment pending post-judgment proceedings and appeal. Pursuant to

reaffirmation of the Court order in March 2019, the Company has ﬁled a

notice of appeal in the superior Court to fully set aside the Order. Epic has

also ﬁled a cross appeal challenging the reduction by the trial judge of

`754 crore (US $100 million) award and `1,509 crore (US $200 million) in

punitive damages. The Company has received legal advice to the effect that

the order and the reduced damages awarded are not supported by evidence

presented during the trial.

ensure continued successful operations of the subsidiary.

The proposed Social Security Code, 2019, when promulgated, would subsume labour

laws including Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act and

amend the deﬁnition of wages on which the organisation and its employees are

to contribute towards Provident Fund. The Company believes that there will be

no signiﬁcant impact on its contributions to Provident Fund due to the proposed

amendments. Additionally, there is uncertainty and ambiguity in interpreting

and giving effect to the guidelines of Hon. Supreme Court vide its ruling in

February 2019, in relation to the scope of compensation on which the organisation

and its employees are to contribute towards Provident Fund. The Company will

evaluate its position and act, as clarity emerges.
