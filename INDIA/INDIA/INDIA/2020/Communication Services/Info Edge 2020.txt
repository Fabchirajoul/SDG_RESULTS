Message

the pandemic has thrown

new opportunities

with More adoption

of digital technology

by individuals and

companies.

We are optimistic about the

future especially given the fact

that the pandemic has shifted

many operations to ‘online ‘

rather than ‘in person.’ This will

expand the addressable market

opportunity for us and go a long

way to increase the demand for

digital services of the type we

provide today or can potentially

provide in the future.

4 INFO EDGE (INDIA) LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2019-20:

Dear Shareholders

In the last twenty years we have faced intense

competition from global players and local well

funded startups, seen huge disruptions in

the world of technology from social media to

mobile to now AI and ML and also been through

a very severe recession in 2008 when for almost

a year we went from 35% growth to a 25%

decline in collections in our Main Recruitment

Business.

This experience has taught us that every

crisis has an end date and can be managed

as long as the company takes a long term

view and continues to focus on its employees,

customers, products and services and cash

in the bank. It is therefore intrinsic to our

management philosophy to expect disruptions

every now and then. This has resulted in an

an agile decision making mechanism that has

focused on achieving our long term objectives

and goals against all odds.

Having said so, one needs to admit that while

we were dealing with an economic slowdown

which had started setting in, your company

certainly had neither expected nor prepared for

the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.

Even then, I am glad to report that Info Edge

has managed to stay its planned course

through these difﬁ cult times. It has continued

to work on product and service upgrades,

maintained its customer connect and effectively

managed its entire operations from a ‘work

from home’ (WFH) environment. And, as the

economy has gradually started opening up,

several of your company’s businesses have

started bouncing back fairly quickly. As I write,

jobseeker trafﬁ c on Naukri is back to 95 % of

its precovid levels, in 99acres; buyer and owner

trafﬁ c is back to 90% of precovid levels and in

Jeevansathi and Shiksha, trafﬁ c is now higher

than the same time last year. Revenue will

hopefully be back albiet with a lag.

At a time when most of the nation’s economic

activity was at a standstill, we successfully

raised `18,750 million in August 2020, through

a Qualiﬁ ed Institutional Placement (QIP).

Buyers in the fund raise were high quality

domestic and international institutional

investors including mutual funds, pension

funds, other long only funds and hedge funds.

Proceeds of this fund raise will be used to

further develop internal businesses, primarily

the real estate, matrimonial and education

portals. Across our businesses, we will invest

more in improving existing platfoms, building

new products, technology upgrades and beeﬁ ng

up our Data Science and Maching Learning

capabilities. The resources will also be used for

strategic investmens in adjacent verticals and

inorganic growth opportunities related to the

four categories we operate in: jobs, real estate,

matrimony and education. We believe that in

a developing country like India these are very

important and very high involvement services.

These market segments are huge and continue

to have signiﬁ cant opportunities and immense

potential for growth.

Essentially, we have absorbed three lessons

from the COVID-19 business environment

that are intrinsic to the future growth of our

business. These are: better disaster recovery,

business continuity and risk management,

riding changing macro trends and revisiting our

traditional ways of working.

Clearly, COVID-19 has created a set of

new strategic imperatives for the different

businesses. As I see it, there are ﬁ ve key

takeaways.

1. Financial Prudence is important. Crisis are

unpredictable and your company should at

any point in time have enough cash in the

bank to tide over them.

2. Second, the issue of operational prudence.

This means one has to look hard at all

costs, do zero based budgeting and reduce

Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer (MD & CEO) who have been

identified as the CODM, to assess the financial performance and position of the Company and makes strategic decisions.

The Company is primarily in the business of internet based service delivery operating in four service verticals through various web portals in respective

verticals namely recruitment solutions comprising primarily naukri.com, other recruitment related portals and ancillary services related to recruitment,

99acres.com for real estate related services, Jeevansathi.com for matrimony related services and Shiksha.com for education related services.

(a) Description of segments and principal activities

The CODM evaluates the Company’s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business

segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along these business segments. The accounting principles used in preparing these

financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue & expenditure in individual segments. The reportable segments represent

“Recruitment Solutions” and “99acres” and the “Others”.

1: Recruitment Solutions: This segment consists of Naukri (both India and Gulf business) and all other allied business which together provides

complete hiring solutions which are both B2B as well as B2C. Apart from all Other Online business, it also includes Offline headhunting business

‘Quadrangle’.

2: Real State- 99acres: 99acres.com derives its revenues from property listings, builders’ and brokers’ branding and visibility through micro-sites,

home page links and banners servicing real estate developers, builders and brokers.

3: Others: This segment comprises primarily Jeevansathi and Shiksha service verticals since they individually do not meet the qualifying criteria

for reportable segment as per the Ind AS.

The CODM primarily uses a measure of profit before tax to assess the performance of the operating segments. However, the CODM also receives

information about the segments’ revenue and assets on a monthly basis.

(b) Profit before tax

Profit before tax for any segment is calculated by subtracting all the segment’s expenses (excluding taxes) incurred during the period from the

respective segment’s revenue earned during the period. To calculate the segment level expenses, certain common expenditures which are incurred

for the entity as a whole but cannot be directly mapped to a single segment are allocated basis best management estimates to all the segments.

Interest income is not allocated to segments as this type of activity is driven by the central treasury function. Similarly, certain costs including

corporate expenses which are not directly related to general functioning of business are not allocated to segments.

2.13 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash on hand, amount at banks and other short-term deposits with an original maturity of three

months or less that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding

bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the company’s cash management

2.14 Earnings Per Share (EPS)

(i) Basic earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:

•

the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company

•

by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in equity shares issued

during the year

(ii) Diluted earnings per share

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account:

•

the weighted average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential

instruments into equity shares.

For the purpose of calculating basic EPS, shares allotted to ESOP trust pursuant to the employee share based payment plan are not included

in the shares outstanding as on the reporting date till the employees have exercised their right to obtain shares, after fulfilling the requisite

vesting conditions. Till such time, the shares so allotted are considered as dilutive potential equity shares for the purpose of calculating

diluted EPS.

2.15 Treasury shares (Shares held by the ESOP Trust)

The Company has created an Employee Stock Option Plan Trust (ESOP Trust) for providing share-based payment to its employees. The Company uses

the trust as a vehicle for distributing shares to employees under the employee remuneration schemes. The Company allots shares to the ESOP Trust.

The Company treats the ESOP trust as its extension and shares held by ESOP Trust are treated as treasury shares. Share options exercised during the

reporting period are satisfied with treasury shares.:

Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer of the Company examines the Company’s performance both from a business & geographical prospective and

has identified as reportable segment of its business which are “Recruitment Solutions” and “99acres” ; the “Other segments” comprises primarily Jeevansathi

& Shiksha verticals are not considered as reportable operating segment since they individually do not meet qualifying criteria for the reportable segment as

per Ind AS 108.
