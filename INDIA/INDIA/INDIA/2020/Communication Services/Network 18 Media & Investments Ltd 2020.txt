The Group commissioned India’s largest

integrated TV and Digital Newsroom at Mumbai.:

Letter to Shareholders

The strength of our brands and class-leading content creation

capabilities continued to enhance consumer engagement

across our TV channel bouquet, which includes our umbrella

brands News18 and Colors, along with our Digital properties -

Moneycontrol, Voot and News18.com.

Our 72 channel-strong TV broadcast network, straddling News

and Entertainment, is reaching out to Indians across every

linguistic group with custom-built content and innovative

packaging designed to deliver to their unique expectations and

aspirations. With timely coverage and relevant social awareness

campaigns, our News network has been an indispensable source

of information and insight during the ongoing pandemic. At the

same time, our portfolio of entertainment channels is keeping

India entertained with engaging programming, backed by

unmatched quality. Television viewers across the country spend,

on an average, half an hour each day on our broad and exciting

palette of brands, endorsing our deep-rooted consumer connect.

Within India, Network18 has emerged as the largest TV News

network and the No. 2 player in the Digital space, while our

subsidiary Viacom18 (a JV with Viacom Inc) is the

No. 3 pan-India entertainment broadcaster. Our Digital

properties have propelled us as a leading media player globally,

where we stand tall today as one of the top 10 Digital News/

Information players. Our Moneycontrol Pro subscription app,

launched a little over a year ago, is the fastest growing financial

news, analysis and research app in India. OTT platform Voot

evolved to a freemium model, with the ongoing ramp-up of

recently launched pay product Voot Select.

With our clutter-breaking cinema studio giving us multiple

national award winning films, and a genre-defining ticketing

and live entertainment platform BookMyShow, we have

scaled new milestones in our growth trajectory in recent

years. At the same time, our growing popularity across genres,

segments and languages makes us the partner of choice for

global brands such as CNBC, CNN, MTV, Nickelodeon, History,

Forbes, A+E Network, among others.

Network18 Group is at the cusp of emerging as the largest listed

Media and Distribution company in the country. As part of the

consolidation currently underway in the Reliance Group’s Media

and Distribution businesses, cable companies DEN and Hathway

are set to be merged with Network18 and TV18, subject to

regulatory approvals. We are getting future-ready to embrace

the next phase of growth, encompassing greater depth of reach

and breadth of content, backed by strengthened financials.

A strong focus on vernacular content curation and expansion

of our digital outreach to the widest possible audience shall

remain integral to our forward-looking approach, backed by

our proactive efforts to realise our strategic goal of enabling

continuous financial improvement and operational excellence.

Central to this growth proposition, however, is the commitment

we live by – to serve Indians across languages, geographies and

social strata with best-in-class, impactful and game-changing

offerings. We are confident that with the sustained trust and

guidance of our shareholders, we shall continue to deliver on

our commitment through experiences that India today aspires

and strives for. Never more than now, we remain poised to

leverage the rising Media and Entertainment opportunity in the

country, to drive an impactful transformation in the News and

Entertainment landscape.

Regards,

Adil Zainulbhai

Chairman: Dear Shareholders,

In a continually changing media landscape , made even more difficult by the COVID-19

pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, Network18 has continued to focus on

improving performance whilst delivering world-class news and entertainment. Our

focus on setting industry-defining standards in fair journalism and engaging story-

telling translated into more consumer-enriching experiences amid increased media

consumption during this period.

eminent people having an independent standing in

their respective field/profession, and who can effectively

contribute to the Company’s business and policy decisions

are considered by the Nomination and Remuneration

Committee for appointment as Independent Directors on
