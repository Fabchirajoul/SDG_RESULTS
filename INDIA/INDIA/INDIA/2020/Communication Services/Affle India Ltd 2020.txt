Dear Shareholders,

At the outset, I extend my sincere thanks to

our shareholders for making possible the

successful public listing of your Company in

2019. We truly appreciate your trust in us

and it gives me immense pleasure to

present our 1st Annual Report post listing.

Since inception, it has been an iconic

journey for Afﬂe underlined by excellent

growth and mapped by outstanding

milestones. We remain committed to

deliver new innovations and leverage

capabilities to drive sustainable growth,

ably guided by a committed leadership

team.

While the last few months were severely

marked by the COVID-19 Pandemic, what

has really kept all of us going is the tech-

enabled connected ecosystem. The world

was already at an inﬂexion point in terms of

connected devices adoption, but this

pandemic has completely altered the

priorities of enterprises and consumers

globally. In these times, your Company

continued to play on its strengths to not

only be resilient but staying ahead and

preparing for growth as the world opens

up and the situation normalizes.

Values-Driven: Continuity Amid Pandemic

Our heart goes out to those who have been

affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We

are in deep gratitude for the governments

and front-line professionals globally

who are providing the support in

these unfortunate times. We took

comprehensive steps to ensure the safety

of our teams and seamless continuity of

our services. Our South East Asia (SEA)

ofﬁces initiated safety action protocols

and started transitioning to work from

home in early-February 2020. These best

practices were extended to the India and

other international ofﬁces around mid-

February 2020. Since then, our teams

have been collaborating in a default work

from home mode. Our disciplined

approach coupled with enterprise-wide

risk management and a robust business

continuity plan enabled us to preserve the

jobs of all Afﬂers with no cuts in salaries or

pre-agreed bonuses. We have learnt from

past outbreaks and have continually

invested in technology to ensure

uninterrupted communication with our

teams, customers and partners leading to

a smooth delivery of operations. We

remain agile to respond to all business

requests as usual.
