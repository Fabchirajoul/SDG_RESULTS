Dear Shareholders

Amid an exceptionally challenging macro environment,

I am pleased to share that we have reported consistent

performance at the back of our prudent business approach

and long-term relationships of trust with customers and other

stakeholders. Our overall performance, and the growth we

posted in the second half of FY 2020-21 after the slowdown

witnessed in the initial part of the year, stands testimony

to our deep-rooted strengths. We are confident that the

learnings of the year gone by will further strengthen our

capabilities as we take on new challenges.

COVID impact

The debilitating impact of the COVID crisis, marked by a

strict nationwide lockdown at the start of FY 2020-21, led

to serious contraction in the Indian economy in the first two

quarters. The trigger effect on the industry reflected the

overall negativity in business sentiment. The Automobile

Industry Associations have pegged daily losses to the

automotive sector at around ` 2,300 crore due to

production stoppage at the automotive Original Equipment

Manufacturers (OEMs) and component suppliers on account

of the lockdown. However, lockdown relaxations, a good

harvest and demand stimulation in the festive season catalysed

recovery in the sector during the second quarter of FY 2020-21.

As economic activities started opening up in Q2 of the year,

demand uptick became visible, particularly in the passenger

segment, leading to signs of recovery in industry growth.

The increase in demand was attributed to release of pent-up

demand, preference for individual mobility, and strong

rural economy.

Owing to the second wave, which led to new lockdowns

in various states, our sales in India have once again been

affected in Q1 of FY 2021-22. However, drawing from the

learnings of the previous fiscal, we have again started taking

measures on fixed cost, variable cost, raw materials and

CAPEX controls, with full focus on generating positive cash

flows. We believe these measures will help us sustain the

growth momentum that the Company had witnessed from the

second half of FY 2020-21.

Sharpening the edge – from planning to

execution

The unprecedented COVID crisis that hit business at the

start of FY 2020-21 brought a new set of complexities into

operations. It necessitated some prompt and proactive

steps to put new policies and plans into action, with

increased focus on operational efficiencies backed by cost

optimisation. While maintaining business continuity, it also

required us to support the society in fighting the pandemic.

From providing safety kits and transportation facilities for

employees, to setting up a 81-bed Covid Care Centre in

collaboration with the local administration in Aurangabad,

we put all our resources into tackling the challenges that the

pandemic had thrown at us.

Safety measures were strengthened, and customer

deliveries were maintained even if it entailed providing

safe accommodation for some employees at the workplace

during the lockdown period. At the same time, we worked

in a focussed manner on fixed and variable cost reduction.

We also curtailed capex to protect our cash flow. As a result

of our comfortable liquidity position, we did not need to avail

the COVID-specific credit lines granted by the lead bank in

our consortium. Concurrently, we looked ahead to plan for the

resumption of normal business post the lockdown period.

As the situation started easing towards the second quarter of

FY 2020-21, we responded with agility to adapt to the new:

DIVIDEND:

The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on 19th May, 2021,

recommended a dividend of ` 6 per equity share of ` 10 each

(@ 60%) (previous dividend was interim dividend of ` 5.50

per equity share declared in the FY 2019-20), for the financial

year 2020-21, for consideration of the shareholders at the

ensuing Twenty Second Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).

The dividend, if approved by the shareholders, will result in

an outgo of ` 843.98 million.

The dividend pay-out is in accordance with the Company’s

Dividend Distribution Policy.

Dividend Distribution Policy

This policy is effective from 26th August, 2016 and has been

framed and adopted in terms of Regulation 43A of the SEBI

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,

Amount proposed to be transferred to reserves

COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE:

During the year under review, the Company posted a total

income of ` 47,865.83 million on a standalone basis as

against ` 49,747.57 million in the previous year. The total

income on a consolidated basis was ` 65,777.31 million

compared to ` 69,653.04 million in the previous year.

The Company’s total income on standalone and consolidated

basis de-grew by 3.8% and 5.6%, respectively. This primarily

was on account of deceleration of automotive industry as a

result of the nationwide lockdown since March, 2020 due

to COVID-19 pandemic. The manufacturing activities and

supply chain across the country were disrupted on account of

such lockdowns announced to curb the spread of COVID-19.

This resulted in tepid demand until almost the end of second

quarter of the financial year. The demand, however, surged in

the subsequent quarters achieving record sales in the last two

quarters of the financial year 2020-21. Despite a challenging

market environment, the Company recorded a ‘better than

industry’ performance.

The profit after tax decreased by 8.3% in the financial year

2020-21 at ` 3,921.99 million as against ` 4,276.92 million:

Managing Director of the Company since its

incorporation in December, 1999. He has over three decades

He is a first generation entrepreneur with sharp business

Group has grown both organically and inorganically.

braking systems and transmission components, with operations

spread across eighteen plants pan India. He also oversees the

operations of six subsidiaries in Europe operating through nine

to all marquee OEM customers in the auto industry having bases

in India and Europe. The Company has strong aftermarket sales

services in both domestic and overseas markets.
