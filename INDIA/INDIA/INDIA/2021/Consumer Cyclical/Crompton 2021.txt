Letter from the Chairman: Dear Shareholders,

It is my pleasure to present, on behalf

of our Board of

Letter from the Chairman

in e-commerce growth, we have

enhanced our focus on direct-to-

consumer

programmes,

which

includes our presence on leading

e-commerce platforms.

Portfolio

excellence:

By

driving

customer-centric innovation through

investments in R&D and technology,

our emphasis is on building a strong

portfolio of differentiated products

across categories. We also remain

focussed on developing premium

category products and driving their

saliency.

Our

premium

category

products have been generating strong

sales year-on-year, endorsing the

strength of our strategy.

Go-to-market excellence: Our go-to-

market execution remained strong in

terms of leveraging technology to drive

productivity and improve customer

reach, building alternate channels

like ecommerce, modern retail and

rural. We focussed on enhancing our

superior partnership with our trade

partners and supporting them during

the lockdown with extended credit

and other support areas. Continuous

efforts and investments are being

made to improve the number of

retail points where our products

are available.

Operational excellence: In addition to

building our portfolio and enhancing

our reach, we believe that a culture

of

continuous

improvement

will

be a critical enabler of business

performance. Several new initiatives

were implemented to drive operational

excellence. We continued to invest

in growth initiatives and strengthen

digital enablement and help achieve

the objective of enabling the business

using technology i.e.: Make people

productive, make processes efficient

and make product relevant. Acutely

aware of the impact that digitisation has

on operations, we are taking our digital

transformation journey to the next level

with our ongoing programme ‘Urja’.

Organisational

excellence:

Our

Company’s progress is rooted in the

skills and capabilities of our people. We

continued to invest in their development

by offering extensive opportunities for

learning through specially-designed

training

programmes.

Throughout

this pandemic, our foremost priority

has been the health and safety of

our employees. Apart from adopting

government and public health authority

guidelines, additional measures, such

as the installation of the MyShield

app to enable contact tracing and

monitoring of physical presence, were

put in place to support the health and

well-being of all our employees. We

also enabled them with technology

solutions so that they could work

remotely from their homes with safety.

In Closing

I want to thank all the people who

have helped Crompton succeed -

our consumers, channel partners,

suppliers, investors and employees,

and last but not the least, our

community. Crompton could not have

grown into the Company it is today

without your confidence and support.

While the pandemic has created near-

term challenges, we are well placed to

recover and deliver sustained value in

the years ahead.

Stay safe, stay well.

Sincerely,

Hemant Nerurkar

Chairman

I want to thank all

the people that help

to

make

CGCEL

successful

-

our

consumers, channel

partners, suppliers,

investors

and

employees, and last

but not the least, our

community.:

in respect of resource use (energy, water, raw

material, etc.) per unit of product (optional):

i)

Quantum series of pumps launched for residential

and agricultural applications have highest star

ratings given by BEE (5 Star) which has almost

40% more efficiency than normal ISI pump.

ii)

The Company launched an energy-efficient

range of Storage Water Heater which is designed

in such a way to get maximum 5 BEE star rated

product with proper insulation and better-quality

Thermostat for Temp sensing.

on energy bills for the consumer as compared

to 1 Star rated Storage Water Heater for their

respective capacity.

iv)

Star BEE rated SWH to move Instant water heater

consumers to Storage Water heater, which

results in saving of energy.

3. Procedures in place for sustainable sourcing

(including transportation) and percentage of inputs

sourced sustainably.
