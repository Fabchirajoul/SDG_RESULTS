Dear Shareholders,

It is a privilege to connect with you as

the newly appointed Chairman of Bosch

Limited. As I write to you, we continue

to be affected by the pandemic that

brought the entire world to a standstill

starting last year. While your health &

safety are of paramount importance,

this uniquely challenging crisis calls

for resilience and conviction. Our

thoughts remain with all those directly

and indirectly impacted as we continue

to stay strong and support the country

in its efforts to overcome pandemic

related challenges.

The COVID-19 pandemic overshadowed

all other major global events, including

the presidential election in the United

States during which we saw Joe Biden

take over the reign from Donald Trump;

post-Brexit changes, extreme weather

events, and various geopolitical

tensions around the world. As per the

World Bank, the global economy

will expand by 5.6 percent in 2021,

following a contraction of around

3.8 percent last year. The strongest

recovery will be seen in Asia and North

America. The downside is that for many

countries the economic output may

return to pre-pandemic levels only in

late 2022 or early 2023. The pace of

vaccination and strategy to tackle the

new COVID-19 variants worldwide will

play a key role in reviving the economy.

The Indian economy contracted

by 7.3 percent in FY 2020-21 as

the country battled the first wave

of COVID-19, against a 4 percent

growth in FY 2019-20. Many economic

reports indicate a reduction in India’s

growth projection from 11 percent

to 8-9 percent for FY 2021-22 in view

of the second wave of the pandemic.

After witnessing one of the most

stringent national lockdowns that

lasted close to two months, India

experienced a V-shape recovery;

however, the second wave has once

again impacted the country severely

with a sharp contraction in overall

economic activities. It will take longer

than anticipated to return to pre-

COVID levels and at Bosch India, we

are prepared to face these challenges

by staying invested in our employees,

prioritizing the nation’s needs and

focusing on our ‘Fit for Future’ strategy.

For us, change signals a need to

readjust our business models and

discover new opportunities, allowing us

to turn a headwind into a tailwind.

So, our response to important global

trends is:

▶ To climate change? Make our

company carbon neutral

▶ To the need for climate-neutral

mobility? Alternate powertrain

technologies

▶ To the pandemic? Rapidly growing

molecular diagnostics segment to

identify infectious diseases

▶ To the great strides China and the

US are making in the development of

IT and AI? Industrial AIoT by Bosch.

Our company’s vast domain expertise

and extensive product portfolio gives

us the ability to adapt to challenging

business environment with stability.

And we have demonstrated this during

a year of crisis. Globally, automotive

operations were impacted due to

disruption in supply chain and Bosch

extended complete support to all

partners and customers. Our Mobility

Solutions business is exploring

electromobility, automated driving, and

future electronics architectures. Robert

Bosch GmbH has further invested

~ Euro 700 million in emission-free

mobility and acquired electromobility-

related orders worth ~ Euro 20 billion

by the end of 2020. The Company

believes that 75% of new vehicles

will still have an ICE engine in 2030.

At Bosch Limited, the mobility

segment continued to make significant

contributions in our overall turnover

with large portions of revenues led

by the tractor segment. In the Beyond

Mobility businesses, we witnessed

an exponential growth in the Power

Tools division through our presence on

e-commerce platforms, which reiterates

our strategy to go digital. In one of

the toughest business years, Bosch

Limited was certified ‘Great Place

to Work’, a testimony to our people-

first strategy.

Furthermore, our sustainability

initiatives related to climate changes

are gaining momentum. With more

than 400 locations worldwide, we have

been certified carbon-neutral since

Q1 of 2020. We are now turning our

attention to assess the extent of CO2

emissions along our wide value chain.

We aim to push our product portfolio

towards energy efficiency or alternate

technology to continuously optimize the

use of energy across all our facilities by

2030. We endeavor to make a significant

contribution to climate action.

In the year 2022, Bosch reaches the

100-year milestone in India, and we

find ourselves motivated to be at the

helm of transformation as a technology

company. And while doing this we are

constantly focused on competitiveness

and cost structures. We are addressing

the challenges of the year ahead with

resilience and optimism. Our values,

strategies, and actions are aligned, to

pave the way for a company that is fit

for the future.

We continue to hope for your safety and

well-being during these trying times.

Be safe and best regards,

Markus Bamberger

The grief that many

of us are having to

“: Dear Shareholders,

The year was certainly the toughest

time in our lives, and I hope you and

your loved ones are well and safe.

The onset of COVID-19 pandemic in

2020 along with consequent rapid

resurgence in 2021 continue to bring

in unique challenges in our personal

as well as professional lives. The grief

that many of us are having to bear, the

pain of seeing loved ones suffer, the

India battles COVID-19

The financial year 2020-21 marked the

impact of pandemic with a national

lockdown for almost two months.

While India did experience a sharp

recovery in the second half of FY

2020-21, the overall sentiment was

highly cautious. The country was yet

again affected by the second wave

of COVID-19 pandemic only to have

much worse impact than the first

wave. India witnessed an alarming

spike in COVID-19 infections clocking

more than 4 lakh cases in a day in the

month of May 2021 alone. According

to the recent data released by the

Government of India in May 2021, the

country’s Gross Domestic Product

(GDP) contracted by 7.3 percent in

2020-21. India’s economy is likely to

rebound by about 8-9 percent in FY

2021- 22 over a low base with the

onset of the second wave which is

lesser than earlier estimates.

As I write to you, about 300 million

people have been inoculated with

at least one dose which is ~20% of

Indian population. The normalization

of the economy will be aided by the

acceleration of COVID-19 vaccination

drives. We appreciate government’s

intent on supporting industry and

the announcements in the Central

Budget 2021. Additionally, a host of

policies and reforms undertaken by

the Government of India will give a

boost to the Indian economy. Among

these, the government’s Production

Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme with an

investment of ~INR 550 billion along

with other initiatives under Atmanirbhar

Bharat have added buoyancy to the auto

sector with an increased focus on local

value addition in manufacturing.

We appreciate the government’s

intent on supporting industry and

the announcements in the Central

Budget 2021.

Balancing the instability

India and the automotive market

witnessed a substantial V-shaped

recovery. While the bulk of it can be

attributed to the pent-up demand,

it can now reasonably be said that

the economy picked up pace faster

than anticipated at the end of 2020.

For Bosch Limited, the recovery

was led specifically by the Tractor

segment that saw a 27 percent

growth in FY 2020-21. The three-

wheeler sales, however, declined

as the shared mobility space was

impacted on account of pandemic

control measures. The two-wheeler

and passenger cars segment saw

reasonable growth while the LCV,

HCV remained affected throughout

the financial year. With increase in

severity during the second wave, there

is a visible uncertainty in the market

and our mobility driven revenues

have been severely impacted. The

supply chain is in upheaval due to

multiple factors, such as the global

semiconductor crisis, localized

lockdowns, oxygen shortage and

workforce unavailability leading to

the CSR Committee, implementation plan and reporting

framework.

Some of the key CSR initiatives during the year under

review include the following:

1. Combating COVID and other continuing projects:

Combating COVID-19 was the major focus of the

Company during the year. The support enabled the

upgradation of Primary Health Centers (PHCs) around

Bosch Plants at Jaipur, Chakan, Naganathapura and

Gangaikondan, making them more Covid-19 responsive.

Further, Covid-19 impacted needy families have been

supported in the areas of Livelihood, Skilling and Health;

migrants’ re-employment facilitated across India; and

training of paramedics undertaken. In addition, the

Company manufactured masks were distributed freely

to second-level Covid-19 warriors (police personnel,

municipal corporation employees, non-Covid hospital

staff) and other needy people. Apart from the above

support to combating Covid-19, a Government school

in Jaipur has been renovated. Two new Artisan Training

Centers were set up in Bangalore and Kanchipuram;

and primary and secondary School Teachers’ Capacity

Building program has also been initiated this year.

2. Collaboration and Partnerships:

The Company continues to build scalable and sustainable

CSR partnerships with like-minded organizations

for maximizing the impact of its social engagement

programs. On 2nd November 2020, the ‘Bosch-Art of

Living Skill Center’ was inaugurated at The Art of Living,

Bengaluru, which comprises a BRIDGE Center, Artisan

Center to offer training in modern carpentry, and a

Collaboration Center to facilitate multi-stakeholder

partnerships. Earlier, on 24th September 2020, the

Bosch CSR team participated in NHRD’s Virtual Thought

Leadership Meet led by the CHRO and detailed out by

CSR Head on our different CSR initiatives. India CSR

Summit held on 8th-9th of December 2020 included

Bosch participation in the virtual CEOs Forum, which

focused on ‘Leadership Perspective on Social Impact

through Business and CSR’ and in a panel discussion

titled ‘Aligning Industry-Academia Collaboration with

the New Education Policy-2020’. External bodies have

recognized our CSR efforts. Two awards given to BRIDGE

in 2020 included FICCI CSR Award for Livelihood & Skill

Development (presented by Shri. Anurag Singh Thakur,

Hon’ble Minister of State for Finance and Corporate

Affairs, Government of India) and the Grant Thornton

SABERA Award for “Enablement”.
