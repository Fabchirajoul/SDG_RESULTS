Dear Shareholders,

I am writing to you at a time when the world is witnessing the

second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Businesses are once again

feeling the heat with the uncertainty of restrictions and lockdowns

amid the rising number of cases. Like always, we are at the forefront

in fighting the war against COVID-19 by helping in whatever

capacity possible.

In FY 2020-21, the pandemic landed a severe blow to the hospitality

industry and IHCL is no exception. The positive news is that we

began the year well placed to sail through the crisis, with a strong

balance sheet and significant liquidity. In an uncertain environment

and with challenging industry dynamics, our top priorities were the

safety of our people and guests, and continuity of our operations.

And we were able to mitigate impact in both these areas with our

resilience, strict safety measures, high quality and diverse portfolio

of assets, robust financial position, a passionate workforce and an

experienced Board and management.

Performing in extraordinary times

Despite the difficult year, we registered a positive EBITDA of

₹14 Crores on a standalone basis. On a consolidated basis, our profit

after tax stood at ₹(720) Crores and EBITDA was ₹(197) Crores.

Our flagship brand Taj delivered robust performance as we have

continued to harness the power of our re-imagined multi-product,

multi-segment brandscape to transform IHCL from a hotels’ business

to a hospitality ecosystem. Our presence in the Eastern part of India

was strengthened with the signing of three Taj hotels, two in Kolkata

and one in Patna. Our new collection of hotels—SeleQtions with 16

hotels in its portfolio—accompanied by the expansion of amã Stays

& Trails with 38 properties, including those in the pipeline across

offbeat locations has allowed us to provide a value proposition to

customer segments across demographics. The repositioned Ginger

has seen strong growth and crossed a milestone of 75 hotels in our

portfolio. Ginger’s fresh take on redefining luxury and comfort has

been both pioneering and successful.

We continued our growth momentum in FY 2020-21 and were

recognised by HVS Anarock as the highest growth hospitality

company in India for the year. Our focus was on expanding our

footprint tenaciously. We signed 17 new hotels across brands

during the year, including Taj in Puri, (Odisha), Kolkata, Patna

and Shiroda (Maharashtra); Vivanta in Lucknow, Bangalore and

Hampi (Karnataka); a SeleQtions hotel in Tadoba Andhari Tiger

Reserve, Maharashtra; Ginger hotels in Chandigarh, Guwahati

(Assam), Aurangabad (Maharashtra) Bangalore, Cochin (Kerala)

and two Ginger guest houses in BKC Mumbai and Jamshedpur

(Jharkhand), among others. We believe that with every

crisis comes the opportunity to re-imagine and explore new

business avenues.

In response to the pandemic, we detailed a comprehensive

five-point mitigation strategy—R.E.S.E.T 2020—that will cater

to the rapidly changing market conditions, shifting government

policies and dynamic customer needs. It will also focus on re-

imagining business models, implementing various operational

excellence interventions required for safety and hygiene, revenue

enhancement, cost optimisation and financial prudence. This

has, most importantly, translated into the implementation of

enhanced safety and hygiene protocols. To assure our clients,

we launched a reinvigorated spirit of Tajness. Tajness – A

Commitment Restrengthened is our promise to provide the

heartfelt warmth of our signature hospitality strengthened with

the assurance of safety and hygiene.

We also explored new avenues of revenue growth through a

variety of innovations such as Hospitality@Home, the launch of

our F&B app – Qmin and curated guest offerings such as Dream,

Drive, Discover, Delight – a new offering which gives guests the

perfect opportunity to drive with families and friends to discover,

unwind, and be with the nature, among others. We also came

up with New Urban Getaways to encourage travellers to take a

short and much-needed break post the country-wide lockdown.

We accelerated the rollout of technology enhancements through

the launch of I-ZEST. With I-ZEST we leveraged digitalisation to

offer enhanced guest experiences, from pre-arrival to departure,

offering zero to minimal touch options through innovative

facilities such as digital pre-check-in registrations to contactless

guest access to their rooms via digital mobile key cards.

The performance of our hospitality brands has been perfectly

complemented by the healthy performance of our ancillary

service brands. The Chambers—Taj’s exclusive business club—

was relaunched with enhanced features. We have re-imagined

our F&B offerings with an exclusive partnership with AB InBev,

the world’s leading brewery, for an industry first on-site chain

of microbreweries.

With the initiatives outlined under R.E.S.E.T 2020, we are

confident of overcoming the challenges posed by COVID-19

and emerging stronger to continue our journey of

sustained excellence

Walking the talk of sustainability

Our commitment to aligning Environmental, Social and

Governance (ESG) measures to our business strategy and

objectives remains unwavering. We have set a global benchmark

for environmental sustainability with 78 EarthCheck certified

hotels, 47 of which have won the Platinum Certification, making

us the proud owners of the highest number of Earthcheck

Platinum certified hotels globally. Energy optimisation and

conservation is one of the focus areas and each hotel has defined

energy efficiency and emissions reduction targets.

Our strength and values as a Tata company are strongly reflected

in the humanitarian support that we have been able to humbly

extend to our immediate community during this crisis. Through

our disaster response vehicle, the Taj Public Service Welfare Trust

(TPSWT), we undertook various initiatives such as the COVID-19

Disaster Response, Taj for Family and Meals to Smiles. We opened

the doors of our properties to house medical staff so that they

can cut down on commute time, rest close to their place of work

and do not have to fear spreading the contagion at home. We

have also been providing nutritious meals to doctors and medical

staff at hospitals, as well as medical equipment and supplies. We

have not faced a crisis like this one before and are ready to do

whatever we can in humanity’s fight against this pandemic.

Looking ahead with optimism

2020 was a year that would not be forgotten easily. I want to

thank all those who remained committed to IHCL during these

challenging times. Our employees prioritised the safety and

convenience of the guests and remained steadfast and resolute

to making our guests’ experiences memorable even during this

adversity. Our other stakeholders have shown immense trust

and faith in us. Our solid focus on embracing best practices in the

environmental, social and governance domains will enable us to

create holistic value for all.

As we look ahead, we are full of hope and optimism. The rollout

of vaccines is extremely encouraging and, of course, vital to our

industry’s recovery, but we know it will take time. I am confident

that our business model and strategy, which builds on the

investments made in recent years to expand our brand portfolio

and enhance our ways of working, puts IHCL in a strong position

to outperform the industry as it returns to full strength.
