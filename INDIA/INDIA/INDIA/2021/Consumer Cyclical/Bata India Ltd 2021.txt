Mr. Rajeev Gopalakrishnan, holds a Bachelor's in

Mechanical Engineering from the University of

Kerala. He joined Bata Shoe Organisation (BSO) in

the year 1990, and has since been associated with

the company. With a rich experience of 31 years, he

has previously handled the positions of the Director

of Wholesale Channels, Sales & Marketing with Bata

International-Canada, and the Vice President of Bata

India Limited in Retail Operations and Wholesale

Division. Before joining as the: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

First and foremost, I hope and pray that you and your

family are safe. Past ﬁfteen months have been very

challenging times for all of us, on both personal and

professional fronts. It has tested human capabilities

like never before - nimbleness, resilience, and

responsiveness to name a few. My heart goes out to

everyone who has sufered the terrible loss of a loved

one, and I pray for a speedy recovery of those still

battling the virus.

I would also like to express my immense gratitude to

each one of you who stood by us and continued to

support us as we grappled with one of the worst

calamities in human history. The ongoing pandemic

has only reinforced the value of human life.

At Bata India, this period has once again proved

strengths that all our stakeholders bring to us - be it

employees, vendors, customers and of course, the

shareholders including the sponsors. Our employees

stood like true Corona warriors, and came forward at

the availability of slightest window of opportunity.

They showed exemplary courage and determination.

Your Company remained steadfast in its resolve to

ensure best eforts and practices for the health and

well-being of our employees. My heartfelt thanks to

all the stakeholders and in particular, the employees

and vendors.

Our resilience built on their passionate and strong

commitment was visible in the strong recovery

witnessed during the last quarter of the year 2020 as

we could restart our operations much faster than

expected. But the second wave shook the country

even harder. Expectedly, revenues for the year

remained subdued due to marked decline in demand

for formal wear but your Company’s conﬁdence on

the path forward remains high.

Bata Shoe Organisation (BSO), the founder and

parent entity, has been guided by a strong set of

beliefs right from the time it was founded in 1894.

BSO has navigated and weathered the World’s

biggest crisis, including Great Depression and two

World Wars in its journey of 127 years.

As a Group, we have always strived ahead with

passion in face of disasters and emerged victorious

with our agility, resilience, adaptability, and proactive

approach. India experienced one of the strictest

lockdowns towards the end of March 2020, and all

our stores, factories and ofces were shut for close

to two months. We quickly adapted, re-oriented and

re-calibrated all our resources towards devising a

comprehensive strategy for the future. New ways of

working were adopted with digital applications,

online trainings, and innovative solutions to ensure

business continuity.

Newer areas for growth including omni channels and

Bata Store-on-Wheels remained in focus. We

undertook strategic initiatives to allow customers to

shop from the comfort of their homes via Bata

ChatShop and Bata Store-on-Wheels. We invested in

new technologies in various areas like ticketing

solutions, contact centre partner, e-commerce

related processes to improve customer experience

and satisfaction. Our e-commerce and Market Place

presence has signiﬁcantly widened during the year,

with our digitally enabled channels contributing to

about 15% of our total sales.:

Dear Shareholders,

The ﬁnancial year 2020-21 was undoubtedly one of

the toughest years we have had to face. However, like

a lighthouse, we stood strong and determined in the

face of adversity, staying true to our ethos of

resilience, agility and ingenuity. As an organisation

that has weathered the worst of storms in human

history,

we

resolutely

continued

serving

our

customers with the same passion and helping the

society at large in its ﬁght against Covid.

The closure of malls and high street stores triggered

by lockdown led to our sales taking a severe hit. As a

result, it became paramount for us to employ

cash-saving measures. Owing to astute planning and

cohesive

collaboration,

your

Company

was

successful in saving more than INR 100 Crores on

account

of

rent

negotiations,

vendor

cost

negotiations and consolidating ofce spaces. We

also

implemented

‘Project

Thrive’

to

reduce

dependency on imports and shifted to local

sourcing. Owing to ‘Project Refuel’, a product

COGS-saving initiative, we were able to save over

INR 7 Crores during 2021.

As the lockdown was lifted and the economy began

showing signs of recovery in June, we prioritised the

safety and well-being of our customers and

employees over everything else. We equipped all our

stores with sanitisers, gloves, masks, dispensers and

quarantine boxes for shoes. We also conducted

extensive training for our staf and prepared a

detailed 20-point checklist to ascertain that the

safety

guidelines

were

strictly

adhered

to.

Our dedicated on-ground teams worked tirelessly to

ensure Bata stores were one of the ﬁrst to reopen

post the lockdown.

Adapting to the consumers’ changed needs, your

company rolled out a slew of measures and scaled

up omni-channel initiatives. We segmented our

consumers in three categories - Digital Natives,

Digital

Adopters

and

Digital

Novices,

and

accordingly customised solutions for them. For

Digital Natives, we scaled up our website, bata.in, to

include newer styles and choices, and expanded our

presence across online marketplaces, while also

strengthening our home delivery services to provide

a seamless remote and safe shopping experience.

We launched Bata ChatShop for Digital Adopters

which allows them to locate three nearest stores,

chat and video call with our store managers through

WhatsApp and get the desired products delivered at

their doorstep. For the Digital Novices like the

elderly, homemakers & children, we set up mobile

kiosks called Bata Store-on-Wheels in residential

localities to ofer a safe and convenient shopping

experience. These measures proved incremental in

reviving overall sales and helped us in charting out a

path for recovery.

As the sales through digital channels grew, so did

the interactions with the contact centre & social

channels for delivery, returns & refund status. We

scaled up customer experience for digital shoppers

by launching a ticketing service to track every:
