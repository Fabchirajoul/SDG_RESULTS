Dear Shareholders,

The year gone by: The previous year has been amongst the

most challenging to-date, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing

a scale of suffering that is hard to comprehend. In some parts of

the world, including India, the situation has deteriorated further

in recent months.

The swiftness and intensity of the second

and third waves have overwhelmed health

systems, devastated lives and livelihoods.

It is a health crisis of the kind we have not

seen in generations. My heart goes out to

everyone out there who has suffered the loss

of loved ones. Given the scientific progress we

have made over the past year, I am confident

we will eventually get the pandemic under

control. Until then, I urge you to stay safe,

follow Covid discipline, and get vaccinated if

you are eligible.

For your Company Tata Motors too, it was

a challenging year. The pandemic resulted

in muted consumer demand along with

disruptions in production, supply chain and

retail networks. I mentioned in my last year’s

report that against this volatile backdrop,

your Company is charting out a disciplined

path towards a robust and resilient future.

Accordingly, the Company’s key focus areas

were:- securing the safety of our people; the

viability of the ecosystem; and securing the

health of the business through a laser focus

on cash flows. This helped us navigate the

crisis well. Gradually, as demand started

coming back from the second quarter of

last year, the company swiftly shifted gear,

significantly ratcheted up capacities, moved

fast to serve customer demand and ended the

year on a strong note.

The resilient performance of the company

is reflected in the business improving its

EBIT margins by 260bps to ` 6,471crore

and Auto Free Cash Flows of ` 5,317crore

despite its volumes declining by 10.3% to

902,648 units and revenues declining by 4%

to ` 2,49,795crore.

India business: The domestic business of Tata

Motors scaled up capacity by proactively

addressing several supply chain bottlenecks

while maintaining the health, safety, and

wellbeing of our employees as well as the

supporting ecosystem. As a result, the

domestic business grew volumes by 2%,

revenues by 7% and improved its EBIT

margins by 370bps with a strong cash flow

of ` 2,730crore.

Our Passenger Vehicles segment was the

standout performer during the year. The

shift to personal mobility and preference for

our ‘New Forever’ range of cars and SUVs

led to the PV business recording its highest

ever annual sales in 8 years and growing its

market share to 8.2%. The “Reimagine PV”

strategy to rejuvenate front-end sales and the

retailer network network as well as customer

engagement, has delivered excellent results.

Within this, the performance of the EV

business is noteworthy. We strengthened

our market leadership to 71.4% led by sales

of more than 4000 Nexon EV units since its

launch last year.

The CV business posted sequential

quarter on quarter growth on the back of

improved consumer sentiment, buoyancy

in E-Commerce, firming freight rates and

higher infrastructure demand. The new BS

VI range of vehicles have been well accepted

in the market. We continue to improve our

market shares in M&HCV to 58.1% (+410

bps vs FY 18), ILCV 45.9% (+90bps vs FY

18). Disappointingly, our SCV market shares

was 37.5%, losing 250bps vs FY 18. We

are committed to get back to winning in this

segment and are taking concerted actions on

this front. The launch of Tata Intra, Yodha BS

VI, Ace Petrol are steps in this direction.

JLR: Jaguar Land Rover also delivered a

resilient performance during the year. Despite

a 14% drop in revenue to £19.7billion, the

business improved its EBIT margins by

250bps to 2.6% and generated positive free

cash flows of £185m. Retail sales declined

14% for the year with China being the

exception growing at a strong 23%. The all

new Land Rover Defender was a standout

performer clocking a robust 45.2K units for

the full year as well as winning the 2021

Word Car Design of the Year. Its financial and

market performance notwithstanding, Jaguar

Land Rover made a critical contribution to the

Tata Group’s worldwide efforts to help our

communities and our people by producing

protective visors for the frontline health care

workers, loaning JLR vehicles to the Red

Cross and Red Crescent to aid the COVID

efforts and many more.

During the year, we had a smooth CEO

transition, during which Mr Thierry Bollore

took over as the CEO of Jaguar Land Rover

from Professor Sir Ralf Speth. I would like to

thank Ralf for his invaluable contributions to

the company over the last decade. Under his

leadership, Jaguar Land Rover has become a

differentiated luxury OEM with iconic brands

like Jaguar, Land Rover, and Range Rover, a

talent base that is world class and a set of

skills and capabilities that will serve us well

for the future. Under Thierry’s leadership,

Jaguar Land Rover has now unveiled its

Reimagine strategy to make the company a

world leader in electrified luxury vehicles,

sustainability, manufacturing efficiency and

new automotive technologies.

Outlook and Our plans: In the near term,

the impact of the pandemic is expected

to gradually recede as more people get

vaccinated. We expect demand to remain

strong with consumer preferences shifting

further towards personal mobility. However,

the supply situation is expected to be

adversely impacted for the next few months

due to disruptions from COVID-19 lockdowns

in India and semi-conductor shortages

worldwide. Due to this, we anticipate a

gradual improvement in performance during

the year. The business has demonstrated

steadfast resilience in the face of adversity

last year and has strengthened its

fundamentals. This track record gives me the

confidence that the business will continue to

build on its turnaround last year and deliver

an even stronger performance in the coming

years.

Over the longer term we anticipate

significant changes in consumer behaviour

— from demanding more integrated digital

experiences to prioritising health and safety

features across purchasing decisions. The

urge to break free and have the freedom to

move without fear or restrictions will shape

future demand for passenger vehicles.

Globally, greater emphasis and scrutiny

will be placed on building environmental

sustainability and climate resilience into the

very core of business models.

To address and leverage these mega trends,

we plan to make sustainable business

models a bedrock of our strategy. At the

Tata Group we would like to be amongst the

world-leaders on sustainability. As a large

and diverse conglomerate based in India,

but with a global footprint, we are uniquely

positioned for this leadership. Our companies

are present in 150 countries, we employ over

750,000 people and touch the lives of 650

million consumers. I will be the first to say

that we have a long journey ahead of us. But

we are clear that this is the right journey we

must undertake and have begun with pushing

targets forward.

Tata Motors Group is in the process of pivoting

its underlying business model towards

sustainable mobility. Jaguar Land Rover is

targeting 100% zero tail pipe emissions for the

portfolio it sells by 2036. Jaguar will become

fully electric by 2025. 60% of Jaguar Land

Rover’s volumes will be pure BEV vehicles by

2030. In India, EV penetration in our portfolio

has now doubled to 2% this year and we

expect penetration to increase exponentially

in the coming years. Tata Motors will lead

this change in the Indian market. By 2025,

Tata Motors will have 10 new BEV vehicles

and as a Group we will invest proactively

to set up charging infrastructure across

the country. In addition, the Tata Group is

actively exploring partnerships in cell and

battery manufacturing in India and Europe

to secure our supplies of batteries. We are

also evaluating an automotive software and

engineering vertical within the Group that will

help us lead in a new world of connected and

autonomous vehicles. We are clear that this

shift to sustainable mobility is an idea whose

time has come, and the Tata Group will move

forward with speed and scale to seize this

and proactively drive the change in consumer

behaviour in India and beyond.

In summary: With these moves, Tata Motors

will be well placed to meet the opportunities

that arise from these fundamental shifts. Your

company will be the torch-bearer for green

mobility in the automotive world and create a

virtuous cycle of growth and returns for our

shareholders too. This exciting journey opens

a new frontier, and I would like to welcome

you on this journey.

Before I end, I would like to take this

opportunity to thank all our employees and

their families for their profound contributions

in these trying times. I would also like to thank

you shareholders for your continued trust,

confidence, and support in the coming years.

Resilience and Rebound

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

In September 2020 it was my privilege to

become Chief Executive Officer of Jaguar

Land Rover.

My view of the company from afar was always

one of uniqueness, of Britishness, and of

immense brand equity. From inside, the clarity

of that view is even sharper.

Nobody could have anticipated the tragic

events of the past year. I’m deeply proud of

our people and the way we worked together

to support our communities throughout the

year. The tremendous resilience of my Jaguar

Land Rover colleagues is truly inspiring.

Even without the impacts of COVID-19, the

business faced challenges that could be

considered major risks. However, the pathway

navigated during the final two quarters is

evidence of our fundamentally strong, re-

emerging business.

Of course, there are still many hurdles to

overcome, including the current global

shortage of semiconductors, but we now

have a clear view of the road ahead with our

Reimagine strategy; a future of modern luxury

by design.

Reimagine allows us to confidently transform

the business and its distinct brands, to over

satisfy our customers, and reward both our

investors and our people.

We will simplify our architecture strategy

and reorganise our manufacturing footprint,

placing quality and sustainability at the heart

of everything we do. We are now becoming

a more agile organisation that plays to our

human-centric strengths.

We will create a knowledge-sharing

collaborative ecosystem with the very

best partners in global industry to leapfrog

forward in clean energy, software, and

digitalisation.

Jaguar Land Rover will focus on value

creation through a profit-over-volume

approach. Our goal is to deliver double-digit

EBIT margin and become one of the world’s

most profitable luxury manufacturers.

Reimagine will see us journey towards net

zero carbon by 2039. Both our brands will be

transformed by electrification, with six new

all-electric Land Rover models in the next five

years and Jaguar completely reimagined as a

pure electric brand, from 2025.

Reimagine is our clear strategy. Driving it

forward is our Refocus programme, which

will generate sustainable, long-term value

through operational excellence.

To help deliver our vision, we have created

four new roles on the Jaguar Land Rover

Limited Board of Directors during the last

financial year.

Nigel Blenkinsop joins as Executive

Director of Company Quality & Customer

Satisfaction; Dave Owen oversees a new

Supply Chain function; and Nick Collins

assumes responsibility for all programme

development and product lifecycles, as

Vehicle Programmes lead.

Finally, to reinforce the importance of

carefully curated brand values and design

excellence in the success of modern luxury,

Professor Gerry McGovern joins the Jaguar

Land Rover Limited Board of Directors for

both brands as Chief Creative Officer.

Ultimately, our will is to become the creator

of the world’s most desirable luxury vehicles

and products, for the most discerning of

customers.

Our plan is not to catch up; our plan is to lead.

Best regards,

Mr. Thierry Bolloré

Gaydon, UK, May 18, 2021

Reimagine will see us

brands will be transformed

CEO, Jaguar Land Rover

TML CEO and MD’s Message

Resilience and rebound in every step

Plan to protect the interests of our business,

customers, dealers and suppliers and to ensure

a swift bounce back as the situation improves.

Further, we are organising vaccination camps

at our plants and offices for eligible employees

and their family members to get conveniently

vaccinated.

We used the pandemic to accelerate our

transformation agenda for enhancing the

organisation’s agility and resilience to avail

forthcoming opportunities:

Redefining Mobility – We used the mandate to

migrate to BS VI norms to transcend beyond just

emission compliance and set new paradigms of

safety, design, quality, connectivity, comfort and

performance in our vehicles.

Optimising More for Less – To offer more choice

to customers, we successfully leveraged the

power of modularity and commonalities to build

scale, reduce complexity and costs, introduce

more products in shorter time span, and improve

overall engineering efficiency.

Embracing ‘Bridgital’ – With digital becoming

the new language to engage with customers, a

smart micro market strategy complementing a

deft product strategy enabled better customer

outreach and engagement.

In PV, the growing preference for our ‘New

Forever’ range of cars and SUVs and rising

popularity of EVs led the business to achieve its

highest ever annual sales in 8-years. Further, the

launch of the ‘Altroz i-Turbo’, the iconic ‘Safari’ in

an all new avatar and other forthcoming vehicles

endorses our commitment to enhance presence

in the faster growing market segments.

The unveiling of an entire CV portfolio (SCV, ILCV

and MHCV) with customised solutions to address

industry specific applications announced our

intent to redefine transportation. While the

ultra-sleek ‘T.Series’ range established fresh

benchmarks in urban and semi urban freight

transportation, the ‘Intra V30’ launch set a new

standard for last mile delivery amongst SCVs.

During this unprecedented fiscal, we delivered

a healthy increase across key metrics – volume,

revenue, cost reduction and profitability. Our

intense efforts resulted in better than expected

cash savings of ` 9,300 crore, positive free

cash flows of ` 2,730 crore after interest and

improvement in EBIT margin by 370bps despite a

weak first quarter.

As the future often demands a different approach

from the past, we have a set of high impact

programmes underway aligned with key trends

shaping the auto industry of tomorrow.

Future is Digital – Building on the early

successes and learnings, we are now ideally

poised to take the big leap in our digital journey

to transform customer experience and provide a

range of solutions for the entire ecosystem.

Future is Connected – Spotting this trend early,

we have successfully developed a proprietary

Connected Vehicle Platform. This customisable,

scalable and adaptable platform is being

effectively deployed across our range of smart

and connected vehicles. It has received acclaim

from customers for providing meaningful

insights and easy to use features.

Future is Collaborative – We are refreshing

our culture fundamentals and institutionalising

benefits of working in purpose driven cross

functional teams to build trust and transparency.

Advances in technology are enabling us

collaborate seamlessly across the value chain to

deliver richer experiences.

Future is Green – As the leader in the electric

car market, we are focussed on accelerating the

adoption, access and use of environment friendly

EVs. We are equally committed to strengthening

our presence in the electric commercial vehicle

domain across segments.

With these programmes, we are well positioned

for the times ahead. Our emphasis remains on

enhancing sales momentum, growing market

share, maintaining leadership in sustainable

mobility and delivering cash accretive growth.

I take this opportunity to express my deepest

appreciation for all my colleagues and their

families for their inspiring contribution amidst

this difficult time. I also thank you for your

continuing trust, support and commitment to

Tata Motors.

Ramsau am Dachstein, Austria, May 18, 2021: Dear Shareholders,

I hope this letter finds you well and in good

health.

Financial Year 2020-21 will be remembered as

the year of COVID-19. With lockdowns and large

scale disruptions across the world, survival

and wellbeing rightfully became the foremost

priority.

Tata Motors too was severely impacted but we

resolved to emerge stronger by improving our

market, operational and financial performance –

a tough ask that was diligently fulfilled.

We took immediate measures to keep our

people safe and protect their health. In the

absence of any prior blueprint to manage such

a crisis, we designed a comprehensive Business

Continuity Plan that was purposefully executed

by empowered, local cross-functional teams.

Our ecosystem inclusive approach to calibrate

shutdown, restart and revival, enabled fast track

recovery and delivered sequential quarter on

quarter growth.

The ongoing second wave of the pandemic has

once again resulted in multiple lockdowns in

Q1FY 22. Experienced from the past year, we

are implementing a holistic Business Agility
