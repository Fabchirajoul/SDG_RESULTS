Dear Stakeholders,

We have all experienced a unique and challenging

year. The COVID-19 pandemic brought in its wake a

lot of disruption and uncertainty that affected every

aspect of life. However, at Welspun, we were guided

by our principles and values while responding to these

challenges.

FY21 has been a landmark year for Welspun. We have

touched the $1 billion mark in our annual revenue,

the highest ever for our Company. This has been

possible because of committed team work, and I

take this opportunity to express my gratitude to my

team members for their resilience, dedication and

unparalleled efforts that helped the Company navigate

the unprecedented challenges of past year.

Industry-leading safety protocol

As you are aware, we have implemented industry-

leading operating procedures to combat COVID-19

and safeguard our employees. Our Penta Protocol and

Intertek Protek standards and procedures, together

with the WelHeal app, secured the health, safety and

well-being of all our employees and service providers.

These not only helped us maintain business continuity,

but also respond to the needs of our customers through

product innovation and adding muscle to our digital

capabilities. With our formalised COVID care measures,

we are better equipped to deal with the challenges of

the future.

Setting new performance records

The relentless efforts of each and every member

of Welspun has helped our organisation overcome

difficulties over the past year. As a result, we have been

able to bring down the curtains on FY21 with a robust

set of numbers.

Our Total Income stood at `74,080 million compared

to `68,362 million last year, registering a YoY growth

of 8.4%; EBITDA at `14,198 million as against `13,098

million in FY20 saw a YoY increase of 8.4%. PAT for the

year was `5,397 million, which is around 1.06x that of

previous year’s PAT of `5,074 million, and our Net Worth

stood at `36,447 million. I am happy to report that Net

Debt of core business has reduced by 46% in the last

three years along with a continuous improvement in

ROCE. FY21 also saw a significant 2.8x rise in Free Cash

Flow (FCF) and continuous pay-out through dividend/

buyback.

Making the best of opportunities

We know that India is best positioned in the textiles

segment to unlock the next wave of growth, and

a focus on man-made fibres and technical textiles

could reap substantial dividends. The pandemic has

also positioned India well in the emerging scenario,

with retailers towards it in a bid to diversify their

supply chain. Emerging businesses delivered strong

performance during the year and global e-commerce

sales contributed 6% to the topline. Besides, our cost

rationalisation initiatives, the growing share of value-

added products in the product mix, and improved

efficiency across all functions helped us deliver a

strong performance.

The pandemic saw a shift in the consumption pattern

towards online spending, and we adapted to this

change by introducing Project WAVE to accelerate our

e-commerce growth, Welspun Carrefour Blockchain to

strengthen our traceability system, introduced a virtual

showroom and revamped our brands WelHome and

Christy to make these products and services available

to a broader range of customers.
