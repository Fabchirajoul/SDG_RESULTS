Dear Shareholders,

It has been an unprecedented year

and a half for the entire world as

nations struggled to come to terms

with the circumstances created

by

the

COVID-19

pandemic.

Economies have been in turmoil

and governments have had the

unenviable task of managing the

fiscal situation amidst incessant

Covid waves. India has been no

exception. At CEAT too normal

business activity was challenged

by the frequent lockdowns and

restrictions on operations. However,

yet again our people adapted well to

the situation and the resilience of the

company was proven again with an

improved performance and robust

balance sheet ratios despite the

adverse first quarter.

CEAT has been sensitive to the

needs of its customers, its people

and the entire eco-system including

the communities around it. Their

safety and wellbeing has been a

top priority for the company. We

extended significant support in India’s

fight against Covid through various

interventions including supply of

critical equipment and infrastructure.

In order to cope with the new scenario,

CEAT leveraged digital technologies

to transform business processes at

a fast pace. The Company has taken

an omnichannel approach to cater

to customers by making several

services available online. CEAT is

now channelising Research and

Development capabilities to develop

niche

competencies,

introduce

indigenous sources of raw materials

and develop tyres with newer

technologies.

To create a resilient and sustainable

future, CEAT has sharpened focus

on ESG practices including a target

to reduce carbon footprint by 50% by

2030. CEAT has continued to move

forward strongly in terms of emission

reduction, water conservation, zero

effluent discharge, plastic waste

management

and

solar

power

adoption across its offices and

factories.

CEAT will continue to strive towards

excellence and sustainable growth.

The pandemic has emphasized even

more that each of our actions have

an impact on the future of the planet

and mankind. It further strengthens

our resolve and our belief of ‘Making

Mobility Safer & Smarter. Every Day.’

H.V. Goenka

Chairman

Our people adapted

well to the situation

and the resilience

of the Company

was proven again

with an improved

performance and

robust balance

sheet ratios

despite the adverse

first quarter.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW:

Dear Shareholders,

The year gone by was unprecedented

in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It brought in a need to focus on all our

stakeholders’ needs - employees,

customers, suppliers and the society

at large – beyond shareholders. The

actions that are taken in difficult times

are what reflect the character of a

company or an individual and it gives

me pride that our Values and Purpose

were our guiding light during these

times of uncertainty.

To overcome the hurdles posed by the

pandemic, CEAT focused on six Cs -

Care for people, Customer centricity,

Cash management, Cost optimisation,

Changes in business models and

Community

engagement.

The

Company demonstrated agility in its

actions and emerged as a company

with a heart to all its stakeholders.

CEAT’s overall performance has been

robust, with the Company generating

the highest ever consolidated revenue

of H 7,610 Crores. CEAT’s consolidated

business EBITDA for the year was

H 1,019 Crores with margin of 13.4%.

CEAT’s top priority this year has been

to take care of its people. During these

challenging times, both physical and

emotional wellbeing of our people

and their families was of utmost

importance. A dedicated hotline was

set up to provide personalised physical

wellbeing advice to employees by the

Chief Fitness Officer. The Company

tied up with Juno Clinic for mental

health counselling to employees.

In its factories, CEAT adhered to all

safety protocols to ensure safety of

its people. When the COVID-19 cases

arose, every individual went out of

their way to help each other in terms

of finding hospital beds, medication,

oxygen or even offer financial and

emotional support.

CEAT also continued its efforts to

improve the diversity in workforce,

particularly on recruiting and nurturing

the talent of marginalised groups

such as differently abled individuals.

Its overall efforts towards unleashing

talent and empowerment has resulted

in improving its Great Place to Work®

rank to 33, two positions up from the

previous year.

It was as much our responsibility to

help out communities and society at

large. We carried out various outreach

programs

such

as

sanitisation

of trucks and support to migrant

workers. We also identified different

ways to support India’s healthcare

infrastructure by donating ventilators

to hospitals and nursing homes and

provide essentials such as Personal

Protective Equipment (‘PPE’) kits,

masks, gloves and hot meals. CEAT

also worked on setting up Fever clinics

in rural Maharashtra, where access to

healthcare was difficult.

The Research and Development team

of CEAT has achieved a milestone in

filing of over 100 patent applications

as on date. We would continue to

invest in technologies for future and

are confident to make further progress

in this domain.

Digitisation is changing the world

and CEAT aspires to be at the

forefront of digital innovation. All the

manufacturing

facilities

of

CEAT,

have

been

supplemented

with

digital solutions that help optimise

supply

chain

and

manufacturing

practices, in support of the Total

Quality Management (‘TQM’) methods

of functioning. CEAT expanded its

presence in e-commerce platforms.

In addition to the appointment based

pick up and drop, these digital

channels offered various new modes

of product delivery and at home

fitment. As customer preferences

changed towards being at home or

towards increased hygiene, CEAT

offered

sanitisation

services

and

touchless

services

keeping

their

safety as its utmost priority.

The pandemic also posed challenges

on our entire supply chain since the

lockdown was imposed and business

operations were halted across the

country. Volatility in raw material

supplies was experienced throughout

this period. We, however, with strong

relationships and synergies within

the internal functions and external

stakeholders, worked closely with our

vendor partners to ensure consistent

supplies to our customers.

Sustainability is a vital part of CEAT’s

efforts and is demonstrated through

our Vision ‘To reduce carbon footprint

by 50% by 2030’. Various initiatives

have been taken up like shift towards

renewable

energy

by

increasing

solar as a source of power in its

manufacturing

plants,

developing

tyres for electric vehicles with use of

sustainable raw materials like reused

rubber and silica and working towards

replacing plastic-based packaging

materials with sustainable alternatives.

Sustainability is no longer a choice in

CEAT. We are committed to giving

back to the earth and ensuring that

our planet is better than we inherited it.

We believe doing good is an essential

part of doing well. As we continue

our journey of ‘Making Mobility Safer

& Smarter’. Every Day.’ we hope to

mature further to reflect our values and

efforts in promoting quality thinking

through this second Integrated Report.

Affirmation that the remuneration is as per the

remuneration policy of the Company;

Remuneration paid during the FY 2020-21 was as per the

Nomination and Remuneration Policy of the Company.

Notes:

(1) Median remuneration of the employees is calculated on the basis of remuneration details of employees including the: Managing Director and the Whole-time Director. The reduction in the median remuneration of employees for FY 2020-21

over the previous financial year is mainly due to increase in the number of associates.

(2) Directors’ remuneration includes commission and sitting fees for FY 2020-21. While Commission is determined based

on the contribution and tenure served by Non-executive Directors during the year, the sitting fees are paid based on the

number of meetings of Board and Committees attended by them respectively. Therefore, variation in the remuneration of

the Directors could be attributed to the committee positions held and the number of meetings attended by them during

the year.

(3) Ms. Priya Nair was appointed as an Additional Independent Director w.e.f. October 27, 2020 and therefore comparable

amount of remuneration was not applicable for determination of percentage increase / decrease in the remuneration.

(4) Ms. Punita Lal resigned as an Independent Director of the Company w.e.f. January 20, 2021.

years effective from August 12, 2020 to August 11,

2025 at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) held on

September 10, 2020.

Board Meetings and Governance

The Board meets at regular intervals to discuss and

decide on Company / business policy and strategy

apart from other statutory matters as required to be

deliberated and approved by the Board. The Board /

Committee Meetings (‘Meetings’) are pre-scheduled

and a tentative annual calendar of the Meetings is

circulated to the Directors well in advance to facilitate

them to plan their schedule and to ensure meaningful

participation in the Meetings. However, in case of

a special and urgent business need, the Board’s

approval is taken by passing resolutions by circulation,

as permitted by law, which are noted and confirmed in

the subsequent Board Meeting.

The notice of Meetings are given well in advance to

all the Directors. Owing to difficulties involved due to

COVID-19 pandemic and pursuant to relaxation granted

by Ministry of Corporate Affairs (‘MCA’) via Circular dated

March 24, 2020 and further notifications dated June 23,

2020, September 28, 2020 and December 30, 2020,

all the Meetings of the Company were held through

video / tele-conferencing facilities allowing seamless

participation in the Meeting. The Agenda relating to

the Meeting is circulated a week prior to the date of the

Meeting in compliance with the provisions of the Act and

Secretarial Standard-1 issued by the Institute of Company

Secretaries of India (‘ICSI’). The Board Agenda includes

an Action Taken Report comprising of actions emanating

from the Board Meetings and status updates thereof.

The Management endeavours to provide the Board with

sufficient information apart from the items as mandated for

discussion by the Board under Regulation 17(7) read with

Part A of Schedule II to the Listing Regulations. Through

various information being placed or presented at the

Board Meetings, the Board is kept well informed about

the overall functioning of the Company, which enables

the Board to contribute to the growth of the Company and

helps them to take informed decisions. Prior approval from

the Board is obtained for circulating the agenda items with

shorter notice for matters that form part of the Board and

Committee Agenda and are considered to be in the nature

of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information.

The Board periodically reviews the updates on the projects,

business performance, risk management, strategies,

people, processes, compliance with applicable laws and

other key affairs of the Company having impact on the

business. The Board is satisfied that plans are in place for

orderly succession for appointment to the Board and to

Senior Management Personnel.

The Agenda of the Meetings is set by the Company

Secretary in consultation with the Chairman, Managing

Director and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The

Company Secretary is responsible for collation, review

and distribution of all papers submitted to the Board and

Committees thereof for consideration. The Company

Secretary attends all the Meetings of the Board and its

Committees to assist the Board and its Committees on

Compliance and Governance principles and ensures

appropriate recording of minutes of the Meetings.

The adoption of a digital application has enabled the

Company to conduct paperless Meetings, thereby

improving governance while simplifying the process of

conducting such Meetings. This involves conducting

the Meetings efficaciously, with the Board being able

to access information directly on their digital devices.

The application meets high standards of security and

integrity that are required for storage and transmission

of Board / Committee Agenda and pre-reads in

electronic form.

The Independent Directors of the Company have also

appreciated the quality, quantity and timeliness of flow of

information between the Company Management and the

Board, that is necessary for the Board to effectively and

reasonably perform their duties.

Risk Management Policy of the Company with

respect to Commodities and Forex

Volatility in commodity prices are managed by

combining a robust price forecast mechanism with

a buying model comprising of spot buying, forward

buying and strategic long-term contracts. Inventory

levels are maintained in alignment to this. Since

significant quantum of raw materials are procured from

international sources, appropriate hedging mechanisms

are in place to insulate forex fluctuations.

The Company manages the volatility in the foreign

currency prices through hedging mechanisms. The

exposure risk arises primarily due to the import and

export activities of the Company as well as short-term

and long-term borrowings in foreign currency. The

Company has put in place a Policy for Foreign Exchange

and Interest Risk Management which is duly approved

by the Board of the Company. The Foreign Exchange

Risk Management programme of the Company is

carried out as per the said Policy and the Company uses

forward contracts, derivatives, structured derivatives

and swaps as hedging instruments. The Company is

suitably insulated against the risk arising out of foreign

currency fluctuations through appropriate hedging

mechanisms and the same is monitored by the Board

on a timely basis. The Company is in fully compliance

with the Rules, Regulations and Guidelines, as may be

applicable, prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India

from time to time in this behalf.

Exposure of the Company to commodity and

commodity risk faced throughout the year

The Company does not have any exposure hedged

through commodity during FY 2020-21.

historical cost convention except for the following

assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair

value:

•

Certain financial assets measured at fair value (refer

accounting policy regarding financial instruments)

In addition, the carrying values of recognised assets

and liabilities designated as hedged items in fair value

hedges that would otherwise be carried at amortised

attributable to the risks that are being hedged in

effective hedge relationships.

2.2 Current versus non-current classification

The Company presents assets and liabilities in

the Balance Sheet based on current / non-current

classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:

•

Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or

consumed in normal operating cycle

•

Held primarily for the purpose of trading

•

Expected to be realised within twelve months after

the reporting period, or

•

Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from

being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at

least twelve months after the reporting period

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

•

It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle

•

It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

•

It is due to be settled within twelve months after the

reporting period, or

•

There is no unconditional right to defer the

settlement of the liability for at least twelve months

after the reporting period

The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-

current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-

current assets and liabilities.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition

of assets for processing and their realisation in cash

and cash equivalents. The Company has identified

twelve months as its operating cycle.

commodity within the meaning of rule 2(l) of the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities),

Rules, 1977”. The above clarification has been re-affirmed vide: letter dated November 16, 1992 by the Legal

Metrology authorities.

2. The Competition Commission of India (‘CCI’) had, while considering the representation of the All India Tyres Dealers

Federation (AITDF) made a prima facie finding that the major players of tyre industry (including the Company) had

some understanding amongst themselves, especially in the replacement market, as they did not pass the benefit of

corresponding reduction in prices of major raw material inputs for the period subsequent to the financial year 2011-

Note 46: Capital management

For the purpose of the Company’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium and all

other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the Company’s capital

management is to maximise the shareholder value.

The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the

requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the dividend

payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Company monitors capital using a gearing

ratio, which is net debt divided by total equity plus net debt. The Company includes within net debt, interest bearing loans

and borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.

* Includes current maturities of long term borrowings

In order to achieve this overall objective, the Company’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it

meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements.

Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have

been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended

March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020.:

c) Others

1. The Group has availed the Sales Tax Deferral Loan and Octroi refund from the Directorate of Industries for Nashik

Plant. Hence, the Group has to take prior permission of the appropriate authority for removal/transfer of any asset

(falling under the above Schemes) from Nashik Plant. In case of violation of terms & conditions, the Group is

required to refund the entire loan/benefit along with the interest @ 22.50% on account of Sales Tax deferral Loan

and @ 15% on account of Octroi refund.

d) Demands and disputes considered as “Remote” by the Group

1. The Group has been served with a Show Cause cum Demand Notice from the DGCEI (Directorate General of Central

Excise Intelligence) Mumbai, on the ground that, the activity of making tyre set, i.e. inserting Tubes and Flaps inside

the Tyres and tied up through Polypropylene Straps, amounts to manufacture / pre-packaged commodity under

Section 2(f)(iii) of Central Excise Act, read with Section 2(l) of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. Accordingly, the

authorities worked out the differential duty amounting to H 27,672 Lacs i.e., the amount of duty already paid on the

basis of transaction value and duty payable on the basis of MRP under Section 4A, for the period from April-2011

to July-2017. The Group believes that Set of TT / TTF (Tyre and Tube / Tyre, Tube and Flap) is not pre-packaged

commodity in terms of provisions of Legal Metrology Act, 2009. The Group has a strong case on the ground that, the

said issue has been clarified by the Controller of the Legal Metrology Department vide its: letter dated May 1, 1991

that “Tyre with tube & flaps tied with three thin polythene strips may not be treated as a pre-packed commodity within

the meaning of rule 2(l) of the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities), Rules, 1977”. The

above clarification has been re-affirmed vide letter dated November 16, 1992 by the Legal Metrology authorities.

2. The Competition Commission of India (‘CCI’) had, while considering the representation of the All India Tyres Dealers

Federation (AITDF) made a prima facie finding that the major players of tyre industry (including the Company) had

some understanding amongst themselves, especially in the replacement market, as they did not pass the benefit of

corresponding reduction in prices of major raw material inputs for the period subsequent to the financial year 2011-

12. CCI had, vide its order passed on June 24, 2014, directed the Office of the

Letter of Credit, bank guarantees, payment against documents. For open credit exports

insurance cover is taken. Generally deposits are taken from domestic debtors under replacement segment. The carrying

amount and fair value of security deposit from dealers amounts to H 42,507 lacs (March 31, 2020: H 34,935 lacs) as it is

payable on demand. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of

financial assets.

c. Liquidity risk

The Group prepares cash flow on a daily basis to monitor liquidity. Any shortfall is funded out of short term loans. Any

surplus is invested in liquid funds. The Group also monitors the liquidity on a longer term wherein it is ensured that the

long term assets are funded by long term liabilities. The Group ensures that the duration of its current assets is in line with

the current assets to ensure adequate liquidity in the 3-6 months period.

Note 51: Financial risk management objectives and policies (Contd..)

a. Market risk (Contd..)

ii. Foreign currency risk (Contd..)

Foreign currency sensitivity

The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD and EURO rates, with

all other variables held constant. The impact on the Group’s profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of

monetary assets and liabilities. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not

material.

The movement in the pre-tax effect is a result of a change in the fair value of the financial asset/liability due to

the exchange rate movement. The derivatives which have not been designated in a hedge relationship act as an

economic hedge and will offset the underlying transactions when they occur. The same derivatives are not covered

in the above table.

In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because

the exposure at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.

iii. Equity price risk

The Group invests its surplus funds in various debt instruments and debt mutual funds. These comprise of mainly

liquid schemes of mutual funds (liquid investments) and fixed deposits.

Mutual fund investments are susceptible to market price risk, mainly arising from changes in the interest rates or

market yields which may impact the return and value of such investments. However due to the very short tenor of

the underlying portfolio in the liquid schemes, these do not pose any significant price risk.

There is no material equity risk relating to the Group’s equity investments which are detailed in note 7. The group

equity investments majorly comprises of strategic investments rather than trading purposes.

iv. Commodity price risk

Commodity price sensitivity

The following table approximately details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% movement in the input price of rubber and

carbon black. The sensitivity analysis includes only 5% change in commodity prices for quantity sold or consumed

during the year, with all other variables held constant. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or

equity where the commodity prices decrease by 5%. For a 5% increase in commodity prices, there would be a

comparable impact on profit or equity, and the balances below would be negative.:
