energy consumption.

Water is the most crucial resource for Human survival.

Hence our core focus over the years has been

to eliminate the usage of fresh water from textile

production. This ensures zero competing use or water

with communities. agriculture and animals.Across our

operations. we recycle 5 billion litres of water every

year. We have also invested in water less dyeing and

processing technologies to eliminate some of the

water requirements. All our facilities are r uture ready in

terms of water use regulations.

Chemicals

Chemicals are necessary to give textile the look,

feel and properties thal we desire. We have worked

over the years to ensure our chemical consumption

has least impact on Environment. We screen each

chemical consumed in our facilities with the help

of globally established and accepted standards to

ensure the usage of non-hazardous chemicals in our

manufacturing processes. There is an ongoing focus

on shif1ing to bet1er chemistry across various business

divisions.

letter from the lender before the date of adoption of financial

statements for not accelerating the payment of this loan within one year from the balance sheet date subject to regularisation of the breach by

end of March 31, 2022. Accordingly, the management has considered the classification of loan based upon the original repayment schedule.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the current period.

World Health Organisation (WHO) declared outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Consequent to

this, Government of India declared lockdown on March 23, 2020 and the Group temporarily suspended the operations in all the units of the Group

in compliance with the lockdown instructions issued by the Central and State Governments. COVID-19 has substantially impacted the normal

business operations of the Group by way of interruption in production, supply chain disruption, unavailability of personnel, closure/lock down of

production facilities etc. during the lock-down period which has been extended till May 17, 2020. Production and supply of goods has commenced

at various dates during the month of May 2020 and in a staggered manner during the year at some of the manufacturing locations of the Group

after obtaining permissions from the appropriate government authorities. The Group has witnessed significant improvement in its operations

during the second half of the year. Nearer to the year end, the operations of the Group were affected by the impact of the second wave of COVID-

19 pandemic.

The situation is changing rapidly giving rise to inherent uncertainty around the extent and timing of the potential future impact of the COVID-19

on revenue from operations, profitability, recoverability of Property Plant and Equipment, investments and trade receivables.

The Group has made detailed assessment of its liquidity position for the next 12 months, recoverability of its assets comprising of Property Plant

and Equipment, Intangible assets, investments, inventories and trade receivables. Based on current indicators of future economic conditions and

estimates made by the Management of the Group, the Group expects to recover the carrying amount of these assets.

As a result of the growing uncertainties with respect to COVID-19, the impact of this pandemic may be different from that estimated as at the date

of approval of these financial results. The Group will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 43 : Capital management:

For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity

holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains an efficient capital structure and

healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions or its business requirements to

optimise return to our shareholders through continuing growth. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend

payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The funding requirements are met through a mixture of equity,

internal fund generation and other non-current borrowings. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total

capital plus net debt. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and short-term deposits (including

other bank balance). The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
