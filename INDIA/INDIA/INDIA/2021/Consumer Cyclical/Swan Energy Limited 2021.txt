Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

The year 2020-21 has been challenging for each one of us. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant

impact on lives, livelihoods, and the business. Operational challenges mounted due to restricted movement

and disrupted supply lines during the first few months of the pandemic. As the second wave of the pandemic

unfolds with predictions of a third wave in the offing, our focus continues to be on our people’s health and

safety, ensuring continued care for the communities in which we operate, and of course, protecting our

business model.

The relentless commitment and dedication of every member of the Swan family helped the business

overcome many challenges in the past year. Triumph Offshore Private Limited, a subsidiary of Swan,

th

successfully took delivery of the company's FSRU, Vasant 1, on 29 September 2020. Post delivery, the

FSRU has been deployed on charter with Hong Kong based CNTIC V Power Energy, for the interim period

until the port construction is completed for the Swan LNG project.

As expected, FY21 was a challenging year for our textile unit. There was a sharp reduction in demand across

all markets, especially in the early part of the year. The expansion project was delayed due to the pandemic,

but we foresee completion by Q3 of FY 22. Although we are not yet free from the uncertainties resulting

from the pandemic, we foresee a spurt in demand in the near future as pipelines are running low on

inventory. As always, we will continue to keep a close watch on both, the opportunities and potential risks,

and take a balanced approach going forward.

The realty division continued to receive rental income from its properties located in Bangalore and

Hyderabad. The ongoing development of the ultra-luxury residential project in Bangalore’s Yeshwantpur

area has faced delays due to the pandemic and expected completion is now June 2023.

Despite best efforts from our frontline health workers, we have experienced grave losses throughout our

country and the rest of the world. Our thoughts go out to all the families, friends, and indeed to all those

whose lives have been impacted. The pandemic tested us in unprecedented ways. It tested the resilience of

our business, character of our people, agility of our operations and the depth of our financial strength. It has

made us a more resilient business that is better prepared for the vagaries of this fast-changing world.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our people who have been tirelessly working to ensure that

we continue to march forward during this extremely challenging year. Most importantly, I would like to

thank you, our shareholders, for your overwhelming trust, support, and confidence in Swan Energy

Limited.
