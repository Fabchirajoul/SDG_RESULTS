of a company, by way of commission not exceeding one percent of the net profits of the company, if the Company authorises such payment

by a special resolution. Shareholders of the Company had approved such payment by a special resolution passed on 27 July 2016 for

a five-year period, which expired on 31 March 2021.

In view of the increased demands on non-executive directors’ participation in Board and Committee meetings and the higher responsibilities

they are expected to bear in the interest of higher level of excellence in corporate governance on account of statutory and regulatory changes,

it is proposed to continue to pay such commission to the non-executive directors for a further period of five years upto and including

the year 2025-26.

The amount of commission shall be payable each year after the annual accounts are approved by the Board of Directors and adopted by the

shareholders.

Pursuant to the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2020, read with rules made thereunder, if a company fails to make profits or makes inadequate

profits in a financial year, any non-executive director of such company, including an independent director, may be paid remuneration in

accordance with Schedule V of the Act.

No approval of Central Government will be required for the said payment of commission, since it is within the prescribed limits as specified

under section 197. The above payment to non-executive directors will be in addition to the sitting fees payable to them for attending

Board/committee meetings, which at present is fixed at H 100,000 per meeting.

None of the Directors/key managerial personnel and/or their relatives, except the concerned non-executive director are directly or indirectly

concerned or interested, financially or otherwise, except to the extent of remuneration that may be received by them and their respective

shareholding, if any, in the Company, in the resolution set out in Item No. 7 of the Notice.

Rajiv Bajaj: Managing

letter to you, over 141 million people have been struck by the disease and more than 3

million have perished. In India, as we are battling the second wave of the virus — a wave that is more

severe than the first — Covid-19 has claimed more than 14.8 million cases and some 177,150 deaths.

Everything suggests that, in epidemiological terms, things will get worse before getting better.

After the full national lockdown during 25 March to 30 April 2020 and partial lockdown that continued in

varying stages up to 30 November 2020, things were gradually moving for the better. Subsequent to the

first and second quarters of FY2021 — when real GDP crashed by 24.4% followed by another 7.3% —

we were beginning to see some green shoots of recovery. October-December 2020 showed a small but

positive GDP growth of 0.4%. We were looking forward to another quarter of positive growth in

January-March 2021.

With the second wave that started in March 2021, I doubt whether we will see that growth. More

worryingly, I am concerned about Q1 FY2022 and what a series of state-wide lockdowns might do to

businesses and economic growth.

In such disheartening circumstances, your Company has done quite well in not only limiting its

downside but also in posting relatively healthy results. Let me briefly share these.

l

Net sales for FY2021 was H 27,133 crore. Despite a decline of 6.8%, it was the third highest sales in

Bajaj Auto’s history.

l

Operating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was H 5,063 crore —

a reduction of 3.6% versus the previous year.

l

Operating EBITDA margin was 18.3% of net sales and other operating income, versus 17.6% in the

previous year — representing an increase of 70 basis points in this Covid-19 year.

l

Though operating profit declined by 4.1% to H 4,797 crore, the operating profit margin was 17.3% of

net sales and other operating income. This was 60 basis points higher than FY2020.

l

Profit before tax (PBT) declined by 9.7% to H 5,939 crore, Bajaj Auto’s third highest ever.

l

Profit after tax (PAT) decreased by 10.7% to H 4,555 crore. This was the Company’s third

highest PAT.

l

Surplus cash and cash equivalent as on 31 March 2021 increased by 23.5% to H 17,689 crore.

CHAIRMAN’S: LETTER

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited

Letter

BAJAJ AUTO LIMITED

Given the circumstances, I believe that these are creditable results. Your: managing director, Rajiv Bajaj,

his team and every employee of your Company should be collectively congratulated for the tremendous

efforts that they have made in the most difficult year that our country has witnessed.

Personally, I am delighted with the introduction of the new Chetak — a best-in-class electric scooter

with an iconic design. When booking for the Chetak was first rolled out in early 2020, it had to be

stopped on account of Covid-19 related supply chain disruptions.

Thereafter, your Company re-opened online bookings on 13 April 2021 but had to stop just 48 hours

later, owing to an overwhelming response. I expect to see your Company delivering this iconic model

in FY2022.

To each of us in Bajaj Auto, our people are our greatest assets. I am proud to say that amidst this

pandemic your Company has walked the extra mile to ensure health and safety for all employees.

As it is doing even now.

Let us hope that rapidly accelerated vaccinations coupled with a strict enforcement of masks and social

distancing will soon bring the second wave under control.

Let us also hope that we do not react to the epidemic by declaring more lockdowns, as we did the last

time. For these will destroy business, employment and the economy without necessarily controlling the

spread of the disease.

I have been your Company’s Chairman since the last 49 years. Given that I am getting along, it is the

time for change and to pass the mantle on to a younger person. I am happy to announce that your

Board has unanimously approved Niraj Bajaj as the next Chairman of Bajaj Auto. I wish him well and am

sure that he will do an excellent job.

That being so, this is my last Chairman’s Letter to you. Though I shan’t write to you through this forum

any further, rest assured that you and your Company will forever remain in my heart.

Stay safe. Vaccinate yourselves. Remain protected.

God bless you and your family.

Letter, Management Discussion and Analysis, Corporate Governance and Directors’ Report, but does not include the

standalone financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing

so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the

audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material

misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management for the standalone financial statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of

these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other

comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally

accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting

records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting

frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates

that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that

were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and

presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether

due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as

a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless

Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable

assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect

a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or

in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these

standalone financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the

audit. We also:

l

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,

design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to

provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one

resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of

internal control.

l

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the

circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has

adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

Managing Director who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Core Management Committee examines

performance both from a product as well as from a geographical perspective and has identified two operative reportable

segments from which significant risks and rewards are derived viz. Automotive business and Investments.

20 Fair value measurement

The Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each Balance Sheet date. Fair value is the

price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at

the measurement date.

The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes

place either:

l

In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

l

In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the

asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their best economic interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits

by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest

and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to

measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair

value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

l

Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

l

Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or

indirectly observable

l

Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is

unobservable.

The Company has set policies and procedures for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurement of financial assets,

which includes valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.

For fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities based on the nature, characteristics and

risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes.

l

Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions (note 1 clause 1)

l
