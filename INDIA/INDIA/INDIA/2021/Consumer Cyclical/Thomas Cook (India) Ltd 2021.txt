Dear Shareholders

I am glad to share that the Thomas Cook India Group stands strong despite having to face the most

challenging period in our lifetime. We are continuing to adapt to the concerns and effects of the

pandemic, while further strengthening our customer focus and accelerating our transformation while

continuing to focus on sustainable and profitable growth.

Covid-19 continues as a lingering black swan event and many lives have been lost and livelihoods

impacted in a negative way. Every nation felt the full force of the unpredictable coronavirus pandemic

- with the Travel and Tourism industry undoubtedly being impacted the most. While it is impossible not to be saddened

by the devastation it has brought about, the pandemic has also summoned extraordinary resilience & innovation across

the world.

The past year has challenged us in many different ways. But it was not without its own valuable lessons and

opportunities. On the contrary, FY21 was a pivotal year in our transformational journey toward creating long-term value

for our business and stakeholders. We were not only determined to keep raising the bar with our services, and everything

within our means to lead the organization out of the pandemic and emerge stronger as travel and travel related services

recovers rapidly going forward.

I truly believe that the past year belonged to active listeners, keen observers, and fast learners. Today, as I draft this

message, I am constantly reminded about how far and fast the world has changed within the last twelve months. We have

experienced profound changes starting with a heightened focus on health & safety, discovering the power of flexibility in

businesses, to rapid digitalization to creating unique solutions in line with the new realities. A lot of what we see around

today, very often, did not even exist a year back and yet, we have all seamlessly become a part of ‘this new normal.’

As the pandemic raged, we launched a comprehensive Reimagine Program as our strategy to deal with the challenges and

opportunities that the pandemic threw up. Driving it forward will help us grow along with the fundamental shifts in the

sector and allow us to continually transform the business, leverage our strong brands, to delight more customers and in

turn reward our investors and our people.

MANAGING: DIRECTOR'S

MESSAGE

A year of

challenges,

leadership and

teamwork

6

letter.

The pandemic’s impact on society and economy started

unfolding as it witnessed sharp de-growth and dampening

business sentiment. Consumer demand remained muted

with severe stress on household balance sheets due to

growing unemployment, reduction in household incomes

etc. As trade skewed negatively, the Government initiated

measures around fiscal and monetary policies with an

effort to curb economic disruption. With staggered and

gradual easing of lockdowns, the second half of the year

witnessed phased resumption of business across sectors

and also bringing some respite to the travel segment.

However, the second wave of Covid-19 once again

slammed the brakes on an otherwise improving economic

scenario. In these testing times, the rapid acceleration

of vaccination drives around the world is a silver lining

among these dark clouds. Countries worldwide including

India have seen a decline in Covid-19 cases as vaccination

efforts continue to ramp up. The International Monetary

Fund forecasts India's gross domestic product (GDP)

growth at 9.5% for FY22, factoring the hit on economic

activity and demand due to the deadly 'second wave' of

the Covid-19 pandemic.

Impact of COVID-19 on tourism:

A recent report by UN World Tourism Organization

(UNWTO), indicated that international tourism and its

closely linked sectors suffered an estimated loss of

$2.5 trillion in 2020 due to direct and indirect impacts

of a steep drop in international tourist arrivals. With

Covid-19 vaccinations being more pronounced in some

countries than others, tourism losses are reduced in most

developed countries but worsened in developing countries

and this the asymmetric roll-out of vaccines magnifies

the economic blow tourism has suffered in developing

countries, as they could account for up to 60% of the

global GDP losses. According to UNWTO, international

tourist arrivals declined by about 1 billion or 74% between

January and December 2020. In the first quarter of 2021,

the UNWTO World Tourism Barometer points to a decline

of 88%.

In India too, the successive waves of COVID-19 have

devastated the travel and tourism industry. The green

shoots and slow recovery recorded in the Q1 CY21 was

diminished with the sudden onset of the second wave

when localized lockdowns and restrictions imposed by

various state governments crippled the tourism industry.

According to the recent report -“India Tourism Statistics”

published by the Ministry of Tourism, the Foreign

Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) during January- April 2021 were

3,76,083 compared to 23,57,877 in January to April 2020,

registering a fall of 84.0%.

Fiscal support: While the tourism and hospitality industry

has made efforts to regenerate itself, it would be

sometime before it returns to normal operations. Hence,

Government’s support is critical. For the dominant part of

2020, there was a lack of any umbrella direction from the

Government or without any fiscal and monetary support.

In June 2021, some economic relief measures were

announced to boost sectors worst affected by the second

wave of coronavirus.

• `1.1 lakh crore loan guarantee scheme for COVID-affected

sectors

• Additional `1.5 lakh crore under the Emergency Credit

Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS)

• Loans will be provided with 100% guarantee with a limit

of `10 lakh for travel and tourism stakeholders and ` 1

lakh for registered tourist guides

• RBI announced `15,000 cr special liquidity window for

travel and tourism sector

Source: WTTC:

Letter of Offer dated

March 5, 2020.

•

The original purpose of the Buyback was to create a mechanism for distributing surplus cash to our shareholders

and enhance shareholder value. Due to outbreak of the pandemic, the commercial and financial position of the

Group witnessed substantial deterioration from what it was at the time when the Buyback was announced (February

26, 2020). Consequently, the Company was been forced to re-evaluate its options regarding the Buyback given the

crippling effect it will create for the Company, in the event it was to be completed.

•

It was critical and in the best interests of all our shareholders and investors to protect the financial sustainability of

the Company, and, accordingly, a relaxation from SEBI was sought.

The SEBI Order noted that the continuation of the Buy-back Offer will result in an adverse effect on the business of

the Company and in turn, its shareholders. Accordingly, SEBI exercised its powers to allow the withdrawal of the Buy-

back.

3) Integration of key functions of TCIL & SOTC- During the year, the Company has made several initiatives to streamline

its structure in order to leverage the combined scale and eventually create synergies to drive operational efficiencies,

higher productivity and margin expansion.

This will also allow for the generation of competitive advantages in areas such as domain knowledge, CRM, pricing and

value, scalability and also the ability to provide a wider range of products / offerings to its customers.

Integration of Product, Contracting and Operations to

drive operational efficiencies, higher productivity and

margin expansion

Consolidation of

non-customer

facing operations

Integrated Group Products, will drive higher operating

strength led by higher volumes

Single centralized contracting team to provide

competitive advantage in pricing and value

along with scale

Ability to provide a wider range of products / offerings

Integrated call centres for both brands enabling

Common CRM and customer acquisition to provide

synergies in process and cost savings

Standardisation across both brands in processes,

(B) Market risk

(i)

Foreign currency risk

The Company enters into foreign currency transactions in the Foreign Exchange and Leisure Travel Outbound businesses. The currency

risk arising out of foreign currency transactions in the Foreign Exchange business is monitored by a central dealing room, which then

hedges the positions transactions entered into at individual locations across the country, through deals in the interbank market, or

through forward contracts, thereby ensuring that there are minimal open positions. In the Leisure Travel Outbound business, package

prices are denominated partly in the functional currency of the Company, Indian Rupees (INR), and partly in foreign currencies. The

portion of customer collection in foreign currencies, which is parked in Nostro bank accounts, is used to pay off vendor liabilities,

denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating a natural hedge. As a result, the risk related to foreign currency exchange rate

fluctuation is insignificant.:

Managing Director, the Chief Financial Officer, and the heads of the business

units and support services' units) has the overall responsibility for the risk management framework and its effectiveness, with the

respective heads of business units/ support services units, being responsible for its implementation and day-to- day monitoring.

(A) Credit Risk

The Group is exposed to credit risk, which is the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligation resulting in a financial loss

to the Group. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by its customer. To manage this, the Group periodically assesses

the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial conditions, current economic trends, analysis of historical bad

debts and ageing of accounts receivable as of different reporting periods.

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances and bank deposits is limited as the Group generally invests in deposits

with banks with high credit ratings assigned by domestic credit rating agencies. Investments comprises of investment in mutual funds

invested with mutual fund institutions having high credit ratings assigned by domestic credit rating agencies. The loan represents

security deposits given to suppliers, employees and others. The credit risk associated with such deposits is relatively low.

Trade receivables

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by its customers. However, the management also considers the factors that may

influence the credit risk of its customer base. The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed

individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s

review includes external ratings, if they are available, financial statements, credit agency information, industry information and in some

cases bank references.

Based on industry practices and the business environment in which the entity operates, the management considers that trade

receivables are in default (credit impaired) if the payments are due for more than specific number of days. Loss allowances are based

on actual credit loss experience over the past years. Refer note 8(c) for loss allowances provided.

(B) Market risk

(i)

Foreign currency risk (Exposure in different currencies converted to functional currency)

The Group is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, purchases and

borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of the Group companies. The functional currency for large

number of Group companies is Indian Rupees ("INR"). The currency risks of the respective group companies are managed by the local

management of these companies. The currency risk arising out of foreign currency transactions in the foreign exchange business is

monitored by a central dealing room, which then hedges the positions transactions entered into at individual locations across the

country, through deals in the interbank market, or through forward contracts, thereby ensuring that there are minimal open positions.

In the leisure travel outbound business, package prices are denominated partly in the functional currency of the Group companies and

partly in foreign currencies. The portion of customer collection in foreign currencies, which is parked in Nostro bank accounts, is used

to pay off vendor liabilities, denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating a natural hedge. As a result, the risk related to foreign
