The year gone by has shackled the notions of

normalcy and has presented the world with

a new paradigm ruled by uncertainty. The

pandemic has been individually experienced,

but globally shared. The impact of the

pandemic might take some while to wane;

however, it has been a tough period that

has tested the resilience of humans and

organisations alike. At Raymond, this would

be amongst the most defining years that

urged us to reshape our business strategy

factoring in the challenges that consumer

facing organisation are grappling with.

Strengthening our core business purpose

that is guided by our values of Trust, Quality

and Excellence, today assume a greater

significance to gain a winning edge in the

new normal.:

Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

Financial year 2020-21 will be written in

the world history in many ways but the

predicament to human lives due to COVID-19

coupled with economic tribulations would be

the worst chapters to reckon with. For all of this

year’s upheaval, we committed ourselves by

staying the course, we refocused the sight of

our purpose and we demonstrated that the core

will guide us through these turbulent times.

The first quarter was the darkest hour of the

fiscal when neither businesses had an idea

how to deal with the pandemic nor they were

aware of the severity of the impact. Given the

lack of short term visibility, it was the time to

introspect and undertake immediate measures

to stay on course. The global pandemic has

presented such a crisis and that too on a

scale many of us have never experienced or

could have predicted. The toll of COVID-19 on

human life is heart breaking and has had an

adverse impact on households, businesses, and

economies globally.

Dear Shareholders,

The extent of financial turmoil caused by the pandemic

was unsettling as we beheld the exacting situations

with economies coming to a standstill. With rampant

supply chain disruptions, COVID 19 affected big and

small businesses alike instigating damages to the tune of

trillions of dollars to the global economy. As I reflect on an

exceptionally perplexing year, we critically watched events

that unfolded and we profoundly focussed on our core to

combat the crisis.

In our glorious journey of 96 years, Raymond has weathered

through multiple economic cycles and ever evolving

business dynamics. However, given this was one of the most

unprecedented ones, we were determined to find a way to

persevere through by continually challenging the status quo

and strived for answers to ever evolving tough situations. It

has been a rough year for us, to make some critical decisions

in an endeavour to stay on course. These decisions helped us

to sustain the performance of the Company.

Additionally, an emphasis on collections and reducing

inventory helped reduce net working capital (Pre-Ind

AS 116) by ` 738 crores from ` 1,855 crores in Mar-20 to

` 1,117 crores in Mar-21. The number of Net Working Capital

(NWC) days improved to 73 days (on 4QFY21 annualised

sales basis) from 103 days in FY 2019-20.

Overall, sequential improvement in sales recovery

along with sustained efforts on controlling operational

expenditures and working capital management resulted

in generating operating cash flow of ` 702 crores and free

cash flows of ` 417 crores during the year.

The cashflows generated were utilised for reducing

consolidated net debt level by ` 443 crores from ` 1,859

crores in Mar-20 to ` 1,416 crores in Mar-21. We were able to

maintain the liquidity in the range of ` 550 crores to ` 650

crores of cash and cash equivalents throughout the year.

Over the recent times, the Company has embarked on a

deleveraging plan and has undertaken multiple steps in

that direction with a purpose of enhancing shareholder

value. In December 2019, we infused ` 350 crores as a

preferential issue from net proceeds from sale of land by

an associate company and utilised the entire amount for

reducing debt. Additionally cashflows generated throughout

the pandemic year was utilised to further reduce the debt.

The deleveraging strategy played out in last 6 quarters

which reduced almost ` 1,000 crores of debt and our net

debt equity ratio has improved steadily and stands at 0.65x

as of March 31, 2021 compared to 0.75x as of March 31, 2020.

Salvaging the tapestry and attire

Branded Textile segment exhibited a good recovery both

in primary sales driven by pickup in wholesale channel and

secondary sales led by opening up of TRS network during

the second half of the year. Early revival was witnessed in

smaller towns as compared to Metros & Tier I towns. Our

segment sales stood at ` 1,572 crores. However, the fourth

quarter reported a 24% growth over the previous year

proved to be an indicator of a resilient regain.

Branded Apparel Segment that has a portfolio of

homegrown brands such as Park Avenue, ColorPlus, Parx,

Raymond Ready to Wear and Ethnix by Raymond clocked

sales at ` 457 crores. The segment has been impacted due

to controlled primary sales to channel partners in MBO and

TRS networks, to re-align inventory in the supply chain. With

lockdown, the demand for apparel category was weak and

the thrust was on liquidating the inventory and speeding

up collections. In the retail sales channels of EBO and LFS,

gradual pickup was witnessed in the second half of the year

In High Value Cotton Shirting segment, the domestic

demand for fabric and yarn sales was also impacted due

to lockdown. However, with demand recovery in second

half of the year, the segment reported a 12% growth over

previous year in the fourth quarter. Overall for the year,

the segment sales stood at ` 258 crores.

Augmenting Capabilities

Meanwhile as export markets remained shut and travel

was affected, the export orders to key markets such as US

and Europe were impacted. To leverage our capabilities

in garmenting business during lockdown period, we

repurposed our Garmenting factories in FY 2020-21 to

manufacture PPE products for government, hospitals and

corporate sectors. Our garmenting plants in Bengaluru

and Ethiopia were quickly repurposed to manufacture

high grade PPE kits and contribute to the fight against

COVID-19. Our Garmenting segment sales stood at ` 549

crores.

Power of Cogs

Both our Engineering businesses reported a strong sales

growth in H2 of the year. Auto Components Segment sales

stood at ` 197 crores supported by demand from leading

auto companies. In fourth quarter, the segment reported

a 46% growth over previous year driven by strong growth

in both domestic and exports markets Tools and Hardware

Segment sales stood at ` 344 crores for the year. In the

fourth quarter, the segment reported a 53% growth over

previous year led by growth across product categories

in domestic markets as well as in global export markets

such as LATAM, Europe & Africa where we have a buoyant

customer base with significant contract manufacturing.

EBITDA margins were improved with higher utilisation

levels and increased operational efficiencies.

Building Blocks of Growth

In line with our ambitions to enhance value creation for

all stakeholders, Raymond forayed into the Realty space.

Standing tall, this maiden project is a spectacular addition

to the city’s skyline and has successfully sold over 60%

of total launched inventory. The project is progressing

in full swing and we sold around 400 units in H2 and

construction of 33rd floor slab has been completed for the

first 3 towers out of total 10 towers. The appeal of these

smart sized homes coupled with incentives of lower stamp

duty reduction and lower home loan interest rates helped

sustaining a strong momentum. Our Real estate segment

sales stood at ` 141 crores.

Enduring Processes

The last fiscal has been unpredictable given the

circumstances that were beyond control. The frequent

disruptions outlined the need of doing business with a

dichotomy; i.e. having greater financial far-sightedness in

the short-term business visibility. We concluded the fiscal

with a profitable fourth quarter and intend to continue our

journey with cost-effective value based processes. As we put

together this Annual Report, the uncertainty continues to

meander with the second wave hitting us hard but hope is

cautiously making its presence felt as vaccination gains pace

and economies are opening up albeit gradually.

A Year of Financial Prudence

About Raymond & Year in Review:

Dear Shareholders,

Since the onset of COVID-19 the much hyped new normal has challenged conventional wisdom

and rediscovered the way we work, live, and celebrate. While numerous fashion retailers

across the world faced challenges threatening their existence, we at Raymond were quick

to make right adjustments during the crisis and we worked through the lockdown phases

to significantly leverage our core capabilities while acquiring new ones to create compelling

customer propositions in retail’s new practicality. Surviving a pandemic can be overwhelming

and providing support to our employees, retail staff and associates across locations at this

critical time was imperative. Safeguarding the health and safety of individuals necessitated the

need for lockdowns which in turn led to the acceleration of ecommerce adoption in India.

Readiness amidst Volatility

Fashion retail in FY 2020-21 was perplexed with multiple

glitches especially given the size and the diversity of

our country. The anomalies at large were many such

as intermittent full lockdowns, partial unlocking of the

economy, unforeseen scenarios of weekend lockdowns,

markets opening on odd even dates, new set of

guidelines for essential and non-essential categories,

the country divided into colour zones basis the number

of positive COVID-19 etc. These uncertainties never

allowed fashion retail companies to work out even on

the short-term go-to-market approaches. However, our

sheer physical presence through our expansive network

and the core strength of the brand ‘Raymond’ proved to

be a silver lining for us. As the COVID impact was lesser

in Tier-III towns and downwards, markets opened much

earlier than metro cities and bigger towns. Being ready

with all COVID protocols, the recovery process started

sooner to our respite in smaller geographies leading to

incremental footfalls on a week on week basis.

We recalibrated our synergies and started servicing

each market that was opening up with objectivity and

prepared ourselves methodically to service the entire

nation that opened up in the third quarter of the fiscal.

Our persistent preparedness reaped the benefits in the

fourth quarter when we saw a formidable topline growth.

Bricks and Clicks: Future of Retail

While consumers adapted online channels during the

peak of the pandemic, the future belongs to creating

a Phygital experience that intersperses imagination,

convenience and customisation. In our endeavour

to create a future ready, agile business model, we

used the opportune moment to re-evaluate all costs

and adopted a zero base approach with a stronger

focus on collections. Being a leading Brick & Mortar

player with an expansive reach, we constantly strive to

create an organisation that delights our consumers.

Customisation is the next level of consumer

gratification and recently we launched a new initiative

̶ Made to Order that focuses on personalisation

through our digital channel, ‘myraymond.com’. With

Raymond Made-To-Order platform consumers can

browse through variety of customisable Ready-To-

Wear garments and modify their style online to receive

a Custom Fit Garment Delivered at Home.

Sustainability

At Raymond, it is our endeavour to manufacture

fabrics responsibly. In an endeavor to reduce the

ecological impact we have outlined framework and

also constituted a task force of 50+ volunteers to

drive sustainability efforts across the organisation.

The team is focussed on six themes of sustainable

consumer packaging, energy from renewable sources,

sustainable raw materials, water conservation, tailoring

training to socio- economically backward youth and

garment donation.

Watchful buoyancy

The year 2020-21 presented an unexpected prelude

into the future of retail. The pandemic has elevated our

strength of sorts and we demonstrated our resilience

and adaptability. As retail buoyancy heralds the Indian

consumption story that extends beyond the metros

and trickles down to the hinterlands, at Raymond we

are now more watchful and agile in the fast changing

consumer landscape as we look forward to a stronger

rebound this year.

INDIAN ECONOMIC OVERVIEW

With an overall slowdown in the global economy which is

estimated to have contracted by around 3.3% in 2020 on

account of COVID-19 pandemic, the prospects in 2021 have

shown sizeable improvement and the negative growth is

expected to be reversed with positive growth of 6% expected

to moderate to 4.4% in 2022. These are unprecedented and

uncertain times. Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused

massive disruptions across every sphere of human and business

activity. There has been an adverse economic impact on people,

communities and countries.

The vaccination drive has picked up momentum pan-India

and the outlook remains positive with the advent of new

vaccines reaching the market. Emerging Markets like India

have witnessed a slowdown and there is economic fallout

registered on account of sustained lockdowns in various

parts of the Country. Growth in India is estimated to have

contracted to -7.3% in FY 2021 with the country witnessing

a second wave of the pandemic in March, 2021. The

localised lockdowns have resumed which are likely to impair

economic activity. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has

severely impacted economies worldwide. Basis the fallout,

the International Monetary Fund has projected a sharp

contraction of the global economy to a status much worse

than what resulted from the 2008-09 financial crisis.

The measures taken by the government to contain spread of

the COVID-19 pandemic have had an impact on the economic

activities as well as on the data collection mechanisms.

Estimates are, therefore, likely to undergo sharp revisions

for the aforesaid causes in due course. V-shaped economic

recovery is expected due to mega vaccination drive, recovery

in the services sector and strong growth in consumption

and investment coupled with resurgence in high frequency

indicators such as power demand, rail freight, e-way bills, GST

collection, steel consumption, etc.

TEXTILES

Global Textile Industry

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted each and every business

in some way or the other, the global textile industry has been

drastically impacted. Asia, being one of the largest markets for

textile industry in the world has suffered due to sudden drop in

international demand for their products coupled with prolonged

lockdowns and restrictions in majority of Asian countries.

Shortage of cotton and other raw materials and several supply

chain disruptions have worsened the situation globally. It is

estimated that exports to major buying regions in the European

Union, United States, and Japan might decline by approx. 70%.

The key markets in the textile industry are China, European

Union, the United States and India, all of which were affected

due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Indian Textile Industry

The textiles and apparels sector is a major contributor to the

Indian economy in terms of foreign exchange earnings and

employment. Textile & garments industry in India is expected to

reach US$223 Billion by 2021 from US$140.4 Billion in 2018. India

is the third-largest textile manufacturing industry and contributes

approximately 6% to the total textile production, globally.

India ranks 2nd as the largest producer of textiles and garments

and is the 5th largest exporter of textiles spanning apparel,

home and technical products.

The Indian textile industry is set for growth, buoyed by both

strong domestic consumption as well as export demand.

Favourable demographic, rising per capital income and a shift in

customer preference to branded products is expected to revive

the textile industry which has been severely impacted by the

COVID-19 pandemic.

The Government of India is working on major initiatives and

reforms in the Textile sector, including launch of a ‘Mega

Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (MITRA) Park’ scheme to

establish seven textile parks with state-of-the-art infrastructure,

common utilities and R&D lab over a three-year period; starting

a focused product scheme; positioning the country as a global

hub in the man-made fibre (MMF) and technical textiles

segments. Competitive advantage, robust demand, favourable

government policies, increasing investments and urbanisation

are expected to be the key drivers for revival of the industry.

Performance

At ` 1,572 Crore, the Branded Textile revenue was substantially

down over previous year. The suiting business topline witnessed

progressive improvement on a quarter-on-quarter basis in

primary sales, boosted by pickup in wholesale channel and in

secondary sales led by recovery in TRS network due to festivities

and wedding season in the second half of the fiscal. Recovery

in B2C shirting was slightly lower while the MTM business was

impacted due to lower consumer discretionary spends and store

Statement of Significant Accounting Policies

I.

Background

Raymond Limited (‘RL’ or ‘the Company’) incorporated

in India is a leading Indian Textile, Lifestyle and Branded

Apparel Company. The Company has its wide network of

operations in local as well foreign market. The Company

sells its product through multiple channels including

wholesale, franchisee, retail etc.

The Company had commenced activities to develop part

of its land for residential / commercial purpose a few years

back.

II.

Significant Accounting Policies followed by the

Company

(a) Basis of preparation

(i)

Compliance with Ind AS

These standalone financial statements (‘financial

statements’) have been prepared in accordance

with the Indian Accounting Standards

(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as

notified by Ministry of Corporate Affairs pursuant

to Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’)

read with of the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, and other

relevant provisions of the Act.

The accounting policies are applied consistently

to all the periods presented in the financial

statements.

(ii) Historical cost convention

The financial statements have been prepared on

a historical cost basis, except for the following:

1)

certain financial assets and liabilities that

are measured at fair value;

2)

assets held for sale - measured at lower of

carrying amount or fair value less cost to

sell;

3)

defined benefit plans - plan assets

measured at fair value;

(iii) Current and non-current classification

All assets and liabilities have been classified as

current or non-current based on the Company’s

normal operating cycle for each of its businesses,

as per the criteria set out in the Schedule III to

the Act.

(iv) Rounding of amounts

All amounts disclosed in the financial statements

and notes have been rounded off to the nearest

lakhs as per the requirement of Schedule III,

unless otherwise stated.

(b) Use of estimates and judgements

The estimates and judgements used in the

preparation of the financial statements are

continuously evaluated by the Company and are

based on historical experience and various other

assumptions and factors (including expectations

of future events) that the Company believes to

be reasonable under the existing circumstances.

Differences between actual results and estimates

are recognised in the period in which the results are

known/materialised.

The said estimates are based on the facts and events,

that existed as at the reporting date, or that occurred

after that date but provide additional evidence about

conditions existing as at the reporting date.

(c) Property, plant and equipment

The Company had applied for the one time transition

exemption of considering the carrying cost on the

transition date i.e. 1st April, 2015 as the deemed cost

under IND AS, regarded thereafter as historical cost.

Freehold land is carried at cost. All other items of

property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less

depreciation and impairment, if any. Historical cost

includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the

acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's

carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset,

as appropriate, only when it is probable that future

economic benefits associated with the item will

flow to the Company and the cost of the item can

be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any

component accounted for as a separate asset is

derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and

maintenance are charged to the Statement of Profit

and Loss during the reporting period in which they are

incurred.

Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and

residual value

Depreciation on Factory Buildings, Specific non factory

buildings, Plant and Equipment, Aircrafts, is provided

as per the Straight Line Method and in case of other

assets as per the Written Down Value Method, over

the estimated useful lives of assets. Leasehold land

is amortised over the period of lease. Leasehold

improvements are amortised over the period of lease

or estimated useful life, whichever is lower.:

Note :- 1 - STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES AND PRACTICES

1(i) Raymond Limited (‘RL’ / the ‘Company’ or the ‘Holding

Company’) and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and

its subsidiaries together referred to as the ‘Group’) and

its associates and joint ventures mainly deals in Textiles,

Lifestyle, Branded apparel, Engineering, FMCG, Auto

components, etc. The Group and its associates and joint

ventures have its wide network of operations in local as well

as in foreign markets. The Group and its associates and

joint ventures sells its products through multiple channels

including wholesale, franchisee, retail etc. The Holding

Company had commenced activities to develop part of its

land for residential / commercial purpose a few years back.

(a) Basis of preparation

(i)

Compliance with Ind AS

These consolidated financial statements (‘financial

statements’) have been prepared in accordance with

the Indian Accounting Standards (hereinafter referred

to as the ‘Ind AS’) as notified by Ministry of Corporate

Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the Companies

Act, 2013 (‘Act’) read with the Companies (Indian

Accounting standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, and

other relevant provisions of the Act.

The accounting policies are applied consistently to

all the periods presented in the financial statements.

The financial statements of the Group have been

consolidated using uniform accounting policies.

(ii) Historical cost convention

The financial statements have been prepared on a

historical cost basis, except for the following:

1)

certain financial assets and liabilities that are

measured at fair value;

2)

assets held for sale - measured at the lower of

carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell;

3)

defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at

fair value;

(iii) Current non-current classification

All assets and liabilities have been classified as

current or non-current based on the Group’s normal

operating cycle for each of its businesses, as per the

criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Act.

(iv) Rounding of amounts

All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and

notes have been rounded off to the nearest lakhs as

per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise

stated.

(b) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting

(i)

Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has

control. The Group controls an entity when the Group

is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from

its involvement with the entity and has the ability

to affect those returns through its power to direct

the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are

fully consolidated from the date on which control is

transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated

from the date that control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to

account for business combinations by the Group.

The Group combines the financial statements of the

Holding Company and its subsidiaries line by line

adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity,

income and expenses. Intercompany transactions,

balances and unrealised gains on transactions

between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised

losses are also eliminated unless the transaction

provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred

asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been

changed where necessary to ensure consistency with

the policies adopted by the Group.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of

subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated

statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement

of changes in equity and consolidated balance sheet

respectively."

(ii) Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group

has significant influence but not control or joint

control. This is generally the case where the Group

holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.

Investments in associates are accounted for using

the equity method of accounting , after initially being

recognised at cost.

(iii) Joint ventures

Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using

the equity method , after initially being recognised at

cost in the consolidated balance sheet.

(iv) Equity Method

Under the equity method of accounting, the

investments are initially recognised at cost and

adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of

the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee

in statement of profit and loss, and the Group’s share

of other comprehensive income of the investee in

other comprehensive income. Dividends received:

managing director, all of them constitute as chief operating

decision maker ('CODM').

(o) Borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at net of transaction

costs incurred and measured at amortised cost. Any

difference between the proceeds (net of transaction

costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the

Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the period

of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Preference shares, which are mandatorily redeemable on

a specific date are classified as liabilities. The dividend

on these preference shares is recognised in Consolidated

Statement of Profit and Loss as finance costs.

(p) Borrowing costs

Interest and other borrowing costs attributable to

qualifying assets are capitalised. Other interest and

borrowing costs are charged to Consolidated Statement of

Profit and Loss.

(q) Provisions and contingent liabilities

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present

legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events,

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required

to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future

operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of

management’s best estimate of the expenditure required

to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting

period. The discount rate used to determine the present

value is a pre tax rate that reflects current market

assessments of the time value of money and the risks

specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to

the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

Contingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect of possible

obligations that arise from past events but their existence

will be confirmed by the occurrence or non occurrence

of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within

the control of the Group or where any present obligation

cannot be measured in terms of future outflow of resources

or where a reliable estimate of the obligation cannot be

made.:
