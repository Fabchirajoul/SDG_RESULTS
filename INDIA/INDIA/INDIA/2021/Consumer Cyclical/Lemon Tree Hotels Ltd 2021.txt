Dear Shareholders,

I present to you the Annual

Report of your company for

FY21. We have witnessed a

difficult year on account of

the extended pandemic and

the horrific resurgence of

the virus during the second

wave, specifically in India.

The company has pursued

every avenue of revenue

generation and met the needs

of new travellers through

strategic partnerships,

service innovation and special

offers. Despite slow markets

throughout the country, we

opened five hotels during

FY21 in Dwarka, Goa, Jhansi,

vijaywada, Aligarh thereby

growing our destinations

from 48 to 51 y-o-y and our

chain-wide inventory to 8,294

rooms.

The continuing pandemic had

a profound global impact on

the hotel sector through all

12 months of the year. The

travel and hospitality industry

across the world has been one

of the most severely impacted

sectors. State governments

in India continuously moved

from a state of lockdown

and curfew to unlock and

back again (second wave).

The unanticipated mismatch

of supply of hospital beds

and oxygen facilities vis-a-

vis the demand for them,

Chairman’s: Letter

led to a national crisis in

March, April, May 2021.

Unexpectedly, a few hotels

became surrogate healthcare

facilities with hospital chains

coming forward to tie up

with them and setup medical

centers for asymptomatic/

mild cases. Lemon Tree was a

frontrunner in these strategic

partnerships. A number of

our large corporate customers

came forward to enter three-

way contracts with Lemon

Tree and the partner hospitals

for a fixed block of rooms to

be kept on standby for their

employees, should they need

assistance. The other key

sources of our business during

FY21 were Indians opting

for institutional quarantine,

business-continuity-planning

teams of global IT majors

(who occupied many of

our rooms in Hyderabad,

Bengaluru and Pune) and on-

duty doctors and paramedical

staff who were advised to

isolate themselves from their

families.

As the hospitality industry

prepared itself for the new

normal, the safety of our

guests and employees

remained of foremost

importance to us. We

continued to keep them safe

through our Rest Assured

by senior leadership (online-

offline hybrid) and continued

online training also supported

employees through this

difficult year.

The prolonged pandemic led

to a temporary shutdown

of ~50% of branded hotel

inventory in India during FY21.

The industry occupancy fell

from 65-68% last year to a

staggering low of ~35% in

FY21. This crash in demand

led to a steep correction in

average room rates (ADRs),

with the average industry

ADR dropping to about 50-

hygiene and sanitization

programmes, in partnership

with Diversey the global

leader in sanitization products.

In hotels where our rooms

were offered for institutional

quarantine, all Housekeeping

employees were provided PPE

suits to service guest floors.

Direct interaction with these

guests was restricted. We also

launched contactless dining

across our hotels, for quicker

and safer transactions. The

implementation of India’s

vaccination program started in

February 2021 and we moved

forward quickly to get our

employees vaccinated, in order

to make each of our hotels a

safe bio-bubble.

We maintained our cost-

alignment approach to

match the new and lower

levels of revenue, thereby

minimizing our losses. The

leadership team’s significant

pay cuts continued to help

maintain a leaner wage bill

throughout the year. Cost

control measures including

manpower costs, power

and fuel, lease rentals, etc.

were implemented across

the board. Our employee

engagement program helped

strengthen morale especially

through retention of all team

members. Regular interactions

Our employee engagement

program helped strengthen

morale especially

through retention of all

team members. Regular

interactions by senior

leadership (online-offline

hybrid) and continued

online training also

supported employees

through this difficult year.

60% of the previous year’s

level. This combined impact

resulted in great losses for the

hospitality industry, especially

because a substantial part of

operating expenses remained

‘fixed’ due to the nature of this

business. The absence of any

major relief measures from

the government, unlike in

most other countries, to

a sector which provides

8% of total employment

in India, did not help.

As a result, our prime

focus was to ‘variablize’

our fixed expenses as

much as possible and

defer all discretionary and

non-essential expenditure.

We however succeeded in

ensuring our aggregate

operating expenses were

brought below our operating

revenues in FY21.
