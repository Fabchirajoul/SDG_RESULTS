Dear Shareholders,

I sincerely hope you and your families

are staying safe and healthy. It has

been a very tough last few months,

as the pandemic gained frightening

proportions early this year, and

many of us were closely affected

by coronavirus.

2020-21 has been a vacillating year

for the world, as several countries

battled the pandemic. While countries

such as Europe and the United States

of America are gradually getting back

to normalcy, many other parts of the

world continue to remain impacted by

the pressures of the pandemic.

Our priority at Eicher Motors has been

to ensure the safety and wellbeing of

employees, partners and stakeholders.

To stand by employees and their

families in times of need, we built

several financial aid and support

programmes. Over and above the

Rs. 50 crores committed last year

towards COVID relief and long-

term rehabilitation, we committed

a fresh corpus of Rs. 20 crores this

year to further our relief efforts.

Our programmes as a part of this

commitment focus on building long-

term medical infrastructure, aiding

remote and rural communities, and

enabling local administrations with

immediate response measures. We’ve

commissioned an Oxygen Manifold

Plant at All India Institute of Medical

Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. We’ve

also undertaken several livelihood

initiatives for families that lost their

employment and have partnered with

local NGOs across the country to

develop long-term programmes aimed

at rebuilding communities in

remote areas.

While business was affected due to

the economic impact of the pandemic,

we continued to remain focussed

on our long-term objectives, while

safeguarding against near term

threats. Both at VECV and Royal

Enfield, we witnessed disruption of

production, supply-chain and retail

operations, and faced pressure on

profitability on account of increase in

input costs due to rise in commodity

prices and regulatory changes.

Our journey through the financial

year 2020-21, has not been much

different from Royal Enfield’s journey

over the last 120 years. Made Like

a Gun since 1901, Royal Enfield will

be 120 years old in 2021. Over the

last century and more, Royal Enfield

has navigated through some tough

corners and turbulent weather. The

last 120 years have been a journey of

undeterred resilience over time and

terrain; continuing to build timeless

classic motorcycles, and creating pure

motorcycling experiences.

Several achievements and initiatives

undertaken by VECV and Royal Enfield,

over the last year, demonstrate this

resilience and our purpose-driven

focus at Eicher. We are confident

about our robust fundamentals,

and are crystal clear about our

objectives and plans. Our razor-sharp

business focus, long-term thinking

and commitment, and our ability to

be agile and navigate short-term

challenges has helped us not just to

overcome a tough year, but emerge

stronger and wiser than before.

Before I begin to detail our financial

and operational achievements, I

would like to draw your attention to

the new format we’ve adopted for

reporting. It has been our endeavour

to develop a strategic vision for an

overall sustainable organisation. We

have been making steady progress on

Environmental, Social and Governance

(ESG) performance parameters. While

we have been showcasing our efforts

through the Sustainability Report over

the last couple of years, this time we

have transitioned to an Integrated

Report format.

The Integrated Reporting format

aims to explain how an organisation’s

strategy, governance, performance

and prospects lead to creation of

value over time for its shareholders.

Based on the Global Reporting

Initiative (GRI) framework, the

Integrated Report gives a more

holistic view of the organisation’s

value creation for all stakeholders

by closely monitoring six different

capitals - Financial, Manufacturing,

Intellectual, Human, Social and

Natural Capital.

royaL EnfiELd

For the year ended March 31, 2021,

EML’s consolidated net revenue from

operations (reflecting the business

of Royal Enfield motorcycles) was

Rs. 8,720 crores, EBITDA was Rs. 1,781

crores, and Profit After Tax was at

Rs. 1,347 crores.

As we rode through a year rife with

uncertainties and challenges, our

first and foremost priority at Royal

Enfield was to ensure the safety

and wellbeing of our employees and

staff, our partners, and communities

at large. Over the last year, most of

our employees continued to work

from home. At our plant facilities,

we continued production through

the year and maintained the utmost

priority for COVID appropriate

protocols.

To support our employees during

these tough times, we provided

medical and COVID insurance

facilities and set up Emergency

Response Teams across regions to

help affected people. We launched

V-Care, an exclusive, free of cost

online doctor consultation platform

for our employees. We also set up an

exclusive 70-bed, Covid Care Centre

in Chennai. We have also promised

2-years’ salary to the family and

education assistance to children of

employees who lose the battle against

the disease.

Additionally, to keep employees

engaged, motivated and ensure a

continual learning curve for them,

we curated several initiatives and

learning platforms for employees to
