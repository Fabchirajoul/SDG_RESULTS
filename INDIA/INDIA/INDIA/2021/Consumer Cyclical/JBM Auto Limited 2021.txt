LETTER FROM

THE CHAIRMAN’S DESK: Dear Shareholders,

It is a momentous occasion as I express my thoughts

on the 25th anniversary of JBM Auto Ltd, by way of

this Annual Report of the company for FY2020-21.

As I put my message forward on the 25th Annual

General Meeting of your company, a famous saying

resonates within me, “The most reliable way to

predict the future is to create it”. With this dream

in mind, we initiated our journey of excellence way

back in 1996. Our focus, then, was towards simpler

auto parts and components which gradually

transitioned to complex auto systems & assemblies

and today your company is manufacturing high

end buses which are successfully running across

various states of India. The journey in these 25

years has been wholesome, engaging and enriching

wherein JBM Auto has transformed from a product

centric approach to experience & solution-based

methodology. Our integral prerogative since our

inception has been our belief towards propelling

shared prosperity.

The global outlook continues to be highly uncertain

over a year after the pandemic erupted as new

mutations of the COVID19 virus continue to impact

lives, livelihoods, and sentiments The year gone by

has taken all of us through extremely difficult and

unforeseen situations both, at personal as well as

professional fronts. Despite all our limitations about

the understanding of COVID19, our resilience and

perseverance enabled us to learn and manoeuvre

ourselves through the new normal. At this juncture,

on behalf of the entire JBM family, I would like to

extend my gratitude to all the doctors, medical and

support staff who relentlessly stood in the line of

duty to save precious lives.

At JBM Auto Ltd., we have defied traditional

manufacturing methodologies by way of our

technology based green manufacturing approach

that reﬂects positively on the environment and

the society at large. Since our inception we have

evolved and come a long way. The automotive

industry today has entered the era of vehicles that

are autonomous, connected, electric and shared. At

the same time, the Indian auto industry is making

its mark in the global arena and hence undergoing

massive transformation in terms of technology,

governance, policy framework and international

collaborations.

This new age transformation at the point of

manufacturing and adoption of new-age advanced

technologies is paving a path for JBM Auto to grow

its business on the back of information and well-

informed decision making.

Like the global economy, the Indian economy too faced a setback due

to the pandemic. The quarterly growth turned sharply negative during

the first two quarters of FY2020-21, on account of stringent pan-India

lockdowns mandated to control the spread of the disease. With the

gradual lifting of restrictions on the movement of people and goods,

by the second half of the financial year the economy started showing

initial signs towards recovery. But despite these signs of recovery, the

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for FY2020-21 stood at -7.3% as

compared to 4.0% in FY2019-20.

The Indian auto components industry accounts for around 2.3% of

India’s GDP and 25% to the manufacturing GDP. During the five-year

period between FY16 to FY20, the Indian automotive components

industry registered a CAGR of 6%, to reach US$ 49.3 billion by FY20.

During the first half of FY 2020-21 (from April to September 2020),

the turnover of the automotive components industry stood at Rs.1.19

lakh crore (US$ 15.9 billion), registering a decline of 34% over the first

half of the previous year. Exports from this industry grew at a CAGR

of 7.6% during the same period to reach US$ 14.5 billion in FY20. As

per the Automobile Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA),

automobile component export from India is expected to reach US$ 80

billion by 2026.

Your company has taken giant strides in the EV space in the year gone

by. I am pleased to share that your company has commissioned an

end-to-end in-house E-Mobility platform to cater to the seamless

adoption and running of e-buses in the country. This e-mobility

platform has been commissioned in Navi Mumbai and Ahmedabad,

wherein your company is overseeing the complete ecosystem right

from bus operations to charging to maintenance. We are in advanced

stages of discussion with various state governments for replicating the

same in other cities and states as well in a very short turnaround time.

The OEM business of your company has been in expansion mode with

ECO-LIFE 100% Electric Bus now successfully plying in multiple cities of

the country, including Navi Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Port Blair and shall

soon be running in the Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru region. Our BS-VI

variant CITYLIFE was first ever city bus to ply on Indian roads post the

implementation of the new emission standards. Your company also

bagged the biggest order of 700 AC CNG and 200 electric buses from

Delhi Transport Corporation.

Our eco-friendly buses are being recognized for their state-of-the-

art technology and enhanced safety & comfort and have been aptly

felicitated with various prestigious awards.

In the auto component space, your company has redefined the

dynamics of the industry in the last 25 years. From humble beginnings

to a stage today where we manufacture almost 500,000 complex

auto systems & assemblies daily, your company is catering to global

OEMs such as Ford, VW, Honda, FCA, Renault, TATA Motors, M&M,

PSA and many more. Moreover, your company’s tooling development

capacities have grown 30-fold to 1500 dies and 500 fixtures and

robotic systems annually since inception. The tooling division has

transformed into India’s largest tooling business and a preferred

supplier for OEMs, delivering consistent growth of over 20% CAGR and

“Constantly think about how you could be

doing things better, keep questioning yourself”

– Elon Musk

KUMAR ARYA

C H A I R M A N

LETTER FROM

THE CHAIRMAN’S DESK

serving over 90% OEMs in India across PV, CV, Agri, 3W and 2W

segments. The tooling business has been recognized by various

OEMs such as Ford, M&M, Tata Motors, Isuzu, Escorts, etc. for

consistently delivering new products with timely development

and exceeding customer expectations. Further, your company

has been recently recognised by the prestigious ‘Economic Times

– Promising Plants 2021’ award. This recognition is bestowed to

manufacturing facilities that have not only scaled excellence but

are also setting new benchmarks for the industry.

Your company’s Skill Development Centre (SDC) is constantly

taking the lead in providing Apprenticeship Trainings to

Candidates who have completed their 10th Standard or higher,

including those who have secured ITIs, Diplomas or Engineering

degrees. In last 6 years, we have trained and placed more than

8000 candidates hailing from different parts of the country. As

the training courses have been customized on an ‘Earn & Learn’

principle, it has enabled your company to help under privileged

and tribal candidates.

As a responsible corporate citizen, it became imperative for

us to create an ecosystem around eco-consciousness, thereby,

subsequently scaling up the business on such foundations that

articulates our ethos and vision. Our employees, their families

coupled with our responsibility towards the society and Nation

at large continues to be an essential ingredient of the strategic

planning process of your company. It gives me immense pleasure

to inform you that this year a revolutionary initiative – Sankalp

Siddhi has been inducted that aims at elevating the skill sets and

invoking the latent talents of our employees and their families.

The success and eminence of JBM Auto as a market leader began

as a modest dream, to create JBM as an equivalent to ‘JBM Inside’

every vehicle running on Indian roads. In these 25 years, I am

proud to say that together we have come extremely close to

realizing that dream. However, this is just a beginning to newer

dreams and goals which will bring in greater sheen to our success

in the coming times.

Finally, it is critical for me to state that getting vaccinated,

wearing masks and maintaining social distancing is the only

approach to control the spread of the pandemic. I urge all to

follow these protocols so as to ensure safety for self and family.

Kindly continue to follow the directives issued by the government

and contribute towards saving the Nation from the possible third

wave of COVID19 pandemic.

To conclude, I extend my sincere appreciation to the management

and the staff of the company for their valued contribution, as

always. A big thanks to you, our valued stakeholders. Your faith

and trust in our capabilities keeps motivating us to transform and

grow from strength to strength.

Stay Healthy, Stay Safe

Thank You and Jai Hind.

Dear Shareholders,

Over the last 25 years, it has been our motto to promote collaborative

growth, collaborative learning and collaborative evolution by adopting

a responsible business approach. We have been clearly conscious

towards curating our offerings and solutions with an intent to enrich

and empower lives of the people. Technology and innovation coupled

with the right talent have been the key catalysts that have driven our

journey of excellence since 1996.

The year 2020 will be etched as the most unpredictable year of modern

human history. It compelled each one of us to stop and switch over

to ‘survival mode’ and lead to severe business disruptions. The fact

that such situation may arise was inconceivable until COVID19 actually

happened. The pandemic is unprecedented in terms of its impact on

people, industry & economy with extreme consequences, in other

words a ‘Black Swan’ event.

At JBM Auto, we utilised this time constructively bringing out the true

spirit of perseverance in all of us. Our philosophy to remain agile and

frugal empowered us to react to the situation sensibly. With a legacy

of winning against the odds we adapted swiftly to the demands of

the ‘new normal’ while incorporating preventive measures in our ways

of working. With the Business Contingency Plan in place well within

time, we were amongst the first to resume production in May 2020.

We ensured enforcement of strict policies and protocols to safeguard

our employees and not compromise on customers’ expectations and

delivery standards.

Your company has been looking at the silver lining of opportunities

even in these toughest of times. This is a historic year for the company

in terms of completing 25 years of a phenomenal journey wherein each

of our business divisions strategized its own goals and path distinctly.

JBM Auto is the only company in India to have transformed into an

OEM from Auto component manufacturing within only 20 years of

its inception. Today, it gives me immense confidence to share that all

our business divisions are equally robust and hold market leadership

position in their own specific domains. We have worked progressively

towards streamlining each of the businesses by means of enhancing

our product portfolio, reducing time to market, optimising the total

cost of ownership, thereby, maximising stakeholder value.

The Government has encouraged purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles

by announcing the vehicle scrappage policy recently to phase out

old and unfit vehicles. It is estimated that this move will encourage

use of fuel-efficient, environment-friendly vehicles, thereby reducing

vehicular pollution and oil import cost. Additionally, a Rs. 18,000

crore scheme was announced to give impetus to bus-based public

transportation in India. This will act as a catalyst for faster growth in

the Indian automobile sector. India is on a national mission of electric

mobility and faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles

(EVs). India’s 2030 EV ambitions, signalled by NITI Aayog, states that 70

per cent of all commercial cars, 30 per cent of private cars, 40 per cent

of buses, and 80 per cent of two-wheeler and three-wheeler sales in

2030 would be of EVs. To meet India’s electric vehicle (EV) ambitions, a

cumulative investment of ~Rs. 12.5 trillion (US$ 180 billion) in vehicle

production and charging infrastructure would be required until 2030.

This is likely to boost the demand of auto components from local

manufacturers. Your company is ready to act on the given opportunity

with utmost vigour and agility.

Your company’s tooling division is one of the largest tooling businesses

in India and is also the most preferred supplier by OEMs. We have

constantly endeavored to upskill our product base and add value

added products such as tooling for skin panels, high tensile parts and

dies. Recently, we made our foray into the specialized and niche area of

robotics and automation. The tooling division has expertise to execute

turnkey projects for OEMs via delivering end-to-end tooling solutions

for dies and welding lines. Last year, we expanded our product portfolio

by developing dies for Skin Panels for two wheelers. Our focus is on

keeping pace with upcoming technologies and expanding the product

base with progressive dies.

JBM Auto has been the first public transport provider to have run

BS-VI buses in India in the capital city of New Delhi. Further, as the

torch bearer of driving sustainability and green environment initiatives,

your company is a pioneer towards creating its end-to-end e-mobility

ecosystem, under the government’s Make in India initiative. This fiscal

our ECO-LIFE 100% electric city buses have been deployed in the states

of Gujarat and Andaman as well. JBM ECO-LIFE buses have already

been plying in Navi Mumbai since Oct 2019. This electric bus operation

will provide estimated savings of around 1.5 million litres of diesel and

20000 tonnes of CO2. ECO-LIFE buses have already covered over 20 lac

e-kms pan India since deployment. JBM Auto was felicitated with the

‘Electric Bus Manufacturer of the year’ award for our ECO-LIFE series

of electric buses at the EV Manufacturing and Design Show India 2021

Awards. As a responsible organisation, we have committed to clock

over 1 billion e-kms over the next 3-4 years.

The future of mobility in India and globally is evolving rapidly towards

becoming more electrified and environment friendly, while delighting

end users with superior experiences. The pace of progress is exciting

in the EV space with special focus on public transportation. Your

company’s R&D team has developed a long-term strategy in line

with the Automotive Mission Plan 2026. This roadmap is much in line

‘Let’s go invent tomorrow rather

than worrying about what

happened yesterday’.
