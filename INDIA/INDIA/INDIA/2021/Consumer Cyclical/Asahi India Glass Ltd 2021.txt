Dear Shareholders,

The year gone by has had profound

implications on millions around the

world. The COVID-19 pandemic has

proven to be not just a health crisis

but a socio-economic one as well,

causing myriad challenges for lives and

livelihoods. My thoughts and prayers

remain with the people and families who

have suffered losses in this time. I am

sure you all are following the prescribed

precautions to stay safe.

As the world witnessed the worst

recession in recent history, India,

too, reeled under the pressure of the

pandemic. The first quarter of FY 2020-21

saw India’s GDP growth rate plunge to

24.4%. The Government of India, along

with the Reserve Bank of India, akin to

their global counterparts, introduced a

broad array of measures to prop up the

economy and extend liquidity support to

the financial markets and those hardest

hit by the lockdowns. These measures

helped in part to revive the economy; the

GDP growth rate turned around to 1.6% in

the fourth quarter of FY 2020-21. While the

de-growth for the full year is estimated

at 7.3%, the outlook for the subsequent

fiscals is largely positive. The pace of the

mass vaccination drive and sustained

government support will hold the key, as

new virus mutations heighten risks.

This pandemic has impacted our key

growth-driving automotive industry.

Already grappling with a cyclical

slowdown that arose on account

of regulatory reforms, lower credit

availability, falling demand and

decreased discretionary spending – the

auto industry was dealt a fresh blow in

2020. The lockdowns hurt the industry’s

complex supply chains and brought

manufacturing to a near standstill. During

FY 2020-21, the sales of Passenger Vehicles

reduced by 2.24% and Commercial

Vehicles by 20.77%. Production in

both Medium & Heavy Commercial

Vehicles and Light Commercial Vehicles

segments reduced by 28.40% and

17.30%, respectively. However, the

overall situation has started to look up,

as global supply chains rebalance, the

Government encourages exports and

pent-up demand finds release. With the

Government bringing out a revamped

scrappage policy, the resale market

shall also pick up pace. The industry is

expected to recover in FY 2021-22.

Futhermore, a slowdown in the

residential housing market was

witnessed even before the pandemic

appears to have bottomed out in

the first quarter of FY 2020-21. While

the recovery was slow after the first

wave, the market picked up pace in

the second half of the year. Residential

housing property registration and

sales across major cities exceeded their

pre-pandemic average levels during the

third and fourth quarters of FY 2020-21.

This was aided by reductions in stamp

duty in some states; release of pent-up

demand; moderation in interest rates and

arrival of vaccines. However, it remains

to be seen how the emerging risks play

out: the spike in commodity prices, such

as steel, cement, copper and aluminium,

and intermittent lockdowns could put

pressure on housing prices and new

project launches, respectively.

The retail real estate segment is expected

to experience a long-drawn recovery,

given that store expansions have

decreased drastically and mall operators

are still adapting to the post-pandemic

social behaviour. When it comes to the

commercial segment, it will be important

to distinguish between the transitory

and the lasting effects of the pandemic.

Despite work-from-home being the

prevailing norm, the importance of

physical office space has not diminished.

Further, the establishment of REITs

will likely benefit investors as well as

developers, unlocking the value of their

assets. As the vaccination coverage

expands, corporate occupiers are

cautiously optimistic. FY 2020-21 is

expected to witness close to 38 million

sq. ft. of new completions, while net

absorption is likely to hover around the

30 million sq. ft. – at par with the average

annual net absorption levels seen during

2016-2018.

AIS performance during FY 2020-21

mirrored the movement of these two

industries, given the Company’s close

relation with both. Consolidated revenue

stood at ` 2,457.48 crores in FY 2020-21, a

7.48% drop over ` 2,656.13 crores achieved

in FY 2019-20. Net profit before tax stood

at ` 204.86 crores in FY 2020-21, a 20.02%

rise over ` 170.69 crores achieved in

FY 2019-20. Net profit after tax stood at

` 133.07 crores in FY 2020-21, a 13.43%

drop over ` 153.72 crores achieved

in FY 2019-20. In view of the financial

performance of AIS in FY 2020-21, and in

line with AIS’s Dividend Policy, the Board

has recommended a final dividend of

` 1 per share.

While FY 2020-21 was a uniquely difficult

year, it was also a time, in which we

discovered the full measure of our

strength and resilience as a company and

our capacity to adapt, sustain, improve

and grow. This year, more than ever, we

have seen the Company culture in action,

valuing care, empathy and agility. I must

pause here to commend the extraordinary

efforts of our people. I want to express my

heartfelt gratitude to all my colleagues,

and special thanks to those who have

continued to work daily in our plants,

offices, assembly units and on sites at

customers throughout the pandemic.

AIS’s newest greenfield plant at Patan,

Gujarat became operational and has

achieved a manufacturing industry

landmark. In its journey to be certified

by the Indian Green Building Council

(IGBC) and the Leadership in Energy

and Environmental Design (LEED)

programme, AIS used high-performance

glass in the factory façade. Additionally,

notable improvements were made to

contain costs, maintain rigorous fiscal

discipline, prioritise investments and

digitalise processes and ways of working.

Our unwavering focus on quality, the

enduring breadth of our portfolio, the

strategic proximity to our customers

and our thirst for innovation together

helped us to take a strides in our existing

markets. The restrictions on movement

meant our teams showed the flexibility

required to connect with customers

and prospects virtually and meet their

glass needs. Our range of digital apps

and platforms provide a seamless bridge

between the Company and its customer

base, immersing the latter in a meaningful

experience. Our new AIS Experience

Centre in Gurugram is an extension of this

very philosophy.

The scope of innovation at AIS is not limited

to our products or routes-to-market.

We believe that our vision to See More

cannot be achieved without integrating

environmental and social considerations

into everything we do. Therefore, we

are making efforts to innovate at every

turn and ensure our value chains are

sustainable – from plugging any further

leakages and wastages in our operations,

to conserving resources and recycling

and reusing materials. Our projects in the

community too gain from our innovative

perspective. As the lockdowns curtailed

mobility, our teams worked remotely, so

that thousands of people could continue

to benefit in the areas of education, skill

development and women empowerment.

This fiscal, Ms. Sheetal Kapal Mehta

joined us as an independent director.

I heartily welcome Ms. Sheetal Kapal

Mehta, on the Board of AIS. I’m certain her

rich experience and expertise will be of

significant value to our Company.

FY 2020-21 underlined once again that

we are a resilient and purpose-driven

business. It has also compelled us to ask

ourselves what we need to do differently

and what we need to further improve, so

that AIS remains relevant and successful

– particularly at a time when India will

seek to achieve its growth potential firmly

on the back of its core sectors. AIS will

continue to take a disciplined approach

to innovation, market penetration,

productivity and sustainability. Even

though the recovery from the COVID-19

pandemic will not be simple or

straightforward, my greatest source of

confidence is the passion for learning of

our people.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to

thank our entire stakeholder fraternity

– our customers, employees, partners,

suppliers, shareholders, bankers,

policymakers, regulatory authorities

and the communities around our

manufacturing plants – for their support

and encouragement during these trying

circumstances. Together, we move

forward with the resolve that we keep

growing through change and challenge.

With Best Regards,

B. M. Labroo

Chairman

Act, 2013.

Asahi India Glass Ltd:

Managing Director and Chief

Executive Officer of the Company has been identified as

CODM and responsible for allocating the resources, assess

the financial performance of segments and position of the

Company and makes strategic decisions.

The Company has identified two reportable segments

“Automotive Glass” and “Float Glass” based on the

information reviewed by the CODM. Refer note.40 for

“Segment Information” presented.

s)

Provisions and Contingent Liabilities

A provision is recognised if as a result of a past event, the

Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive)

that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an

outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the

obligation. Provisions are recognised at the best estimate of

the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at

the Balance Sheet date. If the effect of time value of money

is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre tax

rate that reflects, when appropriate the risks specific to the

liability.

A contingent liability exists when there is a possible but

not probable obligation, or a present obligation that may,

but probably will not, require an outflow of resources, or

a present obligation whose amount cannot be estimated

reliably. Contingent liabilities do not warrant provisions but

are disclosed unless the possibility of outflow of resources

is remote. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor

disclosed in the Standalone Financial Statements. However,

when the realisation of income is virtually certain then the

related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is

appropriate.

Research and Development

Revenue expenditure on research and development is

charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss of the year in

which it is incurred.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional

judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the

Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements of the current period.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the

Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements as a whole, and in

forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate

opinion on these matters.

We have determined that there are no other key audit matters to

communicate in our report.

Information other than the Ind AS Financial

Statements and Auditors’ Report thereon

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for

the other information. The other information comprises the

information included in the annual report, but does not include

the Consolidated Financial Statements and our auditors’ report

thereon.

Our opinion on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements does

not cover the other information and we do not express any form

of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial

Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and,

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially

inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be

materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed,

we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other

information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing

to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged

with Governance for the Consolidated Ind AS

Financial Statements

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for

the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Ind AS

Financial Statements in terms of the requirements of the Companies

Act, 2013 that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial

To the Members of

Asahi India Glass Limited

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS

Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Ind AS Financial

Statements of Asahi India Glass Limited (hereinafter referred to as

the “Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company

and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), its

associates which comprise the consolidated Balance Sheet as at

31st March, 2021, and the consolidated Statement of Profit and

Loss, the consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the

consolidated Cash Flows Statement for the year then ended, and

notes to the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements, including

a summary of significant accounting policies (hereinafter referred

to as “the Consolidated Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according

to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated Ind

AS Financial Statements give the information required by the

Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give

a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles

generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of

the Group as at 31st March, 2021, of its consolidated profit including

other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and

its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on

Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our

responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS

Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent

of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by The

Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and we have fulfilled

our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the provisions

of the Companies Act, 2013. We believe that the audit evidence

we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis

for our opinion.

Emphasis of Matters/Other Matters

We draw attention to Emphasis of Matters/Other Matters

paragraph in Auditors’ Reports of three subsidiary companies

regarding accumulated losses and resultant effect on their net

worth and current liabilities exceeding current assets. However the

same does not have any adverse impact on going concern status

of the Group as a whole.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

of certain assets and liabilities carried at fair values by Ind AS.

gains on transactions between group companies are

eliminated.

Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the

transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the

transferred asset.

iv)

Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed

where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies

adopted by the Group.

v)

The consolidated Financial Statements have been

prepared using uniform accounting policies for like

transactions and other events in similar circumstances

and are presented to the extent possible in the

same manner as the Company’s separate Financial

Statements.

assets of the Consolidated Financial Statements is

computed and shown separately.

Asahi India Glass Ltd:

Managing Director and Chief

Executive Officer of the Company has been identified as

CODM and is responsible for allocating the resources,

assesses the financial performance of segments and position

of the Group and makes strategic decisions.

The Group has identified two reportable segments

“Automotive Glass” and “Float Glass” based on the

information reviewed by the CODM. Refer Note 37 for

segment information presented.

s)

Provisions and Contingent Liabilities

A provision is recognised if as a result of a past event, the

Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive)

that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an

outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the

obligation. Provisions are recognised at the best estimate of

the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at

the Balance Sheet date. If the effect of time value of money

is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre tax

rate that reflects, when appropriate the risks specific to the

liability.

A contingent liability exists when there is a possible but

not probable obligation, or a present obligation that may,

but probably will not, require an outflow of resources, or

a present obligation whose amount cannot be estimated

reliably. Contingent liabilities do not warrant provisions but

are disclosed unless the possibility of outflow of resources

is remote. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor

disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However,

when the realisation of income is virtually certain then the

related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is

appropriate.

t)

Research and Development

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Product

development costs are capitalised when technical and

commercial feasibility of the products is demonstrated,

future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an

intention and ability to complete and use or sell the product

and the cost can be measured reliably. In other cases such

development costs are taken to the Statement of Profit and

Loss. The costs which can be capitalised include the cost

of material, direct labour, overhead costs that are directly

attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.

fluctuations. The instruments are confined mainly to

forward contracts, certain other derivative financial

instruments and interest rate swaps.

Derivatives are initially accounted for and measured at

fair value from the date derivatives contract is entered

into and subsequently remeasured to their fair value at

the end of each reporting period.

l)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash

flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand,

demand deposits with banks, short term balances, highly

liquid investments that are readily convertible into known

amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk

of changes in value. Book overdrafts are shown within Other

Financial Liabilities in the Balance Sheet and form part of cash

and cash equivalents in the Cash Flow Statement.

m)

Taxes on income

Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax

and deferred tax.

Current tax charge is based on taxable profit for the year.

Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the Statement

of Profit and Loss because some items of income or expense

are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be

taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is

calculated using Indian tax rates and laws that have been

enacted by the reporting date.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a

legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against

current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes

levied by the same taxation authority.

The Group periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax

returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax

regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes

provisions where appropriate.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable

in the future arising from temporary differences between the

carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet

and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of

taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised

for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets

are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable

profits will be available against which deductible temporary

differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated at the

tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the

liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that

have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting

date.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are off set against

each other and the resultant net amount is presented in the

Balance Sheet if and only when the Group currently has a

obligations. The estimate of future salary increases

considered takes into account the inflation, seniority,

promotion and other relevant factors. The expected

rate of return of plan assets is the Group’s expectation

of the average long term rate of return expected on

investments of the fund during the estimated term of

the obligations. Plan assets are measured at fair value

as at the Balance Sheet date.

iii)

Other Long Term Benefit Plans

The liabilities for earned leave are not expected to be

settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the

period in which the employees render the related

service. They are therefore measured as the present

value of expected future payments to be made in

respect of services provided by employees up to the

end of the reporting period using the Projected Unit

Credit Method. The benefits are discounted using the

market yields at the end of the reporting period that

have terms approximating to the terms of the related

obligation. Re-measurements as a result of experience

adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are

recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.

iv)

The expenditure on voluntary retirement scheme is

charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year

in which it is incurred.

o)

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit

for the period attributable to the owners of Group by the

weighted average number of equity shares outstanding

during the period. The weighted average number of equity

shares outstanding during the period and for all periods

presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other

than the conversion of potential equity shares that have

changed the number of equity shares outstanding without

a corresponding change in resources. For the purposes of

calculating diluted earnings per share the profit for the period

attributable to the owners of the Group and the weighted

average number of shares outstanding during the period is

adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

p)

Non Current Assets Held for Sale

Non current assets are classified as held for sale if their

carrying amount will be recovered principally through a

sale transaction rather than continuing use and a sale is

considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower

of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.

Non current assets are not depreciated or amortised while

they are classified as held for sale.

Non current assets classified as held for sale are presented

separately from the other assets in the Balance Sheet.
