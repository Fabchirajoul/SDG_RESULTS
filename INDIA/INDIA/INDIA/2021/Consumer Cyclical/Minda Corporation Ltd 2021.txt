We have still some way to go in

this journey, but clearly everyone

in Spark Minda is on board for this

journey, which is also the theme

of the annual report – ‘Narrowing

Focus, Deepening Capability’.

“Do whatever you do intensely.” —Robert Henri

Such a narrow focus has made things easier for everyone at

Spark Minda. Our people are aligned more clearly and our story

to the market and our customers is certainly simple, clearer

and more succinct. It has helped to deepen our capabilities in

these limited areas and invest more in few high value products.

Beyond products, this way of thinking is imperative in the way

we work with our customers. We have been working to ensure

that our customer experience is laser-focused as we not only

address the user needs but also helping plug in the gaps and

get more value per customer.

We have still some way to go in this journey, but clearly

everyone in Spark Minda is on board for this journey, which

is also the theme of the annual report – ‘Narrowing Focus,

Deepening Capability’.:

Dear Shareholders,

These are extremely difficult, uncertain times. In such a time, I

hope and pray for the safety of all our shareholder members

and their families. Additionally, I hope that you and your family

members are safe and following all safety protocols, precautions

and guidelines in days of these crisis. With the second wave

hitting India hard, it becomes extremely important to take

all necessary precautions and adhere to the Government’s

guidelines as this is the only way we can protect ourselves

against the Coronavirus.

FY21 was an extremely challenging and difficult year for all of us.

You are aware that the COVID-19 pandemic raged across the

world. In India, we saw the fiscal beginning on a cautious note

as the country was under a lockdown. This saw mass exodus of

the migrant population from the cities. The other issue related

to the lockdown (and specially the first quarter of the fiscal)

was the plummeting demand for products and services. It was

an extremely tough quarter for us as well and we reported

a quarterly loss of on the operational front, something that

we have not seen in a long time. A look at the auto industry

numbers gives a sense of the challenges we were facing.

According to data from the Society of Indian Automobile

Manufacturers, the automotive industry saw a whopping decline

of 79% in its Q1 numbers. While the industry did see demand

revival in in the subsequent quarters, it still could not avoid a

contraction in the numbers and posted a 13.6% decline for FY21

over its previous year. Each segment in the industry bore the

brunt of the pandemic. The Passenger Vehicle segment was

down by 2.2% with a total sale of 2.7 million units, as compared

to 2.8 million units for FY20. A clear slowdown of economic

activity and other issues played up for the Commercial Vehicle

segment which continued to show a year-on-year decline

in FY21 of 20.8%. The volume driver for the industry, Two

wheelers and Three wheelers accounting for over 80% of the

total units sold in the country, saw negative growth of 13.2%

and a whopping 66.1% respectively for the year. Despite these

challenges and uncertainties, I am delighted to report that your

Company closed the fiscal with a top line of ` 2,3679 million with

growth of 6.5% and a net profit of ` 935 million from continued

operations.

However, we do not look at such a bounce back from a quarter

or two perspective. It is a testimony of our culture of resilience

and optimism where we have learnt to treat challenges as

opportunities. We have narrowed our focus and have deepened

our capabilities as I think this will help us create value for all

our stakeholders. We have been working on three aspects -

Enhancing the Core, Technology & Digitization, and Customer

Centricity. Each of these focus areas implies that we are working

on building deep capabilities in what we consider the core of the

business. For instance, with ‘Enhancing the Core’ we are working

on getting the Cost leadership position in operations, we have a

greater focus on ensuring manufacturing excellence and sourcing;

improving working capital, employee cost and raw material cost;

ensuring that the Wiring Harness division get closer to double digit

Chairman’s: Letter

to Shareholders

continue to streamline our cost structure,

we will ensure investment in R&D, brand

building,

digitalisation

and

building

capability internally. We are ready to take

on any challenges!

I take this opportunity to thank each

one of you for continuing to believe

in our vision and work. Equally I like to

acknowledge the contribution of all

our employees, network and business

partners and customers for reposing

faith in Minda Corporation and actively

working for our combined success.

2.38 Leases

As a Lessee

The Company has adopted Ind AS 116 'Leases' with the date of initial application being 1 April 2019. Ind AS 116 replaces Ind AS

17 – Leases and related interpretation and guidance. The Company has applied Ind AS 116 using the modified retrospective

approach, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at 1 April 2019.

The Company has applied the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. This means that it will

apply Ind AS 116 to all contracts entered into before 1 April 2019 and identified as leases in accordance with Ind AS 17.

The Company has discounted lease payments using the applicable incremental borrowing rate as at 1 April 2019, which is 9.5%

for measuring the lease liability.
