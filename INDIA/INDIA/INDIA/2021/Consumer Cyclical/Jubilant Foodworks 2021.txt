Jubilant FoodWorks Limited:

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

We sincerely hope that all of you are safe

and in good health. We are delighted

to write to you at the end of what has

been quite a tumultuous year, which has

forever altered the way we look at society

and do business. Against a challenging

backdrop, JFL’s business remained

resilient, shouldered by our diverse

product portfolio and experienced Board

and management team.

Our workforce is our most valuable

asset as the growth and success of our

Company depends on the contribution of

our people. We firmly believe that behind

outstanding business performance,

there is always the tireless effort of many

hands, those who are rarely visible but

always indispensable. This year, we

want to express our humble and sincere

gratitude to these unsung heroes. Our

success and growth are the result of and

a tribute to the passion and commitment

of our team members. A cross-functional

taskforce was formed that extended

medical and other assistance 24x7 to

all those in need. We set up several

COVID-19 isolation centres across

the country and established oxygen

concentrator banks across key towns.

We take this opportunity to thank them

all for their contribution. Our response

to the pandemic, while being carefully

considered and planned, was also prompt

and decisive. The senior management

team demonstrated exceptional

leadership in defining key priorities – to

protect our people, our business and cash

– and acting effectively on those priorities.

Our people responded in a positive and

energetic manner and as a result of their

efforts we have weathered the storm

successfully so far. With the second

wave of the pandemic, in India, showing

signs of waning and the vaccination drive

gathering strong momentum, we believe

the return to normalcy, albeit an altered

one, is fast approaching.

Our revenue from operations stood at

₹32,689 million. EBITDA came to ₹7,666

million at 23.5% of revenue, up by 88 bps

y-o-y. Profit After Tax stood at ₹2,337

million at 7.1% of revenue.

JFL introduce strict protocol on food safety and ensure quick

reopening of its restaurants. A centralised distribution point

for restaurants enabled proactive service resumption. The

Company also worked with its vendors and transporters to

ensure that supply was not impacted, and therefore, it had

supply continuity across its restaurants.
