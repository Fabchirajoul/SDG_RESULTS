51 Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic:

The spread of COVID-19 has severely impacted businesses around the globe. While the Company’s operations and the

financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 were adversely impacted, the Company experienced significant

recovery beginning from the quarter ended September 30, 2020.

The situation is constantly evolving and Governments in certain states have imposed various restrictions with the

increase in the number of COVID 19 cases during the month of March 2021. The Company has considered various

internal and external information available up to the date of approval of financial statements in assessing the impact

of COVID-19 pandemic on the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021. The uncertainty caused by the

current situation is causing delays in the confirmation of customer orders and in executing the orders in hand and

increase in lead times in sourcing components. Besides the volatility in commodity prices, container availability and

increasing shipping costs are causing inefficiencies and cost challenges in both inbound and outbound supply chain.

The situation is likely to continue for next few quarters based on the current assessment. The Company is actively

monitoring the pandemic situation and its impact on the sales performance across its geographies and taking necessary

actions to contain costs to reduce the impact of revenue compression from COVID-19.

recoverability and carrying values of its assets comprising Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets, Trade receivables,

Inventory and Investments as at the balance sheet date and has concluded that there are no material adjustments required

continuous process given the uncertainties associated with its nature and duration. The Company will continue to

monitor any material changes to the future economic conditions.
