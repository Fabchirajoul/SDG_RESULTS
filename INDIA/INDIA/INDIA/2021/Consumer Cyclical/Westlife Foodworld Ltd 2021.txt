The Group had preferred an appeal before the Maharashtra Sales Tax Tribunal against a demand

of H2.41 million (Previous Year: 2.41 million) against the appeal order passed by the Joint

Commissioner of Sales Tax (Appeal) II Mumbai on account of disallowance of resale of toys

and cheese and taxability of Birthday Party Income for the year 2003-04. The Maharashtra Sales

Tax Tribunal has partly allowed the appeal in case of Birthday party income and dismissed the

claim of resale sale. The Group has filed Rectification Application before the Maharashtra Sales

Tax Tribunal, Mumbai following apparent errors made in the judgment.

Secondly, the Group has preferred an appeal before Joint Commissioner of Sales Tax (Appeal)

II Mumbai against demand of H1.64 million (Previous Year H1.64 million) as per order passed

by assessing officer on account of disallowance of resale of toys and cheese and taxability

of Birthday Party Income for the year 2004-05. The appeal is pending before the Joint

Commissioner of Sales Tax. The Group has deposited an aggregate amount of H1.53 million as

part payment as directed by the said authorities for both the years.

During the financial year 2013-14, the Group had received demand notices aggregating to H97.39

million for the years 2008-09 to 2012-13 issued by the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial

Taxes, Tamil Nadu towards Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax. The Group had filed an appeal before

the Appellate Deputy Commissioner against the aforesaid demand and had paid H97.39 million

under protest. During the previous years, the Appellate Deputy Commissioner has dismissed

the appeal against by the Group and the Group had filed an appeal before Tribunal against the

order of Appellate Deputy Commissioner. Based on the advice of external counsel, the Group

believes it has good ground for the appeal to be decided in its favour. Accordingly, no provision

is considered necessary in this matter.

iii During the year 2013-14, the Group had received demand notices of H553.71 million for the

period December, 2008 to October, 2013 from the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial

Taxes, Karnataka alleging that the Group had obtained capital goods from other states, and

therefore is ineligible to avail of the benefits of lower rate of tax under the composition scheme

contemplated under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003. In respect of the various notices,

the Group had filed two writ petitions before the High Court of Karnataka. Upon hearing, both

petitions were admitted and the Court granted an interim stay on the operation of all the notices

and on the order passed for the FY 2012-13 and any proceedings in connection therewith.

The said writ petitions came to be disposed of by a single judge of the Hon’ble High Court of:
