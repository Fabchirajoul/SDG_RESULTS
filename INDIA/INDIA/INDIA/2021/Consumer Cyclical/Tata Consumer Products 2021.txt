ABOUT THIS REPORT

Reporting Approach

The report reflects our integrated

thinking and approach to value

creation. It provides a holistic

view of our Strategy, Governance

and Performance, and how they

work together to create value

over the short, medium, and long

term for our stakeholders.

Reporting Principles

The financial and statutory data

presented in this report is in line with

the requirements of the Companies Act,

2013 (and the rules made thereunder);

Indian Accounting Standards; the

Securities and Exchange Board of India

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure

Requirements) Regulations, 2015; and

Leadership Accountability

The Company’s Senior Management,

under the: Managing

letter

Building a stronger

organisation.

Intrinsically.: Dear Shareholders

I am pleased to write to you on the

performance of Tata Consumer for the

financial year 2020-21.

The last year has presented unprecedented

challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic;

it has been a time of significant upheaval

and a test of resilience. Yet, it led us to adapt,

re-orient and accelerate learning while

keeping the safety of our employees and

business ecosystem partners, at the forefront.

In line with our ambition to become a

formidable player in the FMCG industry,

Tata Consumer embarked on a transformation

journey and we made significant progress

despite the pandemic. As a first step, the

integration of the India Foods and Beverages

business has been substantially completed and

we have started to see synergy benefits from

this integration.

Additionally, during the last fiscal, we have

delivered robust broad-based growth across

all our businesses and strong financial

performance across all metrices, despite

a challenging operating environment.

Importantly, we have focused on putting in

place the right building blocks for the future.

These include identifying our strategic priorities,

implementing an integrated organisation

structure, investing in capabilities and talent,

and driving digital to name a few. With these

building blocks in place, Tata Consumer is well

positioned for accelerated growth. As Mahatma

Gandhi said, “The future depends on what

you do today.” Building on the foundation we

have and executing against our strategy will

be critical for consistent value creation for our

shareholders going forward.

Another key area we have focused on is the

product portfolio of our Company, which has

been enhanced through targeted acquisitions.

We now have a portfolio which covers

tea, coffee, water, salt, pulses, spices,

ready-to-cook offerings, breakfast cereals,

snacks, and mini meals. We have also stepped

up the pace of innovation across markets in

line with consumer trends such as health and

wellness and convenience.
