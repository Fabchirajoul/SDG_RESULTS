STOP@NOTHING

The global automotive

industry was undergoing

a paradigm shift when

a once-in-a-century

pandemic emerged to

effect a tectonic shift in

the way of life for people

worldwide. Lockdowns

were imposed with

severe restrictions on

mobility and physical

proximity, bringing

economic activities to a

near standstill and putting

individual and business

resilience to test.

At Varroc, we not only managed to navigate

these extraordinary times by relying on the

inherent strengths of our business model, but

also have positioned ourselves favourably

to shift gears for the next leg of our growth

journey. In the past three years, we have added

significant capacity to drive rapid revenue

growth and expanded our product portfolio to

capture the emerging trends in EV transition,

emission norms and integration

of lighting with electronics.

Our strong in-house technology and R&D

capabilities are a result of our relentless focus

on bringing the most technologically advanced

solutions to the mass market. We are further

sharpening our innovation focus to improve

wallet share and further diversify our customer

base while improving capacity utilisation and

operational efficiency to drive up margins.

Inspired by the collective efforts of our people

and other stakeholders, we continued to make

progress on our social and environmental

commitments while providing world-class

services to our customers and supporting our

suppliers in their time of need. As the world

leaves the pandemic behind and looks for

innovative, safe and environment-friendly

mobility solutions for the future, we are

ready to go full throttle in the auto

component supply chain.:

Dear Shareholders,

The world is going through a

major health crisis and a resultant

economic slowdown. As we were

preparing to leave the pandemic

behind, a more intense second

wave led to renewed lockdowns,

albeit impacts were mostly

localised. We had to close our

plants during the initial part

of the year, and continued to

face supply chain issues such

as semiconductor shortages

especially in the fourth quarter.

During these testing times, we

focused primarily on protecting

our employees, customers and

our business operations while

extending support to other

stakeholders such as suppliers

and community to tide over the

crisis.

That said, the automotive

industry is going through rapid

changes, with growing demand

for personal mobility solutions

that are safe and environment

friendly, connected, autonomous

and electric. These evolving

trends present us significant

opportunities, and we are well

poisoned to capitalise on them

with our extensive manufacturing

footprint globally and strong

innovation focus.

Performance review

In 2020, the global automotive

production fell sharply, by

15.8% Y-o-Y, with the major

auto markets of Europe,

North America and China

declining by 21.6%, 20.5%

and 2.0%, respectively. The

Indian automobile industry

Against this extremely

challenging backdrop,

we reported a 1.63% Y-o-Y

increase in revenue to

K1,13,027 million in FY2021,

despite Q1 being a washout

quarter. Growth was mainly driven

by higher rural demand

in India and VLS. ”

We are currently focusing on cost

optimisation, positive free cashflow and debt

reduction. Also, we are working to control

our capex and working capital.

saw negative growth across

all vehicle segments with 2W

industry registering a 12.8%

Y-o-Y decline in production

volumes. The 3W segment

reported a 46.1% decline in the

overall production volume during

FY2021.

Against this extremely

challenging backdrop, we

reported a 1.63% Y-o-Y increase

in revenue to `1,13,027 million

in FY2021, despite Q1 being

a washout quarter. Growth

was mainly driven by higher

rural demand in India and

VLS. Our newly commissioned

VLS plants also contributed

to growth. Our India business

witnessed a 4.3% Y-o-Y decline

in revenue, offset by the

lighting business (VLS) with a

5.3% increase.

We saw a strong recovery in two-

wheeler and passenger vehicle

sales in India. The global (ex.

China) passenger vehicle volumes

could not sustain its recovery

owing due to semi-conductor

shortages. As the current

demand for chips is continuing

to outstrip supply, suppliers are

adding capacities. This additional

capacity is expected to come

on stream in the second half of

FY2022.

I am happy to inform you that

in FY2021 our India business

was able to secure overall net

business wins of `13 billion

equivalent annual revenue

and almost `11 billion of these

orders were new business wins.

These orders include our new

technology-driven products for

EV, such as DC to DC converters,

battery management systems and

telematics – a sizeable portion

came from a new customer, both

in two wheelers and passenger

vehicles. Our VLS business was

able to secure orders worth €210

million, including new business

wins of €162 million.

Equity fund raise to meet the

Minimum Public Shareholding

(MPS) requirements

In Q4 FY2021, we raised

`6,992 million through a Qualified

Institutional Placement (QIP) of

Equity Shares, which validates

the confidence of our investors

in Varroc’s business model and

growth prospects. We used a part

of the net issue proceeds to pay

down our borrowings.

Looking ahead

We continue to believe that

the business in India will

recover strongly as we come

out of the second wave. In

our global lighting business,

the semiconductor issues are

impacting our Europe and

North America volumes. We

are currently focusing on cost

optimisation, positive free

cashflow and debt reduction.

Also, we are working to control

our capex and working capital.

We recognise that there are

several structural improvements

required in our Lighting Systems

business to achieve sustained

profitability. We have launched

an Integrated Turnaround

Program (Project RACE) for VLS

business, in Europe. This exercise

will start with a comprehensive

performance improvement plan

for the business over the short

to medium term. We expect the

benefits of this programme to

be visible within the next 12 to 18

months.

We intend to continue to improve

our manufacturing processes

and systems, as well as invest in

new technology areas to further

expand our business. Our goal

is to bring leading technologies

to the mainstream markets with

high-quality, cost-competitive

solutions.

I express my sincerest gratitude

to our customers, employees,

bankers and investors for their

trust on our abilities even during

an exceptionally difficult year.

I look forward to your continued

support.

Yours sincerely,

Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods

sustainability throughout their life cycle

1.

List up to 3 of your products or services

whose design has incorporated social

or environmental concerns, risks and/or

opportunities.

The Company is engaged in the business of

manufacturing of automotive components.

These products have insignificant social or

environmental concern or risk. However, Social

and environmental concerns are always on the

fore with regard to all manufacturing processes.

At Varroc, we believe that performance is the

best growth strategy. Performance that doesn’t

follow benchmarks but goes beyond them.

Performance that lives up to commitment, no

matter what it takes. Our quest is to get every

OEM manufacturer in the world acquainted with

our ethos – that is built on a solid foundation

based on relentless pursuit of perfection.

We don’t stop there In the fast changing world

of automotive design and technology, we are

in a state of constant alert. We are constantly

adapting, evolving and innovating. The comfort

zone is not a breeding ground for greatness.

Instead of resisting change, we always seek to

embrace it. And always ask ourselves – How

can we do this better? This mindset allows

us to be future-ready and helps us deliver

performance@change.
