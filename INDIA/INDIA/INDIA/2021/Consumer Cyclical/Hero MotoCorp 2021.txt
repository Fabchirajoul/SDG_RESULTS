Dear Shareholders,

I hope you and your loved ones are

keeping well and staying healthy.

“Be kind, for everyone you meet is

fighting a hard battle” - Plato

The Athenian philosopher could not have

ever imagined that thousands of years

in the future, Humanity will face as dire

a situation that we are facing today.

In the year 2020 and even in 2021, our

planet has been engulfed in what can only

be described as “the worst crisis of our

times!”

As I reflect back on the year that went

by, I am filled with the emotions of

grief, compassion as we saw several of

our family, friends and acquaintances

succumb to and struggle with this

dynamic and evolving virus. We all,

however, stood by each other as One

Family and supported the ones who

suffered and also the ones who could not

protect themselves.

We were extremely

proactive in our

approach and

consciously decided

that we will not

let this crisis go to

waste.
