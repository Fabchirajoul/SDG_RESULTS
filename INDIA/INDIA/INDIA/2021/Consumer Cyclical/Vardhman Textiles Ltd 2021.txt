Dear Shareholders,

A significant part of the financial year

2020-21 passed amidst uncertainty and

despair due to lockdown in the different

parts of the world owing to COVID-19

situation. As a result, different parts of

various countries remained closed and

then opened in phased manner. To a

larger extent, government attention and

resources also got diverted towards

containing pandemic, saving lives and

for vaccination drive. In such a situation,

economic growth and trade concerns

slipped down the priority pyramid as a

natural consequence. This was reflected

in the world economic growth which is

estimated to record a negative growth

rate of 4.4 percent during 2020. With

partial opening-up of the economy in

sync with successful vaccination drive in

the developed and developing countries,

the world economy is projected to grow

at 5.6% in 2021 amidst downward

biases.

Indian economy, which was firmly on

the path of recovery in the second half

of FY 2020-21, had been hit in recent

months by a rather unexpected virulent

second wave of Covid-19. It caused a

severe strain on healthcare facilities in

many parts of the country, leading to

localised lockdowns and a fall in mobility

to levels seen a year ago. However,

disruptions to production and supply

chains have been far less severe during

the second wave than during the first

wave. The Indian economy, which

recorded negative growth rate of about

7.5% in FY 2020-21 is likely to do well

in the current financial year FY 2021-22

and is expected to grow by more than

10%.

In textile sector, the performance of

India has been impacted by three

factors in the FY 2020-21. First of all,

overall slowdown in economic activity

especially in first two quarters of the FY

2020-21 led to significant stress upon

output, demand and earning of the

industry. However, this pressure was

eased in subsequent quarters leading

to improvement in performance of the

Indian textile industry.

Secondly, US-China trade tension

especially related to products made

of cotton grown in Xinjiang area has

supported Indian textile industry. The

industry has witnessed increased export

demand for textile material especially

cotton yarn mainly from China. The

surge in demand for cotton yarn in China

can be linked to its sustained exports of

high value added textiles and clothing

products despite of higher wages in

sync with per capita income of beyond

USD 10,000/year. This transitory positive

impact of high demand of cotton yarn

from India may continue for coming

months also.

The third factor, which adversely

affected the Indian textile industry

is more permanent in nature and is

related to cost incompetitiveness of

Indian producers against its competitors

like Bangladesh, Vietnam and of lately

Myanmar and Cambodia. While China

has seen reduction in clothing export

by USD 38 bn during 2015-2020, the

aforesaid countries have seen almost

identical surge in clothing exports during

the same period. China emerged as

prominent textile material supplier to

these countries by exporting USD 21 bn

knit and woven fabric to these countries.

At organisation level, while yarn

segment has performed well, the

fabric segment could not fully recover

out of COVID-19 situation and is still

facing sub optimal capacity utilization,

which is partly due to addition in fabric

manufacturing capacity made just

before COVID-19 period. Another reason

was low demand of formal wears made

of woven fabric in comparison to casual

wears made of knitted fabric because of

restricted movement of people during

this period. One illustration of reduced

demand of woven fabric can be seen in

the reduced share of woven garment in

total garment exported by Bangladesh.

Total garment exports from Bangladesh,

during March–June 2021, increased by

107% as compared to corresponding

period of previous year. The share of

woven garment during the same period

of 2020 was 50% in total garment

exports, which declined to 46% in 2021,

so even though there is recovery in

garment exports but the demand for

woven garments came down directly

impacting the demand for woven fabric.

Nevertheless, the Company is well

poised to gain from the opportunities

in global market as well as in domestic

market with normalization of economic

activities with increased sense of

security associated with rapid pace

of vaccination and other efforts made

by government. At organisation level,

we have given utmost priority to

necessary safeguards to prevent spread

of COVID -19 and our work force has

been working with full of confidence

amidst safety measures and hopeful

to record improved performance on all

parameters.

We have received immense support

and encouragement from our business

partners, financial institutions and

customers – not just this year, but

continuously over a period of time.

I would like to take this opportunity

to thank all of them for their faith,

advice and guidance. As I conclude my

message for this Annual Report, I look

forward to the same support for the

coming future.

Warm Regards,

Shri Paul Oswal

Dear Shareholders,

Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown has

impacted our business. Post lockdown

new normal life has brought new

operational challenges. In this situation

of business uncertainty we focused

on stabilising in the new environment

remaining optimistic for the future.

Impact of COVID-19

The pandemic is not just affecting the

way people conduct business but also

how humankind will live. This is affecting

every part of our lives, including the

preference for apparel, influencing the

manufacture of yarns.

Being a discretionary spend, the

demand for textile products contracted

sharply. As various countries, including

India, started unlocking their economies

in the latter part of the first quarter of

the financial year 20-21, new challenges

of reduced demand, under-utilized

capacities and cash crunch affected

the industry. The implementation of

social distancing and lockdowns across

countries affected textile export from

India and its corresponding consumption

across countries.

Our business

As expected, FY2021 was a challenging

year for textile business. There was

a sharp reduction in demand across

all markets especially in the early part

of the financial year. As the countries

learned to live and cope with Covid,

many of the export markets started

to resume. Yarn business responded

to the market recovery very quickly

and achieved full capacity utilization

by the end of the second quarter. The

demand of yarn picked up in the export

markets, particularly, from China. With

smart demand, the prices also remained

stable.

The fabric business, however, continued

to feel the burn of pandemic. Firstly, the

improvement of fabric was mainly in the

knitted side. With offices and schools

remaining closed and limited formal

gatherings, the demand of woven fabric

remained sluggish. This kept pressure

on the fabric capacity utilization as your

Company is in woven fabric. Secondly,

rising yarn prices, kept the margins at

a low.

Future Outlook

The effect of pandemic is fading down

with the administration of vaccination.

However, uncertainty still looms as

people are scary of a third wave of

Covid. The adversities have also opened

up doors for Indian manufacturers in

the shape of China plus One Policy.

The Industry need to gear-up to reap

sustained benefits of the same.

Further, in wake of US-China trade

war, particularly the recent restrictions

imposed by US on import of cotton

products made of Xinjiang region

cotton, the demand of yarn from China

is expected to continue. However, the

yarn margins may come under pressure

on arrival of new cotton in the coming

season. On the fabric side, with the

opening up of economies and lifting

of restrictions, woven fabric demand

will firm up leading the Company to

achieve full capacity utilization. Further,

with sustained operational efficiency

and commitment towards customer

satisfaction, the Company has been

able to serve some of the leading global

brands which will go a long way in

enhancement of stakeholder value.

We take the pleasure in expressing

our sincere gratitude and appreciation

for the outstanding commitment and

contribution of all our stakeholders

including employees, suppliers, and

business partners. We are blessed to

have their continued trust, reliance

and unstinted support in shaping and

improving the performance of our

Company.

2.22 Leases

The Group as Lessee

The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases

for land and buildings. The Group assesses whether a

contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A

contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys

the right to control the use of an identified asset for a

period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess

whether a contract conveys the right to control the use

of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (i)

the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the

Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from

use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the

Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.:

managing director

and no significant business decisions relating to debts

restructuring and business restructuring in the above

said associate can be implemented without prior

approval of the Company.

2.24.2 Key sources of uncertainty

In the application of the Group accounting policies,

the management of the Group is required to make

judgements, estimates and assumptions about the

carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not

readily apparent from other sources. The estimates

and associated assumptions are based on historical

experience and other factors that are considered to be

relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are

reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting

estimates are recognised in the period in which the

estimate is revised if the revision affects only that

period or in the period of the revision and future periods

if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The following are the areas of estimation uncertainty

and critical judgements that the management

has made in the process of applying the Group’s

accounting policies and that have the most

significant effect on the amounts recognised in the

financial statements:

2.24.3 Defined benefit plans

The cost of the defined benefit plan and other

post-employment benefits and the present value

of such obligation are determined using actuarial

valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making

various assumptions that may differ from actual

developments in the future. These include the

determination of the discount rate, future, salary

increases, mortality rates and future pension

increases. Due to the complexities involved in the

valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit

obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these

assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each

reporting date.

2.24.4 Useful lives of depreciable tangible assets and

intangible assets

Management reviews the useful lives of depreciable/

amortisable assets at each reporting date.

As at March 31, 2021 management assessed that

the useful lives represent the expected utility of the

assets to the Group.

2.24.5 Fair Value measurements and valuation processes

Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are

measured at fair value for financial reporting

purposes. The Board of Directors of the respective

Company approves the fair values determined by the

Chief Financial Officer of the respective Company

including determining the appropriate valuation

techniques and inputs for fair value measurements.

In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the

Group uses market-observable data to the extent

is available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available,

the Group engages third party qualified valuers to

perform the valuation. The Chief financial officer

works closely with the qualified external valuers

to establish appropriate valuation techniques and

inputs to the model.

Information about the valuation techniques and

inputs used in determining the fair value of various

assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 37.:
