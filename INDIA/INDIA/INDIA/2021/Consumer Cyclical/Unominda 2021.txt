MEssAgE FROM THE CHAIRMAn

Like most

companies

worldwide,

the COVID-19

pandemic

significantly

impacted our business. As

our immediate response,

we focussed on making

our plants, distribution

centres and offices

safe for our people. Our

operations and ehs

teams worked promptly to

ensure safety. At all our

workplaces.: Dear Stakeholders,

Last year, the world, as we knew it, changed

for all. Today, we’re all riding the same sea

of challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic,

rightly being called ‘the pandemic of

inequality’, has exacerbated the existing

disparity and political tensions. This global

health crisis has been overwhelming

public health systems while wreaking

havoc on economies worldwide. The

immediate economic impact slowed us down

considerably. However, it also offered the

opportunity to pause, rethink, and design a

new and faster transition to a sustainable

world.

Just as we started seeing signs of recovery

from the impact of the pandemic in Q3FY21,

the second wave of COVID-19 dented

Q4FY21. It brought about a new set of

difficulties with an even more intense and

severe impact than the first wave. However,

we overcame the hurdles with the same

vigour as we did last year. We stood by

our employees as health and safety took

precedence and provided all possible

support, once again, as one family to ride

over these testing times.

The announcement of lockdowns in April

2021 resulted in many OEMs cutting down

production. This had a cascading effect on

the component industry. But as the number

57. Pursuant to the Scheme of Amalgamation (‘Scheme’) under the provisions of Section 230 to 232 of the Companies Act,

2013, for amalgamation of wholly owned subsidiaries i.e. MJ Casting Limited, Minda Distribution and Services Limited,

Minda Auto Components Limited and Minda Rinder Private Limited (together referred to as “transferor companies”), with

Minda Industries Limited (“Transferee Company” or “the Parent Company”) as approved by the Hon’ble National Company

Law Tribunal vide its order dated June 01, 2020 with the appointed date of April 01, 2019, all the assets, liabilities, reserves

and surplus of the transferor companies have been transferred to and vested in the Company with effect from this date at

their carrying values. The Parent Company had received the certified copy of the said order on July 17, 2020 and the same

had been filed with the respective Registrar of Companies on August 01, 2020. There was no impact of the above merger

on profit for the previous periods and the financial position, since the amalgamation was accounted as per requirements

of Appendix C to Ind AS 103 “Business Combination” under common control.

58. The Board of directors of the Parent Company in its meeting held on February 06, 2020, accorded its consent for the scheme

of amalgamation of Minda I Connect Private Limited (Transferor Company) with Minda Industries Limited (Transferee

Company) subject to necessary approval(s) of shareholders, Creditors and other approvals and sanctions by the National

Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), New Delhi. Appropriate accounting treatment of the Scheme will be done post receipt of

NCLT approval.

59. IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

In view of the pandemic relating to COVID - 19, the Group has considered internal and external information and has

performed an analysis based on current estimates while assessing the recoverability of investments, property plant and

equipment, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, trade receivables, other current and financial assets, for any possible

impact on the Financial Statements. The Group has also assessed the impact of this whole situation on its capital and

financial resources, profitability, liquidity position, internal financial reporting controls etc. and is of the view that based

on its present assessment this situation does not materially impact the financial statements. However, the actual impact

of COVID - 19 on the financial results may differ from that estimated due to unforeseen circumstances and the Parent

Company will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.
