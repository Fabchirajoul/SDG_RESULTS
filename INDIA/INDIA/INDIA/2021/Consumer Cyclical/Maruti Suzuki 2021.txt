Managing Director & CEO

I sincerely wish that each one of you is keeping safe in this tough time. I pray for the speedy

recovery of everyone who is battling the COVID-19 infection. I express my deepest condolences

to the near and dear ones of those whom we lost to the pandemic.

With the pandemic entering into the second year, each one of us must be extra cautious in the

fight against this highly infectious disease. I expect all of us to follow COVID-19 appropriate

behavior and get vaccinated to minimise the risk of infection spread.

Being a responsible corporate citizen, the Company is contributing to the best of its ability

to support the country in the fight against this pandemic. At the time when the country was

battling the second wave of COVID-19 and was facing shortage of oxygen, for medical needs,

the Company temporarily suspended business operations to divert the oxygen available for

industrial purposes to medical needs. Additionally, the Company realised the critical importance

of rapidly installing PSA oxygen plants, to produce life-saving oxygen. The Company decided

to collaborate with its supplier partners to help quickly scale up the domestic manufacturing

of PSA oxygen generator plants. The Company also donated 14 PSA oxygen generator plants

to various government hospitals in the country. Also, the Company together with the help of its

parent company, Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC), donated 1,000 oxygen cylinders to various

government hospitals. If you could recall, during the initial stages of the 1st wave of pandemic,

the Company offered its mass production expertise to an existing ventilator manufacturer to

scale up production multi-fold in the shortest possible time. The Company also mobilised its

seat vendors, who have some expertise in seat fabric, to put up facilities to produce masks and

bodysuits in large quantities.

Since the beginning of the pandemic last year, the Company’s efforts have been extremely

focused on the safety and well-being of its value chain members. The Company collaborated

with its stakeholders and jointly prepared detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

catering to specific needs of every member of the value chain partners. Besides, the Company

also facilitated the value chain partners in vaccinating their workforce.

To ensure the health and well-being of its employees, including their families, the Company

took all-round measures such as forging tie-ups with several healthcare service providers to

offer COVID-19 care, quickly supporting with oxygen concentrators, tying up with an external

partner for digital health consultation, organising vaccination camps, and imparting trainings on

improving physical and mental well-being.

The Company will continue to observe all COVID-19 SOPs and precautions, be sensitive to the

human and social element, build an environment of positivity and keep working hard as its bit in

these difficult times.

Coming to our business, in my last year’s message, I mentioned my views about the resilience of

the Indian economy and expressed that its quick recovery is quite probable.

With the extraordinary measures taken by the Government of India, the economy recovered

from a big contraction in Q1 FY 2020-21 and posted growth in the second half of FY 2020-21.

The demand for cars also followed the path of economic recovery. The demand for cars was

driven by pent-up demand, increasing customer preference towards personal mobility and

a good demand from non-urban markets. The Company supported the demand recovery by

introducing attractive vehicle financing schemes in collaboration with the banks. To ensure that

customers feel safe about coming to the showrooms, the Company put in place the highest

level of hygiene and sanitisation as well as maximised the use of digital interfaces to ensure

contactless operations.

Dividend Distribution Policy

The Company has already laid down the Dividend Distribution

Guidelines (‘Dividend Guidelines’) which were approved by the

Board of Directors of the Company (‘Board’) on 30th October,

2014. The Securities and Exchange Board of India has amended

the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations

and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘Listing

Regulations’) under which the Company is required to formulate

a dividend distribution policy.

Pursuant to the aforesaid change in the Listing Regulations, the

Board has approved this Dividend Distribution Policy (‘Policy’) of

the Company on 23rd March, 2017.

The Company shall declare and pay dividend in accordance

with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, rules made

thereunder and Listing Regulations as amended from time

to time.

Following points shall be considered while declaring dividend:

• Consistency with the Dividend Guidelines as laid out by

the Board

• Sustainability of dividend payout ratio in future

• Dividend payout ratio of previous years

• Macroeconomic factors and business conditions

Retained earnings are intended to be utilised for:

• Investments for future growth of the business

• Dealing with any possible downturns in the business

• Strategic investment in new business opportunities

The Company currently has only one class of shares i.e. equity

shares. As and when it proposes to issue any other class of

shares, the policy shall be modified accordingly.

Dividend guidelines

Background: Many shareholders have opined that the Company

should provide a dividend policy in the interest of providing

greater transparency to the shareholders.

The Board, at the time of approving the annual accounts in each

year, also decides the dividend to be paid to the shareholders

depending on the context of business in that year. A policy stated

by the current Board cannot be binding on future Board. However,

the current Board can form a guideline on dividend payout in

future in the interest of providing transparency to shareholders.

Board approval

The Board accordingly approved the following guidelines for

dividend payment:

The Company would endeavour to keep the Dividend payout

ratio, except for reasons to be recorded, within the range of 18%

to 40%. The actual dividend for each year would be decided by

the Board taking into account the availability of cash, the profit

level that year and the requirements of capital investments.

CEO/CFO Certification

The Company has institutionalised the framework for CEO/

CFO certification by establishing a transparent “controls self

assessment” mechanism, thereby laying the foundation for

development of the best corporate governance practices

which are vital for a successful business. It is the Company’s

endeavor to attain the highest level of governance to enhance

the stakeholders’ value. To enable certification by CEO/CFO

for the financial year 2020- 2021, key controls over financial

reporting were identified and subjected to self-assessment by

control owners in the form of completion of self-assessment

questionnaires through a web based online tool called “Controls

Manager”. The self-assessments submitted by control owners

were further reviewed and approved by their superiors and

the results of the self-assessment process were presented to

the auditors and the audit committee. The whole exercise was

carried out in an objective manner to assess the effectiveness

of internal financial controls including controls over financial

reporting during the financial year 2020- 2021.

Enabling controls self-assessments through the ‘Controls Manager’

As required under Regulation 17 of the Listing Regulations, a

d.

Price movement of commodities are quite volatile in nature and the Company hedges commodity prices (procured directly or

indirectly) to mitigate the risk and protect budgetary level, thus ensuring stable financial performance.

1.0 Background

Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) for producing cars needs

to purchase large volumes of basic commodities like steel,

aluminium directly and indirectly and consume high quantities

of copper and lead being used by its vendors for supplying

components. Apart from these basic metals, significant quantities

of Precious Group Metals like Platinum, Palladium and Rhodium

as well as other commodities like plastics, High speed diesel

(HSD) etc., are consumed.

Due to high volume usage of the above-mentioned commodities

in manufacturing cars and very high price volatility, which is

being witnessed in last couple of years, Company is exposed

to severe commodity price risk directly as well as indirectly.

These commodities are either being purchased from suppliers

directly at mutually negotiated rates or the price is settled with

suppliers, who manufacture these components for MSIL using

these commodities, at monthly/quarterly settled prices based on

prevalent market trends.

Since these commodities and components are not purchased

under a fixed price contract, the cost of the raw material input

is variable.

2.0 Commodities Price Risk Management Objective

and Strategies

The commodities price risk management objective of the

Company is to hedge the risk of changes in the commodity prices

procured directly or indirectly (i.e., procured by component

supplier). Since the fluctuations in commodity prices have severe

impact on financials of the Company, hedging provides stability

to the financial performance by estimating the amount of future

cash flows and reducing volatility.

The Company shall follow a consistent policy of mitigating the

commodities price risk by undertaking following strategies:

I.

Bundling of commodity sourcing

Under this strategy, the Company shall negotiate with

suppliers bundling its in house requirement with its vendor

requirement to get a better price for different commodities

based on large consolidated volume.

II.

Bundling of Suzuki Motor Corporation’s (SMC)

subsidiaries sourcing

This strategy allows the Company to bundle the commodity

sourcing for the SMC subsidiaries present in India in order

to get better pricing for all the SMC group companies in

India.

III. Commodity Grade Standardisation & Substitution

The Company shall undertake grade standardisation across

various categories of commodities to the extent possible like

in the case of steel and plastic products so as to optimise

the costs.

The Company shall also change raw material grades to

cheaper grades without affecting product performance e.g.

in the case of steel from IF to EDD grade.

IV. Yield Improvement

The Company shall continuously undertake yield

improvement activities across various commodities like in

the case of plastic products and electrical components,

etc., done so far.

V.

Commodity price risk hedging

MSIL shall follow a consistent policy of mitigating

commodities price risk by entering into appropriate hedging

instruments as considered necessary from time to time.

Depending on the future outlook on commodity prices, the

Company may keep the exposures un-hedged or hedge

only a part of the total exposure.

The Company shall not enter into commodity hedging

transactions for speculative purposes i.e. without any

actual/anticipated underlying exposure.

The Company shall strictly observe the rules and regulations

laid down by RBI for undertaking the commodities price

risk hedging.

3.0 Commodities Permitted for Hedging

The Company may hedge commodities price risk on all the

commodities being purchased directly or indirectly e.g. Aluminum,

Copper, Lead, Platinum, Rhodium, Palladium, Steel, Plastic, etc.,

wherever possible and permissible under the applicable rules

and regulations to enable fixing the sourcing costs.

1 GENERAL INFORMATION

Maruti Suzuki India Limited (“The Company”) is a public limited

company incorporated and domiciled in India, listed on the

Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange

(NSE). The address of its registered office is #1, Nelson Mandela

Road, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi - 110070. The Company is a

subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corporation, Japan. The principal

activities of the Company are manufacturing, purchase and

sale of motor vehicles, components and spare parts. The other

activities of the Company comprise facilitation of pre-owned car

sales, fleet management and car financing.

2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.1 Statement of compliance

The financial statements have been prepared as a going concern

in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified

under the Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015 and other relevant provisions of the Act.

2.2 Basis of preparation and presentation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical

cost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial

instruments which are measured at fair value at the end of

each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies

mentioned below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair

value of the consideration given in exchange of goods or services.

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-

current according to the Company’s operating cycle and other

criteria set out in the Act. Based on the nature of products and

the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and

their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has

ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose

of current non-current classification of assets and liabilities.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

2.3 Going concern

The board of directors have considered the financial position of

the Company as at March 31, 2021 and the projected cash flows

and financial performance of the Company for at least twelve

months from the date of approval of these financial statements as

well as planned cost and cash improvement actions, and believe

that the plan for sustained profitability remains on course.

The board of directors have taken actions to ensure that

appropriate long-term cash resources are in place at the date of

signing the accounts to fund the Company’s operations.

2.4 Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind

AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and

assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies

and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income, expenses

and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of

these financial statements and the reported amount of revenues

and expenses for the years presented. Actual results may differ

from the estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each

balance sheet date. Revisions to accounting estimates are

recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and

future periods affected.

In particular, information about significant areas of estimation

uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting

policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts

recognised in the financial statements are included in the

following notes:

Note 32 : Provision for employee benefits

Provision for employee benefits requires that certain assumptions

such as expected future salary increases, average life expectancy

and discount rates etc. are made in order to determine the amount

to be recorded for retirement benefit obligations. Substantial

changes in the assumed development of any of these variables

may significantly change the Company’s retirement benefit

obligations.

Note 17 & 37 : Provision for litigations

Income Tax: The Company’s tax jurisdiction is in India. Significant

judgements are involved in determining the provision for income

taxes including judgement on whether tax positions are probable

of being sustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment

can involve complex issues, which can only be resolved over

extended time periods.

Other litigations: Litigations often involve complex legal/regulatory

issues and are connected with a high degree of uncertainty.

Accordingly, the assessment of whether an obligation exists on

the balance sheet date as a result of an event in the past, and

whether a future cash outflow is likely and the obligation can

be reliably estimated, largely depends on estimations by the

management.

Note 17 : Provision for warranty and product recall

The Company creates provision based on historical warranty

claim experience. In addition, assumptions on the amounts of

potential costs are also included while creating the provisions.

The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information.

1 GENERAL INFORMATION

Maruti Suzuki India Limited (“The Company”) is a public limited

company incorporated and domiciled in India, listed on the

Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange

(NSE). The address of its registered office is #1, Nelson Mandela

Road, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi - 110070. The Company is a

subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corporation, Japan. The principal

activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are manufacturing,

purchase and sale of motor vehicles, components and spare

parts. The other activities of the Company comprise facilitation

of pre-owned car sales, fleet management and car financing.

The Company together with its subsidiaries is herein referred to

as “the Group”.

2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.1 Statement of compliance

The financial statements have been prepared as a going concern

in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified

under the Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015 and other relevant provisions of the Act.

2.2 Basis of preparation and presentation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical

cost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial

instruments which are measured at fair value at the end of

each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies

mentioned below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair

value of the consideration given in exchange of goods or services.

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-

current according to the Group’s operating cycle and other

criteria set out in the Act. Based on the nature of products and

the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and

their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the Group has

ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose

of current and non-current classification of assets and liabilities.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

2.3 Basis of Consolidation and equity accounting

(i) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The

Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has

rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity

and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to

direct the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully

consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to

the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date the control

ceases.

The Group combines the financial statements of the parent

and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of

assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany

transactions, balance and unrealised gains on transactions

between Group companies are eliminated. Accounting policies

of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure

consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries

are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit and

loss, consolidated statement of change in equity and balance

sheet respectively.

(ii) Associates

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant

influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in

the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but

is not control or joint control over those policies. Investments

in associates are accounted for using the equity method of

accounting (see note (iv) below), after initially being recognised

at cost.

(iii) Joint Ventures

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that

have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net

assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually

agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only

when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous

consent of the parties sharing control.

Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity

method of accounting (see note(iv) below), after initially being

recognised at cost in the consolidated balance sheet.

(iv) Equity method

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are

initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise

the Group’s share of the post acquisition profits or losses of

the investee in profit or loss, and the Group’s share of other

comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive

income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and

joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying

amount of the investment.

When the Group’s share of losses in equity-accounted

investments equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including

any other unsecured long term receivables, the Group does not

recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or

made payments on behalf of the other entity.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and

its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent

Portfolio diversification

The financial risk management of the Group is carried out under the policies approved by the Board of Directors. Within these

policies, the Board provides written principles for overall risk management including policies covering specific areas, such as foreign

exchange risk management, commodity risk management and investment of funds.

(A) Credit risk

Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter party may not be able to settle their obligations. To manage trade receivable,

the Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial conditions, economic trends,

analysis of historical bad debts and aging of such receivables.

Financial instruments that are subject to such risk, principally consist of investments, trade receivables, loans and advances and

derivative instruments. None of the financial instruments of the Group results in material concentration of credit risks.

Other than financial assets mentioned above, none of the financial assets were impaired and there were no indications that defaults

in payment obligations would occur.

(B) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group can not meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is to

maintain sufficient liquidity and to ensure funds are available for use as per the requirements.

The Group operates with a low Debt Equity ratio. The Group raises short term rupee borrowings for cash flow mismatches and hence

carries no significant liquidity risk. The Group has access to the borrowing facilities of ` 43,690 million As at 31.03.2021 (` 30,240

million as at 31.03.2020) to honour any liquidity requirements arising for business needs. The Group has large investments in debt

mutual funds which can be redeemed on a very short notice and hence carries negligible liquidity risk.

Financing arrangements

The Group had access to the following borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:

The tables below analyse the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities:

The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying

balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
