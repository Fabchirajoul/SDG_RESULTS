LETTER: Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to share with you all that

substantiating its strength, even during tough times, KPR could

sustain the better performance trend. We have delivered growth

despite complex economic scenario caused by the Pandemic. Our

growth during the year was propelled by the encouraging

demand for the products from all segments. We n^igistered a

highest ever revenue and profit during the year Total revenue of

? 3569 Crores, PBT of ? 689 Crores and a PAT of ? 515 Crores -

notwithstanding the challenges. The concerted efforts of entire

KPR Team and the support of all stakeholders made this possible.

The Cotton prices remained stable for most part of the period.

India continues to be a cotton surplus Country and the Global

cotton harvest area as well production is also reported to have

gone up in 2021. Cotton yarn prices in India have been increasing

because of dried-up inventories as supplies have failed to match

demand and in line with the increase in Cotton prices. Still, Indian

yarn prices continue to be lower than international prices. The

sustained quality and prompt delivery continue to enable KPR to

attract more Garment orders from the customers whose activities

revived after relaxations. The Employees' responsible attitude

during pandemic, prompted by KPR's exemplary employee

welfare practices, has enabled improved productivity even during

pandemic proving KPR's unique competence. KPR's success and

growth are shaped by its strengths that gives competitive

advantage over others. This enabled prompt execution of orders

with the backing of our excellent infrastructures, dynamic

management and dedicated workforce. Sugar & Ethanol business

adds both revenue and profitability. Gauging market demand we

have mooted our expansion plans in the segments of Garment

and Sugar cum Ethanol.

However, the sudden surge in the second wave of pandemic is

posing challenges to the Government that has been

administering the vaccination drive. New restrictions were

implemented which are likely to temporarily impede Nation's

growth. But, its spread should be contained by adopting all means

by the Government and the responsible support from the Public is

essential. The market's big hope is on the vaccination drive and
