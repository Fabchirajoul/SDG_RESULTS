Dear Shareholders:

I am delighted to connect with you! These are trying times and I sincerely hope that you and

your family members are safe and healthy.

We have all gone through – and survived – one of the most challenging years in recent

history. The pandemic, which unfolded last year, has wreaked havoc across the world. India

went into total lockdown in March 2020 and the impact was felt immediately. The country’s

GDP contracted in the first two quarters of FY 2020-21 driven by the nationwide lockdown

and moderation in economic activities globally. However, with the gradual decrease in

COVID-19 cases from October 2020 onwards, the economy bounced back to growth in

third and fourth quarter. Almost all macro indicators had shown steady recovery between

September and March 2021. However, the second wave of the pandemic impacted the

pace of recovery.

Last year was a difficult year for most companies around the world. This holds true for

your Company as well. However, under the leadership of a capable management team,

your Company was quick to pivot and find opportunities to not only tide over a tough year,

but also solve for some of the challenges thrown up by the pandemic. Your Company

empowered customers with technology offerings that enabled them to continue operating

optimally with reduced onsite staff. We fast-tracked development and deployment of

technologies that helped enforce guidelines around safety and security in public spaces and

commercial establishments. Importantly, your company demonstrated urgency and agility

in establishing a production line for N95 respirators in Pune to equip frontline healthcare

workers – despite the entire country being in lockdown mode. Some of the solutions that

your Company brought to market will help build confidence among the public as we look at

re-emerging from the second wave and resuming economic activities.

Non Nascor Mihi Solum - Live not for self alone. Moved by the plight of thousands of

displaced and migrant families, your Company mobilised resources to distribute food and

hygiene kits across nine cities. Understanding the criticality of preventive measures in

stemming the spread of the virus, we partnered with the Government to distribute multi-

lingual, illustrated educational material on the importance of hand-washing and social

distancing in rural and peri-urban areas. As the impact of the second wave became evident,

we worked with local and state authorities to build and hand over COVID-19 care centers

and ICUs across multiple cities and towns. We will continue to find ways to help those who

are less privileged but certainly not less deserving.

It would be incorrect to say that the end of this pandemic is in sight since there is still so

much that is unknown to us. With the resilience and dedication of the leadership team, your

Company will overcome these turbulent times. On your behalf, I would like to acknowledge

the tremendous efforts of your Company’s employees at all levels and thank them for their

hard work, dedication and continued commitment. I would also like to thank our customers,

suppliers, bankers, and financial institutions.

Last but not the least, on behalf of Board of Directors of Honeywell Automation India

Limited, I want to thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and support.

(Non-Executive) and Chairman of

the Board of Directors, Honeywell

Automation India Limited:

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S DESK: Dear Shareholders:

Your Company has completed 37 years in India. During these years, your Company has

evolved into a trusted brand. From a fledgling entity serving customers in the process industry

and commercial buildings with a limited automation portfolio, we have now transformed into a

significant company with a large and diversified portfolio – among top 100 companies by market

capitalisation, serving the government and private sectors in India and overseas. This has been

an exciting journey and I have been fortunate to serve the Company during these years.

FY2020-21 was a tough year for most, including your Company. The after-effects of a strict-but-

necessary countrywide lockdown and a slowdown in the global economy impacted us. Overall

revenue from operations in FY2020-21 was INR 3,043 crore, registering a year-over-year decline

of 7.5%. The Company’s profit after tax was INR 460 crore. Cost of goods sold, including excise

duty, was 50.3% of sales against 49.9% in the previous year. However, your Company delivered

a return of 15.1% on sales as against 14.9% in the previous year.

On a positive note, your Company showed tremendous agility and foresight by quickly pivoting

to take actions that addressed challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s

topmost priority was to provide uninterrupted services to the mission-critical operations of our

customers. At the same time, we needed to ensure the well-being of our employees. Your

Company achieved both by meticulous planning, deploying remote services for customers,

enabling employees with IT infrastructure to a work-from-home arrangement, and ensuring

their well-being. Employees who had to brave the situation and be at their work locations

were completely supported by your Company to ensure a safe environment onsite and while

commuting and travelling. The Company also implemented several employee programs to assist

them during this challenging period by helping them meet their medical, financial, and family

needs. Beyond customer and employee services, your Company also focused on the needs of

the community. Realising the urgent need to equip the country’s frontline workers and COVID-19

warriors, your Company installed a world-class production line for N95 masks at our Fulgaon

facility in Pune in record time. This was also done in response to the Indian Government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat mission. The FF2400 flat-fold

disposable mask is a truly “Make in India” mask, with raw material completely sourced in India, and supporting additional Indian businesses that

are part of the supply chain. The mask is BIS P2 and NIOSH N95 certified.

Responding to needs arising from the strict lockdown, your Company rolled out several offerings for our industrial and commercial buildings

customers to enable them to continue their operations remotely. Your Company offered effective remote engineering solutions, remote factory

acceptance test set-ups, remote site-commissioning solutions, and remote maintenance solutions. This eliminated the need for a large number

of their operations personnel to crowd in a confined room and avoid contagion. All this was done using Honeywell’s leading industrial technology

and software applications. This also accelerated our customers on their digital transformation/Industry 4.0 journey. Additionally, we offered our

Cybersecurity solution to protect our customer’s digital infrastructure and data. Your Company innovated and offered the Honeywell Healthy

Buildings solutions, which make commercial buildings and workplaces safer and healthier for occupants and users. Continued Government

spending on the country’s core infrastructures such as airports, metros, railways, ports, Smart Cities, large-scale data centers, etc., are

opportunities for such value-added services. Your Company is well positioned to align with this growing need in the country.

Over the last few years, your Company has focused to grow the business in the pharma and life sciences industry. The pandemic showed that

our foresight was not misplaced. Your Company has a strategic approach to grow in this industry by building a differentiated portfolio relevant to

the Indian customer’s needs. Our portfolio of products, software, and solutions align well across the value chain of the pharma and life sciences

sector – from R&D for vaccine and drugs discovery to manufacturing, packaging, distribution, and tracking. Our integrated hardware and software

solutions enable pharmaceutical manufacturers to meet their key goals – operational excellence, productivity, safety, regulatory compliance,

and data driven decision making. The steady growth of this sector coupled with rapid adoption of automation and digitalisation solutions by

pharmaceutical companies provides an attractive opportunity for your Company to become a trusted automation and digitalisation partner for the

sector in our country.

The pandemic also put a spotlight on the need for a sustainability agenda. India is facing a higher demand for sustainable solutions that address

energy optimisation, natural gas transmission and distribution, renewable energy, and water conservation. Working with global Honeywell experts

and powered by Honeywell’s leading technologies, your Company is well placed to address these new growth areas. Looking ahead, we are

hopeful and excited about post-pandemic opportunities. Your Company is working tirelessly to help customers face new challenges and stay

ahead. This will enable your Company to continue our journey to pursue profitable growth and increased shareholder value.

Finally, on your behalf, I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards the Company employees and appreciate their resiliency. They have

gone above and beyond their responsibilities to ensure uninterrupted operations, delivering on our customer commitments and business priorities.

While doing so, they also supported colleagues and their families during this difficult time. They are our COVID-warriors. With your continued

support, and our collective efforts I am confident that we shall emerge stronger and be known as one of the best socially-responsible software

industrial companies.
