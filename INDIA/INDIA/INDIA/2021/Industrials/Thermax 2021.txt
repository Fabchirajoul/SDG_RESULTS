Financial Statements:

Managing Director &

CEO, Ashish Bhandari, who joined us on

April 7, 2020, the Executive Council, our

SBU heads, and the senior management,

for navigating the company through a

very tough and challenging year. A big

‘thank you’ to all our employees for their

dedication and efforts in effectively

collaborating with all our stakeholders,

despite going through a lot of pain

and anxiety within families, as also

the limitations of working from home.

Thank you, to all our customers for their

understanding and continued patronage;

our channel and vendor partners,

who have worked tirelessly to meet

commitments; our auditors, who, despite

many challenges, have worked hard to

audit our accounts; our shareholders and

all other stakeholders, for their continued

and unwavering support. I would also

like to express my sincere appreciation

to all my fellow Board members for

attending all our Board and Committee

meetings, supporting and guiding the

management in taking many important

decisions during this difficult time. And a

special thank you to our former MD

& CEO, Mr. M.S. Unnikrishnan, who

graciously agreed to extend his tenure

and superannuated on August 31, 2020,

after ensuring a smooth transition,

supporting Ashish through the initial

phase of COVID induced disruption.

Progressing into FY 2021-22, ESG

(Environmental, Social and Governance),

especially ‘S’, is taking centre stage, in

view of the rising disparity in incomes

and a sharp focus on securing human

lives. While the economic and social

disruption has been devastating, many

of those affected, not just by the virus

but also by loss of livelihood, have

been migrant workers and daily wage

earners. Moved by the plight of this

‘invisible’ workforce forming India’s

backbone, your company has made a

modest beginning towards improving

their working conditions, both within our

thermax has always been a proponent

of eSG, since long before the term was

invented. Your company is constantly

looking at ways to harness waste energy

for productive use, be it in heating,

cooling or generating power; cleaning and

recycling water; or using waste biomass

or non-recyclable solid waste in the

paper industry as fuel, for protecting the

environment in the long-term.:

MANAGING DIRECTOR

Dear Shareholder,

This past year has been unlike any other

in living memory. Amid the COVID-19

challenges, business priorities had to

be redefined, with health and safety

becoming the primary imperative. At the

same time, ensuring business continuity

to meet customer needs, and maintaining

robust financial health was also vital

to our sustainable long-term growth.

I am happy to share that your company

performed admirably on all these counts.

We took multiple initiatives for the

safety of our employees, who had to

adapt with agility to the new norms.

From strict adherence to the COVID

safety protocols at our factories and

customer sites, to the development

of a COVID management app, your

company ensured seamless transition to

the transformed realities. Learning from

the first wave of the pandemic, we

decided to expand our COVID safety

ambit, during the second surge, to

include the broader labour force that

supports Thermax, especially contract

workers and the migrant workforce.

Thermax has partnered with Aajeevika

Bureau to formulate the minimum

standards that the company will adhere

to in ensuring the well-being of the

entire ecosystem of our people.

The pandemic also triggered a series

of challenges on the customer

front, necessitating a new level of

responsiveness on the part of the

company. Maintaining service continuity

for international customers, and for

those engaged in essential businesses

such as food and pharmaceuticals,

demanded out-of-the-box initiatives.

Concurrently, your company had

to address urgent requests for

site shutdowns and force majeure

implementations during the lockdown

period, followed by expedited deliveries

as the economy rebounded, only to

slow down again with the relapse of

COVID-19. Our digital capability, which

we have been continually investing

in over the years, proved to be a

particularly valuable asset during COVID.

Our expertise in remote operations

enabled us to solve urgent customer

problems, ensuring seamless execution

of commissioning and other orders

from customers across the world.

One of our earliest crisis management

challenges was the commissioning of a

boiler for a customer in Egypt, without

any way to get our employees to the

site. We successfully commissioned

the project in line with the customer’s

expectations through our digitally

enabled remote operations capability.

Throughout the year, several such

orders from the Philippines to Zambia

to the USA were executed. Our teams

received numerous recognitions from

our customers for going over and

beyond during these difficult times.

That said, while our intent has been

to do our best, logistical complications

over the past year have made us realise

that continuous service improvement is

a business imperative. I do believe that

the prolonged pandemic has irrevocably

changed customer behaviour and

employee expectations.

As cash preservation became a major

priority during the pandemic, we also

worked closely with our customers

and partners to ensure timely

payments to Thermax by ironing out

Thermax is uniquely positioned

to bridge the gap between energy

availability and sustainability. It is

this larger purpose around which

the Thermax team and I are building

the company’s future path.:

124 Thermax Limited:

Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer as

the chief operating decision maker of the Company.

v. Contingent liabilities

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made where

there is a possible obligation that arises from past

events and the existence of which will be confirmed

only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or

more uncertain future events not wholly within the

control of the Company or a present obligation that

arises from the past events where it is either not

probable that an outflow of resources will be required

to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the

amount cannot be made.

w. Earnings Per Share (EPS)

The Company presents the basic and diluted EPS

data for its equity shares. Basic EPS is computed by

dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the

equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted

average number of equity shares outstanding during

the year. Diluted EPS is computed by adjusting the

net profit for the year attributable to the equity

shareholders and the weighted average number of

equity shares considered for deriving basic EPS for the

effects of all the equity shares that could have been

issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity

shares (which includes the various stock options

granted to employees).

x. Dividends

Dividend to equity shareholders is recognized

as a liability in the period in which the dividends

are approved by the equity shareholders.

Interim dividends that are declared by the Board of

Directors without the need for equity shareholders’

approvals are recognized as a liability and deducted

from shareholders’ equity in the year in which the

dividends are declared by the Board of directors.

3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates

and assumptions

The preparation of the Company’s standalone financial

statements requires management to make judgments,

estimates and assumptions that affect the reported

amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities,

and the accompanying disclosures and the disclosure

of contingent liabilities as at the reporting date.

However, uncertainty about these assumptions and

estimates could result in outcomes that require a material

and Chief Executive Officer to assess performance and

allocate resources. The management has determined

that some of the segments exhibit similar economic

characteristics and meet other aggregation criteria and

accordingly aggregated into three reportable segments

i.e. energy, environment and chemical.

iv. Non-current assets held for disposal and

discontinued operations

As part of organisational restructuring, the Board

of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on

February 8, 2019, had approved the transfer of its

Boiler & Heater (B&H) business to Thermax Babcock

& Wilcox Energy Solutions Private Limited (TBWES)

on a going concern basis through slump sale. This was

also approved by the Shareholders on March 27,

2019. The B&H business was transferred to TBWES

w.e.f. October 01, 2019. Accordingly, the results of

B&H business have been classified as discontinued

operations in the standalone financial results in

accordance with Ind AS 105 upto the date of such

transfer. The management considered the business

to meet the criteria to be classified as held for

distribution under Ind AS 105.

For more details on discontinued operations, refer

note 29.

3.2 Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and

other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the

reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing

a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of

assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are

Gratuity

The Company operates a defined benefit plan viz. gratuity for its employees. Under the gratuity plan, every employee who

has completed at least specified years of service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days (minimum) of the last drawn salary

for each completed year of service. The scheme is funded with an insurance Company. The fund has formed a trust and it is

governed by the Board of Trustees.

The fund is subject to risks such as asset volatility, changes in assets yields and asset liability mismatch risk. In managing

the plan assets, Board of Trustees review and manage these risks associated with the funded plan. Each year, the Board

of Trustees reviews the level of funding in the gratuity plan. Such a review includes asset-liability matching strategy and

investment risk management policy (which includes contributing to plans that invest in risk-averse markets). The Board

Corporate Overview

Financial Statements:

Managing Director

and Chief Executive Officer to assess performance and

allocate resources. The management has determined

that some of the segments exhibit similar economic

characteristics and meet other aggregation criteria and

accordingly aggregated into three reportable segments

i.e. energy, environment and chemical.

vi. Segregation of lease and non-lease

components of the consideration

The Group allocates the transaction price to each

performance obligation on a relative stand-alone

selling price basis by determining the stand-alone

selling price at contract inception of the distinct good

or service underlying each performance obligation

in the contract and allocates the transaction price

in proportion to those stand-alone selling prices.

Since the consideration is inclusive of the lease

component, the stand-alone selling price is not

directly observable. Hence, the Group estimates

the standalone selling price by considering all

the information (including market conditions,

entity-specific factors and information about the

customer or class of customer) that is reasonably

available to the Group.

3.2 Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and

other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the

reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing

a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of

assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are

described below. The Group based its assumptions

and estimates on parameters available when the

consolidated financial statements were prepared.

Existing circumstances and assumptions about future

developments, however, may change due to market

changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the

control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in

the assumptions when they occur.

Estimation of uncertainties relating to the

global health pandemic from the Coronavirus

disease (COVID-19):

The Group has considered the possible effects that

may result from the pandemic relating to COVID-19

on the carrying amounts of its assets such as

investments, loans, receivables, unbilled revenues,

lease receivables and inventories. In developing

the assumptions relating to the possible future

uncertainties in the global economic conditions

because of this pandemic, the Group, as at the date

of approval of these financial statements has used

internal and external sources of information including

credit reports and related information, economic

forecasts and consensus estimates from market

sources on the expected future performance of the

Group. The Group has performed sensitivity analysis

on the assumptions used and based on current

estimates expects the carrying amount of these

assets will be recovered. The impact of COVID-19

on the Group’s financial statements may differ from

that estimated as at the date of approval of these

consolidated financial statements.

i. EPC contracts:

•

Provisions for liquidated damages claims

(LDs): The Group provides for LD claims to the

extent that it is highly probable that a significant

reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue

recognized will not occur when the uncertainty

associated with the variable consideration is

subsequently resolved. This requires an estimate

of the amount of LDs payable under a claim

which involves a number of management

judgments and assumptions regarding the amounts

to be recognized.

•

Project cost to complete estimates: At each

reporting date, the Group is required to estimate

The timing and amount of the cash flow which will arise from these matters, will be determined by the relevant

authorities on settlement of the cases or on receipt of claims from customers.

*Claims against the Group not acknowledged as debt on account of ongoing arbitration/ legal dispute with the various

customers / vendors of the Group. Based on the legal opinion on few matters and management assessments of the facts

of the case, no provision is considered for the subject matter. Pending resolution of the matters, it is not practicable to

estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any.

e) There are certain law suits, disputes, warranty claims, etc., including commercial matters that arise from time to time in

the ordinary course of business, the amounts involved in such matters are currently not quantifiable. However, based on

managements assessment under Ind AS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” , that claims are not

tenable / probability of final outcome against the Group is low and therefore not disclosed as contingent liabilities.
