LAKSHMI MACHINE WORKS LIMITED 7

Corporate Overview | Notice | Statutory Reports | Financial Statements:

Dear Shareholders,

I

am addressing you at a time

when India which had registered

a remarkable recovery from the

economic and social abyss caused by

the untamed spread of COVID-19

virus last year, is now faced with

the onset of the second wave of the

pandemic.

While the situation is alarming, the

development of multiple vaccines

and a nation-wide vaccination drive

has reinstated confidence in our

minds. This has happened owing to

the resilient fellow Indians across the

country who have toiled relentlessly

to fight such a formidable battle. I

express my deepest respect for these

gallant heroes.

LMW’s journey in 2020-21 was

equally noteworthy.

Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown

was not like any other crisis. It was

an unknown space. The lack of any

precedence to such an occurrence

made it practically impossible to

fathom the extent of the damage that

could have been caused.

A period that started with such

uncertainty, steadily reformed into a

fiscal with considerable enthusiasm as

volumes started moving northward.

This change was orchestrated by

our team. Their response to this

perplexing phase was truly inspiring.

What stands out for me is the speed

with which, we as a Company, were

able to respond to and resolve the

challenges that arose due to the

sudden and unprecedented nation-

wide lockdown.

I take this opportunity to express my

sincere gratitude to the entire team

who, I am most certain, have gone

beyond the call of duty to facilitate

LMW sail through these unchartered

times.

Business in 2020-21

O

ur initial estimates were very

conservative. For plausible

reasons. We are into the Capital

Goods space. This sector, as a rule

of thumb, is the first to dip in an

economic slowdown and among the

last to recover with an economic

resurgence.

The first half of the year was dismal,

but we used this time well. As

opposed to waiting for business to

trickle in, we were pro-active in

reaching out to our customers both

existing and new, looked at new user

sectors and new geographies. This

unrelenting pursuit resulted in a

steady pick-up in volumes month-

on-month in the second half of the

year. We end the year with a good

order book that promises a healthy

start to the current year.

Looking forward

E

vents like this pandemic

bring in their wake, crises of

unprecedented proportions as also

opportunities like never before. An

opportunity to reimagine the future

and rewire thought, strategy and

action to build a path to a safer and

secure tomorrow. Such disruptive

events unleash forces of innovation

and creativity to shape a more

sustainable and inclusive future.
