Remuneration last drawn

as Joint: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

We trust you and your families are

safe.

FY21 has been one of the most

eventful years in living memory.

The Covid-19 impact on lives and

livelihoods can be regarded as one

of the most significant black swan

events of our time. Through these

tough times, we have witnessed

remarkable resilience of our fellow

Indians, government responsiveness

and multi-faceted co-operation –

much of which have changed the

way we live and interact.

FY21 was a year of contrasting

halves. The first half witnessed

economic erosion. The second

half saw an equally remarkable

recovery assisted by the efforts of the

Government and the banking sector.

The story for us at Kajaria, was largely

similar.

Our performance remained tepid

in the first half owing to subdued

business opportunities consequent

from dampened consumer

confidence. In the second half of

the fiscal, demand re-surfaced

steadily owing to the buoyant Tier

II and III towns as they emerged

as activity pockets. Supply, on the

other hand, was lower owing to

reduced presence of the informal

sector, a number of players increased

their focus on addressing export

opportunities emanating out of new

and large markets.

Hence, increasing volumes coupled

with our cost optimisation strategies

resulted in a satisfactory performance.

Revenue from operations stood at

B2781 Crore in FY21, against B2808

Crore in FY20, a marginal decline

of 1%; Net Profit grew by 21% over

the previous year. We surpassed the

budgets set at the beginning of the

year, with relative ease.

FY21, in one sentence, was a dismal

start with a remarkable finish.

Looking forward

To the current year: FY22 was a

good start, but our momentum was

constrained by a more fatal and

aggressive second wave. What is

heartening is that India once again

came together to flatten this curve

in a shorter period than the first

wave. Unfortunately, though the

losses were more painful. Even as

we pen our thoughts, the nation has

opened in a phased manner, with an

aggressive push for inoculating its

people, which holds the promise of

reducing economic adversity from a

probable third wave.

Barring this roadblock, FY22 appears to

be promising with India expected to

report a GDP growth in excess of 9%.

This positive resurgence is expected to

provide interesting opportunities for

India Inc. across sectors.

DIRECTORS’

REPORT

Financial highlights and state of Affairs of

the Company

In an unusual year, Kajaria demonstrated its resilience to report a

good performance in the face of unprecedented headwinds.

A tepid start owing to the pandemic was followed by an

unexpected upsurge in demand that sustained through most part

of the second half of the year. Prudently prepared for this sudden

shift in gears, Kajaria remained committed to delivering value to its

customers and creating wealth for its shareholders.

Despite a marginal dip of 1% in revenue from operations, Net Prof-

it increased by 21%. The Company reported a Net Profit in excess

of A300 Crore for the first time in its history.

The State of Affair of the Company is detailed in the ‘Management

Discussion and Analysis’ section which forms part of this report.

Outlook

The start to the new fiscal almost mirrored with that of FY21.

The only difference was that the second wave was even more

aggressive in its spread and fatal in its consequence. Even as the

country endured the pain of immense loss of lives and livelihood,

the resurgent Indian flattened the pandemic curve in a shorter

time span. The journey of economic progress has restarted

once again.

The uptick in consumer confidence has helped in kick starting

commercial activity. Moreover, the aggressive vaccination drive

across districts and cities suggest that India should be lesser

impacted for a third wave, if any.

Moreover, with the Morbi cluster focused on exports, the vacuum

created in the domestic market augurs well for the national brands

to widen their presence and increase market share. Additionally,:

Managing Director of

the Company for the further period of five (5) years w.e.f. 1st April,

2021 to 31st March, 2026, subject to the approval of members of

the Company at the ensuing Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) of

the Company.

The terms of Mr. Chetan Kajaria and Rishi Kajaria as the Joint

Managing Directors of the Company expired on 31st March, 2021.
