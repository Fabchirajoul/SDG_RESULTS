letter, it

is a painful feeling that it has been nearly 16 months since COVID-19

pandemic became a global health crisis. We are still grappling with

its unprecedented impact on lives and livelihoods as severe economic

lockdowns and travel curbs were required to cut the chain of virus

transmission. It is quite sad that many people have lost their lives or

their loved ones, especially in the intense second wave that occurred

this year. Our sincere prayers are for the impacted families to overcome

the adversity. We, at Ashok Leyland, directly and indirectly, continue to

extend the necessary support to the people in need to lessen their

physical, financial, and emotional distress.

Faced with the unprecedented situation, the Central and State

Governments have been continuously calibrating their economic

measures and policy initiatives to balance lives and livelihoods.

Businesses and industries, likewise, have responded with heightened

economic and social responsibility. As a leader in commercial vehicles,

your Company always recognised the crucial role the commercial

vehicle industry and the road transport sector play in our country’s

socio-economic progress. I wish to take you through some of the

challenges we faced and the resolute steps we have taken to stay on

course.

The demand for commercial vehicles declined sharply in the fiscal

year 2020-21, especially in the first Quarter, marking the lowest level

registered in recent times. This had an impact on our performance

in the medium & heavy vehicle segment, more particularly in certain

product segments such as buses, haulage and tipper applications. Apart

from the pandemic, an unprecedented shortage of semiconductors

affected our output in the last quarter. The vehicle sales volume

improved during the latter part of the year with progressive unlocking

of activities.

During this difficult period, your Company’s aftermarket operations

were in full gear to reach out to the stranded vehicles and drivers.

We also ensured prompt availability of parts and service support to

the vehicles. The aftermarket business performance was near normal

improving on the reach, turnover and service penetration.

Undeterred by the near-term challenges faced, your Company undertook

several path breaking product initiatives during the last fiscal. The high

point during the year was the successful introduction of the AVTR

range of modular trucks along with BS6 emission conformance in June

2020, a feat we are all proud of.

You may recall that we planned our entry into the light duty range

to balance the overall product portfolio and address the volatility of

commercial vehicle business cycles. Our first light commercial vehicle

DOST led this successful foray. Building on the success of DOST, we

developed in a record timeline of twenty-two months, the BADA DOST

in the adjacent higher payload segment, and commercially launched

it in September 2020. This introduction was instrumental in your

Company reaching the highest ever position in sales volume and

market share in the light commercial vehicle segment.

Both AVTR and BADA DOST have won numerous awards exemplifying

our product strengths and customer centricity.

Our International Operations were also impacted by COVID but, here

again, we used the opportunity to lay new foundations for the future.

BADA DOST will play a key role in this as the vehicle is designed for

configuration in both right-hand and left-hand drive versions. On the

positive side, Defence and Power Solutions businesses maintained their

success on an even keel.

Our journey of digital transformation of the business began in 2017,

with the launch of Digital Marketplace and now we have further built

on it with Digital Nxt. Through Digital Nxt, we are transforming the

way we look at our business and processes internally, and also how

we partner with our ecosystem to make the whole experience fulfilling

and profitable for all - consistent with our ethos of Aapki Jeet Hamari

Jeet. Our telematics solution for vehicles and drivers, iAlert, has been

a one-of-a-kind initiative for optimising on-road vehicle performance.

As you are aware, we have set ourselves the challenging Vision to be

among global top I0 commercial vehicle manufacturers. In the pursuit

of our Vision, we constantly evaluate the changing market dynamics

and customer needs to make our connect with them more purposeful

and mutually rewarding. I would like to update you on two major

initiatives that we have launched and are poised to take off soon.

These are also part of our orchestrated strategy to de-risk our portfolio

during the business cycles.

Ashok Leyland has been pioneering for decades the introduction of

latest technologies in India, in emission, safety and ride comfort as

well as towards better transport economics. In line with that approach,

over 15 years ago, we had initiated an alternate propulsion plan and

successfully introduced CNG buses in Delhi. This was followed with

a plan for zero emission through launch of electric vehicles in the

bus segment. We have also a notable presence in the U.K through

our subsidiary Optare. In order to accelerate our efforts in zero

carbon mobility and to provide a unified approach in electric vehicle

technology development for global markets, we have now combined

our electric mobility assets into a single entity under the name of

Switch Mobility.

The unique advantages of the new entity are the electric vehicle

development capability and customer experience that straddle advanced

markets such as the EU as well as the India-like growth markets. This

is in addition to our low-cost engineering, agile development, and

sourcing advantages in India.

Secondly, customers and operators are increasingly looking to be asset-

light. This has become more pronounced in the context of higher capital
