156:

letter

Dt. July 07, 2020 from the Department

Other Non-current Assets forming part

of Financial statements relating to

Advance to MAMC Consortium

amounting to Rs. 6,487.40 Lakhs

(Previous Year - Rs. 6,053.89 Lakhs)

Our Opinion is not qualified in respect of these

matters.

Key Audit Matters are those matters that, in our

professional judgment, were of most significance in

our audit of the Standalone Ind AS financial

statements for the financial year ended March 31,

2021. These matters were addressed in the

context of our audit of the standalone Ind AS

financial statements as a whole, and in forming our

opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate

opinion on these matters. In addition to the

matters described in the Emphasis of Matter

sections, we have determined the matters

described below to be the key audit matters to be

communicated in our report:

I.

Accuracy of recognition, measurement,

Key Audit Matters

presentation and disclosures of

revenues and other related balances in

view of adoption of Ind AS 115 “Revenue

from Contracts with Customers”:

Refer Note 30 to the Standalone Ind AS Financial

Statements

The application of the revenue accounting standard

involves certain key judgements relating to

identification of distinct performance obligations,

determination of transaction price of the identified

performance obligations, the appropriateness of the

basis used to measure revenue recognised over a

period, and disclosures including presentations of

balances in the financial statements. Additionally,

revenue accounting standard contains disclosures

which involves collation of information in respect of

disaggregated revenue and periods over which the

remaining performance obligations will be satisfied

subsequent to the balance sheet date.

We understood and evaluated the Company's

process, procedure and designed our audit

approach consisted testing of the design and

operating effectiveness of the internal controls and

procedures as follows:

o

Evaluated the effectiveness of control over

the preparation of information that are

designed to ensure the completeness and

accuracy.

o

Selected a sample of continuing and new

contracts, and tested the operating

effectiveness of the internal control, relating

to identification of the distinct performance

obligations and determination of transaction

price. We carried out a combination of

procedures involving enquiry and

observation, reperformance and inspection

of evidence in respect of operation of these

controls.

o

Tested the relevant information, accounting

systems and change relating to contracts and

related information used in recording and

disclosing revenue in accordance with Ind AS

115.

o

Reviewed a sample of contracts to identify

possible delays in achieving milestones,

which require change in estimated efforts to

complete the remaining performance

obligations.
