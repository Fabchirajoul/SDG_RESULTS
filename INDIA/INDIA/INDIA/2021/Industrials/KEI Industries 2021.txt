Letter from the Chairman

letter from the

chairman-cum-: managing director

deAR shAReholdeRs,

An unprecedented year for everyone, FY 2020-21 nevertheless

demonstrated KEI’s resiliency and resolve. Throughout

this tough period, our unflinching focus has been towards

safeguarding our people, ensuring no major disruption to

our customers and consumers, supporting our communities

and retaining our financial strength. It was also a year of

transformation for KEI as we set out to aggressively grow our

Retail segment while gradually reducing the contribution of EPC

projects to our overall sales mix. We believe that this strategic

shift will enable us to deliver better value in the years ahead.

finAnciAl ResUlTs

The fiscal year commenced amidst the nationwide lockdown,

resulting in all our plants being shut down for almost an entire

month, our employees transitioning to a remote working

environment, dealers not being operational, and supply chain

disruption. As the year progressed, the slowdown in economic

activities, with infrastructure projects facing delays due to

shortage of workforce, localized restrictions and widespread

uncertainty had a significant bearing on the demand for wires

and cables.

At KEI, we responded with agility to deliver a commendable

performance against this exceptionally challenging backdrop.

Our net sales for FY 2020-21 stood at ` 4,181 Crore as against

` 4,884 Crore in the previous year. This decline in net sales

was largely due to the lockdown and business restrictions in

the first quarter and the execution of one large export order

in the previous year. Our EPC sales for the full year was also

lower, which is as per the management strategy to reduce our

dependence on the EPC business and restrict its turnover.

Our strong focus on optimizing our costs enabled us to improve

our EBITDA margin to 11.49%, as against 10.49% in the previous

year. Profit after tax stood at ` 273 Crore as against ` 255 Crore

in the previous year. We are also pleased to report that our

net debt (including acceptances) has been reduced by ` 514

Crore in the year under review, which has helped to reduce our

finance cost. The retention money from EPC debtors is partly

expected to be released during FY 2021-22, which will provide

us with sufficient cash flows to meet our working capital and

growth requirements. Further, our Company’s credit rating was

upgraded to Ratings AA- for long-term bank facilities and A1+

for short-term bank facilities. The revised outlook along with

our strong liquidity profile will enable us to secure funds at

competitive costs.

segmenT-Wise ReVieW

As mentioned previously, our Retail segment faced an

exceptionally challenging first quarter during which sales

declined by nearly 49% from the corresponding period in

the previous year. However, with the easing of restrictions

and unlocking of the economy, retail sales made a strong

sequential revival to almost erase the adverse impact of the first

quarter. For the full year, sales through the dealer / distribution

market was almost at par with last year. More importantly, the

contribution of our Retail segment to overall sales mix now

stands at 34% as against 29% in the previous year. This is in line

with our focused strategy as the Retail business offers better

margins and has lower working capital requirements.

Going forward, our target is to generate 40-50% of our overall

sales from the Retail segment in the medium term. To provide

a thrust to the Retail segment, we have been strengthening

our manpower in various sales branches at different levels all

over India. We have also hired a leading consultant for helping

us formulate the strategies to increase our sales through our

distribution network. We remain focused on growing our dealer

network, deepening our engagement with our channel partners

and strengthening our brand visibility through increased

investments. Plans to foray into the FMEG sector are also being

carefully evaluated to boost our retail sales.

Our Institutional segment continued to deliver a steady

performance with our strong pre-qualification credentials

enabling us to tap the growing opportunities across multiple

sectors. Our expertise and capability are best demonstrated

Consolidated Cash Flow Statement For The Year Ended 31st March, 2021 (Contd...)

(` in Millions):

Letter of credit issued by banks under non-fund based working capital limits of

the Group. Considering these arrangements are majorly for raw materials with a

maturity of up to twelve months, the economic substance of the transaction is

determined to be operating in nature and these are recognised as Acceptances

under Trade and other payables.

2.7.2.3 DE-RECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

A Financial Liability is de-recognised when obligation under the liability is discharged or

cancelled or expires. Consequently, write back of unsettled credit balances is done on the

previous experience of Management and actual facts of each case and recognised in Other

Operating Income if arising during normal course of business. When an existing Financial

Liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the

terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification

is treated as de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.

Difference in respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

2.7.3 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In some cases, Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts

and interest rate swaps to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks. Derivative

financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is

entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at the end of each period.

Method of recognizing resulting gain or loss depends on whether derivative is designated as

a hedging instrument, and if so, on nature of item being hedged. Any gains or losses arising

from changes in fair value of derivatives are taken directly to statement of profit and loss.

2.7.4 OFFSETTING OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and net amount is reported in the Balance

Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset recognised amounts and there is

an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise assets and settle liabilities simultaneously.
