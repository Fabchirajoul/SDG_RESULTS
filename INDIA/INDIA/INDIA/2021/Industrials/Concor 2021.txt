LETTER FROM CHAIRMAN AND: MANAGING DIRECTOR

Dear Fellow shareholders,

My sincere wishes that each of you is safe and well in these unprecedented times.

The year 2020-21 has been challenging for each one of us due to Covid-19 pandemic, which has had a significant

impact on lives, livelihoods and the businesses world over. Operational challenges mounted due to restricted

movement and disrupted supply lines. As the second wave of the pandemic unfolds with predictions of a third

wave, our focus continues to be on organizing our business by ensuring uninterrupted logistic support to trade,

including for transportation of essential commodities, liquified oxygen for medical purpose and above all taking

care for health and safety of our people and the communities in which we operate.

As per report of International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy contracted by 3.2% during the year 2020,

whereas the GDP of India in Fiscal Year 2020-21 contracted by 7.3% and the global growth is projected at 6.0

percent in 2021. The Governments world over, including in India have taken various steps which includes financial

stimulus to the support their economies in this tough time.

In order to ameliorate impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Country’s economy, our Government has announced a

special economic and comprehensive package under ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ amounting to about Rs.27.1 lakh

crores. Structural reforms were also announced, which inter-alia included de-regulation of the agricultural sector,

new PSU policy, commercialization of coal mining, higher FDI limits in defence and space sector, development of

Industrial Land/ Land Bank, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in 13 (thirteen) Sectors, including

investments in creating infrastructure, etc.

Indian Railways registered an increase of 1.90% in originating loading of cargo, from 1210.22 million tonnes in

2019-20 to 1233.24 million tonnes in 2020-21. The originating containerized cargo transported by rail increased

from 61.22 million tonnes in 2019-20 to 63.23 million tonnes in 2020-21, reflecting an increase of 3.28%. The

containers handled at all ports of the country registered a marginal growth of 0.28% from 16.45 million TEUs in

2019-20 to 16.50 million TEUs in 2021.

In this environment, I am writing this letter with a sense of pride by sharing the economic and business outlook and

consistent achievements of your Company.

The relentless commitment and dedication of every member of the CONCOR family has helped the business

overcome many challenges in the past year. As a result, we have been able to conclude the financial year 2020-21

with impressive financial numbers. For the year, we reported a Gross Turnover of Rs.6,670.44 crores, Profit after

tax at Rs.503.33 crores and the net worth of the Company at Rs.10,204 crores as on 31.03.2021.

During the year 2020-21, CONCOR has handled 3.64 million TEUs and transported 42.02 million tonnes of cargo

volume by rail, a marginal drop of 2.79% and increase of 3.93%, respectively over the preceding year. There was

marginal drop of 3.77% and increase of 2.42% in the physical volumes of EXIM and Domestic segments of

businesses respectively. The profitability for the year 2020-21 was impacted due to increase in land license fee by

Railways, one time provisioning for assets build on terminals handed over to Indian Railways and impairment of

investment in subsidiary Companies.

Till the financial year 2019-20, CONCOR was paying Land License Fee (LLF) to the Railways for the railway

lands leased to it on the basis of number of Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) handled. Ministry of Railways

had communicated that the LLF applicable on the Railway lands leased to CONCOR shall now be charged w.e.f.

01.04.2020 as per extant policy of Railways i.e., @6% of the value of land, which will further increase 7%

annually. As this was impacting viability of some of our terminals build on Railway land, 17 terminals were

surrendered during the year. Taking into consideration the land parcels surrendered and as per the company’s

assessment, an amount of Rs.517.39 crore has been paid as Land License fee to Indian Railways in FY 2020-21

towards terminals built on Railway land.
