Managing Director

We witnessed a strong performance in Elecon Gear Division in 20-21. This is particularly

important as our first quarter got completely washed out due to pandemic break

out and complete lockdown thereof. Our relentless focus on process optimization

starting from appropriate quality order booking in required combination to an

efficient execution on time, finally resulted into a quick completion of order cycle.

This resulted an improved turnover ratio and a better cost rationalization which

together presented a stronger result in midst of a testing time. Performance of

our subsidiaries continue to be satisfactory considering the challenges in global

economy. Pandemic and its various successive waves will be there for some time

and the global economy cannot isolate itself from Covid effect. Hence, in Elecon

Gear, we are now concentrating on various strategic initiatives which would enhance our operational efficiencies

so that we get somehow immuned from the turmoil of global economy and uncertainty thereof in the business in

days to come. We are witnessing improvement in economic activity led by widespread vaccination and favourable

government measures. Gear Division remains well placed to capitalize on the upcoming opportunities and we are

confident of emerging out to be stronger than before getting boiled in the ongoing crisis.

M M Nanda - Head Gear Division

Our financial performance in in this year has been better considering the uncertainty

prevailed at the beginning of the year. The company took measures to improve the

working capital, cost mitigation and profitability improvement which has yielded

the better results and reduction of debt. Gear division’s financial performance

improved based on the focus on exports, profitability decisions while taking orders,

improved receivables management, measures taken for inventory management

and temporary as well as sustainable cost mitigation. In MHE division, focus was

given to pursue end customers to complete the execution of project based orders

which helps the company to realise the milestone based receivables and cost

(ix)

With reference to the Surya Roshani Limited & others v/s EPFO judgment

of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, which set out the principles based on

which allowances paid to the employees should be identified for inclusion in

basic wages for the purposes of computation of Provident Fund contribution.

The Management is of the view that there is considerable uncertainty around

the timing, manner and extent in which the judgment will be interpreted

and applied by the regulatory authorities. Management is of the view that

any incremental outflow in this regard can only be determined once the

position being taken by the regulatory authorities in this regard is known and

the Management is able to evaluate all possible courses of action available.

Accordingly, in view of management, any additional financial liability for

the period from date of the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India

(February 28, 2019) till the year ended March 31, 2021 is not significant. In

addition, pending the outcome of directions from the EPFO, the impact for

past periods, if any, is not ascertainable and consequently no financial effect

has been provided for in the accounts.

With reference to the Surya Roshani Limited & others v/s EPFO

judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, which set out

the principles based on which allowances paid to the employees

should be identified for inclusion in basic wages for the purposes of

computation of Provident Fund contribution. The Management is of

the view that there is considerable uncertainty around the timing,

manner and extent in which the judgment will be interpreted and

applied by the regulatory authorities. Management is of the view

that any incremental outflow in this regard can only be determined

once the position being taken by the regulatory authorities in this

regard is known and the Management is able to evaluate all possible

courses of action available. Accordingly, in view of management, any

additional financial liability for the period from date of the order of the

Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (28 February 2019) till the date the

Holding Company started complying with the order of the Hon’ble

Supreme Court of India is not significant. In addition, pending the

outcome of directions from the EPFO, the impact for past periods,

if any, is not ascertainable and consequently no financial effect has

been provided for in the accounts.
