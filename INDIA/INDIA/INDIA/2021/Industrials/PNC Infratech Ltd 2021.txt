Dear shareholders,

FY 21 thrown one of the most challenging situations which

never seen by the Company. The Covid-19 pandemic has

severely affected the people and communities around the

world. Lockdowns and wide-ranging restrictions imposed

by the authorities to contain the pandemic caused intense

disruptions to the socio-economic activities across the

nations.

As a Company, we responded quickly and decisively to

overcome the impact of the pandemic by putting in place

protocols early in the crisis to protect the health and safety

of our employees and site workers. I am proud of their

commitment and dedication to ensure business continuity

even in these unprecedentedly difficult times.

Performance

It gives me an immense pleasure to mention that despite the

market headwinds and unprecedented challenges throw by

the pandemic, we achieved satisfactory financial numbers

a testimony of our determination and commitment. We

reported standalone revenues of ` 4,925 Cr in FY 2020-

21 as compared to ` 4,877 Cr in FY 2019-20, EBIDTA was

recorded at ` 673 Cr in FY 2020-21 as compared to ` 764 Cr

in FY 2019-20. We achieved PAT of ` 362 Cr in FY 2020-

21 as compared to ` 460 Cr in FY 2019-20. We closed the

year with a robust order book with EPC projects comprising

62% of the total value of contracts under execution. We

successfully diversified into drinking water supply segment

by bagging some large rural water supply projects under

the Jal Jeevan Mission in UP. As a result, the remaining

value of contracts under execution as on March 31, 2021, the

orderbook is well over ` 11,600 Cr, which is more than three

times our FY 2020-21 revenues. This includes 2 EPC Projects

of Delhi-Vadodara Section of Eight Lane Access Controlled

Greenfield Expressway totalling to ` 1,548 Cr, 6 Water Supply

Projects of ` 2,475 Crs from State Water Sanitization Mission,

Namami Gange and Rural Water Supply Department, Govt of

Uttar Pradesh. Our prudent financial management has further

allowed us to reduce our net working capital days to 51 days

as compared to 57 as on March 31, 2020. We continued to

maintain a strong credit rating of CARE AA for Long Term

Loans CARE A1+ for Short Term Loans and “Stable” outlook,

which are one of the best in the industry.
