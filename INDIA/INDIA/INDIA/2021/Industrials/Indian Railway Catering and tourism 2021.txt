UDIN: F005311C000790141:

letter dated 05.08.2020. Due to change

in scope of work, the assessment under the present

contracts was not feasible.

c. In view of above facts, the IRCTC has decided to

increase the License Fee @15.50 % on quoted

license fee for SBD and Non-SBD Trains on account

of increase of Catering tariff for Mail Express train

as per the CC-60/2019 and accordingly all the

Licensees were advised to pay the enhanced LF.

d. M/s Griham Food & Hotel Pvt. Ltd. had filed a W.P.

(C) No. 2979/2021 i.e. Indian Railways Onboard

Catering Contractors Asso. &Anr. -Vs-The Union

of India & 2 ors at Hon’ble Gauhati High Court,

wherein Hon’ble High Court passed the following

order at Para-19, which is reproduced as under,

“Accordingly, while the Railway authorities would

be at liberty to dispose of the representation dated

27.05.2021 submitted by the petitioner No. 2 within

a period of 2 (two) weeks from today, this Court

directs that, in the interim and until further order, the

Railway authorities shall not resort to any coercive

action against the petitioner No. 2 in terms of the

impugned demand notice dated 25.05.2021 read

with impugned decision dated 13.05.2021”.

e. As the matter is sub- judice and there is an

uncertainty and occurrence is dependent on

outcome of certain event in future, the tentative

amount of enhanced LF is approx H 14.45 Crore

based onthe average percentage increase in LF

after implementation of CC-60/2019 of 15.50 % has

not been recognized as revenue and is shown as a

Contingent Asset.:

letter no TC-II/2910/20/Trains dated 11.5.2021 has

only agreed to waive off the component of “loss of paths

to Good trains” in calculation and charging of fixed cost

for IRCTC passenger trains for non –operational period

up to 31.12.2020 and has decided that other charges

applicable will remain the same. IRCTC has again

requested Railway Board to reconsider waiving off the

fixed charges (fixed haulage and Custody charges)

amounting to H 27.93 Crore for non-operational period

of the three trains considering it as a force majeure

situation, as the lockdown and restriction imposed by

Government of India due to COVID-19 pandemic was

beyond control of IRCTC. However, IRCTC has made

full provision for the fixed charges for both the Tejas

trains and Kashi Mahakal express trains train in the

Financial Year 2020-21.

Point 11 of Emphasis

of Matter

There are large number of legacy debit &

credit balances including those pertaining

to the period of transfer of operations from

/ to the Railways which are pending for

confirmation & reconciliation.

Most of the outstanding in respect of trade receivables/

trade payables are related to different Zonal Railways

and Government entities. Further, the Railway do

the accounting on Cash basis and hence Balances

in regard to receivable/payable can’t be confirmed

by Railway on a particular date. However, regular

reconciliation meetings are being held with concerned

Zonal Railways to reconcile and recover the dues

from Railways. However, for FY 2020-21, the balance

confirmation letters has also been sent to Railways/

Government Bodies but the response from the parties

is not satisfactory.

In respect of parties other than Railways, the Company

had started the practice of sending balance confirmation

letters to parties of each zone w.e.f financial year 2019-

20. For FY 2020-21, the balance confirmation letters

has also been sent to private parties but the response

from the parties is not satisfactory.

Regular persuation with the private parties is being

done at zonal heads level.:
