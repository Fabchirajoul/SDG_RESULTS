Letter of appreciation

in 2012 from L&T

for being the most

quality-consciousness

subcontractor

Received bonus from PWD

for the early completion

of widening and

strengthening of NH-96

Faizabad-Allahabad Road in

Uttar Pradesh:

Dear shareholders,

I hope you and your families are keeping safe during these

challenging times. We were faced with an unprecedented

once in a century event in terms of the Covid-19 led

pandemic, disrupting social and economic activities across

the world. During the year, India witnessed one of the

strictest lockdowns disrupting the economic activities

during the first half of the year. However, despite being

faced with several challenges, I am pleased to convey the

exceptional performance our team has delivered with

their committed zeal to achieve the highest ever recorded

revenues. We have been able to maintain our momentum

and our strong efficiency, which has led to a complete

rebound in execution post the tough initial quarters.

Strengthening infrastructure

Infrastructure plays an important role

in graduating India to the next phase

of growth. The government focus on

infrastructure spending to put the

economy back on track resulted in

the sector’s growth during the year

under review. The NHAI awarded

141 projects (4,788 km) worth Rs

1.71 lakh crore in 2020-21. The share

of engineering procurement and

construction (EPC) in the awards last

fiscal was 51% followed by hybrid

annuity model (HAM) at 49%.

The announcement in Budget

2021 further reflects the Central

Government’s commitment

towards transforming the country’s

infrastructure sector with a

significant increase in allocation

with the objective of connecting

cities and towns and facilitating

urban development across the

nation. The gross budgetary support

towards capital expenditure has

been increased significantly to

Rs 5.54 lakh crore in 2021-22 BE

(up 34 percent from 2020-21 BE,

and 26 percent from 2020-21 RE)

with higher allocation towards the

infrastructure sector (roads, railways,

among others). The government also

provided for additional allocation

towards the National Investment and

Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and the

setting up of a new development

finance institution (DFI) to bolster

the financing avenues for the

infrastructure sector and can pave the

way for increased private participation

thereby supporting the overall

infrastructure investment.:

Managing Director

We are optimistic on the road ahead with our comfortable

order book position, strong revenue visibility, healthy operating

margin, comfortable balance sheet position, controlled working

capital cycle and strong return profile would like to take

this opportunity to thank and show my gratitude for all our

employees for their hard work and continued support and to all

our stakeholders for their continued trust in us.:

Due to the nature of the work required to be performed

on many of the performance obligations, the estimation of

total revenue and cost of completion is complex, subject

to many variables and requires significant judgment.

Variability in the transaction price arises primarily due to

liquidated damages, price variation clauses, changes in

scope, incentives, if any. The Group considers its experience

with similar transactions and expectations regarding the

contract in estimating the amount of variable consideration

to which it will be entitled and determining whether the

estimated variable consideration should be constrained.

The Group includes estimated amounts in the transaction

price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal

of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the

uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is

resolved. The estimates of variable consideration are based

largely on an assessment of anticipated performance and

all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is

reasonably available.

Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of

certain phases of the work as stipulated in the contract.

Billing terms of the over-time contracts vary but are

generally based on achieving specified milestones. The

difference between the timing of revenue recognised and

customer billings result in changes to contract assets and

contract liabilities. Payment is generally due upon receipt

of the invoice, payable within 90 days or less. Contractual

retention amounts billed to customers are generally due

upon expiration of the contract period.

The contracts generally result in revenue recognised in

excess of billings which are presented as contract assets

on the statement of financial position. Amounts billed and

due from customers are classified as receivables on the

statement of financial position. The portion of the payments

retained by the customer until final contract settlement is:

managing director who is identified as the chief operating decision maker of the Group, examines the performance

of the business and allocates funds on the basis of a single reportable segment i.e. ‘EPC business’. The Group has no other reportable

segment. The Group does not have any reportable geographical segment as it caters to the needs of only the domestic market.

Accordingly, the segment revenue, segment results, total carrying amount of segment assets and segment liability, total cost incurred to

acquire segment assets and total amount of charge for depreciation during the period, is as reflected in the Financial Statements as of and

for the financial year ended March 31, 2021.

Non-current assets excluding financial assets, deferred tax assets amounts to Rs. 5,033.77 Millions ( March 31, 2020 Rs. 5,040.22 Millions )

are located entirely in India.

Information relating to major customers

Revenue of approximately Rs. 21,533.58 Millions (for the year ended March 31, 2020 - Rs. 19,468.55 Millions ) was derived from external

customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of the total revenue.
