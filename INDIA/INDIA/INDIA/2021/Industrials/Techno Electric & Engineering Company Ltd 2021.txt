Message from the Chairman

and: Managing

Dear Stakeholders,

I hope you and your loved ones are safe. I would

like to express my respect and gratitude to each

one working during this pandemic to make our

lives better and secure us against the virus – the

medical community and all frontline COVID

warriors. I would also like to extend my heartfelt

condolences to those who have lost a dear one in

this crisis.

This year has been a learning experience for

all of us. Businesses and individuals have been

compelled to rethink the way they conduct

themselves and adjust to a new normal. As we

continue to navigate through the uncertain

times, we, as a business, rely on our sense of

purpose to guide us and help us make critical

decisions, keeping the best interests of our

stakeholders in mind.

I am full of appreciation for the dedication and

agility shown by our workforce in transitioning

and adapting to a new set of circumstances at

work, where many have had to operate from their

homes and yet keep the best interests of the

business foremost on their minds. Their efforts

have allowed us to stay on track, and their

stupendous achievement is reflected in our

balance sheet for FY 2020-21.

EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

Over the last few years, the global energy sector

has undergone a great deal of change, owing

to various macroeconomic factors and subdued

industrial activities. The situation was aggravated

by the pandemic, which brought about

far-reaching changes in lives and livelihoods

of people across the globe. As the world and

businesses build back, this is the right time to

rethink plans, operations and business execution

keeping in mind the collective need to shape a

better future for everyone. A future in which clean

energy will play a major role.

Although global energy demand dipped because

of cessation of industrial activities for a while in

FY 2020-21 on account of the pandemic, global

energy demand is expected to rise by 4.6% in

FY 2021-22. Almost 70% of the rise in demand

will emanate from the emerging markets and

developing economies. The resurgent demand of

0.5% above the 2019 levels is expected to offset

the contraction of the energy sector that was

seen in 2020.

India has tremendous potential to generate

demand as well as supply the demand in the

power sector. The country is undergoing a

digital transformation with power at its core.

This has brought about a sharp increase in the

energy demand potential of the country, and

this is backed by the growing prospects for the

manufacturing sector in India. With sustained

government focus on the nation’s move towards

self-reliance in manufacturing, there is great

scope for demand generation in the power sector,

and thus potential for growth for companies in

this critical sector. To support this growth, the

Government of India has reduced tariffs and

I am full of appreciation for the dedication and agility

shown by our workforce in transitioning and adapting

to a new set of circumstances at work. Their efforts

have allowed us to stay on track, and their stupendous

achievement is reflected in our balance sheet
