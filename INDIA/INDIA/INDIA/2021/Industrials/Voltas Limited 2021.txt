Report is available online at:

https://voltas.com/inv_finance:

dear shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to present to you this year’s

Integrated Report – a document that distinctly exhibits

our purpose, potential and the context we operate

within. It perfectly encapsulates our comprehensive

strategy of value creation and strategic decisions that

have helped us thrive as a market leader.

2020-21 – a year that could easily be termed as one-

of-its-kind – threw several challenges and brought

about tremendous changes for all of us. It was a year

dominated by crises and defined by heroic responses.

Underpinned by our strong resolve, we, at Voltas, took

cautious but confident steps in the right direction

to benefit from the current changing and emerging

trends.

With the customer at the centre of our universe and

all our business operations, we continued to focus

on providing value to all our stakeholders at large.

In addition, being celebrated for our determination

and resilience, we were prompt in adopting the ‘New

Normal’ and pushing the boundaries through this

pandemic. It is my pleasure to share with you our

performance in 2020-21.

Fortunate to be a Consumer Durables Company with

a robust portfolio to deliver in a COVID-19 world and

beyond, Voltas made substantial progress despite

these unusual circumstances. While there was a 1.8%

decline in the Consolidated Total Income for the fiscal

year, Profit after Tax was higher by 1.5% at ` 528.79

crores. The Balance Sheet as of 31 March, 2021,

remained healthy with strong reserves, adequate

cash and minimal borrowings. These results keep me

optimistic about the coming months. I’m confident that

brand Voltas will bounce back, playing an integral role

in shaping India as the world’s manufacturing hub.

There were a number of things that worked in our

favour. One of these being Voltas’ need to always

have a well-thought contingency plan to bolster

against unprecedented challenges. This credo is

clearly reflected in the way we cushioned ourselves

last year. With the perspective of self-reliance in

mind, we focused on design and thinking-led

product development, consumer centricity and

digitalisation. We prioritised our business continuity

plan based on these pillars. We worked in synergy to

deliver our core brand promise of convenience and

comfort to our customers in India and across the

world. Keeping all this in mind, we continued to plan

for the future, as always. Voltasites across the world

have a common goal to be swift and agile in imbibing

capabilities to move forward across businesses and

industries.

Going forward, we are positive about easing and

improving of consumer sentiments. With changing

lifestyles post COVID-19, rising demand for consumer

durables and appliances, we are optimistic about

continuing our growth journey. Our focus on building

the orderbook, following a cautious and risk mitigated

approach, will support the Project business. The

decision to restructure the businesses will start

reaping benefits in near term across all verticals. We

are optimistic that the overall industry in financial year

2021-22 will be touching the pre-COVID-19 levels.

I take this opportunity to thank our Board for their

invaluable inputs and support. I look forward to their

continued support and guidance for many years

to come. Most importantly, I would like to thank

our employees for their contribution, hard work,

dedication, and drive which ensured that we remained

competitive in the market during such unprecedented

times.

I am certain that our ability to think proactively and

comprehend the emerging future trends will propel us

to move onto our next course of growth to meet the

potential that tomorrow has to offer.
