Annual Report 2020-21

3:

Dear Shareholders

At the outset, my deepest condolences for all those who lost their dear ones

to COVID -19. The events in the last calendar year were indeed disturbing and

stepping into 2021, especially India had to take head-on with a devastating

second wave. Hopefully we have contained it through our collective efforts.

My salutations to the brave medical professionals, healthcare workers and

organisations serving the country through various means against the backdrop

of the pandemic. As I understand, we initiated all necessary steps to contain the

spread of the virus in all our offices and sites.

Unprecedented times come with all sorts of challenges. I would say despite

the adversities, we have performed reasonably well. Though our topline and

margins were impacted we continue to be a profit-making entity. We have a

record orderbook of over ` 38,000 crore ensuring our prospects in the years to

come.

I am happy that the core founding values of the company are nurtured.

Through increasing our efficiencies, we are indeed strengthening our position to

be a world-class construction and infrastructure company committed to quality

execution and continuous value creation.

Hope all of you and your dear ones have been vaccinated. I request all of you to

stay safe.

Annual Report 2020-21

5:

Dear Shareholders,

FY21 was a challenging year for the

global economy due to the impact of the

pandemic.

Stepping to FY22 the second wave of the

pandemic played havoc. The number of

cases which peaked in the second week

of May 21 have started coming down

giving fresh hope. Our doctors, healthcare

and public administration staff fought

the pandemic saving thousands of lives.

Nationwide vaccination drive has picked up

speed.

My deepest sympathies for all those who

lost their dear ones. It is our collective

responsibility to help all those who are

distressed due to the impact of COVID.

Individuals, business houses, governments

and NGOs must come together to

handhold the distressed and the needy.

At NCC, while people’s safety is our

immediate priority, we initiated a

vaccination programme for our employees

and their immediate family members.

We continue to strictly follow all social

distancing and hygiene protocols at our

offices and project sites.

Economy

The Indian economy is reported to have

contracted by 7.3% in FY2021. Most

of the large and medium businesses

including banks in India have managed

the pandemic risk prudently. However,

the badly hit sectors are MSME, sports,

entertainment, tourism, hospitality and

service sectors. But I am confident that

economic momentum will improve as

the large developmental projects like

infrastructure and construction get into

full swing. Despite the pandemic, the

agricultural sector has done well in FY21.

With the prediction of a normal monsoon

in FY22,the agrarian sector is expected to

do well in this year also.

Being a developing nation India must catch

up and align with the developed world

in terms of economic recovery. Indian

economy is projected to grow 11% in

FY22 backed by the budget allocation for

development activities and the ongoing

vaccination drive. I am happy that the

various ministries of the Govt of India,

State governments and RBI are proactively

working towards this. As a sign of recovery

in the last quarter of FY21 the Indian

economy grew by 1.7%.

How We Performed

During the hard times our company

exhibited time-tested operational

endurance, meticulously built over

the years. Among the infrastructure-

construction companies we are indeed

uniquely positioned with our execution

skills and pragmatic financial, risk and

project management capabilities.

As a core sector player our performance

in FY21 is in complete alignment with the

Indian economy and its expected recovery.

Our consolidated revenue during Q4FY21

was up 21% YoY to ` 2817 crore as

against ` 2334 crore in FY20.

Our growth during the last quarter was

mainly driven by our strong order book

and pick-up in execution. The EBIDTA for

the period is ` 306 crore as against

` 287 crore during the Q4 of FY20 and

PAT attributable to equity Shareholders

` 117 crore as against ` 76 crore. Our

order book as on 31.03.2021 stands at

` 37911 crore. The company has secured

orders worth ` 18943 crore in FY21.

Stepping into FY22 we continue to receive

new orders for different segments of our

business.

The Board of Directors at the meeting held

on 28.05.2021 have recommended equity

dividend of 40% (` 0.80 per share of

` 2 each) on a paid capital of ` 121.97

crore subject to the approval of the

shareholders at the annual general

meeting.

Opportunity Spectrum

Budget allocation for the infrastructure

and construction sector got a significant

boost of close to 35% increase compared

to FY20. This includes a budgetary

allocation of ` 5.54 lakh crore and an

additional ` 2 lakh crore to states and

autonomous bodies. As an outcome we

should see more projects being prepared

and rolled out.

The intention to speed up monetisation of

brownfield infrastructure assets by creating

a National Monetisation Pipeline will

send the right signals to private investors,

enabling them to make long-term

commitment to Indian opportunities either

by way of investment in capital assets,

technology, or sourcing funds.

As most stressed assets were in the infra

sector, lenders were becoming extremely

risk averse and shying away from lending

to infra projects which posed a significant

risk to successful and timely execution

of the National Infrastructure Pipeline.

Setting up of the ARC and AMC to

address bad assets while recapitalising

lending institutions and creating a new

development finance institution can help

trigger lending for infra sectors. However,

many of the prevailing infra sector specific

and cross-sector issues will still need to be

resolved if the momentum has to be built

up. Also, the issues plaguing the success

of earlier instruments like long-term infra

bonds and dedicated financial institutions

like India Infrastructure Finance Company

Limited created solely for infrastructure

financing need to be addressed in

parallel for the success of proposed new

institutional arrangements.

Approximately ` 77,352 crore has been

proposed in FY22 for the water domain

that spreads across the Ministry of Jal

Shakti, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’

Welfare, Ministry of Rural Development

and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

This allocation is almost double of last

year’s budget estimate. Similarly, the

power sector got an allocation of ` 15,322

crore for FY21-22.

A healthy order book, policy and

budgetary support for the sector is to our

company’s advantage and I am confident

that growth momentum will pick up.

I take this opportunity to thank all

our clients, employees, shareholders,

central and state governments, business

media and financial institutions for their

continued support and guidance.

While concluding let me request all of you

to get vaccinated and stay safe. Please

continue to follow all COVID 19 safety

protocols.

Stay Safe, Stay Healthy
