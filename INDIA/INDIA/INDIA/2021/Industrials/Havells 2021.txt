letter.

Data integrity

We collected and analysed relevant data to support our

disclosures for this sustainability report. We exercised

strict internal controls to collect and analyse the relevant

data that we share here to support our disclosures

captured through our integrated data management

system. Our aim is to provide information that is

accurate and reliable, and at the same time unbiased,

comparable, and comprehensible. Wherever applicable,

we have taken care to cite any significant limitations in

the information.

Materiality

We conduct a thorough materiality assessment every

three years, with the last one held in 2018. As part of the

materiality process, we engage with both internal and

external stakeholders to ascertain their expectations

and aspirations and how these factors impact our

business. The identification of material topics helps us

frame our strategies and guide us towards making the

relevant disclosures.

Precautionary approach

We follow a precautionary approach towards minimising

our business risks and the impact of our business

operations on the environment. We have implemented

environment, health and safety (EHS) management

systems in our plants to address issues related to these

subjects. We get our EHS management system audited

on a regular basis by independent auditors.
