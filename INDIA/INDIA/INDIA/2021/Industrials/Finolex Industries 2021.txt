Finolex Industries Limited:

dear Shareholders,

but also the social and economic fabric

of our communities. The disruption of

international trade and the global supply

chain hugely impacted our production

centres. We faced challenges in serving our

end customers due to logistical obstacles.

Your

Company’s

markets

were

also

impacted by these forces, which resulted

in reduction in volumes, although total

revenues were higher than previous year.

In these challenging circumstances, your

Company has worked tirelessly to adjust

to the new environment. We have made

structural changes and implemented

the reforms needed to succeed and

evolve with the times. We became more

agile and adaptable in order to create

solutions through business processes

and

innovations.

Continuing

with

these changes your Company is taking

concrete steps towards Company’s digital

transformation including state of the

art CRM / Dealer Management system,

improving efficiencies in logistics and

supply chain and creating a tech savvy

culture across the organisation.

In FY 2020-21 your Company’s total

revenue increased by 16% to H 3,463

crores and EBITDA more than doubled to

H 989 crores - the highest ever since your

Company’s inception. This was driven by an

I hope you and your family are taking the

utmost precautions and keeping safe. I

wish a speedy recovery to everyone who

has been affected by this crisis.

Despite these exceptional times, I am

pleased to present before you the 40th

Annual Report of your Company.

It

gives

me

immense

pleasure

to

announce that with the vision of our

beloved founder Late Shri. Pralhad P.

Chhabria, your Company is celebrating

its 40th anniversary. I would say rather,

that it is a celebration of his visionary

entrepreneurship. The journey has been

exciting as well as challenging as your

Company continued to fulfil his vision as

a well-established premium brand in the

PVC Pipes and Fittings segment. While

we may pause to reflect for a moment, we

are always looking ahead to set ourselves

higher standards and greater goals, in

order to take your Company onward into

the future.

Soon after the WHO declared the

Coronavirus pandemic in January 2020,

countries across the world, gradually

went into a lockdown mode to try

to contain the virus. The economic

shutdown compounded the pandemic

crisis by affecting not just our health

Conduct by the Board members

and Senior Management Personnel

As required under Regulation 34(3)

read with Para D of the Schedule V

to the SEBI (Listing Obligations and

Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,

2015,

I

hereby

declare

that

the

Company has adopted a Code of

Conduct and Ethics for all Board

Members and Senior Management of

the Company. The Code is available on

the Company’s website.

I further declare that the Company

has in respect of the financial year

ended 31st March, 2021, received

from all the Board Members and

Senior Management Personnel of the

Company, an affirmation of compliance

with the Code, as applicable to them.

For Finolex Industries Limited

Sanjay S. Math: Managing

Managing Director and Chief

Financial Officer have furnished a

compliance certificate to the Board

of Directors under Regulation17(8)

of the SEBI (Listing Obligations

and

Disclosure

Requirements)

Regulations, 2015.

5) Policy for determining ‘material’

subsidiaries

Pursuant to Regulation 16 (1) (c)

of the SEBI (Listing Obligations

and

Disclosure

Requirements)

Regulations, 2015, the Company

has formulated a policy on material

subsidiaries. The policy is available

on the Company’s website https://

www.finolexpipes.com/investors/

policies-code-of-conduct/

6) Disclosure of commodity price

risks and commodity hedging

activities

For the PVC Pipes and PVC industry,

the prices and costs are linked to

and are dependent on:

a. Same underlying commodity

(crude oil) and

b. Demand

supply

for

each

component in the value chain.

Due to strong interdependence, any

major change in the price of one

input or output, affects the price

of the rest of the components in

the value chain, albeit with a short

time lag. Due to this, margins are

only temporarily affected whether

positively or negatively, until the price

reaches an equilibrium. Generally,

over a period of time, the impact of this

price movement gets compensated,

and results in normal margins. The

commodity price movements are

a temporary risk which can result

in margin risk but do not pose a

material risk to financial health of the

Company. Hence, Company does not

resort to any commodity hedging.

Further, though hedges are available

and actively traded for underlying

commodity (crude oil) but the price

of all inputs are not linearly related

to price of crude and hedges on all

inputs are not easily available.

Exposure

of

the

Company

to

commodity and commodity risks

faced by the Company throughout

the year:

a. Total exposure of the Company to

commodities and intermediates

H 3,606.79 Crores:

Managing Director of the

Company are different persons.

d. The internal auditor is a permanent invitee to

the audit committee and regularly attends

the meetings of the Audit Committee.
