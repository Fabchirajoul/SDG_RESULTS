Dear Shareholders,

It is my pleasure to present to you

the Annual Report FY 2021 for

Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL).

The year under review has been

extremely difficult for humanity and

economies at large. With global

GDP shrinking, businesses across the

world encountered many challenges.

The coronavirus pandemic has left

businesses to grapple with a complex

range of problems – of supply-chain

and logistical disruptions, cash

realisation issues etc. With various

measures like enforcing containment

measures, constantly rearranging

operations, keeping a tight leash

on cash, curtailing on discretionary

spend etc., companies have tried

to adapt to the changing market

dynamics – the New Normal.

YEAR IN REVIEW

It has been a difficult year for CSL as

well. As the year commenced with

unfortunate breakout of the virus,

numerous containment measures

were implemented, that included

social distancing, remote working,

and the shutdown of operations.

This left an impact in first quarter of

the fiscal, but we managed to sail

through the crisis by focusing on

operating with agility and developing

effective response strategies.

With effect from May 06, 2020, the

Company resumed its operations at

the main Yard at Kochi with entire

permanent workforce. We had to

rearrange our entire operations in

two shifts with some overlaps. This

transformation was quite challenging

for us not having operated in this

mode for over three decades.

Taking such adversities in our stride,

we explored new possibilities

and chartered pathways towards

sustainable growth.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Speaking in terms of financials, our

revenue from operations registered

a figure of H2,819 crores. Profit after

tax (PAT) clocked a figure of H610

crores, compared to H638 crores

in the previous year. Had it not

been a pandemic year, we would

have expected higher operating

revenue on the back of our Pan India

operations. Regardless of this fact,

our PAT margin stood at a healthy

21.64% for the year as against

18.63% for the previous year. On

the liquidity front, we have remained

strong. Although there has been

difficulties in collecting receivables

from a few customers on account of

the pandemic, the liquidity position

of the Company remained unaltered.

In March 2021, our credit rating with

respect to long term borrowings

was upgraded to AAA from AA+ by

CARE, which shows the exceptional

liquidity strength of CSL. This

positions us to avoid any foreseeable

impact from debt servicing. In totality,

CSL stands well-equipped to weather

the crisis.

ACHIEVEMENTS

During the year, CSL delivered 13

vessels viz., 500 Pax Vessel for A&N

Administration, Ro-Ro Ferries for

IWAI, Marine Ambulance Boats for

Fisheries Department of Government

of Kerala, Specialised Fishing Boats

for the beneficiaries of Tamil Nadu

and Brows and Pontoons for Indian

Navy. CSL also delivered one of the

4 nos. of Mini Bulk Carrier to JSW

Shipping & Logistics Private Limited

in May 2021.

In August 2021, the CSL built

Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC)

proceeded for her maiden sea trials

thereby making India join a select

group of nations in the world to

have developed an aircraft carrier

indigenously. During the sea trials,

the propulsion plants were put to

rigorous testing at the sea in addition

to the trials of various navigation

communication and hull equipment.

The successful completion of the

first round of sea trials during

these difficult times is a landmark

achievement for CSL as well as for the

entire nation.

CSL in its commitment to adhere to

sustainable business practices earned

the distinction of becoming the first

company in the Shipping sector to

be certified by Confederation of

Indian Industry (CII) for the ‘GreenCo’

certification with a Silver rating. The

GreenCo silver rating is expected

to pave the way for CSL to put up

a strong long-term roadmap for

ecologically sustainable business

growth.

is expected shortly. We are also

aggressively pursuing other projects

including potential orders from

Europe. Thus, the overall outlook for

our Shipbuilding segment is positive.

With strong demand visible for our

ship repair services at the main yard

at Kochi, and given the fact that units

at Mumbai, Kolkata and Port Blair will

function as fully standalone revenue

centres, the Ship Repair segment

continues to be holding promise of

strong growth.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

I am privileged to be heading

CSL while we are celebrating the

Company’s 50 glorious years of

delivering value and being in the

service of the Nation. I am indeed

thankful to the Government of India

for reposing faith and extending my

tenure as CMD for a further term

of 5 years. CSL was incorporated

in March 1972 and since then the

Company has grown leaps and

bounds with its strong determination

and commitment. It was never been

easy for CSL and the Company stood

“Initiatives like ‘Make in India’ and

‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ are also forging new

avenues to our business. We concluded a

comprehensive MoU with the Fincantieri

Group of Italy which is a leading shipbuilding

technology group in Europe, covering various

potential areas of long-term cooperation.”

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

AND ANALYSIS REPORT

Forward Looking Statements

1.

Statements in this Management Discussion and Analysis

of financial condition and results of operations of the

Company describing the Company’s objectives, expectations

or predictions may be forward looking within the meaning

of applicable securities laws and regulations. Forward

looking statements are based on certain assumptions

and expectations of future events. The Company cannot

guarantee that these assumptions and expectations are

accurate or will be realised. The Company assumes no

responsibility to publicly amend, modify or revise forward

looking statements on the basis of any subsequent

developments, information or events. Actual results may

differ materially from those expressed in the statement.

Important factors that could influence the Company’s

operations include government’s strategy relating to

acquisition of naval platforms, changes in government

regulations, tax laws, economic developments within

the country and such other factors globally. The financial

statements are prepared under historical cost convention,

on accrual basis of accounting and in accordance with the

provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and comply with the

Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act.

The Company has used estimates and judgements relating

to the financial statements on a prudent and reasonable

basis, in order that the financial statements reflect in a true

and fair manner, the state of affairs for the year.

2.

The following discussions on our financial condition and

result of operations should be read together with our

audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to

these statements included in the annual report.

Shipbuilding Industry

Global Shipbuilding Industry

3.

The shrinkage of GDP and the trade volumes due to the

current COVID-19 pandemic is directly impacting the

demand and the shipyards. The current COVID-19

pandemic is the worst health crisis in more than a century

and potentially without precedent if we take the globalized

nature of the current economy. A simultaneous supply

and demand shock that led to the global recession and

unprecedented contraction in global trade (affecting

both the export potential of nations and their demand

for imports). In an updated autumn 2020 report, the WTO

forecast a 9.2% decline in the volume of world merchandise

trade, in 2020 followed by a muted rise in 2021. Trade

volume growth thus would remain clearly below the pre-

crisis trend of early 2020. The impact of the COVID-19

pandemic compounded existing trends, complicating an

already challenging newbuilding environment at the start

of the year. Foremost amongst these was the long period

of yard rationalisation after the contracting boom in the

2000s, and more recently, the uncertainties surrounding

the potential impact of environmental legislation along

with non-availability of finance for the industry. These

existing impediments, combined with the adverse impacts

of the COVID-19 pandemic, created a perfect storm of

events that has effectively suppressed the appetite for

fresh ordering this year.

4.

The fillip due to the prospects due to large ageing fleet

replacements and new regulatory restrictions generated

some interest and likely to impact positively on long term

basis. However, the pandemic situation and the world real

GDP stagnant growth on year-on-year basis will have direct

negative impact on the seaborne trade and thus limiting the

appetite for the new shipbuilding orders in the near future.

Indian Shipbuilding Industry and Government Initiatives

5.

Global downturn and rising competition have resulted in

pressures on Indian ship building industry leading to a decline

in its global share to <1%. While India is one of the market

leaders in ship recycling, ship repairs is a very nascent market.

With the objective of propelling India to the fore-front of

the global maritime sector, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and

Waterways has formulated Maritime India Vision 2030 (MIV

2030), a blueprint to ensure coordinated and accelerated

growth of India’s maritime sector in the next decade.

6.

MIV 2030 envisions an overall investment of H3,00,000

– 3,50,000 crores across ports, shipping, and inland

waterways categories. This vision roadmap is estimated to

help unlock H20,000 plus crores worth of potential annual

revenue for Indian Ports. Further, it is expected to create

an additional 20,00,000 plus jobs (direct and indirect) in

the Indian maritime sector. Some of the Governmental

initiatives already put in place are:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To

The Members of

Cochin Shipyard Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial

Statements

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying standalone financial

statements of Cochin Shipyard Limited (“the Company”), which

comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31st March 2021, and the

Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive

Income), and the Statement of Changes in Equity and the

Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes

to the financial statements, including a summary of significant

accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according

to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone

financial statements give the information required by the

Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and

give a true and fair view in conformity with the Ind AS prescribed

under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Ind

AS) Rules, 2015, as amended (“Ind AS”) and other accounting

principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs

of the Company as at March 31, 2021, and its profit (including

Other Comprehensive Income), changes in equity and its cash

flows for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on

Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our

responsibilities under those Standards are further described in

the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone

Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent

of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by

the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together

with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of

the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the

Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder, and we have

fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these

requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit

evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide

a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional

judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the

standalone financial statements of the current period. These

matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the

standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming

our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion

on these matters. We have determined the matters described

below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our

report.

1.

Measurement of Physical Completion of Ship Building and

Ship Repair activities.

The company recognises revenue from ship building and

ship repair activities based on percentage of completion

method. The percentage of completion is arrived at based on

estimated percentage of physical completion as assessed by

the management of the company which involves exercise of

significant judgements. Refer Note 2.4 (Critical Accounting

Estimates & Judgements) & 2.19 (a) (Revenue Recognition)

to the Standalone Financial Statements. The physical

completion is ascertained as per an in-house procedure

developed by the management of the company. The

procedure and the assumptions therein are based on

certain judgements made by the management based on

inputs received from the planning, design and technical

departments of the company. Further, the ascertainment

of the actual physical completion of each sub-activity on

reporting date also involves management estimation.

Our audit approach consisted of understanding the basis

and assumptions made in adopting such procedure,

understanding the system for capturing data and

monitoring the progress of completion of various works

for internal reporting to the management, evaluating

the internal controls in such system, selecting samples

and performing substantive checking and analytical

procedures. However, we have placed substantial reliance

on the technical and activity-based assessment made by the

management for the purpose of recognition of income.

The Members of

Cochin Shipyard Limited

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial

Statements

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial

statements of Cochin Shipyard Limited (hereinafter referred to

as the “Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding company

and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) which

comprise the consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31st March 2021,

and the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including

Other Comprehensive Income), and the consolidated Statement

of Changes in Equity and the consolidated Cash Flow Statement

for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial

statements, including a summary of significant accounting

policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred

to as “the Consolidated Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according

to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated

financial statements give the information required by the

Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and

give a true and fair view in conformity with the Ind AS prescribed

under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Ind AS)

Rules, 2015, as amended (“Ind AS”) and accounting principles

generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs

of the Group as at March 31, 2021, of its consolidated profit

(including Other Comprehensive Income), its consolidated

changes in equity and its consolidated cash flows for the year

ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on

Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our

responsibilities under those Standards are further described in

the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated

Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent

of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by

the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together

with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of

the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of

the Act and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities

in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the

audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate

to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional

judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the

consolidated financial statements of the current period. These

matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the

consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our

opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on

these matters. We have determined the matters described below

to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

1.

Measurement of Physical Completion of Ship Building and

Ship Repair activities.

The company recognises revenue from ship building and

ship repair activities based on percentage of completion

method. The percentage of completion is arrived at

based on estimated percentage of physical completion

as assessed by the management of the company which

involves exercise of significant judgements. Refer Note 2.4

(Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements) & 2.18(a)

(Revenue Recognition) to the Consolidated Financial

Statements. The physical completion is ascertained as per

an in-house procedure developed by the management

of the company. The procedure and the assumptions

therein are based on certain judgements made by the

management based on inputs received from the planning,

design and technical departments of the company. Further,

the ascertainment of the actual physical completion

of each sub-activity on reporting date also involves

management estimation. Our audit approach consisted of

understanding the basis and assumptions made in adopting

such procedure, understanding the system for capturing

data and monitoring the progress of completion of various

works for internal reporting to the management, evaluating

the internal controls in such system, selecting samples

and performing substantive checking, and analytical

procedures. However, we have placed substantial reliance

on the technical and activity based assessment made by the

management for the purpose of recognition of income.
