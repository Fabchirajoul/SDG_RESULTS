VISION

To be a truly global, high-performing organisation delivering quality products and services to

its customers and attain leadership position in the industries we operate in.:

Dear Shareholders,

I hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe and

healthy in these difficult times. This year has been very

challenging for everyone with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Not only has the pandemic impaired livelihoods and

businesses, but also tested the limits of our resilience.

To ensure the safety of our Astral family, we provided the

best treatment available to not only all our staff members

who were affected by the pandemic but also any of their

family members and we underwent a vigorous vaccination

drive across our plants and offices. We also did our best

by giving back to society by donating biotech equipment,

oxygen concentrators, medicines to many hospitals during

the pandemic, and we also set up two oxygen plants at our

location to address the oxygen shortage faced by many

hospitals.

Even amidst all these challenges, I am pleased to inform

you that your company delivered its best financial

performance during one of the worst humanitarian crises

of modern history, and I would like to congratulate and

thank the remarkable Astral team for their unwavering and

determined work ethics for making this milestone possible.

Building on our mission to grow, we have been constantly

innovating to add to our diverse portfolio of products. Our

R&D and senior management teams have been working

relentlessly on new product launches, new technologies,

and new market opportunities. We have added various new

value-added varieties of products under valve category. We

will also be the first Indian company to make an indigenously

developed compound for fire sprinklers called Fire Pro

and we will also be the first and the only manufacturer of

CPVC composite pipes. This year, we have also successfully

added the water tanks product basket whose prospects

are promising across sectors like residential, commercial

and industrial. We set up two plants facilities in Santej

and Aurangabad for water tanks and also plan to start

manufacturing water tanks from our plants in Rajasthan and

Hosur soon.

Our strategic vision has been to decentralize and de-risk

ourselves. In the coming financial year, we shall be adding

three new plants for pipes and we will also be launching a new

line of plastic water tanks. To propel Astral to new heights,

the company has proposed a merger between Resinova

and Astral Biochem as a part of our long-term strategy

to synergize the businesses and optimize resources by

creating cross-selling opportunities and overall economies

of scale.

Astral’s branding strategy has always been to maintain

and grow by commanding a strong recall and presence

in the minds of customers. We launched our marketing

campaigns with our new brand ambassador, the one and

only, Ranveer Singh, which has seen an exceptionally good

response. As you know Astral Pipes has been awarded as

The Most Trusted Pipe Brand by TRA Research for 2019 and

2020. This consumer trust is a result of consistent quality

and product innovations and hence, the launch campaign

with Ranveer Singh had been conceptualized based on the

insight of consumer trust.

When I look back, the word that comes to my mind is

“Gratitude”. I would like to show my gratitude towards

our people and our leadership team who have steered the

company with resilience and executed very well in these

testing times. I would also like to show my gratitude to our

shareholders, customers, and partners for their continued

trust and support throughout our journey. I hope and pray

that all of us emerge stronger and come back to normal

times soon and we can consistently strive to perform in the

future, the way we have done this financial year.

Sincerely,

Sandeep P. Engineer

Chairman &: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

As the effects of the pandemic continued to hover over

the economy, Astral’s strong and deep-rooted business

and relentless efforts by the Astral team helped the

company stay committed and resilient towards its growth

path. The economic revival post the first lockdown

aided by the government push drove the housing and

infrastructure demand, which in turn augured extremely

well for your company.

It gives me immense pride to inform you that we closed

the financial year with one of the best performances in

our history. Our consolidated Revenue grew year on year

by 23% to ₹ 31,763 Million, while improving the EBITDA

significantly by 46% year on year to ₹ 6,626 Million

reflecting an EBITDA margin of 20.9% versus 17.6% in

the last financial year. Our Profit after Tax grew by 64%

to ₹ 4,082 Million while our Cash Profit grew by 47% to

₹ 5,247 Million. This revenue growth was a factor of both

the divisions, i.e. Pipes and Adhesives performing very

well on both the volume and value front, while the focus

on value-added higher-margin products and economies

of scale kicking in drove the profitability higher.

Our biggest highlight for the year has been the significant

strengthening of our balance sheet. As you know that

this has been an extremely high focus area for us, and

I’m happy to report that we significantly improved our

working capital cycle in this financial year from 41

days to 27 days. This improvement coupled with the

improvements in our margins and cash profits, we closed

the year with a strong net cash position in the hand of

₹ 4,094 Million.

As

the

company

focuses

on

decentralizing,

the

company will add three locations to manufacture SWR,

Agri, CPVC, and UPVC pipes at Sangli, Aurangabad,

and Bhubaneshwar. The merger with Resinova will

improve the scale of operations, reduction in admin

overhead, cross-selling, better brand recognition, and

exploring many synergies. All these shall not only lead

to a simplified group structure but also increase the

economies of scale and ultimately enhance the group

value and shareholder’s value.

In the company’s constant endeavor to grow via

innovation and diversification, we are moving from three

segments into four segments, i.e. Pipes, Infrastructure

products, Adhesives, and now Tanks, with an overall

market opportunity size of more than ₹ 65,000 Crores

that is growing at a healthy pace as well. With the shift

from unorganized to organized sector, one of the widest

geographical and distribution reach, a strong brand recall,

high focus on quality, and new product launches, Astral is

strategically placed to cater to this rising demand.

Visualizing the immense unmet demand and the

increasing need in each of our segments, the company

has widened the prospective opportunities by staying

committed to its growth mission. As a well-positioned

player, we have stayed strong in these tough times of the

transitory economic slowdown brought by the COVID-19

virus. We continue to be confident in the demand

scenario for the near and long-term future. I am optimistic

that our investments in products, plant infrastructure,

branding, and our people will lead to sustainable long-

term value creation. Looking forward, I pray and hope for

the pandemic to end soon. The aggressive vaccination

drives and reduced covid cases are green shoots creating

a light at the end of the tunnel.

Regards,

Hiranand A. Savlani

Chief Financial Officer

Segment revenue, segment expenses, segment assets

and segment liabilities have been identified to segments

on the basis of their relationship to the operating activities

of the segment. Inter segment revenue is accounted on

the basis of transactions which are primarily determined

based on market / fair value factors. Revenue, expenses,

assets and liabilities which relate to the Group as a

whole and are not allocable to segments on a reasonable

basis have been included under “unallocated revenue /

expenses / assets / liabilities”.

x) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of

estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements

in conformity with the Ind AS requires management to

make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect

the application of accounting policies and the reported

amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures as at date of

the consolidated financial statements and the reported

amounts of the revenues and expenses for the years

presented. The estimates and associated assumptions

are based on historical experience and other factors that

are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ

from these estimates under different assumptions and

conditions. The estimates and underlying assumptions

are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting

estimates are recognised in the period in which the

estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period,

or in the period of the revision and future periods if the

revision affects both current and future periods.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The following are the key assumptions concerning the

future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty

at the end of the reporting period that may have a

significant risk of causing as material adjustment to the

carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within next

financial year.

i.

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and

intangible assets

As described in Note 2(i) and Note 2(j), the Group

reviews the estimated useful lives and residual values

of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

at the end of each reporting period. During the current

financial year, the management determined that there

were no changes to the useful lives and residual values of

the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

ii. Provisions and Contingent Liabilities

Provisions and Contingent Liabilities are reviewed at

each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to reflect the

current best estimates.

iii. Impairment of Goodwill

Goodwill of ₹ 2,378 million (Previous year: ₹ 2,361 million)

and ₹ 192 million (Previous year: ₹ 192 million) have been

allocated for impairment testing purpose to the Cash

Generating Unit (CGU) viz., Adhesives and Plastics

Segment respectively.

The recoverable amount of all cash generating units

(CGUs) has been determined based on value in use

calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections

based on financial budgets approved by management.

Recoverable amounts for these CGUs has been

determined based on value in use for which cash flow

forecasts of the related CGU’s using a growth rate based

on company’s projection of business and growth of the

industry in which the company is operating. Discount

rate ranging from 7% to 16% has been applied. The values

assigned to the assumption reflect past experience

and are consistent with the management’s plans for

focusing operations in these markets. The growth rate

does not exceed the long term average growth rate for

the respective business in which the CGU operates. The

management believes that the planned market share

growth is reasonably achievable.

An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation

to a change in key parameters (operating margin,

discount rate and growth rate), based on a reasonable

assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario

in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would

decrease below its carrying amount.
