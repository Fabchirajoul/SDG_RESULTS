Performance and Outlook

The Company’s operating margin and profitability on a standalone basis improved remarkably during the Financial Year

2020-21 (FY 2020-21) as compared to the previous financial year. The EBIDTA margin increased to 12.6% in FY 2020-21 as

compared to 9.7% in FY 2019-20. Profit after tax of Rs. 5027.56 lakhs in FY 2020-21 as against loss of Rs. 7992.49 lakhs in

FY 2019-20, shows a turnaround from the previous financial year when due to certain exceptional items, loss was recorded

on standalone basis. It may be noted that despite the total income for FY 2020-21 having been impacted primarily due to the

Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdown especially during first half of the year under review the Company has delivered strong

topline growth from the second quarter onwards.

On a consolidated basis, the Group’s total income during the FY 2020-21 decreased from Rs. 180,034.63 lakhs in FY 2019-

20 to Rs. 154549.87 lakhs in FY 2020-21 i.e. a decline of 14.15%, EBIDTA margin was 6.8% in FY 2020-21 as compared to

8.6% in 2019-20. The Company has suffered overall consolidated loss (after Tax) of Rs. 1878.65 lakhs during the financial

year ended March 31, 2021.

The financial performance as reported above was achieved despite the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown

announced by the Governments as a measure to combat the pandemic in the countries where the Group operates, however

the extent of impact would also be experienced in the financial statement for the current financial year due to the time

required for synchronization of value-chain with efforts being made for reaching normal/pre-COVID level of operations which

were resumed in phases.:

Statutory Auditors of the Company at the 20th AGM until the conclusion of 25th AGM, subject to ratification of their appointment

at the AGM every year. In view of the amendment under the provisions of section 139 of the Companies Act, 2013, the

Managing Director

Anil Kumar Agarwal

Sumit Jaiswal

Director (Finance) & CFO

Company Secretary

Place: Kolkata

Date: June 08, 2021:

Managing Director of the Company for a term of five years w.e.f.

1st October, 2020;:

letter

dated August 28, 2020 inter-alia mentioning the outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as the reason for

delay in such appointment and requested for waiver, which was granted by BSE and rejected by NSE, wherein the

requisite fine was paid to NSE during the year.

(iii)

Intimations were received from BSE and NSE, each imposing fine(s) for delay in submission of financial results

for the quarter and year ended 31st March, 2020 (‘31st March FR’) and the quarter ended 30th June, 2020 (‘30th

June FR’). The Company requested for waiver of the fines explaining that the delay was due to a reason beyond

the Company’s control i.e. time taken in passing the final order by the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal

sanctioning the Scheme of Amalgamation of two subsidiaries with the Company from the Appointed Date i.e. 1st

April, 2019. The Company had represented the matter in detail to SEBI and the related correspondence on record

states that considering the facts of the case, should the stock exchange(s) were to demand fine/penalty for delay

in submission of the financial results, then the Company should submit response to the said stock exchange(s)

requesting for waiver of fine/penalty and that SEBI would advise the stock exchange(s) to waive the fine/penalty

and not take any consequential action. In view of the same, the Company requested BSE and NSE respectively

not to take any consequential action in this regard. The response from BSE to this is still awaited. While NSE is

yet to respond for the fine waiver request for the 31st March FR, it rejected the fine waiver request for the 30th June

FR, even as fine was paid to NSE under protest with a request for necessary waiver and refund, the response

from NSE being awaited.

(c)

The Board of Directors of the Company is duly constituted with proper balance of Executive Directors, Non-Executive

Directors and Independent Directors. The changes in the composition of the Board of Directors that took place during

the period under review were carried out in compliance with the provisions of the Act.

(d)

As informed to me, adequate notice is given to all Directors to schedule the Board Meetings. Agenda and detailed notes

on agenda were sent at least seven days in advance and a system exists for seeking and obtaining further information

and clarifications on the agenda items before the meeting and for meaningful participation at the meeting.

(e)

Majority decision is carried through while the dissenting members’ views, if any, are captured and recorded as part of

the minutes.

(f)

There is a system of compliance mechanism established by the Company and on reviewing the same and on the basis

of the Compliance Certificate(s) issued by the Key Managerial Personnel including the Company Secretary, as taken

on record by the Board of Directors at their meeting(s), I am of the opinion that there are adequate systems and:

was

levied till that date as

Company’s

request is currently

under process.

The Company by its letter(s) to BSE and NSE had informed that it

had already submitted letters to SEBI and the Stock Exchanges for

extension of time for submission of the financial results for the

Quarter ended March 2020 and June 2020 respectively on the

grounds inter-alia that the order sanctioning the Scheme of

Amalgamation of Cimmco Limited and Titagarh Capital Private

Limited with the Company was expected within a short time and will

enable giving effect to the merger of subsidiaries in the accounts of

the Company from the Appointed Date i.e. April 01, 2019 thereby

facilitating reflection of correct financial position of the Company on

standalone and consolidated basis; and the extension of time for

submission of the Results after giving effect to the amalgamation

therein will facilitate publication of financials such that there will be

no confusion in the minds of the shareholders and other

stakeholders regarding financial position of the Company. Further,

while considering the Company’s application for the extension of

time for submission of the aforesaid financial results, the concerned

officer of SEBI had advised that considering the facts of the case,

should the stock exchange(s) were to demand fine/penalty for delay

in submission of the financial results, then the Company should

submit response to the said stock exchange requesting for waiver of

fine/penalty and that SEBI would advise the stock exchange to waive

the fine/penalty and not take any consequential action.. In view of

the same, the Company requested BSE and NSE not to take any

consequential action in that regard.

The aforesaid Scheme of Amalgamation was sanctioned on 30th

September, 2020 and the Company submitted the Results for the

Quarter/Year ended 31st March 2020 to the Stock Exchanges on 8th

October, 2020.

BSE by an email dated 27th July, 2021 informed that the Company

was liable to a basic fine of Rs. 3,35,000/- plus GST@18% for the

delayed submission of Results for the Quarter/Year ended 31st

March 2020, however the Company’s representation for waiver of

fine was placed before its relevant Committee and after considering

the facts of the case, the written submissions made by the company,

the Committee decided to partially accede to the request for waiver

of fines and advised the Company to pay a basic fine of Rs. 40,000/-

plus GST@18%, which was paid by the Company.

NSE is yet to respond for the Company’s request for waiver of fine

on the subject.

The observations/ remarks of the Company are the same as

mentioned above in the matter regarding delay in submission of

financial results for the quarter/year ended 31st March, 2020, i.e. the

delay was due to a reason beyond the Company’s control i.e. time

taken in passing the final order by the Hon'ble National Company

Law Tribunal sanctioning the Scheme of Amalgamation of two

subsidiaries with the Company from the Appointed Date i.e. 1st April,

2019. In view of the same, the Company had requested BSE and

NSE not to take any consequential action in that regard.

The aforesaid Scheme of Amalgamation was sanctioned on 30th

September, 2020 and the Company submitted the Results for the

Quarter/Year ended 31st March 2020 and the Quarter ended 30th

June, 2020 to the Stock Exchanges on 8th October, 2020 and 14th

October, 2020 respectively.

BSE by an email dated 27th July, 2021 informed that the Company

was liable to a basic fine of Rs. 1,45,000/- plus GST@18% for the

delayed submission of Results for the Quarter ended 30th June 2020,

however the Company’s representation for waiver of fine was placed

before its relevant Committee and after considering the facts of the

case, the written submissions made by the company, the Committee

decided to partially accede to the request for waiver of fines and

advised the Company to pay a basic fine of Rs. 70,000/- plus

GST@18%, which was paid by the Company.

On 19th March, 2021, the Company received a letter from NSE which

mentioned that the Company’s representations for waiver of fine for

delay in submission of financial results for the quarter ended 30th

June, 2020 was placed before the Relevant Authority of the

Exchange and the Company’s request for waiver of fine was not

considered favourably and therefore demanded fine. The Company

paid the said fine to NSE on 10th May, 2021 and informed NSE by

its letter dated 11th May, 2021 that although the Company had stated

favorable/genuine grounds to waive off the fines but to avoid any

stricter action of NSE, the Company has paid the stated amount

‘under protest’ and requested to waive off the fines levied & refund

the amount paid to the Company at the earliest. The response from

NSE is still awaited.

letter dated 02.11.2019

wrote to the Exchange that: “if it is assumed that your office is taking

a different interpretation, even then the fine should be waived since

the time taken to appoint Independent Director was not intentional”.

The Exchange(s) informed that the Company’s representation will

be placed before relevant authority of the Exchange. Eventually, the

Exchanges did not agree with the Company’s view and decided to

levy the fine, which was paid by the Company.:

letter dated August 24,

2020 to BSE mentioned that it had already submitted letters to SEBI

and the Stock Exchanges for extension of time for submission of

the financial results for the Quarter ended March 2020 on the

grounds inter-alia that the subject compliance had become

impossible since the delay was beyond the control of the Company

and the extension will enable the Company to comply with the

accounting adjustment to give effect to the merger of two

subsidiaries viz. Cimmco Limited and Titagarh Capital Private

Limited with the Company which was in advanced stage of

completion, pursuant to the order of the Hon’ble NCLT, Kolkata

Bench expected shortly, since the Appointed Date as per the

Scheme is 1st April, 2019, thereby facilitating reflection of correct

financial position of the Company on standalone and consolidated

basis. In view of the same, the Company requested BSE not to

take any consequential action in that regard. The response from

BSE is still awaited. However, the Company had since submitted

the said Results on 8th October, 2020.

The Company by its: letter dated August 24, 2020 to NSE mentioned

that it had already submitted letters to SEBI and the Stock

of correct financial position of the Company on standalone and

consolidated basis. In view of the same, the Company requested

the Stock Exchanges not to take any consequential action in that

regard. During November, 2020, the Company observed that NSE

had marked its waiver request as 'rework' with the remarks that the

request for waiver of fine shall be considered by the Exchange only

after the compliance is achieved by the Company. The Company

by its letter dated 17th November, 2020 replied to NSE that it had

already submitted the financial results for the quarter and year ended

31st March, 2020 in the NEAPS portal on 8th October, 2020 and

requested for waiver by also mentioning that while considering the

Company's application for the extension of time for submission of

the aforesaid financial results, the concerned officer of SEBI had

advised that considering the facts of the case, should the stock

exchange(s) were to demand fine/penalty for delay in submission

of the financial results, then the Company should submit response

to the said stock exchange requesting for waiver of fine/penalty

and that SEBI would advise the stock exchange to waive the fine/

penalty and not take any consequential action. In view of the same,

the Company requested NSE not to take any consequential action

in that regard. The response from NSE is still awaited.
