an opinion on these secretarial records based on our audit.

2.

We have followed the audit practices and process as considered appropriate to obtain reasonable assurance about the

correctness of the contents of the Secretarial records. The verification as done on test basis is to reasonably ensure

that correct facts are reflected in secretarial records. We believe that the processes and practices, we followed provide a

reasonable basis for our opinion.

not verified detailed compliance, submissions, reporting under such laws etc. nor verified correctness and appropriateness

The Secretarial Audit report is neither an assurance as to compliance in totality or the future viability of the Company nor of

the efficacy or effectiveness with which the management has conducted the affairs of the Company.

Considering the limitations prevailing on account of global pandemic COVID - 19 and its severe repetition, particularly since

March, 2021 and Lockdown and semi-lockdown situation, we are not able to verify all the information physically as well as in
