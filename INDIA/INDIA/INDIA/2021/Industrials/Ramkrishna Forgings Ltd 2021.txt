letter and spirit. At Ramkrishna Forgings,

being a Socially Responsible Corporate Citizen is not an afterthought, to wax eloquent from glossy brochures, but rather,

is a way of life that is built into its very being.

However, when a corporate entity makes the transition upwards and reach out to touch and transform lives of those who

are less fortunate, going beyond what it is statutorily mandated to perform as a duty, the transition from the good to the

great begins to take shape. Such deeds can rarely be quantified financially and being largely intangible, do not find

inclusion in the statements that are recorded and filed. For, these caring touches, performed voluntarily out of a greater

compulsion, constitute acts that strengthen and enrich the Balance Sheet of the entity's life. They spell the difference

between the good and the great.

On a very basic level, the primary function of a company is to earn profits for its stakeholders and pay the taxes to the

exchequer. On a more elevated level, it lives to create wealth for the Nation, adding value, generating resources that fuel

progress, acting as a force multiplier. But on the highest level, an entity is an agent of societal change, one that uses its

expertise to empower, to foster transformative well-being in the society in which it operates. At Ramkrishna Forgings, we

are proud to be walking the talk, proud to be doing what our heart commands, what our spirit beckons.

The transition from good to great is a state of the mind, an ongoing process. On a very primary, basic level, just like the

corporate entities are blessed with the power of perpetual succession, they are also mandated to return to the society

more than what they draw from it for their sustenance. The statutory term that defines this symbiotic relationship is

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Its reflection, reduced to monetary figures, can be found in the Balance Sheet and

Annual Report.

The way RKFL sought to step out and do its bit to fight the menace of Covid 19 can also be seen as an extension of this core

belief. The Company was naturally in the forefront and conducted the necessary vaccination drives in all its facilities

ensuring that its entire workforce was inoculated at the first possible opportunity. However, what the company did

simultaneously, was to organise a number of vaccination camps that were open to the public at large which re-

established its humane credentials and, in the process, provided succor to many lives. As many as Nine (9) camps were

organised in different locations in the city spread over two Months in which around 6464 doses of the vaccine were

administered free of cost to the recipients who were primarily from the economically challenged strata of the society.

We are focussed. On leaving for our children a better world than the one we had inherited from our forefathers.

At Ramkrishna Forgings Limited, we too are statutorily bound to perform our duties as a socially responsible corporate

citizen. And we do it with the same vigour, professionalism and precision with which we conduct ourselves in the normal

course of business, as will be evident from the attached annexures in the:
