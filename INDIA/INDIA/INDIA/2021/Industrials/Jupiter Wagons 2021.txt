Dear Stakeholders,

It gives us great pleasure to share an update on the overall performance of your company for 2020-21 along with

the strategic roadmap for the group going forward. As we write to you, we are still experiencing unprecedented

times caused by the pandemic. Unfortunately, it was a challenging year for most industries owing to the impact the

pandemic had on the macro-economic scenario in the world. India's growth projection also changed to 9.6 % for

2021 calendar year from its earlier estimate of 13.9 %, nevertheless, we were still optimistic about the economy

bouncing back.

As a company, we have worked cohesively to maintain an unwavering focus on our R&D that enabled us to enrich

our capabilities, strengthen our abilities, and enhance our product portfolio. These efforts have resulted in

positioning our group as a highly trusted partner for leading companies across the globe. Moreover, the interest of

our various stakeholders remains of paramount importance to us and we endeavour to consistently deliver value

to them.

Nevertheless, as the uncertainty continues, we hope to see the return of normalcy. The show must carry on and we

are already adapting and finding growth opportunities. Our company has six strategically located manufacturing

facilities spread across Jabalpur (4 facilities), Indore, and Jamshedpur and a broad range of product offerings in the

commercial vehicle and wagon space.

To further align our business growth with the infrastructure development of the country, we have recently added

general fabrication prospects from port and Concor for ISO containers. Additionally, owing to the new promoters,

we have expanded our operating bandwidth and fetched BACCBM wagon orders and BOXNHL orders from private

operators. We are also among the large players that undertake manufacturing of various load body applications on

the commercial vehicle (CV) chassis.

We are simultaneously keeping a close watch on the power market as there is a spike in requirement on fabrication

items for FGD owing to the pollution norms. We will look to re-enter the market subject to the prevailing market

dynamics.

As we settle into this new normal, we have continued to focus on the safety and health of our employees who are the

backbone of our company.

To conclude, I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the government bodies, financial institutions,

business partners, and various stakeholders for their sustained support and contribution to our success. We

remain committed in our efforts to keep delivering better value. We look forward to having many more positive

updates in the current financial year.
