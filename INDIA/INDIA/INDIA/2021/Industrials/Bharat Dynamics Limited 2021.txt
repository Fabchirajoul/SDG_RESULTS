recommended a final dividend of ~0 .65 per equity share of no/- each amounting to Ul.91 Cr. It gives me great pleasure in

informing that your Company has paid an interim dividend oH6.70 per share in March 2021. The total dividend for the FY 2020-

21 declared by the Company is U.35 per share (face value ofUO/-each).
