issues.

letter) in respect to material

breaches noted in note 15(l) of the consolidated

financial statements.

• Review the insurance policies issued in favor of the

lenders.

• Evaluate the assumptions and forecasts made by

management in the future budgets.

• Reviewed and evaluated the security documents

applicable to this facility (project finance).

• Devoted attention to the assumptions made with

respect to the ability of the MCL to continue as

a going concern, the results and the cash flows

in order to assess the MCL’s ability to continue

meeting its payment obligations and its obligations

under the financing covenants in the year ahead.

Classification of the borrowings of MCL:

Refer note 15(l) for the related disclosures.

In accordance with the Common Terms Agreement

(CTA) between MCL and its lenders in connection

with the term loans availed, certain key events or

circumstances is defined that will result in events of

default.

On and at any time after the occurrence of an event

of default, which is continuing, the Inter- creditor

agent may exercise or, as appropriate, instruct the

security trustee to exercise any or all of the remedies

in accordance with the terms of the CTA.

A breach in one or more of the “events of default”

clauses could lead to making significant management

judgements with respect to the assessment of the

classification of the borrowings between long-term

and short-term, the legal rights available with MCL

and the other consequences in accordance with

the CTA. Accordingly, owing to these factors, the

classification of the balance of borrowings of MCL has

been assessed as a significant risk and considered as

a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures included, but were not limited

to the following:

• Understanding the provisions of the CTA between

MCL and its lenders with respect to the legal and

other rights available.

• Review of the communications between MCL and

its lenders and between MCL and its customer,

ZESCO and Government of Zambia.

• Testing the management assessment of the

classification of borrowings, including review of

the terms of the insurance cover and the sovereign

guarantee issued by the Government of Zambia.

• Review of the independent legal advise sought

by the management in relation to the various

legal rights available to MCL and the time frame

associated with each of the options.

• Testing the management assessment of the

outcome of the arbitration.

• Evaluating the appropriateness of the disclosures

made in the consolidated financial statements in

respect of this matter.:

25 March 2021.

The Board of

letter, duly reserving

their rights in accordance with the terms of

the Common Terms Agreement entered with

them. These loans are primarily secured by the

assets of MCL, a sovereign guarantee issued

by the Government of Zambia (To the extent

of monies owed to MCL by ZESCO) and an

insurance cover for a majority portion of the

outstanding balance. Pursuant to an approval

from the lenders and in accordance with the

terms of the power purchase agreement, the

management of MCL has invoked necessary

arbitration proceedings against ZESCO, in

pursuit of strengthening its efforts to realise

the amounts due and also to ensure the

repayment of the instalment defaulted.

While the management has secured a

formal approval from the lenders in relation

to invoking the government guarantee,

the invocation of the insurance claim does

mandate

completion

of

an

arbitration

proceedings in accordance with the terms

of the power purchase agreement and the

arbitration award being in favor of MCL. In

accordance with the terms of the underlying

insurance policy, the insurer would make good

to the lenders only the amount of instalments

which have been defaulted and the rest of the

instalment would be paid in accordance with

the terms of the original repayment schedule

agreed between MCL and the lenders.

Consequently, on the basis of a collective

assessment of the status of the discussions

execution, he transformed the Company to its pre-

eminent position of an Indian multinational having

Zambia within the budgeted resources. He takes

active interest in all the CSR activities of the Group

to make a qualitative difference and currently

chairs the CSR Committee of the Board. On the

operational side, he plays a mentor role in guiding

strategy for all facets and verticals of the Company

and its subsidiaries. The Company received several

accolades in the areas of CSR, exports, productivity,

quality, industrial safety, environmental protection

etc., under his leadership.

schemes and smooth transition.
