Dear Shareholders,

An organisation’s success

is not mapped by its

performance alone. in

a difficult business

environment, which FY 21

definitely was, it is also a

measure of a company’s

ability to adapt to the

transforming eco-system.

it is defined by the speed

and agility with which an

organisation aligns itself

to the new systems and

processes. By this yardstick,

FY 21 will go down in the

history of your Company

as quite a remarkable

one. Given the backdrop

of restrictions in both, the

domestic and international

markets, and the emergence

of Coronavirus variants

leading to lockdowns in

first quarter of the year

and then the emergence of

second wave in india, your

Company’s performance has

been quite satisfactory.

32:

Managing Director

EBIDTA margins showed an

improvement from 20.8%

in FY 20 to 23.7% in FY 21

– underscoring our sharp

cost focus in these difficult

times. Profit margin was

also largely maintained,

versus the previous year,

at 14.6%.

Credit and about 29% is contractually not due. Necessary

provisions against doubtful debts and expected credit loss

are made after proper due diligence.

Other Financial Assets

Other financial assets have increased by ` 38.5 million over

the previous year. This is due to increase in unbilled revenue

of ` 22.6 million, which has been billed subsequently. Further,

MTM gain on outstanding forward contract of ` 11.9 million

on account of hedge accounting resulted into increase in

other financial assets.

Other Current Assets

Other current assets have decreased by ` 68.5 million over

the previous year. Decrease in other current assets is mainly

due to receipt of GST refund. All other items under this

head, including Export Incentive receivables and advance

paid to vendors etc., are also lower as compared to the

previous year. These balances are normal in nature and fully

recoverable.

Non-Current Liabilities

These mainly comprise deferred tax liabilities (net) and

certain long-term provisions towards employee benefits, as

mandated by relevant provisions of Ind AS, warranty etc.,

which are made in normal course of business.:
