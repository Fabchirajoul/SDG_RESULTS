response to the aforesaid qualification is given as under:-

Auditors’ Qualification

Management’s Reply

a)

As stated in note no.44(e) of audited standalone financial

statements for the year ended 31st March, 2021, the

Company has given/provided corporate guarantee of

USD 1,500 lakhs (previous year USD 1,500 lakhs) for

loans granted by the lender to Jaiprakash Associates

Limited (JAL) (the party to whom the Company is an

associate) of amounting to Rs. 70,333 lakhs (previous

year Rs. 70,333 lakhs) for which fair valuation has not

been done as per the applicable IND-AS as of 31st

March, 2021 and also no provision there against has

been made in these financial results (in the absence of

fair valuation impact unascertained) (Footnote no. 4 of

accompanying financial results).

In the opinion of the Management there will be no material

impact of the fair valuation of the following guarantee on the

financial result/ statement of affairs. Accordingly fair valuation is

not being considered and recorded in this financial statement.

(Corporate Guarantee of US$ 1,500 Lakhs in favour of State

Bank of India, Hong Kong branch for the credit facilities

granted by lenders to Jaiprakash Associates Limited (Party

to whom the company is Associate). The principal amount of

loan outstanding of US$ 1,300 Lakhs (equivalent to Rs. 70,333

lakhs) has been converted into rupee term loan by State Bank

of India vide sanction: letter dated 28th December, 2016.

Presently Impact cannot be quantified.

b)

As stated in note no. 46 and 53(a) of audited standalone

financial statements for the year ended 31st March,

2021, no provision for diminution in value against certain

long-term investments made in subsidiaries amounting

to Rs. 78,785 lakhs (previous year Rs. 78,915 lakhs)

(Book Value) has been made by the management as

in the opinion of the management such diminution is

temporary (this to be read with footnote no. 3 of the

accompanying financial results) in nature considering

the intrinsic value of the assets, future prospects and

claims (impact unascertainable). (Footnote no. 6 of

accompanying financial results).Having regard to the

above, management of the Company has concluded that

no provision against diminution in value of investment

made, as stated above, in subsidiary companies is

necessary at this stage.

Above both (a) & (b) qualification are appearing since

No provision for diminution in value against following long-

term investments of amounting to Rs.78,785 lakhs (Book

letter dated 28th December, 2016.

Presently Impact cannot be quantified.

b)

In respect of Subsidiary Company, Sangam Power Generation

Company Limited (SPGCL) where Parent has investment of Rs.

55,207 lakhs - Expenditure incurred during the construction and

incidental for setting up of the project, Capital advances and

Security Deposits (Non-Current other financial assets) in respect

of project (project assets) have been carried forward as ‘Capital

Work-in-Progress’, Capital advances and Security Deposits

(Non-Current other financial assets) aggregating Rs. 10,804

lakhs, Rs. 2,248 lakhs and Rs. 3,003 lakhs respectively. In view

of circumstances discussed in the note no. 7 of accompanying

statement, including land being not in possession as stated in

the said note, the Company (the parent) had requested Uttar

Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) to take over the

project SPGCL and refund of investment made by it. Further, the

SPGCL has withdrawn all its undertakings given to UPPCL and

lodged a claim of Rs. 115,722 lakhs. Meanwhile UPERC vide its

Order dated 28.06.2019 has allowed the claim of SPGCL for Rs.

25,137 Lakhs along with interest @ 9% p.a. on Rs. 14,925 Lakhs

for the period from 11.04.2014 to 31.03.2019 and also directed

UPPCL to immediately release Performance Bank Guarantee

(Rs. 99 crore) to SPGCL and SPGCL to transfer the entire land

parcel in their possession to UPPCL. UPPCL has appealed

against the said Order in APTEL and SPGCL has also filed

counter appeal. Hearing in the case as stated in the note, has

been completed and order is reserved by APTEL. Pending these,

no provision, at this stage, has been considered necessary by

the management in the carrying value of project assets (under

non- current assets) for impairment. This indicates the existence

of a material uncertainty that cast significant doubt on the

SPGCL ability to continue as Going concern and accordingly

we are unable to comment on the consequential impact, if any,

on the carrying value of such project assets and its impact on

the consolidated financial results.

Above qualification is appearing since the year ended 31st

March 2017.

Sangam Power Generation Company Limited (SPGCL,

a Subsidiary Company) was acquired by JPVL (the

Company) from Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd

(UPPCL) in earlier years for implementation of 1320 MW

Power Project (Karchana STPP) at Tahsil Karchana,

Distt. Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh. The Company has

made investment of Rs.55,207 lakhs (5,520 lakhs

equity shares of Rs. 10/- each fully paid). The Net

Worth of SPGCL have been eroded significantly as on

31st March 2021. In view of abnormal delay in handing

over the physical possession of land by UPPCL,

SPGCL has written to UPPCL and all procurers that

the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is rendered

void and cannot be enforced. As advised, draft of

Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) was sent to UPPCL

/ UPRVUNL for their approval but there was abnormal

delay in resolving the matter by UPPCL, therefore

SPGCL has withdrawn all its undertakings given to

UPPCL and filed a petition before Hon’ble UPERC for

release of performance bank guarantee and also for

payment amount against claim lodged of Rs 1,15,722

lakh. UPERC vide its Order dated 28.06.2019 has

allowed claim (of SPGCL) for Rs.25,137 Lakhs along

with interest @ 9% p.a. on Rs.14,925 Lakhs for the

period from 11.04.2014 to 31.03.2019 and also

directed UPPCL to immediately release Performance

Bank Guarantee (Rs. 99 crore) to SPGCL and SPGCL

to transfer the entire land parcel to UPPCL. UPPCL

has appealed against the said order in APTEL and

SPGCL has also filed counter appeal. Hearing in the

case is completed and Order is reserved by APTEL.

Pending these, no provision has been considered

necessary by the management at this stage.:

Managing Director &

CEO and Whole-time Director &Senior Executives of the

Company have decided to take a few steps to conserve the

financial resources of the Company.

In this context for the period 1st April, 2020 to 31st March

2021, the following gesture of contribution had been

for bringing uninterrupted supply of quality power

to each household, industry, commercial business,

small & medium enterprises, etc. In this respect,

the Govt of India has launched a scheme named

km. This would be a key supply driver of coal in the next

decade.

DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), Integrated Power

Development Scheme (IPDS) and Deendayal Upadhyaya

Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) have been implemented

by the Government. The target is to reduce AT&C losses

to about 13% by the year 2021–22 on an all-India basis,

in coal policy, FSAs were entered for the quantity of coal to the extent

required for generation of power for supplying to DISCOMs under long

TPP and Nigrie STPP for the part of sale of power without any payments

because of force majeure events i.e cancelation of coal mines and change

in coal policy. PGCIL has sent intimation for dues of Rs 10,112 lakhs

Lakhs till March 2021 including recovery for carrying cost of Rs 8,193 lakhs as

(UPERC) against UPPCL for the aforesaid recovery. UPERC vide its order dated 12th

June,2020 has disallowed the claims of the Company and upheld the recovery/

proposed recovery of excess payment made. To avoid negative impact on cash

2020 Order of UPERC, the Company has requested UPPCL that no recovery towards

the principal amount to be made in FY 2020-21, however carrying cost for FY 2020-

21 can be recovered from monthly invoices for which UPPCL had agreed. Further,

UPPCL and Company have also agreed that recovery of amount paid in excess

@SBI MCLR plus 350 basis points from financial year 2021-22 to financial year

2027-28 (amount unascertainable). In view of the above and considering prudence,

been accounted for net of the component of income tax and excess secondary

energy charges. The Company has also filed an Appeal with Appellate Tribunal

The principal amount of loan outstanding as on 31st March, 2021 was Rs.

70,333 Lakhs (Previous year Rs.70,333 Lakhs). The Company has initiated

process for the release of the guarantee provided to SBI. Fair valuation in

respect of said guarantees as at 31st March,2021, as per applicable Ind-AS

113 has not been done. However, in the opinion of the Management there

will be no material impact on the fair valuation of the above mentioned

guarantees on the financial statements/ statement of affairs.

(i)

In earlier year, the Company had given Corporate Guarantee of Rs.50,000

Lakhs in favour of State Bank of India, for Optionally Convertible Sub Debt

underwritten/ granted by them to Prayagraj Power Generation Company

Limited (PPGCL) (erstwhile subsidiary of the Company). Company has

approached the bank to release of the stated bank guarantee due to change

in the management of PPGCL. Subsequent to the 31st March 2021, the

company has received the NOC from lender and security trustee for

discharge of said corporate guarantee.

(j)

"JPVL had executed Bulk Power Transmission Agreement for long term

open access (LTOA) with Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (PGCIL)

for transmission of power from Nigrie STPP and Bina TPP. Due to

cancelation of coal mines & after re bidding of coal mines which allowed

usage of 85% of coal for Long term PPAs only in respect of JNSTPP. As

per change in coal policy, FSAs were entered for the quantity of coal to

the extent required for generation of power for supplying to DISCOMs

under long term PPA in respect of Bina TPP. There was no assured

supply of coal for the capacities of Plants and these events have resulted

in material change in sale of power of the Nigrie STPP and Bina TPP.
