Managing Director, Key Managerial Personnel and other employees:

The Remuneration Policy of the Company recognizes and is based on position and performance. It is aimed at attracting

and retaining high-caliber talent. The quantum of an employee’s remuneration and its components varies across grades

and is determined by industry practices and comparisons, qualifications, experience, responsibilities and performance.

Most employees are covered by an incentive plan which is linked to the performance of the Department/Function/

Business/Company against annual objectives. The remuneration system maintains a balance between fixed and variable

pay reflecting short and long term performance objectives appropriate to the working of the Company and its goals.

Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and contribute to sustainability throughout their life cycle

Most of GNO’s businesses and products are part of the High Performance Solutions (“HPS”) division of Saint-Gobain. These

businesses provide solutions with high-technology content for a wide range of leading-edge applications for the building,

transportation, industrial, healthcare and other diverse markets. These businesses offer a portfolio of complementary products to

usage/application and contribute to sustainability throughout their life cycle. For example, many of the products offered by these

businesses help to reduce energy consumption, provide protection, improve comfort and sustain the environment.

GNO is committed to responsible purchasing. This purchasing approach is based on the Suppliers’ Charter which sets out the

Company’s expectations and requirement from its suppliers, among other things, on protection of the environment, on health and

Managing Director, assesses the financial performance and position of the Group and makes

strategic decisions.

q. Government grants

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be

received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Government grants relating to purchase of property, plant and equipment are included in non-current liabilities as deferred

income and are credited to profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets and

presented within other income.

R. leases

As a lessee

The Group mainly has lease arrangements for land and building (office premises and warehouses).

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. This assessment involves the

exercise of judgement about whether there is an identified asset, whether the Group has the right to direct the use of the

asset and whether the Group obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement date. The

lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement

date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses

an incremental borrowing rate specific to the Country, term and currency of the contract. Generally, the Group uses its

incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for

any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of

costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset on the site on which it is located,

less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method

from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease

term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and

equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain

re-measurements of the lease liability.:

Managing Director assesses the financial performance and position of the Company and makes strategic

decisions.
