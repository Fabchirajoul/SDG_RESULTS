To,

The Members

LA-GAJJAR MACHINERIS PRIVATE LIMITED

Ahmedabad

My secretarial audit report for Financial Year 2020-21 of even date is to be read along with this annexure:

1.

Maintenance of record is the responsibility of the management of the Company. My responsibility is to

express my opinion on these records based on my audit.

2.

The compliance of the provisions of Corporate and other applicable laws, Rules, Regulations, standards

is the responsibility of the management. My examination was limited to the verification of procedures on

test basis.

3.

I have followed the audit practices and process as were appropriate to obtain reasonable assurance

about the correctness of the contents of the records. The verification was done on test basis/check lists

basis to ensure that correct facts are reflected in records. I believe that the processes and practices, I

followed provide a reasonable basis for my opinion.

4.

I have not verified the correctness and appropriateness of financial records, Books of Accounts and

other statutory records of the Company. Under the Covid – 19 impacted situation, I adopted modified

system & have totally relied on the electronic records submitted to me for verification. In view of above,

there could be some discrepancy which might arise in future as far as actual records are concerned.:

Managing Director leads, that closely monitors the evolving

situation, develops and implements precautionary measures to help limit the impact of COVID-19 at our

workplace and on our communities and ensures business continuity. KOEL is actively monitoring the

potential impact on our key priorities and assessing the situation on an ongoing basis to evaluate the

impact and challenges posed by the COVID-19 situation and manage them accordingly.

The Company has analysed the impact that COVID-19 had on our financial reporting. The Company’s

operations and financial performance remains satisfactory despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and

identified no significant impact on the financial reporting in Financial Year 2020-21. Further KOEL has

not received any specific governmental financial support in relation to COVID-19.

A steep increase in virtual collaboration during COVID-19 has fast-tracked the need for digitalization

both at our customers and at KOEL. Looking ahead, your Company will continue to make investments

in digitalization and technology, which will also be crucial in a post-COVID-19 environment, in order to

keep ensuring the well-being of our employees and to better serve our customers.:

Letter of

Appointment is also issued to them.

The Company’s management makes business presentations periodically at the Board meetings

to familiarise Independent Directors with the strategy, operations and functioning of the Company.

These interactions provide them with a holistic perspective of the Company’s business and

regulatory framework.

The details of familiarization programme imparted to the Independent Directors are available

on the website of the Company. (Web-link. http://koel.kirloskar.com/sites/koel.kirloskar.com/

letter of credit, bank guarantee, business deposits and such other forms of credit

assurance schemes.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major

clients. In addition, a large number of minor receivables are combined into homogenous

category and assessed for impairment collectively. The calculation is based on actual

incurred historical data. The Company does not hold collateral as security. The Company

evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers

are spread over vast spectrum.

Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company’s

treasury department in accordance with the Company’s policy. Investments of surplus funds

are made as per the approved investment policy. Investment limits are set to minimise the

concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss if any.

c.

Liquidity risk

The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a liquidity planning tool.

The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and

flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans. The Company has access to a

sufficient variety of sources of funding and debt maturing within 12 months can be rolled

over with existing lenders.:
