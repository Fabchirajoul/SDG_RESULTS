Chairman's Statement: CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

Dear Shareholders,

To say that the year gone by has been a challenging one would be an

understatement. Ironically, it is also the year when your company has

reported its highest standalone net profit, since FY 2008-09, of ` 1030 cr.

Last year, the human tragedy that swept the world took centre stage.

Country after country struggled to cope with and provide the much

required help to its people. Many lives were lost, some simply too

early. Amidst these very difficult personal challenges for many, we as a

company continued to march along as best we could. We faced hurdles

in many areas, whether in providing timely crew relief to our seafarers,

ensuring our shipboard staff were kept safe, undertaking statutory dry

dockings under remote supervision, or continuing to work from home

for over 12 months. Our people responded admirably to successfully

meet these challenges. They are our heroes and for me beyond the

reported profit numbers, it is to them that I dedicate the year gone by.

A special mention for our seafarers. They have made, possibly, the

biggest sacrifice, as we were often unable to provide them timely relief

because of the various travel restrictions in place across the world.

More sadly, we were not always able to reunite them with their families

even when most needed. I just wish to assure them and their families

that we always attempted everything in our power to help them.

The second wave of this pandemic has hit our country hard.

Consequently, it has also impacted our business in multiple ways. More and more countries are imposing various restrictions on Indian flag ships

as well as on Indian seafarers. This has led to us being forced to at times undertake sub optimal voyages and also to undertake crew relief at

significant costs. It has also constrained us in both buying and selling ships, an important activity in our industry. The financial costs of the above

will be felt in the ongoing year.

One of the big lessons we have learnt from the year gone by is that it is impossible to predict black swan events that potentially can disrupt the

business. The best that can be done is to build a resilient organization comprising of hard working and talented employees who have the ability to

navigate through multiple uncertainties. This will be one of our core focus areas.

There remain many challenges that lie ahead of us but I am confident that with the grit and determination of all our people, we will successfully

overcome those challenges and build a stronger organization that will serve its shareholders well. Let us collectively look forward to a bright future.

With warm regards,

6VARIABLE PAY

It provides a variable level of remuneration dependent on short-term performance of the individual as well as the Company vis a vis industry

performance globally. The test of performance by the Company is whether it is able to increase its profits when the industry environment is

favourable and whether it is able to minimise its losses when the environment is harsh. The Company believes that performance of each and every

employee of the Company contributes to its overall performance and hence should be rewarded suitably. Hence, the Company follows the policy of

making payment of variable pay to its executive directors annually.

Variable pay is decided based on performance of executive directors as well as the Company. Where possible, the Company uses quantifiable, hard

targets that can be factually measured and objectively assessed. The Company also reviews the underlying performance of the group in light of the

annual plan, competitors results, etc.

Variable pay may vary from time to time but shall be maximum four times of the Consolidated Salary. Executive directors with bigger operating

responsibilities may be entitled to more variable pay as compared to others.

PENSION

Pension recognises and appreciates the experience, expertise, advice, efforts and contribution provided and made by executive directors to the

Company during their long years of service with the Company and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries, whether in their capacity as executive directors

or otherwise.

The Company may provide pension (which includes providing perquisites) to its eligible executive directors upon their ceasing to hold office in the

Company in recognition of their past services in accordance with a scheme formulated by the Board of Directors.

REVIEW

Salary reviews consider both external competitiveness and internal consistency when determining if any increases should be applied. Salary

increases will be generally in line with all employee increases within the Company and other companies based in India and abroad.

Salaries are compared against other shipping and offshore majors, but the Company also monitors market practice among companies of a similar

size, geographic spread and business dynamic to the Company.

Salary increases are not directly linked to performance. However a base-line level of personal contribution is needed in order to be considered for a

salary increase and exceptional sustained contribution may be grounds for accelerated salary increases.

Specific measures and targets may be determined each year by the Committee. The principal measures of increments / bonus will be based on

value creation and may include financial measures such as operational efficiency, operating cash flow, operating profit, cost management, project

delivery, etc.
