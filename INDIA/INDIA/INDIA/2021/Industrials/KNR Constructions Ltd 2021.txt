Dear ShareholDerS,

As I present this year’s report before you, the year 2020-21

witnessed the most tumultuous time the world has ever seen over

a century due to the devastating impact of the novel Covid-19

pandemic. The health emergency has pushed the conditions of

survival of businesses to the limit, having a significant impact

on a large part of the national economy and causing great social

hardship. The operational challenges mounted due to restricted

movement of men materials leading to disruption of supply lines

during the first few months of the pandemic. The prolonged

lockdown in the financial year further forced the country to

face contraction in economic output which necessitated

intervention from both the Government and the Reserve

Bank of India by slew of measures to uplift the economy

progressively.

Such situations demand companies to act quickly,

to rethink not only products and services, but

also the business models themselves, capable

of connecting people, technology, organisation

and all other forms of capital within a flexible and

interactive system with equal attention to health

and safety. Companies that place sustainability at

the heart of their strategies will be able to emerge

better and faster from the Covid-19 crisis.

This is particularly true for KNRCL. Our relentless

commitment and dedication allowed us to overcome

several challenges in the pandemic year. Our Company

has adopted a holistic approach to wellness of the

workers, safety norms, social distancing and necessary

precautions at all the project sites. We also conducted mass

vaccination camp for most of our staff and their families.

Performance SnaPShot

Your Company ended the year with a robust set of numbers. We

achieved a turnover of ` 27,026.29 Million, growing by 20.43%

and Profit After Tax of ` 2,441.8 Million, growing by 8.42%.

Your Company with due approval from Board of Directors

and shareholders, issued 1:1 bonus shares to all the eligible

shareholders. We laid out strong execution plan and prudent

Dear ShareholDerS,

The last financial year has seen the COVID-19 crisis impacting

the world in ways that few could have imagined. It has forever

altered the way we look at the society and business. As our nation

continues to navigate the uncertainty created by the second wave

of the pandemic, the aggressive vaccination drive across the

country creates a strong hope of normalising the unsettled world.

While we thank and appreciate frontline workers for their service,

our heartfelt sympathies to those who have been affected by

this pandemic.

our reSPonSe to uncertainty

I am delighted to write to you that during the financial

year ended March 31, 2021, KNRCL successfully

executed projects and achieved the targeted

turnover of ` 2,7026.29 Million despite adversities.

We continued to align ourselves to the nation’s

infrastructure agenda by remaining resilient,

reinforced by our high quality and diverse projects

portfolio and an equal support from our experienced

Board and management team. Our response to the

pandemic was also prompt and decisive. Utmost

care is taken on staff health and wellness by strictly

implementing social distancing, sanitisation, mask

wearing and quarantine facilities at all the projects

sites. Further mass vaccination camp was also organised

for the staff and their family members. During the lockdown

period, mobile technology was used extensively for real-time

data collection and transmission between the jobsite and project

managers in the back office as well with investors and bankers and

other agencies. During the second wave, greater emphasis was

laid on reducing assembling of work force, work schedules have

been redrawn. This has resulted in scaling down the production

levels at different project sites. Our people responded in a positive

and energetic manner and as a result of their efforts our business

has shown resilience.
