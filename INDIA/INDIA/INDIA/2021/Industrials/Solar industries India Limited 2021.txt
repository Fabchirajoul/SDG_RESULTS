Managing Director’s

Message

I am happy

to quote that

in 25 years

of existence,

your company

has grown

manifold!

Starting

as a small

manufacturer

based out

of Nagpur

to one of

the leading

Global

Explosive

Manufacturer.

D E A R

R E A D E R S ,

It’s my pleasure to review the Company’s performance

for FY 20-21. During the year we faced multiple

challenges but I am proud to say that we have many

positive take aways.

Business performance

A year that was unprecedented, our response to Covid-19

can be described in one word as resilient. Our operating

and financial performances were a result of agility and

dedication that was demonstrated by our team. We

restructured our strategic goals, focusing on key areas

that needed attention, keeping the momentum going

on all fronts.

During the fiscal 2020-21, the company posted net sales

of H 2515.63 crore, achieving a growth rate of 12.44%

compared to H 2237.30 crore during FY2019-20. The

global price rise across commodities was driven by

rebound of economies across the world, resulting in price

inflation. Despite the cost headwinds, the company

registered a 12.76% growth in EBITDA which stood

at H 536.02 crore during the period under review, from

H 475.37 crore in the previous fiscal. The EBITDA margins

continue to remain healthy at 21.31% levels, driven by

strong operational performances.

The resilience in our business model is reflected in our

robust financial performance. Our long-term approach

towards risk mitigation and strong internal controls

remained pivotal in enabling us to emerge out stronger

from the impending difficulties.

On the operational front, we yet again stood tall

exhibiting our core capabilities. In the past one decade

of foraying into a capital intensive and critical approval-

based defence sector, your company has expanded

its offerings, now visible with a strong order book of

H 680 Crore. Your company has been successful in

opening new frontiers of growth with beginning of

exports in ammunition sector.

We ensured meeting our customer expectations by

increasing our production capacity and maintaining

adequate inventory levels.

This exemplary performance across mining, defence and

space applications is a result of our investments made

in building state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. We

possess one of the world’s most integrated defence

manufacturing facility and modern packaged explosives

and detonators facilities across strategic locations. All

our manufacturing facilities are process-oriented with

modern technologies and benchmarked with global

standards and environment management systems.

Over the years we have leveraged our R&D capabilities

across our operations to develop the ‘future’ solutions

within our industry landscape. Our focus on strengthening

our in-house technology has helped us broaden our

product portfolio and introduce new solutions to offer

our clients.

Our multi-geographic manufacturing presence in

strategic countries has allowed us to penetrate markets

with higher economies of scale and sustain our market

leadership.

Business Outlook

I am happy to quote that in 25 years of existence,

your company has grown manifold! Starting as a small

manufacturer based out of Nagpur to one of the leading

Global Explosive Manufacturer. Moving forward, we

foresee the accelerated momentum for Solar, with

healthy order books and high growth potential across

the products we offer. The company continues to scale

new heights and expand its market share across its

diverse product portfolio. Currently having operations in

Notes :

1. Liabilities are very sensitive to discount rate, salary inflation and withdrawal rate.

2. Liabilities are very less sensitive due to change in mortality assumptions. Hence, sensitivities due to change in mortality are ignored.

3. The base liability is calculated at discount rate of 6.25% per annum and salary inflation rate of 5.00% per annum for all future years.

Note 28. Commitments and contingencies

Capital Commitments

Contingent liabilities

Note a.

The Company is contesting the demands and the management, including its tax/legal advisors, believe that its position will likely be upheld in

the appellate process. No tax expense has been accrued in the financial statements for the tax demand raised. Cash outflows for the above are

determinable only on receipt of judgements pending at various forums/authorities.

Note b.

The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-employment benefits received Presidential

assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. However, the date on which the Code will come into effect has

not been notified and the final rules/interpretation have not yet been issued. The Company will assess the impact of the Code when it comes into

effect and will record any related impact in the period the Code becomes effective.

Note 32. Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Company’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, and

financial guarantee contracts. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations and to provide

guarantees to support its operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include loans, trade and other receivables, and cash and cash

equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Company also holds FVTPL investments and enters into derivative transactions.

It has an integrated financial risk management system which proactively identifies monitors and takes precautionary and mitigation measures in

respect of various identified risks.

The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s senior management oversees the management of these risks,

which evaluates and exercises independent control over the entire process of financial risks. All derivative activities for risk management purposes

are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is the Company’s policy that no trading in

derivatives for speculative purposes may be undertaken. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which

are summarised below.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk

comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market

risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, FVTPL investments and derivative financial instruments.

Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments. The finance department undertakes management of cash resources,

hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing mechanism and ensuring compliance with market risk limits.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The

Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.

The Company manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. The Company borrows
