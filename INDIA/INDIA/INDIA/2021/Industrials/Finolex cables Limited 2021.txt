Dear Shareholders,

Trust that you all are safe and in good health. The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the foundations

of world economy and is forcing an unprecedented social, economic, and business response. It has

fundamentally changed the way we live, work, and has made work from home, social distancing, and

increased digitization and technology adoption as the new normal.

‘‘At Finolex Cables, we have stayed

focused and demonstrated agility

and resilience through these

uncertain times by enhancing our

focus on cost, process efficiency,

and new product development.’’

- D.K. Chhabria

The Indian economy has been severely

impacted on account of the pandemic

and contraction of economic activity

following the nationwide lockdown. As

per the Central Statistics Office (CSO),

the economy contracted by 7.3% in

FY 2020-21, as compared to 4%

economic growth recorded in the

previous fiscal. Recent economic

indications and data suggest that the

economy is headed for a gradual revival

with 1.6% growth recorded in Q4 of

the fiscal year.

Favourable government reforms,

strong thrust on infrastructure

development, recovery in consumer

sentiments following successful

vaccination drives contributed to

the buoyancy in economic activity.

However, uncertainty about the

resurgence of coronavirus

infections and subsequent

restrictions may threaten the

economic recovery.

At Finolex Cables, we have stayed

focused and demonstrated agility and

resilience through these uncertain

times by enhancing our focus on cost,

process efficiency, and new product

development. We have taken judicious

actions to help ensure our continued

competitiveness, financial resilience,

and business continuity in the new

normal. We are adopting increased

digitization and automation across our

operations to enhance operational:
