NH-19 from Palsit to Dankuni (up to NH-6 Connector)

from km. 588.870 to km. 652.700 (total design length

63.830 km) in the State of West Bengal and HAM

to Mo from kms 11.000 to kms 42.000 (Design Length

28.700 kms) of NH-20 (New NH-154) of Pathankot-Mandi

Section (Package - IA)

The Company’s BOT (toll) projects, Yedeshi Aurangabad

and Agra Ethawah, have been issued CODs by NHAI in

Sept, 2020 and Nov, 2020 respectively. Consequently,

toll rates for the SPV increased and the SPVs started

collection of toll at revised toll rates. Further, other

projects under implementation are progressing largely

as per schedule except COVID-19 lockdown related

delays and are expected to be completed within their

stipulated timelines.

2.2.2 Toll O&M

IRB has 19# projects under O&M. With its in-house

expertise in handling BOT O&M on-road projects, the

Company routinely carries out maintenance of toll roads.

# Inclusive of seven BOT projects transferred to IRB InvIT

Fund in FY 18 and nine BOT projects transferred to IRB

Infrastructure Trust in FY 20. The Company is the project

manager for both these entities.

2.2.3 Sponsor of IRB InvIT Fund

IRB launched the first public InvIT of the country, IRB InvIT

Fund, in May 2017 and continues to act as the sponsor

and the project manager.

It transferred six assets at the time of IPO in May 2017

and seventh asset in September 2017. IRB owned ~16%

stake in the Trust, as on March 31, 2021. During the

fiscal, the Company received total distribution of ` 723

million, of which ` 538 million were received as interest

and ` 185 million as return on capital.

2.2.4 Sponsor of IRB Infrastructure Trust

IRB has incorporated a private InvIT viz. IRB Infrastructure

Fund in August 2019 and continues to act as the sponsor

and the project manager.

IRB has transferred nine of its BOT assets into the Private

InvIT in which IRB continues to hold stake of 51%.

The portfolio spans across ~5,900 lane kms in Haryana,

Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Karnataka.

All nine assets in the portfolio are revenue-generating

assets. As a part of the transaction, GIC affiliates has

acquired 49% of the Trust. The investment proceeds has

been used for deleveraging the portfolio and for equity

funding for the under-construction projects.

Financial Analysis

3.1 BOT Assets

As is the norm for financing highway BOT projects,

debt funds from project lenders are the major source of

funding. The project lenders have reposed trust in the

Company’s financial strength, demonstrated by healthy

growth in internal accruals and net worth. Besides, they

have also shown faith in the Company’s project execution

capabilities. This trust of the project lenders has played

a primary role in helping IRB achieve the required

financial closure.

IRB invested in projects that were under construction and

are now in operation. With this, it has augmented capacity

to invest in new projects that may be secured on a

diligent evaluation of their risks and commercial viability.

Internal accruals were robust even after providing for

debt repayments post impact of COVID-19.

The total consolidated income for FY 21 stood at

` 54,875 million as against ` 70,472 million in FY 20

registering a decline of 22%. The consolidated toll

revenues for FY 21 has decreased to `15,594 million

from ` 17,232 million FY 20 registering a decline of 10%.

The consolidated construction revenues for FY 21 has

decreased to ` 37,392 million as against ` 51,290 million

in FY 20 registering a decline of 27%.

EBITDA for FY 21 decreased to ` 27,016 million from

` 31,664 million in FY 20 registering a decline of 15%.

Interest costs has increased to ` 16,924 million in FY 21

from ` 15,644 million in FY 20 increased by 8%.

Depreciation has increase to ` 5,817 million in FY 21 as

against ` 4,683 million in FY 20 increased by 24%.

PBT excluding extraordinary income has decreased to

` 4,274 million in FY 21 from ` 11,337 million in FY 20,

registering a decline by 62%.

PAT after share of loss from JV has decreased to

` 1,171 million in FY 21 from ` 7,209 million in FY 20,

declined by 84%.:
