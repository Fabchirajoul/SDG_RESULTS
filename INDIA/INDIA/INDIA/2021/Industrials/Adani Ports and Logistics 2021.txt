letter, AVCTPL contested

the said consultation notice on the grounds

that the consultation notice is not valid since

notified force majeure event due to COVID-19

pandemic was still under continuances. Also

since the force majeure event has exceeded

120 days, AVCTPL has initiated termination

on mutual consent as per right under the

concession agreement. VPT has also issued

the counter termination and the matter is

under arbitration.

(b) During the previous year, Adani Murmugao

Port Terminal Private Limited (“AMPTPL”) had

provided H58.63 crore as provision for revenue

share on deemed storage income based on

our best estimates, pending conclusion of

AMPTPL’s arbitration with Murmugao Port

Trust (”MPT”) for recovery of revenue share on

deemed storage income. The same is shown

under exceptional item in the previous year

ended March 31, 2020.

43 The management has carried out detailed cash

flow projections over the period of the concession

agreement

in

determining

the

recoverable

value of the Property, Plant and Equipment

and Intangible Assets comprising of service

concession rights in accordance with Ind AS 36,

Impairment of Assets in case of Adani Kandla Bulk

Terminal Private Limited (“AKBTPL”) amounting to

H737.02 crore and Adani Murmugao Port Terminal

Private Limited (“AMPTPL”) amounting to H305.60

crore. AKBTPL has received relaxation in the form

of rationalisation on revenue share on storage

income from the authorities in accordance with

guidelines from Ministry of Shipping (“MoS”).

AMPTPL has received relief in terms of rationalised

tariff on storage charges from authorities for

financial year 2019-20. In developing cash flow

projections, the management has considered

the benefit arising from the relaxation received

/ expected to be received from the authorities

in form of rationalisation of revenue share from

storage income in accordance with guidelines

issued by Ministry Of Shipping in Financial

Year 2019-20. The Management has made

various estimates relating to cargo traffic, port

tariffs, inflation, discount rates, revenue share,

COVID-19 impact on income etc. which are

reasonable over the entire concession period.

On a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors,

the Management of the Company has concluded

that the recoverable amount of Property, Plant

and Equipment and Intangible Assets is higher

than their carrying amounts as at March 31, 2021.

Hence, no provision for impairment is considered

necessary at this stage. The eventual outcome

of the impact of the global health pandemic as

well as the actual cargo traffic and port tariffs,

considering the long period, may be different

from those estimated as on the date of approval

of these financial statements.

44 During the previous year, on fulfilment of condition

precedent of the agreement dated April 29, 2019

between Total Holdings SAS and the Group; the

Group has recorded fair value gain of H434.30

crore, arising from infrastructure development

of Port and LNG infrastructure at Dhamra, from

erstwhile subsidiary Dhamra LNG Terminal Private

Limited.
