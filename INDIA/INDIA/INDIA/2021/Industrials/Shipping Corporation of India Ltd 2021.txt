Dear Shareholders, Ladies and Gentlemen,

On behalf of the Board of Directors of The Shipping Corporation of India Ltd., I am pleased to place before you, our esteemed shareholders,

the 71st Annual Report of your Company for the financial year 2020-2021. The report enumerates in detail your Company’s performance for

the financial year ended 31st March 2021. I would however take you over some salient features of your Company’s achievements during the

last financial year.

The bamboo that bends is stronger than the oak that resists; the venerable timeworn Japanese proverb could not have held more truth

today in depiction of the agility which organizations embraced to withstand the instability caused by the pandemic and its resurgence. Your

organization continued to adapt and change in tune with the variable circumstances and pandemic vicissitudes. The Business Continuity and

Shipboard Outbreak Plans instituted and implemented last year to assuage adverse impact on operations continued to mature and yielded

disruption-free performance. Operations and functions were executed seamlessly and yet again it is a matter of pride for me to convey

that your Company ensured transportation of essential supplies and uninterrupted trade flow requirements notwithstanding the upheaving

outbreaks time and again impacting the economy. I am therefore extremely happy to declare that your Company not only sustained but

performed exceedingly well, bearing testimony to its domain proficiency, resilience and dexterity. The Business Continuity and Shipboard

Outbreak Plans were reviewed extensively this year to realign and evolve to meet the desired standards of deliverables and efficacy and we

are well assured of being able to address any contingency.

Impact of the Pandemic

Despite the challenges wrought by the pandemic, commercial ship operations, ports, and other maritime transport sectors maintained their

operations to ensure movement of goods regardless of low cargo volumes. The maritime sector adjusted their operations, finances, sanitary

and safety protocols as well as working practices and procedures to cope with pandemic-related disruptions. The catastrophic rise of Covid:

letter and spirit.

Diamond Jubilee Celebrations

Your Company is on the threshold of completion of a glorious and an enthralling sixty years of rendering valuable service to the nation. To

commemorate this landmark stage, the Diamond Jubilee inaugural function was held phy-gitally on SCI’s Foundation Day on 2nd October

2020, inaugurated by Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, Hon’ble Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Ports, Shipping and Waterways. A series

of events have been organized throughout the year to celebrate the proud milestone and the joyous spirit has not been dampened by the

adverse circumstances of the pandemic. Among the many events which took place during the year, the notable ones include celebrating new

year with Seafarers and Fleet Excellence Awards 2019, Flag Off Ceremony of MT Swarna Krishna - all women officers sailing, Padma Shri

Awardee Dr. (Mrs.) Sudha Murthy’s address to the employees on the International Women’s Day on 8th March 2021 and Brahma Kumari

Sister B.K. Shivani’s talk on ‘Self-management to build inner resilience during unstable times for empowerment’ on 30th May 2021. A grand

finale to mark your Company’s ushering into the sexagenarian phase is proposed to be held in October 2021.

All Women Officers’ Sailing aboard m.t. Swarna Krishna – a watershed phenomenon

It gives me immense delight to convey that your Company created history with yet another landmark achievement, a ‘first-ever’ in the global

maritime history - an ‘All Women Officers’ Team commanded and managed by a lady Captain set sail, carrying crude oil, on tanker, m.t.

Swarna Krishna from Mumbai (JNPT) for delivery at Vadinar on 7th March 2021, on the eve of International Women’s Day. What made it an

exclusive ‘first’ was the convergence of three wonders viz. all the Merchant Navy Officers on board the vessel belonged to a single nationality

(Indian); all officers had Indian Certificate of Competency (CoC) issued by the Director General of Shipping and they sailed on Indian flagged

vessel. Hon’ble Minister of State (Independent Charge) Ports, Shipping & Waterways, Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, virtually flagged off the

vessel in a ceremony organized on 6th March 2021 and the historic event was hailed far and wide for promoting diversity and equality in the

maritime sector, presumed to be predominantly male-oriented. The ‘UN Women’ theme for IWD 2021 ‘Women in Leadership: Achieving an

equal future in a COVID-19 World’ lent the event paramount meaning and significance.

Other developments

Direct cargo ferry services between India and Maldives was commenced towards end September connecting Indian ports of Tuticorin &

Cochin with Kulhudhuffushi and Male ports in Maldives.

In another ‘first’, your Company through its wholly owned subsidiary, Inland & Coastal Shipping Ltd. (ICSL) forayed into the inland waterways

and a MOU was executed between ICSL and Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) on 22nd January 2021 for operations and management

of 3 of its cargo vessels on bareboat charter basis. The vessels would navigate the national waterways and serve the hinterlands of India.

The first two vessels were taken over by ICSL in January and February, respectively. ICSL is in the process of establishing scheduled liner

services in NW1 (Haldia/Kolkata to Varanasi) and subsequently intends to connect Inland waterways with coastal shipping.

MV Sindhu, first of the two 500 Pax and 150 MT cargo vessels under construction at Cochin Shipyard was successfully delivered to A&N

Administration and the vessel was inducted into service during June 2021. SCI, as a technical consultant, had been involved in the project

right from the inception stage and oversaw the technical specifications, construction supervision till delivery. SCI will also be managing

Operations of the vessel. This is the first passenger vessel ever built in India with electric propulsion and azimuth thrusters. SCI’s capabilities:

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

letter of appreciation for the efforts put in by the entire team of the vessel enabling continuous operations of

vessel till date without losing any downtime even during severe conditions caused by the covid-19 pandemic.

IX Overview of the industry and important changes in the industry during the last year;

The Offshore industry is primarily a support industry to the offshore oil and gas Exploration and Production (E&P) sector. Its fortunes directly

depend on that of the Oil and Gas Industry. The Indian offshore market had shown signs of gradual improvement during the last year, with

an upward trend in the charter hire rates. However, the advent of the covid-19 pandemic and the sudden drop in oil prices led to the industry

once again facing difficult times during 2020-21.

The lockdown conditions imposed due to the pandemic led to difficulties in obtaining clearances for onhiring of vessels. The industry also

witnessed contracts for offshore vessels being foreclosed due to Force Majeure conditions, while some contracts being re-negotiated. The

industry is hopeful of a better year ahead in expectation of revival of projects by the E&P operators, which had been postponed in the last year.

Further, although the country is witnessing the second wave of the pandemic, it is expected that the impact would be much less compared

to the last year considering that the vaccine is already released and all efforts are being taken by Government to administer the same to all

at the earliest.

Key initiatives with respect to Stakeholder relationship, Customer relationship, Environment, Sustainability, Health and Safety

Your company continued to interact with the vendors across the globe so as to exchange ideas for mutual growth of both SCI and Vendors.

SCI continued to register new vendors especially from MSME category so as to increase procurement from MSME vendors as mandated by

the gas is reduced to 1/600th of its original volume making it economic to

transport in specially designed

LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas)

Natural gas will liquefy at a temperature of approximately -259 F or -160

C at atmospheric pressure. One cubic foot of liquefied gas will expand to

approximately 600 cubic feet of gas at atmospheric pressure.

LNGC

(LNG Carrier) An ocean-going ship specially constructed to carry LNG in

tanks at -160 C. Current average carrying capacity of LNGs is 125,000 cubic

metres. Many LNGCs presently under construction or on order are in the

Not to be confused with LNG, LPG is often called ‘propane’ as it is made of

various mixtures of propane and other similar types of hydrocarbon gases.

These hydrocarbons are gases at rooms temperature, but turn to liquid

when they are compressed. LPG is stored in special tanks that keep it under

pressure, so it stays a liquid. While the room distribution of LNG requires

heavy infrastructure investments, LPG is more easily transported.

volume of cargo holds, D is the distance between ship’s bottom and the

uppermost deck, d is the draught) “Ton” is figured as a 100 cubic foot ton.

An approximate conversion ratio is 1NT = 1.7GT and 1GT = 1.5DWT.
