In order to get the major bus shutdowns, the Services team

identified critical priority bays in discussion with Karnataka

Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) for the

220 kV Hoody substation and executed and completed the

bays on time. This bay majorly feeds IT companies and the

Bangalore International Airport.

Despite the nationwide lockdown, services at LTMC sites were

operational and provided more than 99.5% power availability

to customers. The LTMC contract of Chennai International

Airport has also been renewed for subsequent two years due

to the outstanding performance delivered by the Services

team since the past seven years.

The Services business, with the presence of Asset Performance

Management (APM) experts in the region and support from

GE’s global service Center of Excellence (CoE), is at the

forefront of services being offered by GE APM. Satisfied by

the benefits received by implementing the Company’s APM

solution in 2017, Haldia Energy Limited awarded the repeat

APM order to your Company in 2019 and 2020.

The Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) Field Services teams

worked relentlessly during the pandemic for the repair and

maintenance work on various GIS sites, thereby ensuring

uninterrupted power transmission from major hydro power

plants in Sikkim and J&K. This activity was very important

for your Company’s hydro power generation customers to

ensure uninterrupted power transmission during the peak

generation season starting from April 2020. The hard work

and determination of your Company’s field experts exceeded

the customer expectations.

Your Company’s Air Insulated Substation (AIS) services

business successfully completed the major overhauling

at M/s Hyosung site a/c PowerGrid Dhaka, Bangladesh,

as well as thirty 420 kV disconnectors, ten 245 kV and one

36 kV disconnector). This increased the Services team‘s

footprint in Bangladesh. The Services team in India attended

the emergency breakdown of 66 kV CB at the Hydel power

generation substation of Haryana Power Generation

Corporation Limit in Yamunanagar, using the Smart Helmet.

HPGCL appreciated this new innovative approach of GE

and this helped us to leverage your Company’s strength in

innovation for creating new service business opportunities.

Despite COVID-19, the Power Transformer Services team

had been working to meet customer requirements and

emergencies with full dedication and commitment, and

completed major dismantling of old transformers, installation

of new transformers restoring the generation for NHPC, the

Bairasiul Hydro Power Project along with other critical repairs

and site maintenance such as 100 MVA, furnace transformer

and other power transformers. The work done by the Power

Transformer Services team in 2019-20 at HVDC converter

transformers paid off well in 2020-2021. The Transformer

services team made history once more by completing major

overhauling of a set of HVDC converter transformers at PGCIL,

Bhadrawati, well within the defined shutdown time. The team

broke previous record while maintaining compliance to the

set safety norms.

Network Consultancy Services successfully conducted

multiple studies for dynamic modelling of solar and wind

plants in PSS/e-software and dynamic studies for validation of

the model as per CEA 2019 guidelines for various developers

and successfully conceptualized innovative Kaizens. A

few of them are – layout modification without impacting

between operators, leveraging remote test facility,

online portal for supplier test reports, hands-free door

units. Employee engagement programs to promote

awareness and commitment to Quality were organized

with active participation from employees.

efficiency weekly checks, online air quality improvement

and implementation of dust ingress prevention systems.
