Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments

A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) profit or loss

by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant.

Financial instruments – Hedge accounting

The objective of hedge accounting is to represent, in the Company’s financial statements, the effect of the Company’s use of financial

instruments to manage exposures arising from particular risks that could affect profit or loss.

Currency risk-

The Company’s risk management policy is to hedge its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of highly forecasted sales. The

Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk. Such contracts are generally designated as cash flow hedges.

Company’s policy is to match the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts with that of the hedged item.

Commodity risk

transactions. The Company uses futures contract to hedge its commodity risk. Such contracts are generally designated as fair value hedges.

Interest rate

The Company’s risk management policy is to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure on floating rate borrowings by entering into fixed-rate

instruments like interest rate swaps to eliminate the variability of cash flows attributable to movements in interest rates. Such hedges are

designated as cash flow hedges.
