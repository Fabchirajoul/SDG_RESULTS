Managing Director

Manish Bhatnagar: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

As we all know, 2020 has been a uniquely challenging year

and we have all been impacted by COVID-19, both in our

professional and personal lives. Amidst a very challenging

business landscape, your Company remained steadfast in

executing its strategies, sustaining operational efficiencies,

maintaining customer centricity, and ensuring cost discipline

leading to a strong financial performance and increased

shareholder value — which you will see in this report.

Our business was impacted in March 2020 as COVID-19

spread nationwide which led to a complete lockdown of the

country for over six weeks. There were signs of gradual

recovery towards the end of first quarter, partly led by

automotive segment followed by an uptick in demand from the

industrial segment, and the economic environment steadily

improved by the end of the fiscal year.

Financial performance and strategic progress

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented

health crisis in our lives. And we have witnessed the most

unpredictable times for businesses around the world. This

posed significant headwinds, including lockdowns, travel

restrictions, supply chain disruptions.

Your Company clocked Net Profits of INR 297.73 crore, up

from INR 288.99 crore in FY20. Revenue stood at INR 2670.73

crore as compared to INR 2841.58 crore a year ago. We

maintained a strong liquidity position and robust cash flow. We

continued to drive execution on our strategic priorities, with a

disciplined cost and investment approach. With a long-term

vision in mind, we are transforming our ways of working with

digitalization across the full value chain.

Reflecting on this performance in the backdrop of an extraordinary

crisis makes it even more commendable, demonstrating the

resilience and the spirit of winning of our people.

Ensuring health and safety of our employees

Underlying our exceptional performance is the efforts of our

people, who showed tremendous resilience, responsibility and

resolve to support one another, our customers, our communities,

and our suppliers. We are incredibly proud of them and their

family members who stood by us during these times.

From the very beginning of the pandemic, your Company

prioritised the well-being, health, and safety of our

own employees, and of our suppliers. We implemented

comprehensive hygiene standards across all our locations

and provided our employees with clear guidance – including

introducing a structured program on safety behaviour for line

managers and blue-collar employees, for encouraging and

implementing mandatory safety protocols organisation-wide.

Your Company formed a special task force to monitor the

situation on the ground and take necessary measures to

support the employees in their time of need. Additionally,

COVID Care centres were set up at multiple locations for

employees and their families. The Company also facilitated

online doctor consultations across India, organized vaccination

camps and provided vaccination cost coverage for employees

and their immediate family members.

Giving back to our communities

The events of the past year have demonstrated that societal issues

disproportionately impact the most vulnerable. We continued

deepening our relationships in the communities we serve as part

of our Community Care initiatives. With the help of our NGO

partners, we are using our resources, ingenuity, and collaborations

with local municipal corporations to support our communities

in the areas of education, skill development, employment, and

environmental sustainability. From organizing vehicle disinfection

camp at the peak of the lockdown, to providing PPE kits across

We maintained a strong liquidity

position and robust cash flow.

We continued to drive execution

on our strategic priorities, with a

disciplined cost and investment

approach.
