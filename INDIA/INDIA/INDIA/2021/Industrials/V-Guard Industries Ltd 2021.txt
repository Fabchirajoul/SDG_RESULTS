Message from the Chairman

08 Message from the: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

As I write to you during these

unprecedented trying times, my

heart goes out to all the families

who have suffered tremendous loss

due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The colossal loss of life has been

heart-wrenching and painful. These

times have also demonstrated the

tremendous and salute worthy

efforts of our frontline workers and

medical professionals. With their

unyielding commitment at the risk of

their own health and life, they have

worked selflessly to keep us safe.

The year in review

At V-Guard, the nationwide lockdown

and ensuing period of restrictions

presented us with extraordinary

challenges in the first half of the

year, including the temporary

shutdown of our manufacturing

facilities. Supply chain disruptions

added to a weak consumer demand.

It was also the first time in our

history that we had to contend with

an almost zero-revenue environment

for a considerable period. Yet, I am

pleased to share with you that our

Company has demonstrated a strong

resilience to not only overcome

these hurdles but to also register

a robust recovery as soon as the

market environment improved. Our

people have responded with great

agility and commitment to enable

the Company to emerge victorious

with strength. Our strong balance

sheet also positioned us at a

vantage point as we navigated our

way through these uncertain times.

And as expected of our Company, we

strictly adopted all the appropriate

COVID-19 safety protocols across

all our locations. We have also put

additional measures in place to

support the health and well-being

of all our people in these uncertain

times.

Our strategic priorities

During the year, despite the

unprecedented challenges caused

by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,

we stayed focussed on our strategic

DURING THE YEAR, DESPITE THE

UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES CAUSED

BY THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC,

WE STAYED FOCUSSED ON OUR STRATEGIC

INITIATIVES TO PROVIDE AN IMPETUS TO

OUR COMPETITIVENESS AND TO MAKE US A

BETTER DIGITALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE.

Corporate Overview

06 l Annual Report 2020-21: Message From The

Dear Shareholders,

At the outset, let me take this

opportunity to express my heartfelt

gratitude to our amazing family

at V-Guard for their unyielding

dedication in their efforts at keeping

the organisation rock solid during

this global crisis. For being a strong

support system not just internally

but for all our partners who have had

to go through this unprecedented

turmoil that has taken its toll across

the country. And it is this very

indefatigable spirit and resolve that

will see us come out on top as the

situation gets more normal.

This pandemic spared no one as

it unleashed the largest economic

setback across the globe. Our country

felt the impact as much, if not more,

with the nationwide lockdown and

cessation of economic activities which

severely impacted our growth. The

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for

FY2021 contracted by 7.3%, with

the GDP for the first quarter of the

year showing a 23.9% decline. Private

consumer spending which contributes

to more than half of the India’s GDP

contracted by 27% in this quarter.

And to add to the problem, the

second growth engine of investment,

represented by gross fixed capital

formation, contracted by 47% during

the same period. Thankfully, with the

easing of relaxations, the economy

started reviving from the third quarter

with strong festive sales and pent-up

demand which aided growth.

The economic and social restrictions

and widespread uncertainty had a

significant bearing on the demand

for our products as well as our supply

chain during the first half of the year.

Another major challenge we had to

contend with was that of our Sikkim

manufacturing units being in lockdown

for an extended period. Towards the

end of the year, raw material cost

inflation added to the headwinds.

In the face of uncontrollable factors

in the operating environment, we

stayed focussed on strengthening our

business and positioning it for fast

recovery. We continued to expand

our distribution presence, particularly

BACKED BY THE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

WE ARE MAKING IN BRAND VISIBILITY,

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, DISTRIBUTION

NETWORK, PRODUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE

AND HUMAN RESOURCES, WE ARE

WELL PLACED TO GAIN FROM EMERGING

OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE SUSTAINED

VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS.

position as at the date of approval of these financial statements for the next one year and of the recoverability and

carrying values of its assets including Property, Plant and Equipment (including assets under construction), Intangible

assets, Trade receivables, Inventory and Investments as at the Balance sheet date and has concluded that there are

into account all the possible impact of known events and economic forecasts based on internal and external sources

of information arising from COVID-19 pandemic while making such assessment in the preparation of the standalone

financial statements.
