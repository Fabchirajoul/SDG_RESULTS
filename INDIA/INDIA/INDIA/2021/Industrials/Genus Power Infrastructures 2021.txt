The remuneration of SMP mainly comprises basic salary, allowances,

are paid according to the Company policy, subject to prescribed

scenario and prevailing remuneration package of the industry.

The annual variable/incentive pay is linked to the performance of

the Company in general and their individual performance for the

relevant year measured against Company’s targets fixed in the

beginning of the year.

Stock Options: In addition to normal/regular remuneration

package, Employees Stock Option Schemes (“ESOS”) are also in

place for SMP and other employees of the Company, which are

Scheme) Guidelines,1999 (the “Erstwhile SEBI ESOP Guidelines”) as

Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014 and any other guidelines,

the ESOS are to attract & retain talent, reward for past association

& performance and to create long-term shareholder value. The

stock option scheme is share-based. ESOS is administered by the

Committee. The Committee, in accordance with this Scheme and

applicable laws, determines the following:

(i).

The quantum of Employee Stock Options to be granted

under the ESOS;

(ii).

which may be different for different class of employees

pursuance of the ESOS.

Options granted under ESOS would vest within not less than one year
