Letter

of Award for 500 MW PPA. Battling water ingress, tough

geography, adverse weather conditions and COVID

related restrictions during the year, our project team

at GMR Bajoli Holi Hydro Power Limited (GBHHPL) has

managed to tunnel through the tough terrain. With

more than 95% of the Project being completed, we are

expecting to commission the plant during H2 of FY’21-22.

The achilles heel of the power sector in India, is the

operational and financial performance of discoms,

barring a few private ones which are performing well

and reflect that significant improvements are indeed

possible. With adequate power generation capacity and

transmission network in place, it is the distribution sector

which would see a lot of focus, as with a turnaround in

this, power sector can be nursed back to health.

The Government and related agencies have taken

concrete steps to address the issues in this sector, which

include:

• Revamped distribution reforms scheme with an

outlay of more than ` 3 lakh crore to focus on

reduction of technical and commercial losses by way

of smart metering, Feeder segregation and other

infrastructure works,

• The Government has already tabled Electricity

Amendment Bill to delicense power distribution to

introduce competition and private sector play,

• Merit based economic dispatch of power plants is

being piloted to reduce variable cost of power and

thereby bring down losses.

I believe that India is at a cusp of an energy transformation

and is marching towards ambition of 450 GW of installed

green capacity by 2030. There is also a large headroom

for increase in power consumption with the current per

capita consumption of in India much lower than the

global average. This would mean a major transformation

of power sector, with significant opportunities opening

of power distribution, renewable power space including

distributed generation, intelligent energy solution and

services.

Your Company has built significant expertise and domain

knowledge in the Power sector over the past years and

is exploring new opportunities in the emerging scenario.

With anticipated changes in the Market and Regulatory

environment, GMR Group is focused on identifying

attractive opportunities that we can target. Areas being

explored include Power Distribution, Renewable Energy

and other Asset Light Digital opportunities.

International Natural Resource assets

Given the global upswing in commodity cycle, the coal

business has been performing exceptionally well in the

recent past. PTGEMS have been consistently increasing

its coal volumes and its operations have been robust

and consistently profitable. During CY-2020, PTGEMS

has sold 34 million tons which translated to a PAT of

USD 96 million for the year and company has announced

cumulative dividends of USD 253 million, with your

company receiving USD 76 Mn as dividend since start of

2020 till date.

TRANSPORT & URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE

The key highlights for FY’20-21 for the Transportation

and Urban Infrastructure vertical (T&UI) vertical of your

Company included the following.

The Highway toll projects were affected due to the

ongoing Covid 19 pandemic and farmer’s agitation

in Punjab. The toll has been suspended in Ambala –

Chandigarh toll road from October 2020 onwards. We

are engaged with the Government in efforts to resume

tolling. NHAI has also released a policy for compensation

to BOT (Toll) concessionaires, to which we have applied to.

On the positive side, implementation of Fastag has

improved collection efficiency at our toll projects.

During the year, we have also converted all streetlights

in Ambala–Chandigarh project to LED. It is worthy to

note that Hyderabad – Vijayawada project secured Green

Highway award from MoRTH during FY’20-21.

The Highway sector continues to be one of the most

dynamic sectors in the country. During FY’20-21, NHAI

awarded record number of projects in Hybrid Annuity

Model (HAM) mode and significant number of projects

are expected in HAM, BOT and EPC during FY’21-22. Your

company is always in lookout for adding new highways

PPP projects that fit into the overall strategy of the Group

to the existing portfolio. On highways front, concerned

authority have passed a significant order accepting our

submission on Change in Law for Hyderabad-Vijaywada

Principle-wise (as per NVGs) BR Policy/policies (Reply in Y/N)

The National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and

Economic Responsibilities of Business (NVGs) released by the Ministry

of Corporate Affairs has adopted nine areas of Business Responsibility.:

letter dated 22 January 2020 issued by the Ministry

of Finance Male, Republic of Maldives, “the amount of tax assessed by

the MIRA relating to the final arbitration award is only USD 0.59 crore

and this amount should be paid by whom the payment was settled to

GMIAL in the event of any tax payable by GMIAL”. Further the: letter also

confirms that GMIAL is not liable to pay for the taxes assessed by MIRA

on the arbitration sum and the Government of Maldives have initiated

communication with MIRA to settle the taxes and fines payable on the

arbitration award. Accordingly, the ultimate outcome of the business

tax assessment sent by the MIRA cannot be determined and hence, the

effect on the financial statements is uncertain. Accordingly, the Group

has not made any provision in these consolidated financial statements.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

The above matter has also been reported as an emphasis of matter in

the audit report dated 5 March 2021 issued by other firm of chartered

accountants on the standalone financial statements of GMIAL for the

year ended 31 December 2020.

7.

We draw attention to note 48(ii) to the accompanying consolidated

financial statements in relation to the recoverability of sale

consideration receivable as at 31 March 2021 amounting to ` 741.50

crore pursuant to the sale of equity stake and inter-corporate deposits

given to Kakinada SEZ Limited (‘KSEZ’) which is dependent on the

achievement of the milestones as detailed in the aforementioned note.

Such, achievement of milestones is significantly dependent on future

development in the Kakinada SEZ and basis independent assessment

by property consultancy agency, management is confident of achieving

such milestones and is of the view that no adjustment to the aforesaid

balance is required to be made in the accompanying consolidated

financial statements. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this

matter.

Key Audit Matters

8.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment

and based on the consideration of the reports of the other auditors on

separate financial statements and on the other financial information

of the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, were of most

significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current

period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of

the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our

opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these

matters.

9.

In addition to the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion,

we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit

matters to be communicated in our report.

believes that the claims filed against GKEL/GWEL are not tenable and does not have any adverse impact on the consolidated financial

statements.

v)

GEL had entered into a Power Purchase Agreements ('PPAs') with Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited for supply of energy

during the period December 15, 1997 to July 7, 2008. GEL had a Fuel Supply Agreement (‘FSA’) with a fuel supplier towards purchase of

Naphtha for generation of electricity during the aforementioned period. The FSA provided for payment of liquidated damages to the fuel

supplier in the event there was a shortfall in the purchase of the annual guaranteed quantity.

During the year ended March 31, 2013, GEL received a demand towards liquidated damages amounting to ` 296.16 crore along with an

interest of ` 5.55 crore towards failure of GEL to purchase the annual guaranteed quantity for the period from November 21, 2001 to June:

letter dated March 3,.2021 and March 15, 2021 with reference to both

the rectification / recall request for an amount of Rs 12.78 crore and Rs 182.13 crore respectively. The letters states that there is no mistake

/ error in both the Orders dated December 10, 2020 and DDFS may file an appeal before the appropriate authority.

Having regard to status of matters referred above and in view of inherent uncertainty in predicting final outcome of above litigations,

involving refunds, which is sub-judice, refund of ` 27.84 crore (as at March 31,2020 ` 27.84 crore) received in an earlier year has been

considered as contingent liability by the management.:

letter dated April 17, 2018, proposed to extend the EC granted to GBHPL for a period of 3 years, subject to the final outcome

of the matter pending before the Court. Based on its internal assessment and a legal opinion, the management of the Group is confident of

obtaining the requisite clearances and based on business plan and a valuation assessment carried out by an external expert during the year

ended March 31, 2021, the management of the Group is of the view that the carrying value of net assets of GBHPL by GEL as at March 31, 2021 is

appropriate.

v)

power plant of 600 MW situated at Warora. GWEL has accumulated losses of ` 703.86 crore as at March 31, 2021 which has resulted in substantial

erosion of GWEL’s net worth. GWEL had claimed compensation for coal cost pass through and various ""change in law"" events from its customers

under the Power Purchase Agreements (‘PPA’) and have filed petitions with the regulatory authorities for settlement of such claims in favour of GWEL.

part of an entity's cash management, bank overdrafts are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents. A characteristic of such banking

arrangements is that the bank balance often fluctuates from being positive to overdrawn. Accordingly, the Group has considered only such bank

overdrafts which fluctuates from being positive to overdrawn often.

personal assets of certain directors and assets held / corporate guarantee given by the holding company / fellow subsidiaries.:

letter dated January 22, 2020 received from Ministry of Finance Male', Republic of Maldives (the "Ministry"), the amount of

tax assessed by MIRA relating to the final arbitration award is USD 0.59 crore and in the event of any tax payable by GMIAL on the same shall be

borne by whom the payment was settled to GMIAL, without giving any workings / break-up for the same. As such the Ministry has confirmed that

the GMIAL is not liable to pay for the tax assessed by MIRA on the final arbitration award.

GMIAL has obtained the statement of dues from MIRA on December 31, 2020, according to which GMIAL is required to settle business profit

tax amounting to USD 0.72 crore and fines on business profit tax amounting to USD 0.62 crore and GMIAL is required to settle withholding tax

amounting USD 0.29 crore and fines on withholding tax amounted to USD 0.36 crore (withdrawing the interim tax liability claim of USD 0.72 crore).

Considering the entire tax liability pertaining to the business profit taxes is relating to the Arbitration Award Sum, the management of the Group

is of view that GMIAL will be able to successfully defend and object to the notice of tax assessments and accordingly, no additional provision

is required to be recognized in these financial statements. Further, in respect of the matters pertaining to the withholding taxes and the fines

thereon, Group, believes that since these pertain to the aforementioned matter itself, the tax demand on these items is not valid and based on an

independent legal opinion, no adjustments to the books of account are considered necessary.

Accordingly, no adjustments have been made to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2021.

cost of total 300.375 acres land has been classified as asset held for sale and recorded at realisable value. However, considering the value

appreciation of land in the vicinity subsequent to sale of land to TEPL and based on the independent valuer report, the management is of view

that the recoverable value of balance land will be more than the book value.

clarifications. Block assessments have been completed for some of the companies of the Group and they have received orders/demand

from the Income Tax Authorities for earlier years. The management of the Group has filed the appeals with the income tax department

vii.

DIAL has made an internal assessment on computation of Annual Fee payable to AAI and is of the view that the Annual Fee has been paid to AAI

on Gross Receipts credited to the statement of profit and loss (with certain exclusions) instead of on the “Revenue” as defined under OMDA. The

legal opinion obtained in this regard made it clear that there were excess payments of Annual Fee by DIAL by mistake from time to time to AAI.

Accordingly, as per the decision taken by the Board of Directors of DIAL, a claim for return of excess Annual Fee paid to the AAI was raised on

December 26, 2016. AAI has not agreed to the claim and insisted DIAL to continue to pay Annual Fee on the same basis, which DIAL is paying

under protest and accounting annual fee as expense till the matter is settled. Accordingly, the dispute arose under OMDA but same could not

be resolved amicably leading to the initiation of arbitration proceedings, which have commenced from December, 2018. DIAL has submitted its

statement of claim in respect of which, AAI has filled its Statement of Defense (SOD). Pleadings in the matter are completed and issues were

framed by Arbitral Tribunal. At the stage of oral evidence, DIAL had examined two of its witnesses. Despite opportunity being given no witness

was examined by AAI. DIAL had completed its arguments/ submissions, AAI arguments have been partly heard and will further continue on the

next date of hearing. However, due to current COVID -19 situation, the matter was not taken up for hearing for AAI’s arguments and was simply

adjourned. Next date of hearings are July 11, 2021, July 18, 2021 and August 01, 2021 for AAI’s arguments and August 07, 2021 and August 08, 2021

for DIAL’s rejoinder arguments.

viii.

In the month of March 2020, DIAL in its various communications issued inter-alia under Article 16 (Force Majeure), informed AAI that consequent

to outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the entire aviation industry, particularly the IGI Airport has been adversely affected. It was specifically

communicated that the said crisis has materially and adversely affected the business of DIAL which in turn directly impacts the performance of

DIAL’s obligations under the OMDA (including obligation to pay Annual Fee/Monthly Annual Fee) while it is continuing to perform its obligation

to operate, maintain and manage the IGI Airport. DIAL thereby invoked Force Majeure as provided under Article 16 of OMDA and claimed that it

would not in a position to perform its obligation to prepare Business Plan and pay Annual Fee/ Monthly Annual fee to AAI. The said event(s) of

Force Majeure has also been admitted by AAI in its communication to DIAL. Consequently, DIAL is entitled to suspend or excuse the performance

of its said obligations as notified to AAI. However, AAI has not agreed to such entitlement of DIAL under OMDA. This has resulted in dispute and

for the settlement of which, DIAL has invoked on September 18, 2020 dispute resolution mechanism in terms of Article 15 of OMDA. Further,

on December 2, 2020, DIAL again requested to AAI to direct the Escrow Bank to not transfer the amounts from Proceeds Accounts to AAI Fee

Account, seeking similar treatment as granted by Hon’ble High Court of Delhi to Mumbai International Airport Ltd.

In the absence of response from AAI, DIAL approached Delhi High Court seeking certain interim reliefs by filing a petition u/s 9 of Arbitration &

Conciliation Act on December 5, 2020 due to the occurrence of Force Majeure event due to outbreak of COVID 19 and its consequential impact

on business of DIAL, against AAI and ICICI Bank (Escrow Bank). The Hon’ble High Court of Delhi vide its order dated January 5, 2021 has granted

ad-interim reliefs with following directions:

•

The ICICI Bank is directed to transfer back, into the Proceeds Account, any amount which may have been transferred from the Proceeds

Account to the AAI Fee Account, after December 9, 2020,

•

Transfer of moneys from the Proceeds Account to the AAI Fee Account, pending further orders, shall stand stayed and DIAL can use money

in Proceeds Account to meet its operational expenses.

Meanwhile with the nomination of arbitrators by DIAL and AAI and appointment of presiding arbitrator, the arbitration tribunal has been

constituted on January 13, 2021. The first preliminary hearing was held on January 29, 2021. Parties have to complete their pleadings by June 19,

2021 and DIAL has filed its statement of claim on March 25, 2021.

Before DIAL’s above petition could be finally disposed off and while the issue is now pending before the Arbitral Tribunal, AAI has preferred an

appeal against the ad-interim order under section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before division bench of Delhi High Court.

Though AAI has preferred an appeal, but it has not issued any certificate or instructions to the Escrow Bank from December 9, 2020 onwards

regarding the amount of AAI Fee payable by DIAL to AAI, as contemplated under the Escrow Agreement and the OMDA. Resultantly both pursuant

to the ad-interim order of Hon’ble Delhi High Court and in the absence of any certificate or instruction from AAI, the Escrow Bank has not

transferred any amount pertaining to AAI Fee from Proceeds Account to AAI Fee Account of the Escrow Account from December 9, 2020 onwards.:

letter dated

June 9, 2020 acknowledged the receipt of request from GHIAL for refund of the aforesaid up-front fees and to present GHIAL’s request to the

appropriate committees for approvals. Further, management has obtained legal opinion from an independent lawyer regarding GHIAL’s right to

receive the refund of upfront fee. In view of the above and on the basis of on-going discussions with the Bank officials, management is confident

of the recovery of the said amount in full, and accordingly, no adjustment were considered necessary in the accompanying consolidated financial

statements for the year ended March 31, 2021.

xxii. The Hon’ble Orissa High Court vide Judgement in W.P. No.20463/2018, in the case of Safari Retreats Private Limited, observed that the GST

provisions w.r.t input tax credit allowability in respect of Civil work are not in line with the objective of the Act, and accordingly, held that if an

assessee is required to discharge GST on the rental income, it is eligible to avail the Input Tax Credit (ITC) of GST w.r.t. civil work. DIAL is engaged

in rendering output supplies which is in the nature of letting out space/ facilities to various airline operators and other parties/concessionaires,

in return for consideration, known by different nomenclatures and are leviable to GST. Hence, DIAL has availed the GST ITC in respect of the costs

for civil work incurred as part of the Phase 3A expansion project and regular operations, upon application of the said judicial pronouncement.

Further, department has filed an appeal in Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the judgement of Hon’ble Orissa High Court. Pending outcome

of judgement of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, considering the judgement of Hon’ble Orissa High Court and based on the opinion obtained by

DIAL in this regard, the Management is of the view that GST ITC in respect of such civil work is eligible to be availed by DIAL.

Having regard to the same, GST ITC amounting to ` 477.62 crore (March 31, 2020: ` 254.01 crore) has been claimed in GST return and disclosed

under balance with statutory / Government authorities in consolidated financial statements.

Further a Writ Petition has also been filed by DIAL in the matter before Delhi High Court on July 10, 2020, for ITC claim to be allowed of GST in

respect of the civil works i.e. works contract service and goods and services received by DIAL for construction of immoveable property used

for providing output taxable supplies. The writ was heard by the Hon’ble High Court on July 29, 2020 and issued notice to the respondents.

Accordingly, the matter was heard on September 15, 2020 and on November 20, 2020. Next date of hearing has been fixed on July 09, 2021.

Further GHIAL has also recognized input tax credit on civil and related work aggregating to ` 372.80 crore (including ` 256.71 crore pertaining to

earlier year) has been claimed in GST returns and disclosed under balance with government authorities in the consolidated financial statements.

Further, GHIAL has filed a writ petition (10367/2020) with Hon’ble High Court of Telangana requesting to strike down the relevant provisions of GST

which denies ITC in respect of works contract services or goods and services received for construction of immoveable property (other than plant

& machinery). The Hon’ble High Court had passed interim order directing the Respondents to not take any coercive action against the petitioner.

Further GIAL has also recognized input tax credit on civil and related work aggregating to ` 68.69 crore (March 31, 2020: Nil) has been claimed

in GST returns and disclosed under balance with government authorities in the consolidated financial statements.

Further a Writ Petition has also been filed by GIAL in the matter before High Court of Bombay at Panaji, Goa on December 18, 2020, for ITC claim to

be allowed of GST in respect of the civil works i.e. works contract service and goods and services received by GIAL for construction of immoveable

property will be used for providing output taxable supplies.

xxiii. During the year 2018-19, DIAL had started the construction activities for phase 3A airport expansion as per Master Plan. DIAL has incurred `

4,160.88 crore excluding GST (including capital advances of ` 635.76 crore (excluding GST)) till March 31, 2021 [March 31, 2020: ` 2,813.45 crore

(including capital advances of ` 839.16 crore)] towards construction of phase 3A works, which includes Interest during construction of ` 418.08

crore (net of interest income Rs: 198.83 crore) as on March 31, 2021 (March 31, 2020: ` 117.15 crore [net of interest income of ` 115.80 crore]).

The Company together with GAL had executed a settlement agreement dated August 13, 2018 with Investors to amicably settle all outstanding

disputes pertaining to the matters which were the subject of the aforesaid arbitration. As per the settlement agreement, the Company through

its wholly owned subsidiary, GISL, had purchased 2,714,795 CCPS A of GAL for an additional consideration of ` 3,560.00 crore from the Investors

However pursuant to the definitive agreement dated July 04, 2019 with TRIL Urban Transport Private Limited, a subsidiary of Tata Sons, Solis

Capital (Singapore) Pte. Limited and Valkyrie Investment Pte. Limited, the management had considered the aforesaid additional obligation of Rs.

3,560.00 crore as recoverable and had recognized the same as a financial asset in it consolidated financial statements for the year ended March

31, 2019. This agreement was cancelled during the year ended March 31, 2020.

Matters related to certain road sector entities:

i.

GMR Ambala Chandigarh Expressways Private Limited (‘GACEPL’), a subsidiary of the Holding Company has been incurring losses since the

commencement of its commercial operations and has accumulated losses of ` 543.15 crore as at March 31, 2021. The management of the Group

believes that these losses are primarily attributable to the loss of revenue arising as a result of diversion of partial traffic on parallel roads.

GACEPL had invoked arbitration proceedings against National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), State of Haryana (SoH) and State of Punjab

(SoPb) as per the terms of the Concession Agreement entered into with NHAI dated November 16, 2005 (‘Concession agreement’) and State

Support Agreement dated February 21, 2006 and March 8, 2006 due to continued losses suffered by GACEPL on account of diversion of traffic to

parallel roads developed by SoH and SoPb. GACEPL has raised its contention that NHAI, SoH & SoPb has breached the provisions of Concession

Agreement and State Support Agreements by building parallel highways resulting in loss of traffic to the GACEPL's toll road. GACEPL had filed a

net claim of ` 1,003.35 crore including interest, calculated up to March 31, 2019 before the Tribunal.

The three member Hon’ble Tribunal vide its order dated August 26, 2020, has pronounced the award wherein majority of the Tribunal has

disagreed with the contention of the GACEPL and has rejected all the claims of GACEPL whereas the minority arbitrator has upheld the claims

of the GACEPL and awarded the entire amount claimed by GACEPL. Majority Award has also vacated the stay granted on recovery of negative:

letter

dated June 24, 2020 and October 15, 2020 has stated that the contention of GHVEPL is unmerited and due reasons have been conveyed, even

though no substantial information is provided on the basis of which such decision is taken. In this regard, GHVEPL has obtained a legal opinion

from its Counsel handling NHAI matter in Honorable Delhi High Court which has opined that with the majority findings of the Arbitral Award in

favour of GHVEPL, issuance of Notice dated May 8, 2020 and: letter dated June 24, 2020 / October 15, 2020 by NHAI / Regulator is in bad light

and arbitrary. Legal Counsel opined that NHAI being aware of the financial implications of the Notice dated May 8, 2020 trying to somehow avoid

quantifying and making any payment of the claim to GHVEPL under Change in Law. The Counsel further opined that, NHAI after having failed in

its series of coercive steps including the notices for recovery of alleged Premium, suspension notice and notices in relation to non-compliance

of O & M requirements has, on May 8, 2020, issued the Notice under Article 3.2.2 of the Concession Agreement and that too in the middle of

extensive arguments in the aforesaid petitions before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, only to make GHVEPL to somehow give up its claims and avoid

determination of claims. GHVEPL on October 30, 2020 has issued Notice of Dispute under Article 44.2 read with Clause 44.1.2 of the Concession

Agreement to NHAI for amicable settlement as a first step in dispute resolution, which has been declined by NHAI on December 4, 2020. Pursuant

to the notice dated April 6, 2021, the Arbitrators have been appointed and the Arbitral Tribunal has held its first hearing setting procedural

timelines for hearing the litigation. Legal counsel has opined that GHVEPL has a fair chance of winning the arbitration proceedings and has rightful

claim for Change in Law for 25 years concession period.

Further GHVEPL has also internally assessed the average daily traffic for financial year 2024-25, the scheduled six-laning period which indicates

that average daily traffic at designated Toll Plaza will exceed the Design Capacity that would require six-laning as per Clause 29.2.3 of the

Concession Agreement. In terms of the internal assessment by GHVEPL where in the traffic flows were estimated to increase to the levels which

mandates six-laning during the concession period and based on the opinion from the legal Counsel, the management is of the view that the

withdrawal of the Six Laning of the project highway without any reasoning is not a tenable action by NHAI / Regulator based on which a notice

for invoking Arbitration under clause 44 of the concession agreement has been served upon on April 6, 2021. The legal counsel has opined that

GHVEPL is in good position to assert for concession period of 25 years. Accordingly, considering the matter is sub-judice, concession life of 25

years with six laning has been considered for the purposes of the amortisation of Intangibles considering the initiation of Arbitration Proceedings

challenging the communication/notice by NHAI / Regulator restricting the period to 15 years with four-laning.

The valuation expert based on the assumptions that it would be receiving the compensation in the future, had determined value in use of GHVEPL

assets as at March 31, 2021 (i.e. valuation date) which is higher than the carrying value of assets.

Standalone statement of cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2021:

letter dated April 17, 2018,

proposed to extend the EC granted to GBHPL for a period of 3 years, subject to the final outcome of the matter pending before the Court. Based on its

internal assessment and a legal opinion, the management of GBHPL is confident of obtaining the requisite clearances and based on business plan and a

valuation assessment carried out by an external expert during the year ended March 31, 2021, the management of the Company is of the view that the

carrying value of the investments in GBHPL by GEL as at March 31, 2021 is appropriate.

10

The Company through its subsidiary GMR Coal Resources Pte. Limited (‘GCRPL’) has investments of ` 3,703.92 crore (March 31, 2020: ` 3,618.65 crore)

in PTGEMS, a joint venture as at March 31, 2021. PTGEMS along with its subsidiaries is engaged in the business of coal mining and trading activities. The

cost of investments is significantly higher than the book value of assets of PTGEMS and includes certain future benefits including Coal Supply Agreement

(‘CSA’) of GCRPL with PTGEMS whereby the Company along with its subsidiaries is entitled to offtake stated quantity of coal as per the terms of the CSA

at an agreed discount other than profit from mining operations. Though the shares of PTGEMS are listed on the overseas exchanges, the management

is of the view that the quoted prices are not reflective of the underlying value of the mines as in the past few years the shares have been very thinly

traded. Based on profitable mining operations, ramp up of production volumes and other assumptions around off take at a discounted price and trading

thereof considered in valuation assessment carried out by an external expert during the year ended March 31, 2020, the management believes that the

carrying value of aforesaid investments in PTGEMS as at March 31, 2021 is appropriate

11

i) During the year ended March 31, 2021:

(a)

The Company has sold 154 equity shares of Mrf 10 each of GMIAL for consideration of ` 0.00 crore (` 23,725)

(b)

GGAL ('the Transferee Company'), a subsidiary of the Company had applied for confirmation / approval of scheme of merger / amalgamation and

capital reduction ('the Scheme') with its wholly owned subsidiaries GMR GENCO Assets Limited, GMR Kakinada Energy Private Limited and GMR

Coastal Energy Private Limited and partly owned subsidiaries SJK Powergen Limited and GMR Power Corporation Limited (collectively referred to

as the 'Transferor Companies'). The appointed date of merger / amalgamation is March 31, 2019. The scheme was filed with the Hon'ble Regional

Director, Mumbai (RD). Necessary approvals from shareholders and creditors (vide NOCs) were obtained and submitted with the office of RD.

The RD filed its report dated February 20, 2020 with National Company Law Tribunal, Special Bench, Mumbai ('NCLT') and NCLT passed the order

approving the Scheme on March 13, 2020. Pursuant to the Scheme, financial statements of GGAL have been prepared on merged basis with

effect from March 31, 2019 in accordance with the accounting treatment prescribed in the Scheme. Further, as per the Scheme, GGAL’s issued,

subscribed and paid-up equity share capital has been reduced from ` 6,323.25 crore (comprising of 6,323,250,226 equity shares of ` 10 each) to

` 723.25 crore (comprising of 723,250,226 equity shares of ` 10 each) by way of cancelling and extinguishing 5,600,000,000 fully paid up equity

shares of ` 10 each out of which 5,599,557,367 pertains to shares held the Company. The shareholders whose share capital has been reduced have

been paid a total sum of ` 60 crore in the proportion of their shareholding in GGAL as the consideration.

(c)

DPPL has redeemed 15, 0.1% unsecured optionally convertible cumulative debentures of ` 1,000,000 each

(d)

The Company has sold 1,165,330,644 equity shares of `10 each of GAL to GIDL for a consideration of ` 2,112.05 crore. The sales consideration is:

letter dated January 22, 2020 received from Ministry of Finance Male, Republic of Maldives (the "Ministry"), the amount of tax

assessed by MIRA relating to the final arbitration award is USD 0.59 crore and in the event of any tax payable by GMIAL on the same shall be borne by

whom the payment was settled to GMIAL, without giving any workings / break-up for the same. As such the Ministry has confirmed that GMIAL is not

liable to pay for the tax assessed by MIRA on the final arbitration award.

GMIAL has obtained the statement of dues from MIRA on December 31, 2020, according to which GMIAL is required to settle business profit tax

amounting to USD 0.72 crore and fines on business profit tax amounting to USD 0.62 crore and GMIAL is required to settle withholding tax amounting

USD 0.29 crore and fines on withholding tax amounted to USD 0.36 crore (withdrawing the interim tax liability claim of USD 0.72 crore).

Considering the entire tax liability pertaining to the business profit taxes is relating to the Arbitration Award Sum, the management of GMIAL is of view

that GMIAL will be able to successfully defend and object to the notice of tax assessments and accordingly, no additional provision is required to be

recognized in these financial statements. Further, in respect of the matters pertaining to the withholding taxes and the fines thereon, GMIAL, believes

that since these pertain to the aforementioned matter itself, the tax demand on these items is not valid and based on an independent legal opinion, no

adjustments to the books of account are considered necessary.

13

The Company does not hold any shares in these entities. The value of investment represents investments in additional equity on account of financial

guarantees.

14

The Company has signed definitive share sale and purchase agreement (‘SSPA’) on September 24, 2020 for the sale of equity owned by its
