NOTICE

335:

Dear Shareholders,

The past year has indeed been a year of great challenge

with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting economies across

the globe, including the Indian economy. The pandemic also

seriously affected your company’s performance. However,

your company has shown resilience in dealing with the

situation and supplemented the national efforts while

at the same time worked towards strengthening its own

foundations for long term growth.

From the initial days of the pandemic itself, your company has

been at the forefront in ensuring safety and well-being of its

employees, their families and supporting the society at large.

This continued in the second wave as well, with the company

supplying over 5,75,000 Cu Mtrs, i.e., over 80,000 cylinders

of medical oxygen. BHEL was, in fact, the major source of

emergency medical oxygen for Uttarakhand, Western UP,

city of Bhopal, etc., which resulted in saving many lives. We

have futher developed and supplied medical oxygen plants

for hospitals, in collaboration with CSIR-IIP, in record time.

Your company also developed and manufactured disinfection

equipment for mass sanitization of towns and cities, and

upgraded company’s hospitals and dispensaries. In keeping

with its ethos as a caring company, BHEL introduced an

assistance scheme for taking care of families of employees

who unfortunately succumbed to the pandemic.

While the second wave of COVID has hit the country and

your company hard, BHEL has taken steps for ensuring

rapid recovery of operations and made efforts for mitigating

effects of any further waves by taking steps to make

workplaces COVID compliant as well as an extensive

vaccination campaign at its units as well as project sites. The

company is making efforts to ensure vaccination of not just

employees and their families, but also of all persons working

in these premises. To avoid any stoppage of work due to

non-availability of oxygen (as happened in the second wave)

as well as to support the community at large, in case of any

future eventuality, we are additionally installing oxygen

generation plants in those units which do not have oxygen

production facilities at the moment.

Key performance highlights

Disruptions caused by the first wave of COVID had serious

repercussions on the company’s operations, both in the

manufacturing units as well as at project sites. While all: Letter to Shareholders

BHEL is on its journey to

transform itself into a

vibrant and growing Global

Engineering Organization

Dr. Nalin Shinghal

Dear Shareholders,

It is an honor and a privilege to present the 56th

Annual Report to our valued shareholders. I am

writing to you at a time when the entire world is

combating with the Covid-19 pandemic, which

has far reaching consequences on societies,

economies and businesses across the globe.

The pandemic has added yet another layer of

complexity to an already challenging business

environment with falling global GDP growth rates

and decline in ordering of thermal power projects.

Now that the world is slowly coming to terms

with this unprecedented crisis, it is time for us to

adjust to the ‘new normal’ and reorient ourselves

accordingly.

Covid response & contribution

Your company has undertaken various steps to

deal with COVID-19 situation and responded with

agility to minimize the impact on its stakeholders.

Business continuity & preparedness has been

ensured during the lockdown through the ‘work-

from-home’ mode, especially in areas such as

design and engineering, training, knowledge

sharing and other HR related activities, finance

related activities, etc. During the lockdown, work

continued at critical sites with the support of local

authorities, which resulted in recommissioning

of 1x800 MW Kothagudem thermal project and

commissioning of Bhadradri Unit-1 in Telangana.

Your company has also risen to the occasion

to support the national efforts on COVID-19

through monetary contribution of ` 15.72 crore to

PMCARES fund as well as through development

of multiple products for in-house use and by

various govt. departments/ municipalities and

has also provided support to local communities in

every possible way.

Key performance highlights

Even

though

the

lockdown

was

imposed

in

the

country

from

25th March 2020, the impact on your company’s

operations was being felt much earlier, on account

of disruptions in material supplies from China,

efforts were made to subsequently resume activities at

normal levels, the impact is visible in the annual results.

• Your company secured orders worth I13,472 Cr despite

the sluggishness in ordering by customers on account

of COVID related uncertainties. Your company has

booked its highest ever orders in hydro power segment

and was also successful in retaining its leadership in

engineering and manufacturing of equipment for

nuclear power and emission control business.

• Your company has won its first order for Sulphur

Recovery Unit (525 TPD) from IOCL Paradip, and its

successful completion will establish BHEL as an LSTK

player for process packages in upcoming opportunities

in the Downstream Oil & Gas sector.

• The company recorded a turnover of I16,296 Cr with

a net loss of I2,717 Cr in 2020-21. The loss includes

an additional merit based provisioning of about

I1,800 Cr. made after detailed review of receivables,

on an exceptional basis, which was taken up by the

company as a measure of utmost financial prudence, so

as to strengthen receivables management process and

improve quality of assets in the balance sheet. Further,

the loss has been exacerbated due to non-productive

expenses during the COVID period (salaries/ expenses

for which there was no production)

• Your company has taken a major initiative for change

of strategy from Revenue Centric to Project Centric

operations, which have impacted the revenues in the

short term but will lead to timely completion of projects

and improvement in customer satisfaction, as well as

significantly improve long term business prospects.

• Concerted efforts for cash collection resulted in

liquidation of 82% of the current year billing, which is

the best in the last 10 years and the company achieved

a cash surplus of I383 Cr. in FY 2020-21 as against a

deficit of I3,587 Cr. in previous year.

durable sales and hiring of urban workers suggest that the

consumption, investment and external demand are regaining

traction.

Investment demand still remains weak. However, improving

capacity utilization, rising steel consumption, congenial

monetary and fiscal policies and the economic packages &

other measures announced by the Government are expected

to kick-start a long-awaited revival.

Although ordering for new coal-based power generation

equipment remains weak, demand for emission control

business is strong and growing. Growth in urban mobility

in rail transportation sector, thrust on indigenization in

defence & aerospace sectors, and expected expansion in oil

& gas sector will continue to present new opportunities. The

AatmaNirbhar Bharat Initiative of the government is also

creating multiple opportunities for the company.

Future perspective

While the challenges continue, the situation is also throwing

up a number of opportunities. The company believes

that timely & high quality delivery of products & projects,

aggressive efforts in emerging technologies, collaborative

working with government, PSUs, private industry, R&D

institutions and academia will be the foundations for building

a strong future. In this situation, the company has set out to

reinvigorate itself by following a two pronged strategy:

a. in the short run, complete & close projects expeditiously

which will also result in release of cash to meet its

operations; expand existing conventional business

through enhanced efforts in pollution control systems,

spares & services; strengthening of IT and technology

base; rebuilding a Quality First culture across the

organization; and vigorous cost cutting for achieving

business growth in a competitive environment and

b. in the long run focus on regaining technology leadership

and strengthening diversification initiatives.

The past year has been a year of consolidation for the

company, wherein a number of initiatives taken up in the

previous year have come to bear fruit and are playing a

vital role in efforts towards building a BHEL of the future.

The company has focused on revamping project execution

through successful implementation of the IPMS (Integrated

Project Management System) supplemented with the

ongoing Site Data Digitization project, ensuring sequential

dispatches, closure of punch points, and switching over from

Revenue Centric to Project Centric philosophy.

The company has worked aggressively towards realizing its

pending dues through taking up issues at multiple levels

with the state and central governments and taking required

Improved execution coupled with concerted

efforts for cash collection resulted in the company

being cash surplus in FY 2020-21 as against a

deficit of I3,587 Cr. in previous year

Economic & business environment

After the pandemic induced contraction, domestic economic

activity is normalizing with the ebbing of the second wave of

the virus and the phased reopening of the economy. Several

high-frequency indicators, viz., registration of automobiles,

electricity consumption, non-oil non-gold imports, consumer:
