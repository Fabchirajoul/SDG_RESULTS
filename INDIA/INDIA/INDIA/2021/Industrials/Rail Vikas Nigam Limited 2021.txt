Company measures financial instruments at fair

value at each reporting date. Fair value is the price

that would be received to sell an asset or paid to

transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between

market participants at the measurement date. The

fair value measurement is based on the presumption

that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the

liability takes place either:

•

in the principal market for the asset or liability or

•

in the absence of a principal market in the

most advantageous market for the asset or

liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must

be accessible to the company. The fair value of an

asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions

that market participants would use when pricing the

asset or liability assuming that market participants

act in their economic best interest. The company

uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in

the circumstances and for which sufficient data are

available to measure fair value maximizing the use

of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use

of unobservable inputs.
