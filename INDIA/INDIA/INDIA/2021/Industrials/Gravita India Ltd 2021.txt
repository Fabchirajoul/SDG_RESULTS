Letter from our Chairman

Dear shareholder,

Ÿ

Our net profit is up by 58.17% to ` 52.48 cr

Ÿ

Our EBIDTA is up by 20.33% to ` 117.29 cr

challenging times. COVID-19 resulted in identifying and

implementing new business and operational opportunities

which improved the overall efficiency of our operations.

Ÿ

Our earnings per share is up by 60.16% to ` 7.72

Given the circumstances, the markets in which we operate

held up relatively well. Furthermore, as the year progressed,

we became increasingly skilfull at adapting to new methods

of operations and working practices to deal with the

persistent challenges that came our way. Consequently, the

adverse impact on our business reduced to an extent, that by

the end of the fiscal year we were able to deliver an overall

strong and credible performance.

We knew that our customers needed our support during

these challenging times and we remained at optimal

capacity to service their needs, while also transitioning our

office-based employees to working from home

arrangements in line with government directives and health

advice. We focused on our most affected customers to

provide them with appropriate solutions to help them

navigate through turbulent times arising due to lockdown

restrictions imposed to curb the pandemic. Importantly, the

pandemic has made it clear that our strategy is robust,

manifest in our financial performance for the year.

Ÿ

Our revenues are up by 4.59% to ` 1,409.74 cr

In light of enhanced performance, the Board of Directors

recommended an interim dividend of ` 1.10 per share

(payout of 55% on face value per share of ` 2) in January

2021.

Business and markets

It must be noted that the multi-product, multi-geographic

nature of our business added to our resilience through
