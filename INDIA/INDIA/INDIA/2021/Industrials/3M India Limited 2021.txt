Message from the: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

In an uncertain environment, your Company focused on protecting citizens and helping them ɥght the pandemic, providing

customers with innovative solutions and maintaining prudent cash position. During FY 20-21, COVID headwinds softened

demand from automotive and manufacturing sectors. At the same time, the demand from healthcare, personal protection,

home improvement and cleaning remained strong as customers looked for new solutions to adapt. In an extremely

challenging environment, your Company was able to put in its best eɢorts to sustain a reasonable performance without a

steep decline. Your Company's overall growth rate on a standalone basis declined by 12% for the ɥnancial year ended March

31, 2021. The operating margin for the current year is 10.8% compared to 13.6 % for the previous ɥnancial year.

Adversity brings out the resilient spirit.

Your Company furthered its eɢorts on all fronts - employee safety and vaccination, enhanced manufacturing to meet the rapid

and growing demand for respirators, sanitizers and other essential commodities and continuing to deliver to customers with

innovative solutions. Emerging trends provided opportunities to improve healthcare outcomes, create safer and more

hygienic experiences at home, and support business recovery with solutions for enhanced safety and hygiene to name a few. I

would like to make a special mention of the employees of your Company who stepped up when they were needed the most.

Whether it was dedication to duty to show up on the shop ɦoor to manufacture essential commodities during the harsh

lockdown months or supporting each other and families or extending support to the local communities, the eɢorts have been

inspirational. During the second wave, there have been several instances of employees going beyond the call of duty to lend a

hand and even save a life. I am also pleased to share that your Company has contributed to the country’s COVID

immunization program by facilitating the vaccination of all its employees, dependents, and contingent workers across all

locations.

COVID also exposed the vulnerabilities of our communities bringing urgent attention to issues such as food security, access

to healthcare, disruption of education and several livelihoods. Your Company augmented its CSR eɢorts through multiple

partnerships and collaborations to support communities in various ways like cooked meals and ration distribution to

vulnerable communities, enhancement of healthcare infrastructure and skilling and digital education initiatives.

I would like to laud the leadership and employees of your Company for their eɢorts to serve the country, our customers and

communities. We are optimistic about the recovery of the Indian economy as the country scales up mass vaccination and

works to contain the spread of infection. We are grateful to the national, state and district Government agencies for their

support throughout the year. On behalf of the Board of Directors of 3M India Limited, I want to thank you, shareholders for

your trust and support. I am conɥdent we will emerge stronger with science and innovation driving a more inclusive and

sustainable future.

“We have to move along a resilient path

that is both inclusive and sustainable.”
