Aim to achieve

industry leading growth

Project Leap PG 34

Amidst the

upheaval, we

continued to

remain nimble

with unwavering

focus on business

execution.

PG 18:

Dear shareholders,

On this 25th year of Polycab as

structured organisation, it gives me

immense pleasure to place before you

the first Integrated Annual Report of

Polycab India Limited for FY 2020-21.

This is a decisive step towards improving

transparency, ensuring sustainability,

and promoting inclusive growth.

I believe realigning our principals

towards progressing across multiple

capitals of our business model will

lead to tremendous value creation for

all stakeholders, while cementing our

market leadership position.

COVID-19 response

With initiation of our business continuity plan last

year, we started prioritising safety and well-being

of our employees, partners, and customers.

This year our corporate social responsibility

initiatives reached even deeper and farther. We

proactively supported communities across India,

either directly or by partnering with government,

local administrations, or NGO partners with

monetary aid or through distribution drives, which

included ration kits, essentials such as masks,

sanitisers and medicines. These efforts were

well recognised by the local administration and

the communities. On the operations front, all

our factories, offices and warehouses have been

operational in compliance with local guidelines

and following global best practices. We continue

to stand with the community fight the pandemic

on a front foot.

Performance review

The year saw our team working from home and

we leveraged this as an opportunity to strengthen

our skillsets with more focused training sessions.

We played to our core strengths -manufacturing,

distribution, innovation and technology, to

sustain our leadership in the wires and cables

segment, while strengthening our consumer

electricals business.

We worked on developing new ranges of

consumer-centric products, based on our deep

understanding of the market and launched new

products across categories. Our manufacturing

excellence was bolstered through process

improvements, investments in capacity building,

deployment of cutting-edge technology and

automation, including data analytics and artificial

intelligence driven tools. A robust R&D backbone

and seamless backend integration for quality raw

materials, strengthened our brand position and

enabled us to stay ahead of the curve.

We grew our market reach in the Tier-II and

Tier-III cities and continued with our branding

initiatives during the year to improve brand

connect. Our experience centers were redesigned

as Polycab Galleria to engage more meaningfully

with customers and influencers and strengthen

our presence in the consumer electricals

segment.

Amidst the upheaval, we continued to remain

nimble with unwavering focus on business

execution. As a result, our revenue increased

from `88.3 billion in FY20 to `89.3 billion in

FY21, despite pandemic-induced disruptions.

Economic contractions witnessed in the first

half of the year put our antifragility to the test.

It was not until the latter half that India began

its upward trajectory. Consumer and market

sentiments improved as crucial indicators, such

as the infra investments, GST revenues, IIP, PMI,

building materials consumption, among others

began to indicate an economic rebound.

Our core wires and cables business was

supported by distribution expansion,

portfolio augmentation, higher realisation

and favourable macro environment in second

half. Our efforts to become a premium global

player is progressing well. Normalised exports

portfolio saw strong traction during the

year. Our swelling portfolio of global quality

certifications along with product approvals

from large multinational organisations proves

our commitment to quality, consistency,

and creditability. A sharp rebound in global

demand for commodities coupled with

supply side interruptions led to record surges

in input prices. This was largely mitigated

through calibrated price escalations, hedging

mechanisms and better production planning.

We received multiple product approvals for

our inhouse manufactured high end cables

used in sectors such as defence, railways and

automobiles. We are the first Company in India

to receive Automotive Research Association

of India (ARAI) test certificates on ISO 16942

cables for electric vehicle (EV) applications. We

worked as a project implementation agency

(PIA) with BharatNet’s Phase-II and received

several awards and accolades.

Consumer electricals vertical continued its

strong momentum, withstanding all disruptions.

The year was marked with impressive broad-

based growth and market share gains across

categories. At `10.3 billion in revenue the

business achieved a major milestone. Within

the fans category we emerged leader in few

geographical clusters. Lighting business posted

strong industry leading growth over last year

despite tough market conditions and input cost

inflation. Our strategic interventions to unlock

synergies helped revive growth in categories

like switches and switchgears. A focused

programme is underway to develop premium

and value-added products which resonates

better to market trends. Augmenting our brand

architecture, we launched a new brand Hohm

from the house of Polycab. It is a premium

IoT based FMEG portfolio which will cater to

evolving needs of consumers in this digital age.

All of Hohm products are made in India and

most of them are manufactured inhouse. Hohm

is a significant step in our journey of innovation

and transforming Polycab into an aspirational

brand.

Profitable growth has been our core agenda.

Strategic interventions in terms of pricing,

cost optimisation and enhanced portfolio mix

helped mitigate sharp surge in input costs and

improve operating profitability during the year.

Our Financial position was stronger than ever

with net cash position of over `9 billion as of

year end.

Outlook

We are encouraged by the government’s

continued efforts to calibrate our health

infrastructure and ongoing progress on the

vaccination front. Initiatives like Atmanirbhar

Bharat, National Infrastructure Pipeline

and the recently introduced production

linked incentives (PLIs) to bolster domestic

manufacturing augurs well wires and cables

industry. Favourable developments on account

of policy reforms, normal monsoons, easing of

liquidity position, reduction of interest rates and

boosting entrepreneurship with initiatives for

MSMEs strengthen the case for India becoming

a $5 trillion economy. These structural

developments offer tremendous growth

potential, and we intend to work relentlessly,

leverage our core competencies and stay ahead

of the curve.

Leaping growth

During the year we flagged off a strategic cost

optimisation initiative – Project Udaan. We

are quite optimistic that it will help us build a

lean cost structure, which is sustainable while

institutionalising new ways of working. While

the implementation is still underway and

benefits will accrue over the next two years, I

am happy to report that we have identified and

are unlocking significant value already.

We also initiated Project Shikhar to strengthen

our engagement with key influencers i.e.

Retailers, Electricians & Small contractors. This

programme seeks to expand our retail reach

in 300 high potential cities across India, over

the next two years. We intend to reach to over

half of all the retailers directly in these cities

and drive 3x sales from these markets. Our

‘Experts Program’ emphasis on inclusive growth

by imparting personal and professional skills to

participants along with monetary incentives.

Our extensive focus on digitalisation and

creating a robust IT infrastructure has helped us

improve cross functional operating efficiencies

and transform customer experience. Our online

multiplatform dealer portal now generates

over 70% of our domestic products business.

We are also digitalising and integrating our

supply chain including warehouses and logistics

using RFID, GPRS, sensors and scanners.

Document management process is being made

intuitive with intelligent workflows across the

organisation. We have meticulously aligned

individual goals with company goals through

an upgraded robust performance management

system.

Lastly, we have embarked on a five-year

transformational journey. By FY26 we aspire to

cross `200 billion in sales with significant market

share improvement across categories. I believe

we are at an inflection point of our organisation’s

growth trajectory and the next five years will

be driven by customer-centricity, future-ready

organisation structure, digital transformation,

and a sharp focus on Environment, Sustainability

and Governance. We are dedicated to using

our resources in a responsible manner. Our

endeavour to serve the communities, have a

positive impact on environment and ensuring

corporate governance form an integral part of

our business.

Gratified by your support

Before I conclude, I take this opportunity to

thank the Board for effectively steering the

Company in these unprecedented times. I

am grateful to the leadership team and our

employees for their relentless efforts and

contributions towards upholding business

continuity and enabling growth. To our

stakeholders including our partners, suppliers,

customers, consumers, influencers, bankers,

government authorities and to you, our

shareholders, I express my gratitude for

reposing your faith in us. Let us together make a

difference and scale new heights of progress in

the impending year.

Warmly,

Inder T. Jaisinghani

Corporate information

Polycab India Limited (the “Company”) (CIN-L31300GJ1996PLC114183) was incorporated as ‘Polycab Wires Private Limited’ on

January 10, 1996 at Mumbai as a private limited company under the Companies Act, 1956. The Company became a deemed public

limited company under Section 43A(1) of the Companies Act, 1956, and the word ‘private’ was struck off from the name of the

Company with effect from June 30, 2000. Thereafter, the Company was converted into a private limited company under Section

43A(2A) of the Companies Act, 1956, and the word ‘private’ was added in the name of the Company with effect from June 15, 2001.

Subsequently, the Company was converted into a public limited company, the word ‘private’ was struck off from the name of the

Company and consequently, a fresh certificate of incorporation dated August 29, 2018 was issued by the Registrar of Companies,

National Capital Territory of Delhi and Haryana (“ROC”), recording the change of the Company’s name to ‘Polycab Wires Limited’.

Thereafter, the name of the Company was changed from ‘Polycab Wires Limited’ to ‘Polycab India Limited’, and a fresh certificate of

incorporation dated October 13, 2018 was issued by the ROC. The Consolidated Financial Statements relates to Polycab India Limited

(‘the Parent Company’) along with its subsidiaries and joint ventures (collectively referred to as ‘the Group’).

During the current year, the registered office of the Company has been shifted to Unit 4, Plot Number 105, Halol Vadodara Road,

Village Nurpura, Taluka Halol, Panchmahal, Gujarat-389 350.

The Group is the largest manufacturer of Wires and Cables in India and fast growing player in the Fast Moving Electrical Goods

(FMEG) space. The Group is also in the business of Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) projects. The Group owns 23

manufacturing facilities, located across the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, and U.T. Daman.

The Board of Directors approved the Consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 and authorised for issue

on May 13, 2021.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

A) Basis of preparation

i.

Statement of Compliance:

The Group prepares its Consolidated financial statements to comply with the accounting standards specified under Section

133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended from time to

time. These Consolidated financial statements includes Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2021, the Statement of Profit and

Loss including Other Comprehensive Income, Cash flows Statement and Statement of changes in equity for the year ended

March 31, 2021, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (together hereinafter

referred to as “Financial Statements”).

ii.

Basis of Measurement:

The financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 have been prepared on an accrual basis and a historical cost

convention, except for the following financial assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value or amortised

cost at the end of each reporting period:

(a)

Derivative financial instruments

(b)

Certain financial assets and liabilities (Refer note 39 for accounting policy regarding financial instruments)

(c) Net defined benefit plan (Refer note 30 for accounting policy)

(d) Share Based Payments (Refer note 30 for accounting policy)

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value

is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market

participants at the measurement date.

Accounting policies and methods of computation followed in the financial statements are same as compared with the

annual financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020, except for adoption of new standard or any pronouncements

effective from April 1, 2020.

The Group presents an additional balance sheet at the beginning of the earliest comparative period when: it applies an

accounting policy retrospectively; it makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial statements; or, when it

reclassifies items in its financial statements, and the change has a material effect on the financial statements.

Corporate information

Polycab India Limited (the “Company”) (CIN-L31300GJ1996PLC114183) was incorporated as ‘Polycab Wires Private Limited’ on

January 10, 1996 at Mumbai as a private limited company under the Companies Act, 1956. The Company became a deemed public

limited company under Section 43A(1) of the Companies Act, 1956, and the word ‘private’ was struck off from the name of the

Company with effect from June 30, 2000. Thereafter, the Company was converted into a private limited company under Section

43A(2A) of the Companies Act, 1956, and the word ‘private’ was added in the name of the Company with effect from June 15, 2001.

Subsequently, the Company was converted into a public limited company, the word ‘private’ was struck off from the name of the

Company and consequently, a fresh certificate of incorporation dated 29 August 2018 was issued by the Registrar of Companies,

National Capital Territory of Delhi and Haryana (“ROC”), recording the change of the Company’s name to ‘Polycab Wires Limited’.

Thereafter, the name of the Company was changed from ‘Polycab Wires Limited’ to ‘Polycab India Limited’, and a fresh certificate of

incorporation dated October 13, 2018 was issued by the ROC.

During the current year, the registered office of the Company has been shifted to Unit 4, Plot Number 105, Halol Vadodara Road,

Village Nurpura, Taluka Halol, Panchmahal, Gujarat 389 350.

The Company is the largest manufacturer of Wires and Cables in India and fast growing player in the Fast Moving Electrical Goods

(FMEG) space. The Company is also in the business of Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) projects. The Company owns

23 manufacturing facilities, located across the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, and U.T. Daman.

The Board of Directors approved the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 and authorised for issue on

May 13, 2021.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

A) Basis of preparation

i.

Statement of Compliance:

The Company prepares its Standalone Financial Statements to comply with the accounting standards specified under

Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended from

time to time. These Standalone financial statements includes Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2021, the Statement of Profit

and Loss including Other Comprehensive Income, Cash flows Statement and Statement of changes in equity for the year

ended March 31, 2021, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (together

hereinafter referred to as “Financial Statements”).

ii.

Basis of Measurement:

The financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 have been prepared on an accrual basis and a historical cost

convention, except for the following financial assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value or amortised

cost at the end of each reporting period:

(a)

Derivative financial instruments

(b)

Certain financial assets and liabilities (Refer note 37 for accounting policy regarding financial instruments)

(c) Net defined benefit plan (Refer note 29 for accounting policy)

(d) Share Based Payments (Refer note 29 for accounting policy)

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value

is the price that would be received from sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market

participants at the measurement date.

Accounting policies and methods of computation followed in the financial statements are same as compared with the

annual financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020, except for adoption of new standard or any pronouncements

effective from April 1, 2020.

The Company presents an additional balance sheet at the beginning of the earliest comparative period when: it applies

an accounting policy retrospectively; it makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial statements; or, when it

reclassifies items in its financial statements, and the change has a material effect on the financial statements.:

letter of credit. Trade

payables are presented as current financial liabilities.

The Company enters into arrangements for purchase under usance: letter of credit issued by banks under non-fund based working

capital limits of the Company. Considering these arrangements are majorly for raw materials with a maturity of up to twelve months,

the economic substance of the transaction is determined to be operating in nature and these are recognised as acceptances under

Rate of TDS @10% u/s 194 of the Act is subject to provisions

of Section 206AB of Act (effective from July 1, 2021) which

payments to specified persons:

-

at twice the rate specified in the relevant provision of the

Act; or

-

While your Company is awaiting the guidelines from the

Government prescribing the mechanism to determine who

fulfils the conditions of being a ‘specified person’. Therefore,

in order to comply with the provisions of the Act, and unless

any mechanism is prescribed by the authorities in this regard,

Company will proceed on the assumption that all shareholders

are in compliance with the provisions of Section 206AB of the

IT Act. However, we request you to inform us well in advance

and before record date if you are covered under the definition

of ‘specified person’ as provided in Section 206AB of the IT Act.

The Company reserves its right to recover any demand raised

In case tax on dividend is deducted at a higher rate in the
