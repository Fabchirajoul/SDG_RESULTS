Dear Shareholders,

I am privileged to present the 35th Annual Report of your

Company for FY 2020-21.

I sincerely hope all of you are safe and secured amid resurgence

of COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak of the Covid-19 has

caused immense damage to human life and global economy.

After severe contraction in last year the global economy had

shown promising signs of returning to normalcy, however

second wave of Covid has slowed down the pace of recovery.

Indian economy is projected to be at pre covid levels on the back

of domestic market consumption and positive monsoon

forecast.

The world is beginning to appreciate value of environment.

Pandemic has shown the value of putting premium on

environment. There has been increasing awareness on reducing

energy footprints, Carbon Intensity (CI) reduction and marching

towards net zero emissions to create sustainable future.

India remains heavily dependent on the imported fossil fuels to

meet its growing energy needs. Consumption of fossil fuel is

undoubtedly one of the major causes of GHG emissions. This is

adversely impacting environment and raising concerns over

ecological balance. Being signatory to COP 21 Paris climate

change summit, India has obligations to fulﬁl Nationally

Determined Contributions (NDC). Industry and the private sector

need to join forces with the government to make this happen.

Your Company is in the business of developing and deploying

technology led sustainable solutions that help conserve the

environment. As a build-up to COP 26 Climate Change summit at

Glasgow scheduled in November 2021, Praj looks forward to

joining UNFCCC’s Race to Zero global campaign aimed at zero

carbon recovery to unlock inclusive and sustainable growth.

Transportation sector is identiﬁed as the 2nd largest emitters of

GHG after industry. Praj’s pioneering Bio-MobilityTM platform of

technology solutions utilizes biological resources to produce

low carbon renewable transportation fuels in liquid as well as

gaseous form. While Bio-MobilityTM platform is already helping

reduce GHG emissions in surface transportation, there is

tremendous growth potential globally for deeper penetration.

With stringent environmental norms being envisaged in air and

water transport, Bio-MobilityTM is poised for big strides in

aviation and marine sectors in near future. It may be noted that

Bio-MobilityTM platform also helps address brown clouding of

cities caused by stubble burning. Agricultural waste post

harvesting is used as a feedstock for production of biofuels and

as such helps create employment and entrepreneurship

opportunities in the rural areas.

Considering social, environmental & economic beneﬁts of

ethanol blending program (EBP), the government of India has

advanced 20% ethanol blending target by 5 years from 2030 to

2025. This is creating visibility of growth in ethanol demand &

helping build industry structure alongside robust ecosystem

across the value chain. This bodes well for Praj, as your

Company is a market leader in developing & deploying innovative

technology solutions for sugar as well as starch based ethanol

plants.

Dr. Pramod Chaudhari

Executive Chairman

June 2021, Pune:

dear shareholders for your continued belief in

Praj’s capabilities and bright future.

Managing Director and Mr. Sachin

Raole (SR), CFO and Director-Finance & Commercial have exercised all the options granted to them under ESOP 2011 Grant X.

Since the difference between market price as on the date of exercise of options and the option price, is treated as perquisite

(ESOP Perquisite), this perquisite amount of Rs 371.67 Lakhs for the financial year 2021/22 and similar estimated amount for the

financial year 2022/23, would form part of Managerial Remuneration of SJ and SR for the Financial Years 2021/22 and 2022/23

respectively.

From the above, it will be observed that, the major increase in Managerial Remuneration, proposed for Financial Years 2021/22

and 2022/23 is on account of ESOP Perquisite of Rs 371.67 Lakhs approx. in respect of SJ and SR and balance of Rs 308.41

Lakhs is on account of salary revision of all the Executive Directors.

In view of above factors, it is expected that the total Managerial Remuneration of all Executive Directors, taken together for the

Financial Years 2021/22 and 2022-23 may exceed the limits specified in Section 197 of the Companies Act, 2013 , as computed

under section 198 of the Companies Act 2013.

As per provisions of section 197 of the Companies Act 2013 read with other applicable provisions, if any, and Regulation 17 (e)

of SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015, if the Managerial Remuneration for Executive Directors for any Financial Year exceeds 10% of

the total profits of the Company as computed in the manner specified under Section 198 of the Companies Act 2013, the same

shall be approved by the Shareholders by way of Special Resolution.

In the backdrop of above and pursuant to the provisions of Section 197 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies

(Appointment and Remuneration of Managing Personnel) Rules, 2014, as amended from time to time, read with Schedule V to

the said Act and Regulation 17 (e) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015 as amended from time to time, consent of Members is being
