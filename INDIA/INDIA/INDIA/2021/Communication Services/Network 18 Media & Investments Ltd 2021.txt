Letter to Shareholders: Dear Shareholders,

The last year has been a story of conviction, continuity and standout performance

for Network18, all in the face of adversity, which humanity has never witnessed

at such a scale in the past. The Covid-19 pandemic created an extremely difficult

operating environment, with logistical constraints and business that ebbed

and flowed, but the biggest challenge was the virus attacking our teams and

families. It is in such times that the true DNA of an organisation shows up, and our

stakeholders across the board have kept the flag flying high.

Our operating teams have risen to the occasion by persevering through tough

times, innovating to get business back on the rails, and ensuring that our consumer

connect keeps growing unfettered. Our group devised and implemented pandemic-

appropriate work measures and arranged for healthcare and vaccinations for all

employees and their families; creating an environment that fostered hope and

positivity amidst the gloom. The management strategically pruned costs to reset the

business in the new normal, and our shareholders persevered with us all through,

offering words of guidance and support. The net result has been that business

returned to its growth trajectory by Q4, and FY 2020-21 was the most profitable

year in the history of the group, with all business lines delivering highest-ever

operating margins, reduced leverage, and a much healthier bottomline.

During the year, our 56 domestic TV channels continued to inform and entertain the

Indian masses, as Television grew in stature as the primary mode for home-bound

people to remain connected to the world outside. News operations continued

unabated even during the peaks of the pandemic, as a vital service for >95% of

TV-viewing households that are our consumers. In Entertainment, we were the last

amongst peers to stop original programming telecasts, forced by the pandemic-

led lockdown shuttering content production. We were also the first to restart Hindi

GEC original content broadcasts, underscoring our responsibility towards paying

consumers.

Digital got a major fillip during the lockdown, as both News & Entertainment

platforms witnessed increased engagement. Ad-led models, in both genres, broke

even, as the Digital medium became the preferred choice for many advertisers

during the pandemic. The new growth engines of Digital subscriptions took centre

stage, as Moneycontrol Pro and Voot Select grew in stature early in their lifecycle.

MC Pro is among the top 20 news pay platforms globally. Voot Select was the

fastest to 1 mn Direct-to-Consumer paying subscribers amongst peers; despite the

limitations on the quantum of original content due to the lockdown.

The Network18 Group has viewed the crisis as an opportunity to rethink business

models and is emerging stronger and ready for the post-Covid-19 world. We

continue to push the envelope in content creation, expand partnerships and

distribution, and deploy innovative and efficient solutions in operations amidst

the ever-changing ground realities. We hope to marry our hard-fought gains in

profitability with industry-leading growth in a more conducive business environment

as we go forward. Our plans to invest in digital growth and our resolve to excel in

television remain constant amidst a dynamic business environment.
