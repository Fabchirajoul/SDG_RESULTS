the Company with unique

opportunities. Certain enterprise

segments like hospitality and

travel were significantly impacted

by Covid 19 while some others

such as Media & Entertainment,

fell sharply due to cancellation

or postponement of major live

sporting events. With the year

witnessing lockdowns in different

forms across markets, our teams

collaborated with customer teams

to bring alive events to consumers

federations and live events to

help them restart safely behind

closed doors (without on-ground

spectators). Our teams worked

tirelessly to deliver the same high-

quality live production remotely,

while dramatically reducing the

number of on-site people required

at the event. We supported global

distribution of over 9,000 live

events, 700 TV channels, with

60,000 hours of live events and

reached over two billion sports fans,

while many of the countries were

under lockdown.

As enterprises were resetting

quick to launch our Secure

Connected Digital Experience

integrated digital solution enabling

We continued to deliver

on our commitments

to our customers, our

shareholders, our partners

and our employees with a

Chairman - CSR Committee:

letter dated

September 7, 2000. The GoI also gave the Company

an assurance that it would consider additional

compensation, if found necessary, following a detailed

review of its decision to open up the ILD market.

Contrary to its assurances, on January 18, 2002, the

GoI issued a further: letter to the Company, unilaterally

declaring that the compensation package provided in

its original letter was to be treated as full and final

settlement of every sort of claim against the early

termination of the Company’s exclusivity rights in the

ILD business. The Company filed a suit in the Bombay

High Court in 2005. On July 7, 2010, the Bombay High

Court ruled that it did not have the jurisdiction to

hear this suit, in view of the provisions of the Telecom

Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997. Aggrieved

by the said order, the Company instituted an appeal

before a division bench of the Bombay High Court on

various grounds. This appeal is yet to come up for a

hearing.

Indian Telecom Regulatory Developments

The Department of Telecommunications (‘DoT’) vide its

amendment dated March 31, 2021, amended the old ISP

licenses granted as per the guidelines dated March 8,

2002 and August 24, 2007. Vide an amendment effective

March 31, 2021, DoT has amended the definition of AGR

and pass-through charges in the ISP Licenses which are

applicable from the date of issue and has prospectively

imposed license fee @8% on pure internet service

H115.73 crores being the penalty and interest

thereon realised by DoT in January 2008. Under

TDSAT’s order of May 2012, DoT refunded to

the Company, an amount of H226.23 crores

(H115.73 crores plus interest), and simultaneously

challenged the order in the Supreme Court of

India, for which appeal is still pending.

iii. In 2013, the Company filed a Writ Petition before

Madras High Court challenging the demand

notice dated February 19, 2013 issued by DoT,

which demand was issued pursuant to special

audit for FY 2006-07 and 2007-08 for additional

license fee and seeking the quashing of the said

demand notice. The Madras High Court by its

order dated March 1, 2013 stayed the demand.

The petition is pending.

iv. In 2013, the DoT introduced a new Unified License

(UL) regime for internet service providers that

replaced the old service-specific license regime

and imposed a new license fee of 8% of AGR on

internet services revenue under the new UL-ISP

Licenses. This created a non-level playing field

among providers. In 2014, the company applied

to the DoT for a new UL-ISP license with the

condition that we would not pay the new license

fee on internet services revenue to maintain a

level playing field with providers not yet subject

to the new license fee, and also requested an

extension for the old service-specific license. The

DoT, while extending the old license, imposed

license fee on internet services, which was

challenged by Tata Communications in TDSAT.

In its hearing of March 25, 2014, TDSAT granted

a stay on payment of license fee on pure internet

services and extended company’s license during

the pendency of the litigation. TDSAT has

granted similar stays on petitions filed by other

service providers on imposition of license fee by

DoT. Vide judgement and order dated October

18, 2019, TDSAT has allowed the petition and

decision of DoT to include the revenue from pure

internet services in the AGR for levy of license

fee on the ISPs under Unified License regime is

set aside with direction to raise revised demands

of license fee on the basis of same concept of

AGR as is being done in respect of ISPs holding

license under the old regime. The expectation

was expressed by TDSAT from DoT to expedite

the process of taking decision keeping in view

the relevant recommendations of TRAI as well

as the constitutional requirement of providing

and safeguarding a ‘level playing field’ for all the

ISPs. DoT was further directed to do it without

any delay to end the uncertainty. DoT has filed a

Civil Appeal before Supreme Court, challenging

the TDSAT’s judgment dated October 18, 2019.

The said Civil Appeal was listed on January 5,

2021 and the Supreme Court, after hearing the

submissions, condoned the delay in filing of

appeal and issued the notice with the directions

that DoT shall not be required to refund any

amounts in pursuance of TDSAT judgment,

and all the respondents in the appeal, in the

event appeal succeeds, be subject to such final

directions as may be passed by the Supreme

Court in its judgment. The Supreme Court further

directed all the respondents to file their counter

affidavit. While the Civil Appeal is pending,

DoT on March 31, 2021 has issued amendments

of Licences granted under 2002 and 2007

guidelines, whereby licensees under 2002 and

2007 guidelines shall be subject to payment of

8% licence fee on the revenue from pure internet

services with immediate effect.

Independent

Director

of

the

Company for a second term.

The resolution was put to vote and

carried with requisite majority.:

Managing Director and CEO w.e.f. July

5, 2019, the strength of the Board of Directors

of the Company was 5, which fell below the

prescribed requirement of 6 directors for

top 1000 listed entities. The Nomination and

Remuneration Committee ('NRC') and the

Board of Directors of the Company immediately

initiated the process of identifying a suitable

successor to be appointed as the MD and CEO

of the Company. After due process, at their

respective meetings held on July 30, 2019,

the NRC and the Board identified Mr. Amur S.

Lakshminarayanan to take up the position of

the MD and CEO of the Company. However, in

terms of the permissions granted by the Ministry

of Information and Broadcasting (‘MIB’) to setup

Teleports at certain places, it was mandatory

for the Company to adhere to the Policy

Guidelines for Uplinking of Television Channels

from India dated December 5, 2011. The said

Policy Guidelines make it obligatory on the part

of the Company to take prior permission from

the MIB before effecting any change in the Chief

Executive Officer / Board of Directors of the

Company. Accordingly, immediately after the

NRC and the Board of Directors identified Mr.

Amur S. Lakshminarayanan to be appointed as

the MD and CEO of the Company, an application

was made to the MIB on August 2, 2019 for the

above mentioned necessary regulatory approval.

The Company received approval of the MIB on

November 22, 2019, upon receipt of which the

Board of Directors, promptly, appointed Mr.

Amur S. Lakshminarayanan as the Managing

Director and Chief Executive Officer of the

Company with effect from November 26, 2019.:
