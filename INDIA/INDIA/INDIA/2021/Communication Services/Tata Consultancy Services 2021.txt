Dear Stakeholder,

Even as I write this, India and many other parts of the world are in the grip of

second or even third waves of the pandemic, much fiercer than anything we

saw last year. It is a health crisis of the kind we have not seen in generations.

My heart goes out to everyone out there who has suffered the loss of loved

ones. I am confident we will eventually get it under control, but until then, I urge

you to stay safe, follow covid discipline, get vaccinated if you are eligible and keep

your spirits up.

On the business front, your company weathered the pandemic very well. It

adapted quickly and embraced a new operating model that prioritized the health

and wellbeing of its employees, while enabling it to continue supporting its

customers not just in their mission-critical operations but also in their growth

and transformation journeys. Its Vision 25x25 and pioneering work around talent

clouds have reinforced its credentials as a thought leader on the future of work,

and a trend setter in the industry.

TCS’ agility, resilience and responsiveness during the crisis earned it tremendous

goodwill from customers and enhanced its standing in the market. After the

initial impact from lockdown-related disruptions, it swiftly returned to a sharp

growth trajectory over the next nine months, and exited the year on a very

strong note, with an expanded market share, industry-leading profitability and an

all-time high order book.: Letter from the

Letter From The Chairman | 8

Technological change is far more perceptible when

it comes to consumer technology, and less so in

the enterprise world. Enterprise adoption of new

technologies tends to be very measured, and it

is only much later, with the benefit of hindsight,

that the scale of change and the key inflection

points become more evident. To my mind, the year

gone by saw an important inflection point that has

huge ramifications on enterprise consumption of

technology in the coming years, and on demand for

your company’s services.

The pressing need for operational resilience and

for enhancing customer experiences in digital

channels accelerated enterprise decision-making,

committing to future technology investments around

the all-encompassing hyperscaler cloud stacks.

This represents an important inflection point in

the enterprise embrace of the cloud, and will drive

significant spending on migrating workloads to public

clouds in the coming years.

Moving workloads to the cloud is just the start

of their digital transformation journeys. The rich

native capabilities of these stacks, particularly in the

areas of analytics, machine learning and artificial

intelligence open up a vast array of possibilities

for enterprises to pursue new business models,

address new customer segments, and provide highly

personalized, differentiated experiences across the

entire customer journey.

Your company is very well positioned to benefit

from this multi-year technology upgradation cycle,

and help customers translate their transformative

visions into reality. To better articulate its mission and

its aspirations, your company adopted a new brand

statement this year, `Building on Belief’. I think it

describes what TCS does very accurately, and also

reflects the ethos of the Tata Group and its evolution

over the last century and a half.

Your company has been guided by a set of strong

beliefs, right from the time it was founded. Belief in

our core values, belief in putting the customer above

all, belief in investing in people and empowering

them, belief in constantly trying out new ideas

and models, and belief in doing right by all the

stakeholder communities we work with. This is why

the new brand statement resonates so well, and feels

so right.

Looking ahead, your company sees immense

opportunities for growth, riding the new technology

cycle that has kicked off, powered by the belief

that its differentiated capabilities and collaborative,

solution-centric approach makes it the preferred

transformation partner of its customers. It is building

on that belief, and investing in sharpening the

capabilities needed to expand its footprint in this

large opportunity.

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Tata

Consultancy Services, I want to thank you for your

continued trust, confidence, and support.

Warm regards,

N Chandrasekaran

Dear Stakeholder,

It has been a difficult year for everybody. Despite the ferocity with which the

second and third waves of the pandemic are now hitting us, we are in a far better

place as we exit FY 2021 than we were at the start. With a plethora of vaccines

and new therapies that modern science and the pharmaceutical industry have

delivered at unmatched speed, humanity is not as helpless as when the pandemic

first struck. We are a resilient and adaptable species. With discipline, focus and

fortitude, we shall overcome.

Our business performance in the year gone by is also a reflection of that innate

resilience and adaptability. In the early months of the pandemic, when the

worldwide lockdown disrupted economic activity across virtually all sectors, your

company responded with speed and agility, embracing a new operating model,

Secure Borderless Workspaces (SBWS™). Working remotely, our teams helped

customers maintain business continuity during peak disruption, and thereafter,

to accelerate their growth and transformation (G&T). The dedication shown

by TCSers, our agility and our innovation, won us much appreciation from our

customers, and incremental business.

Despite a sharp fall in revenues in the first quarter, progressively strengthening

demand for our services helped us stage a swift recovery during the rest of the

year, helping clock full year revenues of ₹164,177 crore in FY 2021, growing

4.6% over the prior year in reported terms, and degrowing by 0.8% in constant

currency terms.

The uneven impact of the pandemic on the different sectors shows up clearly in

our segmental reporting. Three of our six industry verticals showed growth (in

constant currency) over the prior year. As is to be expected in a pandemic year,: Letter from the CEO

Letter From The CEO | 10

when the world looked to the pharma majors to

save humanity from the scourge of disease, our Life

Sciences and Healthcare business grew 17.1%. The

other two verticals were Banking, Financial Services

and Insurance which grew 2.4%1, and Technology and

Services which grew 0.2%.

Our operating margin continued to be industry-

leading at 25.9%*, an expansion of 1.3%* over the

prior year. Net profit was ₹33,388 crore*, a net

margin of 20.3%*. Our cash conversion continues

to be very strong, with a cash conversion ratio

of 116.2%* and free cash flow of ₹35,663 crore,

growing 21.8% over the prior year.

The Board has recommended a final dividend of ₹15

for the year, bringing the total dividend for the year

to ₹38 per share. In keeping with our shareholder

friendly capital allocation policy, your company has

paid out ₹33,873 crore in dividends and a buyback in

FY 2021, amounting to 95% of the free cash flow.

Strong Business Momentum

Demand was driven by the confluence of two big

trends. First, with consumers preferring contactless,

digital transactions, enterprises were forced to rely

more on their digital channels, and in some cases,

1 Excluding Regional Markets and Others

*Excluding an exceptional item provided towards a contested legal

claim

switch entirely to online-only modes, triggering a lot of

investment in not just front-end transformations and

personalization of the customer experience, but also at

the back end, to simplify and digitize processes, reduce

turnaround times for customer service requests and

enhance the end-to-end customer journey.

Second, the pandemic drove home the downsides

of carrying technology debt, and the need for

greater resilience and agility within enterprises. This

resulted in several core transformation engagements

around building a lean, secure and adaptive digital

core, encompassing operations, digital workplaces,

applications, data, the underlying infrastructure and

cybersecurity.

In terms of technology choices, both these drivers

converged on the hyperscaler cloud stacks, also

known as public clouds. FY 2021 will be remembered

as the year when many enterprises took the leap and

committed to channeling their future technology

investments into one or more of these cloud stacks,

significantly accelerating what had been a measured

movement over the last few years.

This decision triggered many engagements around

cloud migration, application modernization and

data modernization. As a precursor to the core

transformation and cloud migration, many customers

are revisiting their current operations to look

for opportunities for optimization and to free up

resources to support their core transformation.

Some customers embarked on significant operating

model transformations as they sought out strategic

partners with strong capabilities and shared values.

There was also increased activity around traditional

outsourcing.

These trends resulted in a steady and strong flow

of deals of all sizes, across all our industry verticals,

throughout the year. We had two large deal wins,

with Deutsche Bank and with Prudential Financial

Inc respectively, that saw us strengthen our German

presence and establish a strong local presence in

Ireland. The order book signed every quarter was

higher than that in the prior year. We closed the year

with an all-time high quarterly TCV of $9.2 billion.

The full year order book was $31.6 billion, our

highest ever, representing a growth of 17.1% over

the prior year.

We see this technology shift

as the start of a multi-year

technology upgradation cycle in

which the abundance of native

capabilities will constantly expand

the art of the possible, opening

up newer opportunities for

technology-driven differentiation.

Letter From The CEO | 11

A Multi-year Technology Cycle

The enterprise embrace of the hyperscaler cloud

has ramifications that go beyond the current year,

extending to the medium and the longer term as

well. This is a decadal technology shift that goes far

beyond just the server and storage aspects of the

IT infrastructure, and represents a crystallization of

technology choices at a much broader level.

This is because all the major hyperscale providers

have been steadily building out their technology

stacks over the last few years, expanding the

offerings to include richer native choices around

databases, data warehouses, applications and

even cutting-edge tools like machine vision,

conversational systems, AI, ML and IoT. Today’s

public cloud is no longer just a very large and

inexpensive third-party data center, but a holistic,

all-encompassing technology ecosystem. Once an

enterprise enters this ecosystem, it is virtually certain

that all of its future innovation and technology

programs will stay within that ecosystem.

So we see this technology shift as the start of a

multi-year technology upgradation cycle in which

the abundance of native capabilities will constantly

expand the art of the possible, opening up newer

opportunities for technology-driven differentiation.

Of course, the technology by itself doesn’t deliver

differentiation. If anything, cloud models are

predicated on standardization and commoditization.

Differentiation takes place when enterprises

invest in bespoke solutions that harness the native

capabilities of the cloud, and are contextualized to

each customer’s unique circumstances, which amplify

their unique strengths, and manage the nuances and

idiosyncrasies to reduce risks. This is exactly what

we have been doing for our customers over the last

few years, leveraging our deep contextual knowledge

of their business and technology landscapes, our

research and innovation, intellectual property and

expertise across digital technologies.

Given the ever-increasing reliance of enterprises

on technology to drive differentiation, and to

power their growth and transformation, we see our

customers’ cloud transformation journeys play out

over three horizons, spread over the next three to

five years and beyond.

The events of FY 2021 have kickstarted the

journey across the first of those horizons for many

enterprises. Migration to the cloud, by itself, is a

material transformation program that will play out

over the next two to three years, depending on the

complexity of the IT landscape. The outcome of

this first phase of transformation will be a resilient,

future-ready digital technology stack that supports

leaner, more agile operations and serves as a scalable

foundation for growth and the subsequent horizons

of transformation.

Enterprises will start realizing the full value of their

cloud investments in the subsequent two horizons.

In the second horizon, we expect to start helping

our customers leverage the rich native capabilities

of these stacks around analytics, AI and ML to build

new systems of customer engagement, new systems

of differentiation and experiment with new business

models.

As more and more enterprises get on to this journey,

the cloud will become the seamless technology fabric

that will bring together enterprises from across

industries to form collaborative ecosystems which

co-innovate around their individual products and

services. It will help launch larger, purpose-driven

offerings, each representing much more value to

their common customers than the sum of its parts.

We believe this boundaryless innovation has the

power to change industry after industry. Given our

deep domain knowledge across multiple industry

verticals, and our work on innovation at their

intersections, it presents us an opportunity to be the

transformation agents and potential orchestrators of

such ecosystems.

Building on Belief

With many of our customers embarking on multi-

year, enterprise-wide transformation journeys,

we are very well positioned to benefit from this

expanding opportunity. Most importantly, we believe

that this represents a unique opportunity to redefine

how enterprises have traditionally approached

transformations.

We believe that enterprises can build sustainable,

inclusive, and greater futures for their stakeholders

by adopting an organic, inside out transformation

model, rather than outside in, externally driven

standardized change agendas. Our own journey over

the last two decades in one of the most competitive

industries in the world highlights the strengths of

this approach. Our transformation approach values

the collective knowledge between us and the

customer, and combines it with a deep understanding

of technologies and an innovation mindset to build

their aspirations into reality.

This differentiated approach is helping us win several

G&T engagements that represent a promising

beachhead in a market where our participation has

been quite low traditionally.

We are very proud of this early success. Our path

to getting to where we are today, systematically

investing to acquire the necessary capabilities and

customer mindshare, has been very differentiated,

very organic and very TCS. Our verticalized,

customer-centric organization structure has

helped us foster domain and contextual knowledge

within the Industry Solution Units. Our sustained

investments in organic talent development, in

research and innovation, and in creating intellectual

property have helped build up solutioning expertise

and boost our innovation credentials. Moreover, we

have created structures that help stitch together

different capabilities from across TCS to put together

holistic solutions that help our customers achieve

their business objectives.

Our focus and investments will now be on growing

further and gaining more market share in this space.

Towards this, we are investing in deepening our

transformation capabilities. While we stay open to

inorganic acquisitions, our focus and commitment to

organic talent development remains unwavering.

In addition to hiring more management graduates,

we are scaling up our highly successful Contextual

Masters program, that identifies individuals who have

developed deep contextual knowledge on the job

and are using that to create value for our customers.

We have launched newer learning and development

initiatives that will identify high potential candidates

and put them through experiential courses that will

help them become more effective transformation

leaders. We are strengthening our partnerships

with large technology providers as well as startups,

academia and domain specialists towards co-

innovating and collaborating to create new service

offerings.

We also refreshed our brand last

month, and launched a new brand

statement, `Building on Belief’, to

reflect who we are today, and to

support our, and our customers'

aspirations in the G&T space. It

celebrates the power of reinvention

and instils hope into business and

trust in the enterprise.

We also refreshed our brand last month, and

launched a new brand statement, `Building on

Belief’, to reflect who we are today, and to support

our, and our customers' aspirations in the G&T space.

It celebrates the power of reinvention and instils

hope into business and trust in the enterprise. Our

belief conveys our optimistic outlook and reflects our

limitless potential to create greater futures.

Purpose, People, Planet

I have spoken earlier2 about how a purpose-driven

approach can infuse greater resilience, adaptability

and innovation within the organization, and drive

greater rootedness in the community. In FY 2021,

alongside a new brand statement, we also articulated

our core purpose: building greater futures through

innovation and collective knowledge.

The first three words capture our forward-looking

worldview very well. We truly believe that everything

we do should result in better outcomes, and

therefore greater futures, for our stakeholders. The

emphasis on innovation and collective knowledge

represents core tenets of the belief system that has

sustained TCS over the last five decades, and shaped

our culture and guided our strategy.

It was this purpose-led approach which helped us

keep our employees safe and well even during the

bleakest phases of this pandemic. The proactive

outreach of our HR, touching over 400,000

employees, the 24/7 medical hotline, online

counseling services, and virtual sessions to foster

physical and emotional wellness brought us all closer

together during the year. We tied up with ambulance

services and hospitals and set up isolation centers

and quarantine accommodation at our facilities to

2: Letter from the CEO, Integrated Annual Report, FY 2019-20

help employees cope with the disease and to ease

the load on stretched local medical infrastructure.

Our emphasis on organic talent development is a

natural outcome of this belief system, to help our

employees realize their potential. TCSers collectively

logged 43 million learning hours in FY 2021, building

expertise in a broad range of digital technologies

that will be critical to our customers’ transformation

needs.

We honored all the job offers we had made pre-

pandemic, and also onboarded all the trainees to

whom we had given offer letters. We had our normal

annual salary increase in October, and promotions

as well. In line with the strong recovery in demand,

we also ramped up our lateral hiring during the

second half of the year and ended the year with a

net addition of 40,185. By onboarding over 60,000

freshers over the last couple of years and training

them on the technologies most in demand, we have

created for ourselves, a secure talent pool to support

the growth ahead.

While this influx of fresh talent is very important for

our growth, even more critical has been our ability to

consistently retain the talent that we have cultivated

and grown in the organization. This year, we set a

new benchmark in talent retention. Our attrition in IT

services was 7.2%, the lowest in the industry globally,

and an all-time low by our own standards.

We are entering FY 2022 with

strong growth momentum and

with much better visibility for

future growth than we did last

year, powered by a strong order

book built up throughout the

year and a robust deal pipeline.

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited

Letter From The CEO | 14

We continued to work with communities across the

world, pursuing our long-standing commitment to

programs in the areas of health, STEM education,

skills development and the bridging of digital divides.

In addition, we helped in the fightback against the

pandemic. Our researchers used AI to identify

promising new molecules which could potentially

inhibit the spread of the virus. Our data marketplace

solution is powering a critical national initiative to

double India’s COVID testing capacity.

Even more fulfilling is the work we do for our

customers which helps further their mission to save

lives. In the Life Sciences domain, our teams used our

innovative platform to streamline drug development

processes, speed up clinical trials, and help pharma

companies rush new therapies and vaccines to

the market. At a time when the world desperately

needed more ventilators and manufacturers were

struggling to increase production, our team worked

with the engineers at GE Healthcare to automate

the late-point configuration of ventilators. This

reduced the production time per ventilator by 6

minutes, enabling production of an additional 340

ventilators per month, helping ease suffering and

saving lives.

On the environment front, while I am pleased that

our large-scale switch to remote working helped

us cut our absolute carbon footprint by 48.8% over

the prior year, we are working on a longer-term

roadmap to neutralize our carbon footprint and bring

down atmospheric carbon towards helping the world

reach net-zero levels by 2050.

Our Vision 25x25 will be pivotal in this fight for

our planet. Equally important is the leading role

we are playing in helping our customers become

more energy efficient, whether it is by deploying

our Clever Energy solution that uses IoT and AI to

remotely monitor and optimize energy consumption

across distributed facilities, or by helping them switch

from energy-inefficient in-house data centers to

more efficient public clouds.

Looking Ahead

We are entering FY 2022 with strong growth

momentum and with much better visibility for future

growth than we did last year, powered by a strong

order book built up throughout the year and a

robust deal pipeline. In the medium and longer term,

we see strong structural growth drivers triggered

by the multi-year technology refresh cycle that our

customers are embarking on, and their increased

focus on G&T initiatives.

The G&T opportunity is very large, and yet to be

fully scoped. The transformation imperative will

only strengthen over time, and as new technologies

emerge, new combinatorial possibilities will open up,

driving further investments by our customers. So we

believe this market will see tremendous growth in

the coming years.

That puts us in a very advantageous position. In

addition to the large outsourcing opportunity which

we continue to dominate, we are now entering a

large, growing opportunity that significantly expands

our addressable market. It is an exciting growth

journey we are embarking on for the next few years.

We thank you for your trust and look forward to

your continued support on the journey ahead.
