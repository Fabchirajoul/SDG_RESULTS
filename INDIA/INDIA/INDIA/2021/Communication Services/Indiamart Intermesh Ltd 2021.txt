MESSAGE FROM MD & CEO

A powerful catalyst to

transform businesses

India’s digital citizens are growing

exponentially, and this fraternity is

spanning generations. We are encouraged

to be both a participant and a catalyst to

this revolution, touching approximately

10% of this population. This trend is

accelerating the growth of our user base

substantially, and we are confident that

this trend will speed up further.: Dear Shareholders,

The financial year 2020-21 presented extraordinary challenges for

the Indian economy and businesses. The Government of India’s

timely fiscal stimulus measures helped mitigate the impact to a

certain extent. Small and medium enterprises, the backbone of

the Indian economy, witnessed large-scale digital adoption in

the year gone by. We as a country, summoned up extraordinary

courage and put together a collective effort to stave off the

impact, reoriented ourselves, redefined our priorities and created

opportunities for the greater benefit of the community.

Additionally, given the need of the hour, we ensured that

IndiaMART plays an active role in bridging the demand-supply gap

for COVID-essential category products. I must say our suppliers

have demonstrated extraordinary agility in adapting to the

situation and ensuring availability of these products by reorienting

their product lines.

A RESILIENT PERFORMANCE

After a difficult first half, a sharp recovery followed suit, resulting

in a 5% y-o-y growth in our consolidated revenues. Collections

from our suppliers reported a marginal drop from ₹738 crores in

FY 2019-20 to ₹711 crores in FY 2020-21. However, the deferred

revenue increased from ₹685 crores as of March 31, 2020 to

₹726 crores as of March 31, 2021.

FOCUSING ON BUSINESS CONTINUITY

We acted proactively to facilitate work-from-home for our

employees and ensured business continuity remotely. We

remained connected with our customers to understand their

requirements and supported them in their critical hour of need.

Our well-designed social responsibility framework helped us serve

the larger community. We took a step forward and rolled out an

Online Associate Programme (OAP) to provide work opportunities

to individuals who are affected by the pandemic, homemakers,

differently-abled individuals and unemployed graduates.

EXPANDING HORIZONS

The gradual economic recovery, backed by our robust

fundamentals, has positioned us attractively to help SMEs in

their growth journey through end-to-end digitisation of their

businesses. Our successful ₹1,070 crores capital raise through

the Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) will be utilised for

both organic and inorganic growth opportunities by investing in

companies, which have synergies with our business model.

We are considering strategic investments in line with our long-

term vision of facilitating commerce online as well as enabling

businesses by providing a wide range of SaaS-based solutions,

thereby, helping us create a robust and resilient business

ecosystem for our suppliers.

FAST-TRACKING VALUE CREATION

India’s digital citizens are growing exponentially, and this fraternity

is spanning generations. We are encouraged to be both a participant

and a catalyst to this revolution, touching approximately 10% of

the population. At IndiaMART, we are building on our execution

capabilities to service the incremental traffic on our platform. We

are optimistic that the robust algorithm that we have built will help

us grow significantly in the coming years.

I take this opportunity to thank you all for keeping your faith in our

vision and capabilities. I would also like to thank our employees

whose commitment has helped us remain resilient and create

value for all stakeholders.

IndiaMART is fully equipped to help catalyse the transformation of

small and medium enterprises, who we believe will shape India’s

next era of growth. We will continue to make ‘doing business easy’

and build a more sustainable and scalable business model.
