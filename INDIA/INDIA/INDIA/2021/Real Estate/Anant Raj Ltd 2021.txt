Dear Shareholders,

With the blessings of Lala Anant Ram Sarin and Smt. Raj Kumari

Sarin, I am delighted our FY 2020-21 report, the first one post

our demerger of Anant Raj Limited into Anant Raj Limited and

Anant Raj Global Limited. With all legal processes and formalities

relating to demerger complete, we are now filled with renewed

enthusiasm and energy to move towards a better future and create

value for all stakeholders.

The impact of the pandemic was evident in the real estate industry.

The lockdown and the subsequent unavailability of labour and raw

materials in the first half of FY 2020-21 saw the entire industry

face delays in project execution. The demand too bottomed in line

with low consumer confidence. In the second half of the fiscal, the

economy bounced back and consumer confidence improved. This

along with a huge pent-up demand led to a steady pick-up in real

estate demand since January 2021.

Focussing on Priorities

At Anant Raj, our top priority in these times was the safety of

our people. We adopted all safety guidelines as mandated by the

Government including temperature checks, regular sanitisation

of facilities and maintaining social distancing. To ensure business

health, we pushed back new projects as demand was low and

instead focussed on maintaining adequate liquidity and balance

sheet integrity. We continued to maintain sharp focus on reducing

debt which stood at ` 1,482.97 Crore as on June 30, 2021. You

will appreciate that its more than two years now that the Company

has not taken any fresh loans.

Despite the execution difficulties, we made efforts to ensure timely

deliveries, a track record that we have maintained since inception.

That said, the unprecedented nature of crisis led to some delays,

and this was a trend all through the industry. I appreciate the

patience shown by our home buyers and assure them that we

are now much better prepared and have all resources in place to

ensure fast execution.

Considering the impact of pandemic on the weaker section of

communities, we also undertook to distribute food and safety kits

to needy people.

Performance Review FY 2020-21

Our performance reflects the market sentiments. Our total income

for FY 2020-21 was ` 275.51 Crore as against ` 417.60 Crore

last year. EBITDA increased by 4.67% to ` 69.85 Crore due

to a sharp decline in construction-related expenses. PAT though

declined 26.38% to ` 20.12 Crore due to higher finance costs.

Our balance sheet position continues to be strong with net worth

of ` 2,468.16 Crore as on March 31, 2021.

To ensure business health, we

pushed back new projects as

demand was low and instead

focussed on maintaining adequate

liquidity and balance sheet

integrity. We continued to

maintain sharp focus on reducing

debt which stood at 1,515.93

Crore as on March 31, 2021.
