Dear Shareholders,

We hope that you are safe, healthy and taking all precautions for your wellbeing.

As you all are aware, FY2020-21 commenced with the onset of Covid-19 pandemic which by now has truly

changed several aspects of our life. This was a very unprecedented and challenging situation, which made

everyone more empathetic and sensitive towards life and the world at large. Even though the pandemic led to a

lockdown for almost six months during FY21, the crisis only made us stronger and smarter in managing our

lives and our business in an uncertain environment. Such challenges always compel us to innovate, take

initiative and become more resilient for the future.

Adapting to the difficult situation, we continued to work from home and ensured all our stakeholder requirements

were addressed. Our employees were equipped with necessary tools and infrastructure to carry out their work

effectively. We also made sure that our labour force and security staff were provided with requisite essentials

regularly. All our operational sites have been following the safety guidelines since the pandemic and we have

been constantly updating them thus offering our workforce a safe environment to function.

While the first half of FY21 was subdued because of the lockdown constraints, however the initiatives taken by

Central and State governments, RBI and other regulatory authorities offered great support which ensured that

overall economic activity in India took the pace in the second half year

We would like to inform that during the year, one of the Associate Companies of your Company, viz. DB BKC

Realtors Pvt. Ltd., executing the project at Tata Colony, BKC in which Prestige Group had acquired equity stake

had thereby provided exit to all its institutional investor during the year. The associate company had also settled

its tenants and vacated the site. Construction is expected to commence in the next year. In addition to above, Turf

Estate Joint Venture LLP, wholly owned by the Company, have executed an amendment LLP agreement with

Prestige Group entity acquiring equal stake in the LLP for joint development of the property. The LLP has

provided exit to its existing partner and initial plans have been approved for the project, balance approvals

including commencement certificate for commencement of work is expected in the next financial year. The

construction of the project is expected to commence in the next financial year.

Before concluding, we would also like to thank all our shareholders, customers and partners for their confidence

and continuous support. It was very encouraging and helped us to continue our fight against the pandemic

during these demanding situations.

Stay Positive, Stay Safe & Stay Healthy.
