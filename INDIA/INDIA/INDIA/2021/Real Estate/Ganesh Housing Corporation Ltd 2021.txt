Dear Shareholders,

I hope you and your near and dear ones are safe and healthy. The

COVID-19 pandemic dominated the entire FY 2020-21 and still

continues to create disruptive impact on the lives and livelihood

of people across the world. In our history of three decades,

we have not experienced anything like this pandemic before.

But as they say, challenges always give you the opportunity to

revisit yourself and change the approach, we also brought about

several changes to our strategy and strengthened our core,

while adapting to the new normal.

FY 2020-21 was the most toughest year on record as a residential

market already struggling for survival was forced to deal with

a collapse in residential demand caused by the pandemic

induced lockdowns in Q2 FY 2020-21. It seemed unlikely that

the subsequent economic fallout would allow market demand

to revive in any meaningful way. However, once the initial panic

subsided due to our improving understanding of the fight against

the pandemic, economic activity resumed, and market forces

rationalized over the latter half of the year.

Measures such as the moratorium on loans, reduction in housing

loan rates and an extension of RERA completion deadlines

allowed developers to survive immediate financial capitulation,

but only a revival in homebuyer demand could make a material

impact on developers’ fortunes. The broad-based income

disruption caused by the pandemic weighed heavy on market

sentiment. However, homeownership has traditionally been a

coveted aspiration of the average Indian and the acute loss of

security felt by the masses during the worst of the pandemic only

reinforced this sentiment. That, coupled with home loan interest

rates at multi-decade lows of sub 7%, a substantial correction in

apartment eventually seem to have convinced homebuyers that

this was an opportune time to buy into the market.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

INCOME: Total Income decreased to ` 182.04 crores in FY

2020-21 from ` 277.33 crores in FY 2019-20.

EBITDA: Earnings Before Interest, Tax and Depreciation

increased to ` (37.73) crores in FY 2020-21, from ` (50.41) crores

in FY 2019-20.

PAT: Profit/ (Loss) After Tax increased to ` (105.25) crores in

FY 2020-21 from ` (119.63) crores in FY 2019-20.

CHAIRMAN’S

MESSAGE

We are facing this crisis

with great strength,

a result of years of

prudent and proactive

management of the

business.

We

lay

our

full

focus

on

our business today
