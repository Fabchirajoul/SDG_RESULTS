Dear Shareholders,

Ever since we were incorporated in 1905,

we’ve witnessed and weathered several crises.

In every instance, our values have guided our

response and these crises became defining

moments and made us stronger. The global

Covid-19 pandemic, that we’re persevering

through now, will be reminisced as one of

the most challenging aftermaths of modern

history. It will also be recognized for the

incredible resilience humanity has displayed in

recovering from it.

Your Company is an exemplary illustration of

true grit put on display by its employees. I am

immensely proud of the way our people have

coalesced together in steering the Company

through the last fiscal year. As a retail

consumption-led real estate company, we are

part of a sector that was particularly affected

by the prolonged and repeated shutdowns.

Nevertheless, I am pleased to inform you that,

even now, we continue our 116-year-old habit

of coming out stronger through adversity.

Our response to the pandemic

We were able to act quickly and effectively to

deliver support where it was most needed, and

this is a testament to the excellent work we

have done over many years to develop strong

relationships with local partners. Our fiscal

year 2021 saw multiple national lockdowns

when only essential stores could run and

these restrictions placed enormous financial

pressure on our retail tenants. To help our retail

partners, we offered certain rental waivers for

a period of time and engaged on a case-by-

case basis to formulate agreed payment plans

that would be a win-win for both. The entire

negotiation with retail partners was based

upon the concept of ‘reasonableness’.

We have also incorporated the highest quality

SOPs to ensure the safety of our customers,

retail partners, guests, residents and

employees across all our properties. Further,

we organised multiple vaccination drives

covering more than 15,000+ employees, their

family members, retail staff, contractual staff

and third-party associates. These drives ran

across our pan India businesses spanning nine

malls in six cities, our two hospitality assets

in Mumbai and Agra, residential projects in

Bangalore, and various commercial properties

in Mumbai and Pune. This effort helped us in

providing a safe experience to people visiting

our properties.

Throughout, our priority has been the

wellbeing of our people. We have worked

hard to foster employee engagement through

online resources to create a culture of

support and understanding where everyone

has access to the assistance they need. Our

Pan-India teams came together to support

any affected employee by procuring medical

supplies, oxygen concentrators, etc. The

Board recognises just how tough delivering

on the day job has been this year and we are

hugely grateful to everyone for their vigorous

work and commitment throughout this time.

An increased focus on ESG

At PML, we have always been sensitive to

running our business in a sustainable way.

During FY2021, we expanded our focus on

ESG aspects and sharpened our Sustainability

Strategy. Climate Change is by far the

most pressing problem facing humankind

and life as we know it. At PML, we are

approaching energy, water efficiency and

waste management not only through systems

and technology routes but also through

advocacy and sensitization – thus influencing

behavioural change.

Over last three years, our conservation

efforts have achieved satisfactory results

with a steady dip in consumption of natural

resources. Energy and water consumption

year on year have decreased consistently in

this period and waste recycling has improved

despite increasing scale of business. With

sustainability now seen as a differentiator

between the best space and the rest,

our ability to deliver buildings which help

occupiers reduce their own carbon footprint

and improve employee wellbeing, will be a key

differentiator. To achieve these, we will work in

partnership with our customers, partners, and

suppliers to deliver meaningful change.

At PML, we emphasise on zero tolerance

on deviation on our Environment, Health

and Safety (EHS) Intent in conducting its

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S

STATEMENT: Dear Shareholders,

This has been an extraordinary year, to say

the least, and I am enormously proud of the

enduring performance the team delivered.

I am particularly gratified with the strong

progress we have made across our set

plans in activating our new mall in Lucknow;

progressing with our asset expansion

in line with our targets set to exceed 13

million square feet of retail by FY2026; and

sharpening our capital budgeting and overall

liquidity to support our growth agenda and

resilience. Building on this, we are clearly

set on achieving our goals by exploiting

our strengths in project management

and development; our active and agile

management of our operational assets;

and our strengthened balance sheet - both

on the debt and equity sides. Even though

our performance this year clearly reflects

the impact of Covid-19, we have further

strengthened our finances through strategic

equity raising and selective debt pairing, and

are well positioned for the opportunities that

lie ahead.

Taking Capital Excellence to the

next level

At PML, we aim to achieve higher and faster

returns by deploying best-in-class thinking

across our projects portfolio and project

delivery value chain. Our ‘Capital Excellence’

approach is designed to improve returns and

programme performance across the entire

portfolio with a rigorous, holistic approach to

capital budgeting and allocation. This requires

us to form risk mitigated capital strategies,

optimise our asset portfolios, and transform

project development and delivery across

asset classes. At each stage we discover,

create, and ultimately grow value—for all

stakeholders in the value chain—and build

teams with the right skills to manage complex

workstreams. By combining advanced

analytics, and capability building, we have

proven our talents in delivering on an end-

to-end journey of capital transformation,

resulting in reduced risks, optimised costs,

accelerated progress, increased returns, and

improved performance.

A key aspect of taking Capital Excellence

to the next level, is to ensure that we are

resourced to execute on our playbook with

confidence – especially when we have seen

how global disruptions can surprise one

at any moment. Through FY2021, we took

several steps to further strengthen our

balance sheet even further and give us the

capital autonomy to go ahead unimpeded

with our long-term plans. In this respect, it

was indeed a prolific year: we raised ~ ` 30

billion in equity within a span of 10 months.

In doing so, we now benefit from a sound

financial position and a strong leadership

team with an unobstructed vision for the

future. The key corporate actions with respect

to capital management included:

z Our QIP in August 2020

z The expansion of our JV with CPPIB - a new

partnership in Kolkata and commitment to

bring in additional funds in the first JV

z Our new JV with GIC

z Our prudent debt management

Our QIP in Aug 2020

In August of 2020, we successfully raised

around ` 11 billion through a QIP issue. Despite

the adversities surrounding the retail and

hospitality sectors, the investor confidence
