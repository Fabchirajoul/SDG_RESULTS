Vinod Kumar Agarwal

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

In FY 2019‑20, I wrote to you that the

macroeconomic uncertainties appear

to be increasing, but we are well

prepared for the emerging conditions.

A year later, I am delighted to convey

that the Company has delivered

results – not just that, our IPO

received a overwhelming response, a

resounding affirmation of the trust that

you have placed in us. On that note,

I am pleased to share the progress

of G R Infraprojects Limited in the

Financial Year 2020‑21 through this

Annual Report, our first as a publicly

traded company.

ECONOMIC REVIEW

The global economy plunged into its

worst recession in living memory in

2020, as COVID‑19 exacted a heavy

toll. India’s GDP shrank by 7.3% in

FY 2020‑21, as compared to a 4.2%

growth in FY 2019‑20. Measures

announced by the Government of

India, in tandem with the Reserve

Bank of India, helped avert a deeper

contraction and extended support

to the vulnerable sections of the

society. Global experts expect the

impact of the second wave to be

limited to the April‑June 2021 quarter

and the economy to be significantly

revitalised by the end of FY 2021‑22

– as public spending ramps up, the

mass vaccination drive picks up

pace, Government efforts generate

positive externalities for the private

sector and pent‑up consumer

demand finds release.

POLICY ENVIRONMENT

The infrastructure sector has

witnessed a steady stream of

investments in the past five years,

primarily led by the Government’s

implementation of the National

Highways Development Project

(NHDP) and various States’

continued emphasis on improving

You would be pleased to note that the

Company registered strong growth in revenue

from operations in FY 2020‑21, reaching

J 7,24,445.50 Lakhs, a 20.18% increase over

J 6,02,775.74 Lakhs in FY 2019‑20. During

this period, EBITDA rose by 7.70% from

J 1,33,504.49 Lakhs to J 1,43,786.65 Lakhs,

while Profit after Tax increased by 13.33% from

J 68,876.81 Lakhs to J 78,060.92 Lakhs.
