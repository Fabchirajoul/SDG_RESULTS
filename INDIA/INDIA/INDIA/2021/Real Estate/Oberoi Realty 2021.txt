Dear Shareholders,

We wish that you are safe, healthy and taking all precautions for

your wellbeing.

FY21 started with the onset of Covid-19 pandemic which by now

has truly transformed several aspects of our life. The challenging

situation made everyone more empathetic and sensitive towards

life and the world at large. Even though the pandemic led to a

lockdown for almost six months during FY21, the crisis only made

us stronger and smarter in managing our lives and our business in

an uncertain environment. Such challenges always compel us to

innovate, take initiative and become more resilient for the future.

Adapting to the difficult situation, we continued to work from

home and ensured all our stakeholder requirements were

addressed. Our employees were equipped with necessary tools

and infrastructure to handle all customer queries virtually. Our

technological solutions enabled our employees to ‘Work from

Anywhere’ ensuring seamless collaboration among themselves

and our business partners. We also made sure that our labour

force and security staff were provided with requisite essentials

regularly. All our sites have been following the safety guidelines

since the pandemic, and we have been constantly updating them

thus offering our workforce a safe environment to function. For

more transparency, efficiency and as a part of our environment

initiatives we have been using some of the best industry software

to monitor the project progress, cost and manage resource

efficiently. To ensure the safety and wellbeing of the employees

and their families, the company concluded a vaccination drive for

approximately 1700 individuals across the ORL group, Westin

and Oberoi Mall.

While the first half of FY21 was subdued because of the lockdown

constraints, however the initiatives taken by Central and State

governments, RBI and other regulatory authorities offered great

support which ensured that the second half made up for the whole

year. I would also like to thank all my shareholders, customers,

and partners for their confidence in the brand and continuous

support. It was very encouraging and helped us to continue our

fight against the pandemic during these demanding situations.

The pandemic also led to a paradigm shift in consumer

preferences and buying behaviour. It made people realise the

importance of owning a home that takes care of all the needs and

safety of every family member. This realisation shifted consumer

preferences towards spacious homes and integrated residential

developments having an ecosystem of amenities, social

infrastructure, workspaces, shopping, dining and entertainment

destinations. Furthermore, developers with high brand equity,

financial prudence, proven track record of construction quality

and delivery saw a consolidation of demand in their favour. The

convergence of these changing consumer preferences,

consolidation in the sector and low home loan interest rates

ensured a stupendous sales performance in FY21 for the

company. Customer’s comfort to deal with developers who have

the financial stability will ensure that the market share for

established players like us will continue to increase further.

FY21 has been a year where we strengthened our position and

focused on execution, growth and expanding horizons. Even

during the pandemic all our residential projects received robust

interest from across the globe. The new launches, at Goregaon

and Borivali received remarkable response from homebuyers. We

leveraged consumer insights to identify the emerging trends in

buying behaviour post pandemic and accordingly designed

spacious homes. We also added a multipurpose room that can be

set up as a dedicated Work From Home area. This additional

space was created to meet the new requirement of the

homebuyers.

On our annuity portfolio we leased 1.1 million sq. ft. in Commerz

III, our upcoming commercial building at Oberoi Garden City,

Goregaon to a leading international financial services company

making it one of the largest office space transactions in India. Our

retail business performed well and during the festive season the

sales volume exceeded the pre-covid levels. We believe there is a

lot of potential for the real estate sector to grow.

At Oberoi Realty, our vision is to build contemporary and

sustainable developments that will offer a better quality of life for

our customers. We are certain that our customer-centric

approach, strong corporate governance, and deep

understanding of consumer behaviour will only make us more

robust and resilient. Technology will play a pivotal role in

enhancing customer experience in the post-covid era and we are

well poised to adapt ourselves seamlessly. We believe success is

achieved by those who pursue perfection in every detail and never

settle for anything less than excellence.

Stay Positive, Stay Safe & Stay Healthy.

Best Wishes,

Vikas Oberoi

letter of allotment and when control of

the goods or services are transferred to the customer, at an amount that reflects the consideration (i.e.

the transaction price) to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or

services excluding any amount received on behalf of third party (such as indirect taxes). An asset created

by the Group’s performance does not have an alternate use and as per the terms of the contract, the

Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed till date. Hence the Group

transfers control of a good or service over time and, therefore, satisfies a performance obligation

and recognises revenue over time. The Group recognises revenue at the transaction price which is

determined on the basis of agreement or: letter of allotment entered into with the customer. The Group

recognises revenue for performance obligation satisfied over time only if it can reasonably measure its

progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. The Group would not be able

to reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation if it lacks

reliable information that would be required to apply an appropriate method of measuring progress.

In those circumstances, the Group recognises revenue only to the extent of cost incurred until it can

reasonably measure outcome of the performance obligation.

The Group uses cost based input method for measuring progress for performance obligation satisfied

over time. Under this method, the Group recognises revenue in proportion to the actual project cost

incurred (excluding land and finance cost) as against the total estimated project cost (excluding land

and finance cost).

The management reviews and revises its measure of progress periodically and are considered as

change in estimates and accordingly, the effect of such changes in estimates is recognised prospectively

in the period in which such changes are determined.

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the

customer. If the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer

pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration

that is conditional.

A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group

has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer

pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is

recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities

are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.
