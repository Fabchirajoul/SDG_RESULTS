Company Information

Stronger Together

We believe that these are some

of the most challenging times we

have seen.

Challenging times for our nation,

our economy, and our people.

It’s in this time, that we must

unite and find strength together

to protect the interests of all our

stakeholders and support those

around us.

And so, our objective will continue

to be to build safer homes in a

secure manner and create a world

that’s better for all.:

Dear shareholders,

I hope this message finds you and

your loved ones safe. The second

wave of Covid19 has taken a terrible

toll on our country, and our employees,

shareholders, and stakeholders have

all faced adversity in recent months. I’d

like to take this opportunity to convey

our deepest condolences to those who

have lost loved ones.

India is now emerging from the second

wave and we are cautiously optimistic

that the worst of the pandemic is

behind us. With vaccinations picking

up pace considerably, and with high

levels of previous infection also

providing protection, I’m hopeful

that any subsequent wave of the

pandemic will not be as devastating

as the second wave in April and May.

At Godrej, by the end of June, we

have administered the first dose of

vaccine to all our employees, as well

as to other stakeholders such as our

customers and construction workers at

our sites. As a Group, we have invested

approximately H 100 Crore to aid India’s

response to the pandemic and remain

fully committed to further investment

until we fully emerge from this crisis.

Despite the significant challenges the

pandemic posed to our operations in

FY 2020-21, your Company registered

several important accomplishments.

There were four different areas where

Godrej Properties ranked #1. The first

of these was that for the first time,

your Company was India’s largest

developer by the value and volume of

sales it achieved. The second was that

the Global Real Estate Sustainability

Benchmark (GRESB) ranked GPL as

the #1 global leader amongst listed

residential developers in terms of

its governance and sustainability

practices. The third was that your

Company was for the first time ranked

#1 in India amongst more than 10,000

developers in India by Track2Realty

in an exhaustive study comprising

of feedback from more than 10,000

participants in the sector. The fourth

was that our Qualified Institutional

Placement (QIP) in March ranked #1

ever by a real estate developer or REIT

in India in terms of the quantum of

capital it raised.

The first achievement of becoming

India’s largest real estate developer

by booking value was achieved by

delivering booking value growth of 14%

to H 6,725 Crore. This was achieved

through selling 10.8 Million sq. ft. of

area representing growth of 23% over

FY 2019-20. We sold 9,345 homes

at an average of over 25 homes per

day. Our team did a fantastic job of

meeting the challenges the pandemic

posed by pivoting fast to digital sales

tools including virtual site visits, an

online sales portal, and in-house data

analytics. We sold more than 1.5 Million

square feet with a booking value of over

H 1,300 Crore in each of our four focus

markets of MMR (Mumbai Metropolitan

Region), Pune, NCR (National Capital

Region) and Bangalore in FY 2020-21.

While we received a strong response

to our new launches and reported

launch sales of H 2,175 Crore, we are

particularly happy with our sustenance

sales that grew 46% to H 4,550 Crore

in FY 2020-21 and made up for the

delay in regulatory approvals at some

of the projects we had hoped to launch.

Strong sales ensured our best ever

gross residential collections at

H 4,389 Crore despite us losing nearly

a third of the year from a construction

perspective due to the lockdown and

subsequent construction labor exodus

in the first half of the financial year.

Being adjudged the #1 listed residential

developer in the world by GRESB is a

recognition the entire GPL team is very

proud of. Our purpose of bringing joy

to the lives of our customers rests not

only on providing high quality homes

for them, but also on the premise that

each Godrej Properties home has a

positive impact on the broader world

around us. We have over the past

decade insisted that all our projects are

third party certified green buildings and

have invested both in our operations

and through our corporate social

responsibility funds to ensure we

deliver a more sustainable future. We

are water positive and carbon neutral

for our Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions and

are working towards extending our ESG

mandate to cover our supply chain.

Similarly, we have placed significant

emphasis on governance standards

and world class practices in areas such

as construction safety.

Track2Realty has been conducting its

annual study that involves significant

research with over 10,000 participants

in the real estate sector in India

including customers, investors, media,

We sold 9,345 homes at an average of over 25

homes per day. Our team did a fantastic job of

meeting the challenges the pandemic posed

by pivoting fast to digital sales tools including

virtual site visits, an online sales portal, and in-

house data analytics.:

The Notice of AGM along with Annual Report for the

financial year 2020-21, is available on the website of the

Company at www.godrejproperties.com, on the website

of Stock Exchanges i.e. BSE Limited and National Stock:

Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer and Executive

Director respectively of the Company for a period of three

years commencing from April 01, 2015 by the Members at the

Annual General Meeting held on August 4, 2015. Subsequently,

the members, at the Annual General Meeting held on August 2,

2017 had ratified the change in their designation to Executive

Chairman and: Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer

respectively with effect from April 1, 2017 till March 31, 2018 and

the term of their appointment was further extended/modified

to March 31, 2021 as approved by the members at the Annual

General Meeting held on August 02, 2018 and through postal

ballot the results of which were declared on December 12, 2020.

The Board at its meetings held on February 4, 2021, subject to

the approval of members, had approved the re-appointment

of and remuneration payable to Mr. Pirojsha Godrej and

Mr. Mohit Malhotra as Whole Time Director designated as

Executive

Managing Director & Chief

Executive Officer for FY 2020-21, in case the Company has

inadequate profits during FY 2020-21, however the overall

remuneration for FY 2020-21 was capped at H 15 crore.

Pursuant to the said approval, Mr. Mohit Malhotra has received

H 7.18 crore as remuneration for FY 2020-21.

The Nomination & Remuneration Committee at its Meeting

held on November 03, 2017, had approved the Long Term

Incentive Plan which triggers incentive payouts to senior

employees, including to Mr. Mohit Malhotra, upon achieving the

thresholds as specified in the said plan. The first installment of

the incentive payout as per the plan shall be in FY 2022-23 and

the second installment shall be in FY 2023-24.

The management has achieved most of the thresholds as

specified in the said plan in FY 2020-21 and accordingly an

incentive provision of up to an additional amount of H 40

crore towards long term incentive is made in the managerial

remuneration of Mr. Mohit Malhotra for FY 2020-21, in

accordance with the applicable accounting standards, although

actual payment to Mr. Mohit Malhotra will be made in FY 2022-

23 (first instalment) and FY 2023-24 (second instalment) subject

to fulfillment of thresholds to be achieved in FY 2021-22 and FY

2022-23.

As per the Long term incentive plan, the above payment

depends on fulfilment of certain conditions during the plan

period from FY 2018 to FY 2022, as also on achieving certain

thresholds in FY 2022 and FY 2023. During the year, the

Company has attained the parameters for the plan period

of FY 2018 to FY 2021, however, the incentive payment is

dependent on the thresholds to be attained in FY 2022 and FY

2023 and in case these are not achieved the payment will not

be made. Nevertheless, based on assessment of thresholds

achieved and expected performance in the forthcoming years,

an additional provision of H 40 crore is made in the financial

statements of FY 2021, which is considered as the managerial

remuneration for the FY 2021. The actual payment will be

made in two tranches in FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24 subject

to fulfillment of thresholds to be achieved in FY 2021-22 and

FY 2022-23.

As a result, the long term incentive of up to H40 crore will be

computed, as an additional managerial remuneration of Mr.

Mohit Malhotra for the FY 2020-21. Accordingly, he will be

considered to have been paid excess remuneration to the tune

of H40 crore during FY 2020-21.

Since the approval granted by members on December

11, 2020 is capped at H 15 crore, it is necessary to obtain

approval of the Members by way of Special Resolution as

mentioned at Item no. 5 of the Notice for the waiver of excess

remuneration in the form of long term incentive payable to Mr.

Mohit Malhotra for FY 2020-21 which shall be paid to him in

financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24.

The Nomination & Remuneration Committee and Board

of Directors of the Company at their Meetings held on May

02, 2021 and May 03, 2021 respectively have inter alia

recommended for approval of the Members by means

of Special Resolution, the waiver of recovery of excess

remuneration by way of Long Term Incentive of up to an

additional amount of H 40 crore to Mr. Mohit Malhotra during

financial year 2020-21, in addition to the limit approved by the

Shareholders on December 11, 2020.
