Dear Shareholders,

I sincerely hope that you and your family

members have been safe during both

waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and

continue to follow all precautions and

safety guidelines.

Financial 2020-21 was the year of the

pandemic as it raged across the world

and the ensuing challenges had to

be faced by individuals, communities,

organisations, and countries. During a

large part of the year, we have been

witness to uncertainties, lockdowns and

exodus of the migrant population making

it an extremely challenging and difficult

year, especially for our industry.

Nevertheless, we continued to persist

and did what we do best – treat

challenges as opportunities. Given the

pandemic and the lockdowns, our first

and foremost concern was the safety

of our employees and people working

on the construction sites. We ensured

covid appropriate behaviour was strictly

adhered to in all our offices and sites

and urged people to follow it when at

home. Within a short time, we created

an entire eco-system to ensure that our

employees could work from their homes

during the intermittent lockdowns in the

first quarter of the financial year 2020-

21. At Brigade, we believe that our Core

Values have helped the organisation,

in both, good and difficult times, to

have come this far since our inception.

We will continue to strive to live by

our Core Values. We have ensured

that each employee lives the values of

QC-FIRST as we continue to work for

the betterment of the society and the

communities we work with, apart from

ensuring sustainability and growth.

During the year, we continued to fulfil

customers aspirations by offering them

best-in-class projects and launched

nine residential projects in Bengaluru,

Chennai, and Hyderabad and two

commercial projects in Bengaluru.

Holiday Inn Express & Suites at OMR,

Bengaluru with 129 keys started

operations during the year. Despite the

pandemic, we achieved an all-time high,

yearly real estate sales of 4.60 million

square feet with a total value of `2767

crores as compared to 4.30 million

square feet with a total value of `2377

crores. The sales value increased by

16%. Total collections during FY21 were

reported at `2712 crores compared

to `2538 crores during FY20, an

increase of 7%, despite the impact of

the pandemic. Brigade Group posted a

revenue of `2010 crores with Earnings

before Depreciation, Interest, Tax &

Amortization (EBITDA) margin of 26%

at `523 crores and a Net Loss after Tax

and Minority Interest of `46 crores for

the financial year 2020-21.

We have ensured that we become

a socially conscious company and

have been working unceasingly for

the betterment of the industry, our

customers, our communities, and the

planet.

Through the Brigade Foundation, we

have been able to give back to society

by focusing on three sectors namely

health, education, and community

development. We strongly believe that

in these times of difficulty, caring for the

underprivileged and the marginalised

should be a shared responsibility.

Every effort counts and we believe

that together we will be able to fight

the pandemic. Our endeavour is to go

beyond the present and promote and

sustain better healthcare and education

facilities and work towards the upliftment

of the community.

Looking forward, I see FY22 to remain

a challenging year due to the second

wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the

intermittent lockdowns in various cities.

And there are talks of the third wave as

well. Yes, it will be a challenging year

but that has never scared us – in fact, it

has brought the best out of each one at

Brigade. We will continue to do what we

do best – develop new projects, take

care of our employees and the people at

site, continue with our initiatives for the

community, society, and the planet.

We remain hopeful that with the

government’s plan to get the entire adult

population vaccinated in the coming

year, the business environment will

become more conducive for travel &

transactions, and we can relentlessly

focus on offering a better quality of life

to our customers and communities.

I take this opportunity to thank all

our stakeholders for their unstinted

and continued support and actively

contributing to the growth journey of

Brigade.

Thanking you,

underlying loans and advances are classified as good and recoverable in the standalone financial statements based on

ordinary course of business, including certain litigation for commercial development or land parcels held for construction

purposes, either through joint development arrangements or through outright purchases, the impact of which is not

quantifiable. These cases are pending with various courts and are scheduled for hearings. After considering the

circumstances and legal evaluation thereon, the management believes that these cases will not have an adverse effect
