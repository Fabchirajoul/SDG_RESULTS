| PURAVANKARA LIMITED:

Dear stakeholders,

It had been my honour and privilege to serve as

Puravankara’s Executive Director & Chairman of

the Board for the past 35 years. My journey with

Puravankara began 46 years ago when I birthed the

business with a small project in Mumbai. Even as a

fledgling enterprise, we always dreamed big, worked

hard and capitalised on opportunities. As our

business grew from strength to strength, the day we

got listed on the prestigious National and Bombay

stock exchanges in 2007 changed my life forever.

Having steered Puravankara for such a long time, I have seen

it weather the ups and downs of the business cycle, always

remaining steadfast and focused. We have faced economic

recessions and industry downturns, political upheaval, as well

as seasons of prosperity and success. We have learned to

evolve and adapt to meeting the market’s changing needs in all

this time, build endurance and longstanding market credibility

in real estate.

| PURAVANKARA LIMITED

14:

letter, the Board and the

management team of Puravankara pay

tribute to the unsung heroes of the

pandemic. To the healthcare workers

caring for Covid-19 patients and the

security forces helming containment

efforts of the disease in the country, we

thank you sincerely for all the efforts

you put in. The stress and risks you

undertake in combating this pandemic

have earned you our love and respect.

Our appreciation extends to

Puravankara’s stakeholders for their

continuous support. To our loyal

shareholders, we truly value your trust

and conviction in us over the years. Our

sincere gratitude to our staff, customers,

bankers and financiers, statutory bodies,

business associates and partners, all

of whom are essential components

of our ongoing success. My heartfelt

appreciation to my fellow Board of

Directors, whose dedication and wisdom

bestowed to the Company is invaluable.

I urge you to stay safe and get

vaccinated.

Best wishes,

RAVI PURAVANKARA

Dear stakeholders,

The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic was a

turbulent period. When stringent movement

restrictions were declared in late March 2020,

we had 15 projects in the construction stage

spread across 12.67 msft in 7 cities of the country.

While work had to be halted temporarily across

all our sites, we also had to close several show

galleries during this period. With the shutdowns

being unprecedented, it was natural to have more

questions than answers, more challenges than

solutions.

A major complexity that confronted us was managing our

site workforce. How do we adopt Covid-safe protocols

across labour camps? How do we keep them healthy, safe and

engaged? How do we ensure that our contractors treat their

staff with dignity and fairness? Locked in our homes, we begun

active discussions with our teams, exploring different ideas and

brainstorming solutions. Our longstanding business experience

and the quality of our people shone through, which eventually

helped us navigate the challenging times of the lockdown.

The safety of our workforce was at the heart of all our

decisions. We activated several key measures, including

providing food and accommodation to contract workers even

when construction activities were temporarily halted. We

switched to virtual meetings for our office staff and postponed

Company events to abide by physical distancing guidelines.

Furthermore, we encouraged our employees to sign-up for

online learning courses to enable them to make the best use

of the period. In addition to this, we staggered clock-in times

and lunchtime to prevent crowding. In terms of other standard

operating procedures, we implemented:

Digital temperature scanning at our offices and site premises

Social distancing measures in our offices, including in

elevators and around our construction sites; our large site

areas enabled social distancing

Provision of face masks and hand sanitisers

Higher frequency of routine cleaning and sanitisation of our

offices and site premises

I am moved by how Puravankara came together as one team,

unified and determined to ensure the safety of the entire

workforce and deliver superior services and innovative

products to our homebuyers. We recognised the potential

impact of the pandemic-led economic uncertainty on our

Provident Park Square, Bangalore

Meetings - Board of Directors

According to Section 173 of the Companies Act, 2013, four

Board Meetings are required to be held every year in such a

manner that not more than 120 days shall intervene between

two consecutive meetings.

However, the mandatory requirement of holding meetings of

the Board of Directors of the companies within the intervals

provided in section 173 of the Companies Act, 2013 (CA13)

(120 days) was extended by a period of 60 days for the first

two quarters of the year i.e., until 30th September 2020 by the

Ministry of Corporate Affairs vide General Circular 11/2020

released by them on March 24, 2020 in order to support and

enable Companies to focus on taking necessary measures to

address the unprecedented outbreak of the pandemic caused

by COVID-19. Accordingly, as a one-time relaxation the gap

between two consecutive meetings of the Board was extended

to 180 days for the first two quarters, instead of 120 days as

required in the Companies Act, 2013.

According to Regulation 17(2), the maximum time gap between

any two Board Meetings cannot be more than 120 days, which

has been complied with. Further, the quorum for the Board

Meeting is one-third (1/3rd) of the total strength (excluding

interested Directors, if any) or 3 Directors, whichever is higher,

including at least one independent director.

Meetings of the Board and its Committees are normally held at

the Corporate Office of the Company located at Bengaluru and

through other Audio Visual Means.
