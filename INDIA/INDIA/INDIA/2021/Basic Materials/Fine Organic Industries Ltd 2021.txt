Dear Shareholders,

the year 2020 was the one that tested

all assumptions: about how markets and

supply chains function in an age of global

interdependency; about what it means

to deliver for customers, employees and

communities truly; and about how companies

can and should operate in a crisis.

In such a challenging environment, we

have anchored ourselves to our purpose

and our values. Fundamentally, we believe

in enhancing our products in a safer,

responsible and sustainable way.

We focused on people, who worked tirelessly

through unprecedented circumstances

and ensured the uninterrupted delivery of

our products. the year 2020 was about

the countless ways we powered through

everything that came our way while taking

care of people, who depend on us.

It was an exceptional year, not just from

the Covid-19 standpoint; but also, from the

Company’s presence in the industry. While

we continued concentrating on our prime

focus – delivering on our commitments;– we

also completed 50 years of our existence.

We had always aspired to see this blissful

day and yet, this is only a part of the journey

we wish to cover. We have taken the right

strides in the right direction of innovation

driven by passion. this approach has helped

us create an extensive and potentially

one of the widest product portfolios for

various applications. even as we continue

strengthening our offerings, we will keep

exploring newer application base and

industries to venture.

Financial Highlights

During the fiscal year 2020-21, we saw a

year-on-year growth in revenue of 9.3%,

However profit Before tax and eBItDA was

declined by 28% and 18.6% respectively. our

operating margin is affected mainly due to

unprecedented and steep rise in prices of

all major vegetable oils which are our basic

Raw materials. the increase in domestic

prices is basically a reflection of international

prices. the rise in prices of vegetable oils are

attributable to many factors such as shifting

of demand from food basket to fuel basket,

increase in buying by China, labour issues

due to lockdowns in Indonesia and Malaysia,

Climatical impact on soya producing areas

and imposing of import duties on palm oil

in India etc. Despite these challenges, Your

Company is focused on maintaining the

growth momentum and delivering value.

operational Highlights

the year started on a low note with

pandemic-led lockdowns. the first two

quarters took a hit in overall demand due

to the temporary closure of economic

activities resulting in low sales. the

phased unlocking played its role in

uplifting the consumer spirit and boosting

their confidence. And thus, it revived the

demand across industries and helped in

gradually resuming the sales.

the pandemic impacted our expansion

plans; however, we could manage

to operationalise the first phase of

patalganga facility that caters to the

growing demand from food industry.

We have also formed Joint Venture

Company in thailand which will help

us in expanding our product basket

and further strengthening of our global

presence.

India’s Chemical Growth story

the production of sustainable, bio-

based chemicals has increased as

consumers have become well-versed

with the environmental and cost

benefits that oleochemicals can provide

over the other chemical classes with

numerous concerns. Although, in India,

the awareness and acceptance of

oleochemical-based green additives is

in preliminary state, it will promisingly

continue to grow over the years, driven

by an increasing shift from other harmful

chemistries to more benign and safe

chemistry. Green additives, being 100%

safe and plant-derived, are catching up

across diverse industries such as food

& beverages, feed nutrition, polymers,

cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, personal

care and coatings among others. We

continue to remain optimistic about the

global opportunities and are confident

of capturing the same with the help of

R&D expertise, in-house manufacturing

capabilities and well-nurtured customer

relationships. our sustainable business

operations and green approach

remarkably add to these trust factors

appealing the customers to consider us

as a preferred additive supplier.

environmental, Social, Governance

(eSG)

the year was one-of-its-kind; yet it

helped in establishing us as a Company of

commitments. As a responsible corporate

citizen, we have always had a sharp

focus on the eSG. We are convinced that

companies, which act responsibly and

create value for the society can be truly

successful in the long term. our products

and solutions help our customers meet

their sustainability goals and position

themselves for the future demanding the

relevant sustainable solutions.

our employees continued fulfilling

their duty diligently, and we ensured

to appreciate their hard work with no

salary cuts or reduction in the workforce.

We extended our health and insurance

policies, along with the financial

assistance, to build a sense of security

and belonging to the Fine organics

family. We earnestly recognise our role in

uplifting the lives of communities, which

we operate in and we will continue to do

so in the inspiring future times as well.

We understand our duty towards these

key parameters, which encompasse all

the tenets of our business.

Closing note

We are ready to enter our next phase of

growth with an innate sense of gratitude

for the ‘Fine’tastic 50 years we have had

so far. these past decades have taught

us that we can always achieve more

tomorrow than we can today through

consistent efforts and dedication to

improvement. last year was one such

year, when we were re-introduced to the

significance of resilience.

We faced the adversities head on and

proud to say that we, not just survived

but thrived based on the strength we

received from our core values and belief;

more importantly from the trust along

with the kind support of our stakeholders,

customers and associates.

We are grateful to our employees,

customers and other stakeholders, who

have enriched us, helped us to excel

and achieve more. together with their

undeterred support, we are confident

to take on the challenge of our future

journey focusing on areas that matter the

most.
