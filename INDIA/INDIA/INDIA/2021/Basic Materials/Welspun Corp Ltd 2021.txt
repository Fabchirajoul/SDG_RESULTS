Mr. K.H. Viswanathan -

Dear Shareholders,

I am writing to you at a time when the world, as

we know it, has been changing. In the beginning of

the financial year, reduced economic activity and

lockdowns had an impact on the demand and supply

in the energy markets. This was followed by a strong

recovery with improvement in business conditions,

strengthening demand and overall better market

conditions. The pace of business activity resumption

again took a knock due to the second wave of

COVID-19 seen across the world at different points of

time. However, stimulus programs and the vaccination

drives across countries is enabling a recovery.

India should also witness a recovery as increasing

number of people get inoculated with the vaccine.

At Welspun Corp, we demonstrated resilience and

rose to the challenges. We moved swiftly to respond

to the situation and took several steps to secure

the interests of all our stakeholders. Despite the

prevailing uncertainty, we had a strong order book

movement and resilient performance. We assessed

our inherent strengths, targeted opportunities for

change, identified smarter strategies and built strong

partnerships. We are continually converting our

challenges into opportunities through our robust

balance sheet, superior governance framework

and maximum asset utilization, and in the process,

capturing a high share of the overall opportunities.

Having built our business on sound fundamentals, it

gives us enough room to tackle the unprecedented

situation. Our strong financial position and

execution capability has enabled us, to explore and

fund new business opportunities like ductile iron

pipes to bring growth and consistency in financial

earnings. We continue to strengthen our business

through automation, digitization and developing

talent. We are confident of being able to pursue

our focus on the long term, while we address the

near-term challenges.

CoviD-19 anD our reSponSe

We have adopted several measures across our

organization to ensure that our commitment to

our stakeholders is not compromised. A robust

IT infrastructure has been put in place for remote

working to ensure business functions seamlessly from

any location. A Special task force team has been

formed across locations to support affected employees

and their family members. The highest standards of

hygiene and safety are being practiced by our staff

across all our locations. Additional measures have been

taken to ensure the well-being and create awareness

amongst our employees through Employee Connect

Drives. Various activities like Meditation with Family,

Wellness tips, COVID Myth Busters by eminent Doctors,

Counselors, Yoga practitioners, Nutritionists have

been organized. We have extended advance leaves

for COVID-affected employees who can avail them for

their hospitalization or home quarantine period.

Employees have also been given advances to meet

financial urgencies. Apart from the Group Term

Life Insurance plan, a formal policy has also been

announced to support employees who have lost their

lives during pandemic. This includes 50% monthly

salary for 2 years as living allowance, medical insurance

for family (Spouse and 2 children) of ` 5 Lakhs for

10 years, Education fees for 2 children till graduation

(Scholarship scheme). Additionally, we will consider

the spouse or children for suitable job roles based on

Company’s policy as per requisite qualification and skill.

While any kind of financial support cannot compensate

for the magnitude of the loss of life, we will always

remain with the families during these difficult times.:
