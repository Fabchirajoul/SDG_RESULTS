dear shareholders,

The year 2020-21 has been a

very challenging year for India as

a Country. Our overall economy

has degrown by 7.3% due to the

challenges caused by the COVID-19

pandemic. However, in this situation

the agriculture sector has shown an

impressive growth of 3.6% for the

year 2020-21. We are fortunate as a

Company to be largely operating in

this sector and this has helped us to

show an overall good performance

for the year 2020-21 despite the

prevailing

risks

and

challenges

posed by a devastating pandemic.

Against this backdrop of positive

growth, there are many challenges

facing the agricultural sector too.

India is a Country with the second

largest farm output. But, shrinking

farmland, rising population, shifting

food patterns and increased per

capita consumption of farm produce

are necessitating higher agricultural

yields. In addition, there is also a

growth in demand for better quality

and higher nutritional food products

due to shifts in food consumption

patterns.

Keeping pace with this growth in

demand and consumption pattern

requires a considerable shift from the

traditional ways of farming. Both the

State and the Central Government

have been proactively and rightfully

focusing on several policy measures

and implementation programs to boost

farm sector. Soil health card schemes,

consumption-based subsidies,

crop insurance, corpus for special

irrigation fund, more crop per drop

approach, sustainable ground water

management,

unified

agricultural

marketing e-platforms, Pradhan Mantri

Kisan Sammann Nidhi etc., are only a

few of the many interventions from our

Government to the agri community.

As a responsible Company operating

in the Agri-inputs sector, Coromandel

too has strived to play an active role

in bringing about adoption of modern

agronomic practices over the years.

Providing

effective

and

affordable

nutrition and crop protection solutions

to our farmers’ needs is critically

important. Coromandel is committed

to bring in the right products and

agri technologies to help the farmers

achieve the best possible yields. We

firmly believe that there is a tremendous

opportunity and an unsaid responsibility

for Coromandel to bring the best of

technological advancements from the

world of agri research to the doorsteps

of our Indian farmers.

some of the company’s activities to

fulfil the foresaid agenda include:

•

Ensuring seamless and efficient

supply

of

nutrient

and

crop

protection products and services

to

farmers

through

multiple

channels, including private trades,

Government institutions and MGC

stores.

•

Continued investment to strengthen

in-house R&D with an endeavour to

introduce differentiated products

like GroSmart, GroPlus, Gromor

Ultra, GroShakti etc. to help farmers

grow their yield.

•

Tie-ups with agri universities, IITs

and other agri agencies to pass

on benefits of new products and

farming practices to farmers.

•

Providing agri extension services

like soil Testing, satellite imagery,

crop advisory services.

•

Extending access for Government

welfare schemes like POSHAN

abhiyaan

(Prime

Minister’s

Overarching Scheme for Holistic

Nutrition).

•

Conducting

crop

and

farmer

specific

workshops

through

Gromor Nutri-clinics.

As a responsible Company committed

to preserving the soil health of the

nation, Coromandel will continue to

offer the best organic and biological

solutions in addition to the traditional

chemicals-based fertiliser and crop

protection solutions.

The

financials

of

Coromandel

continued its strong trajectory despite

a pandemic year. The EBITDA and

net profits for the Company clocked

impressive double-digit growth rates

of 17% and 25% respectively on top

of a 8% revenue growth as well. The

consolidated total income reached

`14,257

crores

during

the

year

2020-21. However, as we enter the

year 2021-22, we are witnessing

serious

challenges

in

terms

of

availability and prices of our key raw

materials. Although Government of

India has rendered timely help by

announcing a higher subsidy for the

phosphatic sector, the situation is

quite challenging.

Built over its 60 plus years of

existence, the strong fundamentals of

the Company will ensure Coromandel

will continue to perform well in the

future. However, there is a growing

need for the Company to embark on a

transformative journey to imbibe new

capabilities. The current leadership

team at Coromandel is fully cognizant

of this and is making a dedicated

effort to spend disproportionate time

and effort towards building an agile,

next-gen agriculture Company. I am

confident the output of these efforts

will manifest itself in the coming years

in the form of innovative new product

launches, geographical outreaches,

digital and technology adoption to the

Company’s manufacturing and supply

chain, enhanced customer service

models and fringe ecosystem plays.

Welcoming the new

members to coromandel

Board

I would like to welcome Mr. Arun

Alagappan and Mr. Ramesh K. B.

Menon who joined on the Board of

the Company during 2020-21. My

congratulations and best wishes to

Mr. Arun Alagappan on his subsequent

appointment as the Executive Vice

Chairman of the Company as well.

thank you all...

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I

would like to thank our customers,

shareholders,

banking

partners,

channel partners and the Government

for reposing faith in us and supporting

us throughout. I would like to whole

heartedly thank my colleagues across

factories and offices at Coromandel

for going above and beyond their call

of duty to support the business during

the pandemic. With your continued

support, I eagerly look forward to the

upcoming year.

a Vellayan

Chairman:

dear shareholders,

the year gone by: a spirited

performance despite the

challenges of a pandemic

The past year’s headlines were defined

by a pandemic that has altered the

economic, social and lifestyle aspects

of our nation. During these tough times,

the farming community stood together

and made it a successful year for Indian

agriculture. Despite the overall economy

de-growing by 7.3%, agriculture sector

grew by a commendable 3.6% during the

fiscal year 2020-21. It is with immense

pride that I say that Coromandel too

played its part by ensuring seamless

and efficient supply of nutrient and

crop protection products and services

to farmers through multiple channels,

including private trades, government

institutions and MGC stores.

coromandel has initiated a technology

and digital transformation journey along

with a refreshed approach to data analytics

and change the way the company extracts,

processes, consumes data in line with best-

in class practices.:

ManagIng dIRectOR’s

InteRactIVe Q&a

What have been the key factors that

enabled company’s growth during FY

2020-21?

Coromandel

had

a

phenomenal

FY 2020-21 despite the pandemic

related

disruptions.

Its

ability

to

swiftly transform its operations in an

uncertain business environment helped

in delivering a strong performance.

The Company was able to effectively

manage its operations with a dedicated

focus on employee well-being & safety,

and ensured the continuance of its

supply chain and operations by strictly

adhering to the safety protocols.

This included the formation of Crisis

Management

teams

and

SOPs,

scenario planning, swift management

communication and leveraging the

digital tools for seamless connectivity.

Our manufacturing units operated

safely for most part of the year. The

Company implemented smart sourcing

in a highly disrupted supply chain

and diversified its sources to improve

operational flexibility.

We

were

quick

to

adopt

digital

marketing to reach out to millions of

farmers and worked on direct delivery

model

through

our

retail

stores.

We were able to get the agriculture

scientists and the farmers connected

through the use of virtual platforms.

This has helped in acceptance of our

new product launches for the benefit

of the farming community. The brand

marketing has been more efficient and

impactful as we could be very selective

in reaching our target consumer base.

The new products introduced over the

past few years have been the growth

engines for some of the business

segments and we continue to invest

in building a strong product pipeline.

Our employees have been our greatest

strength and I thank them for rising to

the occasion for delivering a strong

performance to effectively overcome

the

health,

mobility

and

other

unprecedented challenges.

I would also like to compliment the

efforts of the Centre and various

State Government towards agriculture

and and agri inputs sector. The

Government’s inclusion of the sector in

the essential services category ensured

sustenance of farming operations.

(Membership No. 209354)

Date: 29 April 2021

UDIN: 21209354AAAAFO9734

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial

statements, our responsibility is to read the other

information and, in doing so, consider whether the other

information is materially inconsistent with the standalone

financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the

course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially

misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that

there is a material misstatement of this other information,

we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report

in this regard.

Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial

Statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the

matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to

the preparation of these standalone financial statements

that give a true and fair view of the financial position,

financial performance including other comprehensive

income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in

accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles

generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes

maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance

with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of

the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and

other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate

accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that

are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation

and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,

that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy

and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to

the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial

statement that give a true and fair view and are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In

preparing

the

standalone

financial

statements,

management is responsible for assessing the Company’s

ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as

applicable, matters related to going concern and using the

going concern basis of accounting unless management either

intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or

has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing

the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone

Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about

whether the standalone financial statements as a whole

are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud

or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our

opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,

but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance

with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it

exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are

considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they

could reasonably be expected to influence the economic

decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone

financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise

professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism

throughout the audit. We also:

•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement

of the standalone financial statements, whether due

to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures

responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence

that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis

for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material

misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for

one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,

forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or

the override of internal control.

•

Obtain an understanding of internal financial control

relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures

that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under

Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for

expressing our opinion on whether the Company has

adequate internal financial controls system in place and

the operating effectiveness of such controls.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies

used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates

and related disclosures made by the management.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use

of the going concern basis of accounting and, based

on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material

uncertainty exists related to events or conditions

that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s

ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude

that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to

draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related

disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if

such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence

obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,

future events or conditions may cause the Company to

cease to continue as a going concern.

•

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content

of the standalone financial statements, including the

disclosures, and whether the standalone financial

statements represent the underlying transactions and

events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the

standalone financial statements that, individually or in

aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of

a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial

statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative

materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of

our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and

(ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in

the standalone financial statements.:

Managing director during the year is in accordance with the requisite approvals mandated by the

provisions of Section 197 read with Schedule V to the Companies Act, 2013 and the remuneration paid/payable to the

whole-time director is subject to the approval of shareholders in the ensuing general meeting of the Company.

(xii) The Company is not a Nidhi Company and hence reporting under clause (xii) of the Order is not applicable.

(xiii) In our opinion and according to the information and explanations given to us the Company is in compliance with Section

177 and 188 of the Companies Act, 2013, where applicable, for all transactions with the related parties and the details

of related party transactions have been disclosed in the financial statements as required by the applicable accounting

standards.

(xiv) During the year the Company has not made any preferential allotment or private placement of shares or fully or partly

convertible debentures and hence reporting under clause (xiv) of the Order is not applicable to the Company.

(xv) In our opinion and according to the information and explanations given to us, during the year the Company has not entered

into any non-cash transactions with its directors or directors of its holding, subsidiary, or associate Company or persons

connected with them and hence provisions of section 192 of the Companies Act, 2013 are not applicable.

The executive leadership team reviews the results of our

operations and our financial position on consolidated,

operating segment and business unit levels. Our

operating segments are defined by the organisation

and reporting structure through which we operate our

business. We categorise our operating segments into

Nutrient and other allied business, and Crop Protection.

The Company has 17 manufacturing facilities located

across India. The Company also operates a network

of retail outlets across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana,

Karnataka and Maharashtra. The Company’s products

are marketed all over the Country through an extensive

network of dealers and its own retail centers. The crop

protection products are exported to various countries.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

2.1 Statement of compliance

The financial statements which comprise the Balance

Sheet, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other

Comprehensive Income), the Cash Flow Statement,

and the Statement of Changes in Equity (“financial

statements”) have been prepared in accordance with

Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under

the Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”),

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015,

along with relevant amendment rules issued thereafter

and other relevant provisions of the Act, as applicable.

The Company has consistently applied accounting

policies to all periods.

2.2 Basis of preparation and presentation

The financial statements have been prepared on

the historical cost basis except for certain financial

instruments that are measured at fair values at the end

of each reporting period, and on accrual basis

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the

consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset

or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between

market participants at the measurement date, regardless of

whether that price is directly observable or estimated using

another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of

an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the

characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants

would take those characteristics into account when pricing

the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for

measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial

statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-

based payment transactions that are within the scope of Ind

AS 102, leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind

AS 116, and measurements that have some similarities to

fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in

Ind AS 2 or value in use in Ind AS 36.
