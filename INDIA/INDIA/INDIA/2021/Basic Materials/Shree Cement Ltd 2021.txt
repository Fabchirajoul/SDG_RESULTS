Managing Director’s Perspective

A Q&A Session with the Joint: Managing

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S PERSPECTIVE

A Culture of Fostering

Hard Work

Having the ability and having results are actually two different things.

Having the requisite talent is basic. For achieving results, one must

put in efforts.

A perennial question that people keep seeking

an answer to is whether sustainable success is an

interplay of various factors of fate, luck, talent and

hard work. Our ancestors, in their continual pursuit

of enlightenment, generated unlimited knowledge.

This ancient knowledge bank, compiled and

disseminated in the form of shlokas, contains key to

guide us in our innumerable quests in life. One such

compilation, Hitopadesha, provides an answer to

the above query as contained in following Shloka:

CÚ_oZ {h {gÜ`pÝV H$m`m©{U Z _ZmoaW¡… &

Z {h gwßVñ` qghñ` à{depÝV _wIo _¥Jm… &&

Work gets accomplished by effort and industry, not

merely by wishing. The animals don’t enter a sleeping

lion’s mouth.

Emphasis here is clearly on making efforts to achieve

results. A lion is born with a natural ability to hunt. Is

that enough for it to survive? No. To actually feed itself,

the lion has to go into the forest and do the hard grind.

No amount of inborn ability, even of the king of jungle,

can substitute the efforts.

Having the ability and having results are actually two

different things. Having the requisite talent is basic.

For achieving results, one must put in efforts. Ordinary

efforts will bring ordinary results. Hard work on a

sustained basis produces success which is durable and

takes one to greater heights. Thus, it is only continuous

toiling with the same level of commitment on an

ongoing basis that brings sustainable success. Below

quote from Bhagwat Gita aptly describes the

importance of consistent hard work -

Xþb©^mÝ`{n H$m`m©{U {gÚpÝV àmoÚ_oZ {h&

{ebm{n VZwVm§ `m{V ànmVoZmU©gmo _whþ…&&

Impossible things can be accomplished with efforts. Like a

hard rock gets thinner with repeated fall of water.

Sportsmen like Sachin Tendulkar or Vishwanathan

Anand have achieved amazing success in their

sporting endeavour. It is very tempting to consider

them ‘naturally gifted and talented’. No doubt they

had enormous ability or talent. But what made them

great was their years of dedication and commitment

towards their goal. What comes across as their talent

is actually years of hard work. In fact, they had many

contemporaries who were equally or more talented

than them. But what made them stand out was their

consistent hard work to improve their skills, no matter

what the outcomes were.

Thus, what is more important is continuity of

effort to sustain the positive outcomes. This can be

explained arithmetically in the form of an equation

where Result = Talent x [Hard Work]. Hard work has a

domino effect. As the value of hard work expands, it

also expands the value of talent thereby amplifying the

figure on the LHS of above equation.

Some people achieve initial success, as in the case of

lower hanging fruits. It, however, soon brings with it

the temptation to get carried away and succumb to the

lure of resting on achievements. Sustainable success

accrues to those who get the complete equation right

12 | Annual Report 2020-21

i.e. those who continue their run and don’t stop. In the

long-term, success is more dependent on the disciplined

hard grind with perseverance. With similar talent, those

who work hard are the one who triumph against all

impediments. It means to say that if talent does not

work hard, hard work beats talent.

At Shree, we have strived hard to create a work

environment seeped in continually seeking action.

Focus of the team is on regular betterment of

existing practices. People are encouraged to look

for opportunities in anything they do and to work

as hard as they can. Talent is merely considered as

allowing entry to an individual to the club of continual

improvement. This is because in business, Status

Quo is unsustainable. Change, fast or slow, is always

happening in the external environment. Failing to take

action to guard against it is costly. The only way is to

keep sharpening your axe continually.

If one considers himself as owner, then instead

of considering his daily activity as mundane and

monotonous, he would relish the challenge of making

it interesting by finding ways to improve on the same.

Every such single innovation or improved daily practice

contributes to the overall growth of the organisation,

albeit through the same mundane task. When one is

sure of the target and puts his efforts into action, every

task becomes another arrow towards the target rather

than a monotonous activity.

We have been growing at a brisk pace setting footprints

in newer markets, embracing newer technologies and

reaching newer horizons. As we expand our sphere of

working, each attempt brings with it hitherto unseen

challenges in terms of customers, environment, people

and resources. We are prepared as we are practicing

daily. Each one of our team, when he goes out to work,

he is not merely doing his daily task, he is taking the

small step towards the giant leap.

At Shree, we realise the importance of getting the entire

equation right. Each and every member is inclined

towards harnessing abilities as a daily routine to keep

ticking the equation to a value, higher than yesterday. In

fact, they work towards converting the equation where

Hard work remains the only Talent we have!!

H. M. Bangur

Work gets accomplished

by effort and industry,

not merely by wishing.

The animals don’t enter a

sleeping lion’s mouth.

Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard | 13:

MANAGING DIRECTOR

You have been growing consistently. What is the

secret behind your success? Is it that you have

more talent than others?

The world was faced with unprecedented

disruption during 2020-21. How did it

impact Shree Cement?

Colin Powell, American politician and General,

described secret of success as ‘There are no secrets

to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work,

and learning from failure’. And this is what our

culture is all about.

We have an open, a ‘secret-less’ culture where

everyone’s view aimed at improving any existing

process or practice is encouraged and empowered.

Our talent lies in scouting for little improvements

in everything we do. We have always measured

growth in terms of improving upon the existing.

We keep our benchmarks significantly higher

which requires continual pushing yourself to the

maximum. Thus, even if we fail to achieve the target,

we are substantially better than where we were

earlier. This requires a culture of ownership in the

team which becomes self-sustaining when you give

people freedom and allow mistakes in the pursuit

of continual improvement. The team then builds

up new capabilities and remains motivated to keep

delivering, every day, with hard work and dedication.

What is important is that we keep learning, even in

failures, to optimise the approach next time.

?

The pandemic disrupted economy and lives globally

and we were not an exception to it. However, after

unlocking began, the economy witnessed a gradual

recovery with ease of restrictions and opening up

of various sectors. There was a substantial demand

surge in the second half of the year from the rural

regions. Additionally, increased prevalence of work-

from-home in semi-urban regions led to enhanced

demand for real estate space. Higher government

spending also contributed to demand recovery

from infrastructure segment.

How are you reducing your

environment footprint?

?

?

?

How are you continuously de-risking yourself

from the vagaries of the market while continuing

your growth?

In business, risk is unavoidable and what one needs is

to remain prepared to respond effectively. An airplane

is always at risk while flying, but it is of no use staying

on the ground. The biggest risk for an organisation is

staying content within their set boundaries or to grow

with excessive leverage. At Shree, our approach has

been to grow sensibly.

We consolidate our market presence in a geography

and then expand in newer markets. After establishing

a strong presence in the northern market, we

moved to the eastern market in 2014, and have been

continuously consolidating our presence there. In

2018, we moved to southern markets by establishing

3 MTPA integrated unit in Karnataka. De-risking is also

present at operational level. Even in high growth, we

have remained flexible in our practices. We have built

our systems to ensure that our product delivery can

cater to the largest as well as smallest customers with

equal efficiency, our plants can run on multiple fuels

and ramp up or ramp down as per requirement, and

our people have access to all levels of management at

all times. Strong focus on cost optimisation through

sustainable practices, processes and resource

efficiency have helped us insulate ourselves to market

vagaries to a great extent. Innovation is our key

differentiator and as an organisation we encourage

exploring newer ideas every day. This helps us stay

ahead of our competitors in the market and achieve

newer benchmarks.

Our innovation has far reaching impact on the way

we take care of our environment. We have taken

a number of innovative initiatives as a result of

which our emission levels are one of the lowest and

comparable with the best in the industry globally.

Our WHR based power generation capacity is largest

in world outside of China. We are steadily adding

solar and wind energy plants to raise our green

energy portfolio. In fact, I take pride in saying that

our share of green energy, which is 48% of our total

power consumption, is the highest in the industry.

We produce synthetic gypsum to conserve natural

gypsum using patented process. From continuously

increasing share of green energy, to usage of

alternative raw material, implementing energy

efficiency measures and optimal use of natural

resources, our sustainability interventions have been

an integral part of our growth story and have become

a guiding light for sustainable future.

How do you plan to grow in the

coming years?

Our capacity and volume have grown at double digit

CAGR over last two decades. We expect to continue

this momentum and look forward to take our next

leap of growth to achieve 80 MTPA capacity by

2030. In this process, we continue to explore newer

geographies across the country and adopt both

organic and inorganic ways.

We are mindful of fulfilling the aspirations of all

our stakeholders and directing all our energies to

realise the goals. There is no dearth of talent in our

team and nor will be in our hard work. I have all the

reasons to be optimistic and creating greater value

for our stakeholders.

Prashant Bangur

It was important for us to remain prepared. Our

deep-rooted presence and dealer network, continuous

focus on cost optimisation and product servicing

capability placed us in perfect position to capitalise on

the demand surge and helped us recover much faster

than our peers. In statistical terms, we reported 35.4%

growth in the revenue and 30.4% growth in EBIDTA

during the second half of the FY 2020-21 compared

to first half of the year, leading to our overall annual

revenue growth of 5.7% and EBIDTA growth of 11.8%

vis-à-vis previous year.
