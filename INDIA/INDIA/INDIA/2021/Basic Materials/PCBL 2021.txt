Dear shareholders,

These are testing times and

we need to stay strong and

resilient until the impact

of the pandemic gradually

tapers off.

to `350.84 crores and `283.49 crores in FY20,

respectively.

In spite of overwhelming business challenges,

our esteemed Board has declared an interim

dividend of `120.64 crores (@350% i.e., `7 per

equity share of `2 each) on 20th January, 2021

for the financial year ended 31st March, 2021

and was paid during the same quarter.

Against the backdrop of a challenging macro

environment, bulk orders were cancelled, and the

entire industry was severely impacted. Besides,

various tyre and rubber manufacturing plants

worldwide had to be shut down, as the pandemic

raged on. Similarly, the automotive industry’s

nascent recovery at the beginning of FY21 was

derailed due to tepid consumer sentiment and

disrupted supply channels.

However, towards the second half of the year

under review, the scenario improved significantly.

Manufacturing plants started opening up in

a phased manner and consumer sentiment

improved which helped create new opportunities

across the value chain.

Besides, our very own cost rationalisation

initiatives, growing share of value-added

products and specialty blacks through research

and innovation and improved efficiency across

all functions were supported by a resurgent

automotive market. These facilitated our

comeback journey.

We undertook people-centric initiatives to

ensure the safety of our entire team and

slowly, but steadily, resumed production in all

our manufacturing facilities, maintaining the

guidelines set by the Government.

Once the ground reality was under control,

our operation resumed seamlessly, and the

Greenfield and Brownfield projects were fast-

tracked. In a bid to widen and strengthen our

footprint and to ensure continued service to our

international customers, our teams were active

in our key international markets such as Japan,

Korea, Vietnam, China, and Europe,

among others.

During the year, we also took initiatives to further

deleverage our balance sheet, and constantly

monitored our liquidity position. Our priority was

to protect our business and safeguard

our stakeholders.

We have always placed great emphasis on

research and innovation and have invested

extensively in this regard. Our state-of-the-art

Sushila Goenka Research & Development Centre

in Asia and Sushila Goenka Innovation Centre

in Europe, have emerged as the seeding ground

for product and process innovation, coupled with

increased efficiencies in all our manufacturing

units.

We have embedded sustainability as a part of

our broad strategic pillars and place emphasis

on sharpening our Environment, Social and

Governance (ESG) focus. Guided by our Board

of Directors, we are working relentlessly on

these strategic pillars and implementation of

our sustainability policy. Ensuring the highest

standards of corporate governance is our priority.

We have received the Corporate Governance

rating of CGR2+, reflecting our strong

commitment to good governance. We have also

put in place targets that are a testimony of our

continued commitment to sustainability. As we

move through the new normal, our focus on

sustainability and ESG remain strongest to

the core.

While India battles the second wave of the

virus, we, as a responsible corporate citizen,

are committed to support our employees,

business partners and communities. Our social

responsibility goes beyond statutory obligations,

it is embedded in our corporate culture. We have

initiated several measures to help citizens in this

nationwide crisis.

I thank you all for your faith and continued

support in PCBL.

Let us put up our best efforts to combat the

crisis together.

Yours sincerely,

Dr. Sanjiv Goenka

Chairman

It is imperative for us to realise that the COVID

induced pandemic is the greatest human tragedy

in modern history, apart from the economic

impact of it. Loss of lives as well as livelihood in

the wake of the pandemic are the key challenges

that the world is facing today. This is the moment

for all of humanity to come together and face

this adversity with our cumulative spirit and

resilience. Empathy, fortitude and optimism is

what the world needs right now.

The grit, determination and agility demonstrated

by Team PCBL deserves to be lauded.

Considering the constraints in the business

environment, the team worked relentlessly to

report a spirited performance.

Despite a 18% decline in revenue, from

`3,243.54 crores in FY20 to `2,659.52 crores

in FY21, PCBL reported a PBT and PAT of

`390.36 crores and `312.27 crores, compared:

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S PERSPECTIVE

Comeback from

setback by being resilient

Let me take this opportunity to share a snapshot of

our journey in FY 2020–21. At PCBL, operations

were in full swing, with the Greenfield project at

Chennai in the process of being set-up. Further,

human capital was getting deployed in key

international markets such as Japan, Korea,

Vietnam, China, Europe, etc. to strengthen the

foothold. The Sushila Goenka Innovation Centre in

Belgium was just inaugurated, which was emerging

as the seeding ground of product and process

innovation. Additionally, the capacity expansion

initiative at Palej, our Brownfield Project, was also

being configured and getting prepped-up for

roll-out.

At this juncture, the catastrophe of coronavirus

engulfed the entire world, propelling the global

economy into a downward spiral. Operations

came to a screeching halt at PCBL, with all the

plants discontinuing production due to lockdown.

This was followed by mass cancellation of orders

by customers. The resultant business effect was

insignificant sales in Q1 FY 2020-21 with a meagre

PBT of `2 crores.

Our immediate realisation was that this pandemic

more of a human catastrophe than an economic

one, affecting the health and livelihood of millions

all over the globe. The first priority was the safety

and well-being of our people. We adopted all the

necessary measures and initiatives to ensure

that the pandemic was faced with a mix of

agility, preparedness, caution, and safeguards.

Taskforces were formed to create a holistic plan

that maximised employee safety on one hand

and facilitated the company’s business on the

other. An online COVID dashboard was developed,

which was a database of all the details of the

COVID-19 prevention checksheets from all our

locations. We launched our ‘connecting with people’

initiative during the pandemic. Me, as well as the

senior leadership team engaged regularly with

the employees on virtual platforms, focusing on

employee well-being, discussions around business

realities and the company’s prospects.

After setting the house in order, we embarked upon

the comeback journey. At the core of the response

was 4 step methodology comprising four ‘R’s.

1. Resolve: The first step of bouncing back was

accepting the reality and having the belief and

confidence that the organisation can overcome

this setback.

2. Resilience: The organisation demonstrated

stoic resilience in the face of adversity and the

business objective was to ensure that cash flow

was maintained, and costs were optimised. Agility

and nimble footedness ensured that we were

prepared to immediately resume operations when

opportunity arrived, paving the way for a

speedy recovery.

3. Return: The results of the implementations

started to reflect in Q3 FY 2020-21 as the

profitability saw a significant upward curve from

`2 crores in Q1 to `125 crores in Q3, the

organisation’s highest ever PAT in its 60 years’

history. The momentum was carried forward in

Q4 as PCBL raised the benchmark of PAT to

`127 crores.

4. Re-imagine: With the growth journey re-

energised, we continued the pursuit of our vision to

be a Global player by factoring in our key learnings

from the battle with the pandemic while chartering

the way ahead.

Difficult times are the best teachers. The pandemic

has taught the world gratitude, adoptability,

adaptability, and a lot of other lessons for life. In

the carbon black category, customers are looking

at a China + 1 strategy, creating an opportunity for

us to step up and take up that available position.

Another realisation that dawned upon us was

the need of a business continuity plan in case of

an unforeseen and Force Majeure incident, and

we are already in the process of formulating the

same. Additionally, the myths around the need of

physical presence to facilitate work was shattered,

paving the way for a possible hybrid work culture

in the future. Further, the importance of being

updated on the digital infrastructure front was also

highlighted in the remote-working times. We also

understood the need of accelerating our adoption

of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. This

will be primarily reflected at our upcoming plant

in Chennai, which will be at par with Industry 4.0

standards.

We have always been a socially conscious company

and it is reflected through our ESG focus and

sustainability initiatives. We are constantly in the

process of reducing our emissions, waste and

water consumption levels, which would lead to a

significant reduction in our carbon footprint. Also,

as a responsible corporate, we stepped up to do our

bit in the country’s battle against the coronavirus

through various interventions in different

geographies.

The battle against the once-in-a-century crisis is far

from over. However, there is an overarching feeling

of resilience and optimism. The journey to become

a trusted Global player, providing cutting-edge

solutions to our Partners and an exciting workplace

to our People continues, fueled by zeal, enthusiasm

and determination.

Message from the Chairman

Message from the: Managing Director

Touching lives in

myriad ways

Value creation at every step

Dear Stakeholders,

We are pleased to share with you our

FY 2020-21 Sustainability Report.

Similar to our inaugural edition in 2018,

this report contains updates on our

sustainability journey as we strive towards

meeting our environmental, social and

governance objectives. The report is in

accordance with the Global Reporting

Initiative (GRI) Standards and aligned

with the UN Sustainable Development

Goals (SDGs).

Guided by our ESG priorities, I am delighted

to report that we have made significant

progress in fulfilling both internal and

external stakeholder commitments.

We focused on maximising stakeholder

value with sharper focus on research and

innovation. Over the years, we expanded

our offerings, addressing the emerging and

widening requirements of our customers.

Our expansive portfolio made it possible

to moderate the risk quotient, so that no

singular grade or product accounted for

a disproportionately large share of our

revenues in the long-term. Our globally

acclaimed Sushila Goenka R&D Centre in

Palej, India, and Sushila Goenka Innovation

Centre in Ghislenghien, Belgium, contribute

to developing a diversified product

mix, with a strong focus on new and

customised carbon black grades, through an

amalgamation of fundamental research and

market driven application research, which

will further drive our revenue momentum.

We have invested in developing a low

carbon green power plant in Palej, for which

we are the first carbon black company

in the world to receive carbon credits.

This was a conscious effort to utilise waste

heat and reduce energy consumption for

the plant. In continuation, we have also

set up green power plants at each of our

factories to prudently utilise the waste heat

from the manufacturing process.

We retain a relentless focus on creating a

safe and exciting workplace for our people.

We are committed to building capability,

upskilling our people and grooming them

for future challenges. This commitment

As a part of the global

chemical industry, we are

a rapidly growing carbon

black manufacturer,

with a presence in

45+ countries serviced

through six offices

outside India. As the

largest exporter from

India, we are focused on

creating value through

customer-specific

solutions, innovative

products, and a prudent

balance between growth

and sustainability.

Our approach to

sustainability rests on the

pillars of environmental

preservation, employee

satisfaction and safety,

diversity and inclusion,

and community

commitment. We are

the first carbon black

company in the world to

receive carbon credits.

We have set up green

power plants at each of

our factories to prudently

utilise the waste heat

from the manufacturing

process.

is backed by our consistent investment in

equipment, infrastructure, training, and

processes.

Throughout our supply chain operations,

we hold constructive dialogue with our

partners across the spectrum to improve

decision-making and the accountability of

our partnerships.

In all that we do, environment stewardship

continues to be a core focus area for us.

We are consistently adopting initiatives

which heighten energy efficiency, reduce

emissions, decrease water consumption and

minimise waste.

This year, we have conducted a carbon

footprint accounting across all our

manufacturing plants and offices.

The GHG emissions covered by the report

includes both direct and indirect emissions

generated by our business. The GHG

mapping and quantification will help us to

formulate a viable action plan to further

reduce our footprint and steadily achieve

carbon neutrality in the future.

To combat the coronavirus pandemic,

we contributed to the PM CARES Fund

and responded with several initiatives to

ensure the health and safety of all our

stakeholders. We continued our community

endeavours across locations we operate in,

with consistent focus.

We have embedded good governance

practices at the heart of our sustainability

journey. It is our responsibility to create

long-term value for shareholders by

balancing the myriad interests of all

stakeholders we work with.

Mitigation strategy

Economic risk

Prolonged slowdown in the global and

Indian economy may adversely impact our

business prospects.

Likelihood of occurrence: Medium

• Our senior leadership team maps emerging trends, changes in regulations and economic

environment to course-correct business strategies

• Impact assessment studies are conducted, whenever considered necessary

Country risk

Risks associated with investment in any country

arising out of uncertainty in political, economic,

exchange rate or technological investments which

could result in losses.

Likelihood of occurrence: Low

• We evaluate country risk ratings by accredited agencies

• We conduct detailed study on the economic, political, social and structural factors

prevailing in the country

• There are detailed discussions and deliberations in the senior leadership team and Board

of Directors

Investment risk

Timely completion of projects and ensuring

projects do not overshoot the budget capex that

may impact cash flow or increase debt burden.

Likelihood of occurrence: Low

• We undertake detailed project planning and feasibility study before initiating a project

• We organise frequent review meetings on the update of such projects and schedule the key

events properly to streamline the projects

• We hire trained people to oversee the project; and leverage cutting-edge technologies to

ensure timely deliveries

Supply chain risk

Disruption in supply of materials from the major

suppliers would adversely affect operations.

Further, volatility in crude prices may affect

both raw material prices and end product prices,

impacting profitability.

Likelihood of occurrence: Low

• We maintain strong and enduring relationship with our suppliers and maintain alternative

sources in case of exigencies

• The senior management develops the weekly production plan and maintenance of a

reasonable stock of Class A materials, to mitigate the risk

• We offset the raw material price escalation by increasing non-contract sales price and

undertaking specific cost-reduction initiatives

• A significant portion of our volume is sold based on formula driven price adjustment

mechanism, which allows for recovery of the changed raw material cost from customers

Downstream risk

Any slowdown in downstream industries may

jeopardise the Company’s growth.

Likelihood of occurrence: Medium

• We mitigate the risk by diversifying our product portfolio, ensuring a widespread

geographic footprint and a large customer base

Rate risk

Sale of power also contributes a significant

proportion to our total revenues; and any

change in power tariff may affect our

profitability as well.

Likelihood of occurrence: Low

• We foster strategic bilateral power purchase agreements for short, medium and long-term

Competition risk

Competition from industry peers pose a threat to

our market share and profitability.

Likelihood of occurrence: Low

• Customer feedback and review meetings help us ensure their satisfaction

• We are strengthening market intelligence and product differentiation
