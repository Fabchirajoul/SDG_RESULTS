The performance was visible

across two levels – revenues

increased 11% in FY 2020-21 over

the previous financial year and

the Company reported profitable

growth as operating EBITDA

increased 19% . This indicates

that the Company’s business

model was not only protected but

actually strengthened during the

last financial year. The Company

reported a 132 bps improvement

in EBITDA margin to a record

27% in FY 2020-21; the Company

belonged to the top 2 percentile

of its sectorial margins the world

over by the close of

FY 2020-21.

The Company’s performance

product mix. The confluence of

these factors helped drive top

line growth as well as margin

expansion.
