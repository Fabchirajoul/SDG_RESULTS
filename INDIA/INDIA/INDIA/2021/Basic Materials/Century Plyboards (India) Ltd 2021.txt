CENTURY PLYBOARDS (INDIA) LIMITED

ANNUAL REPORT 2020-21 05:

Managing Director: Dear shareholders

I normally write a detailed analysis of

Century Plyboards’ performance in the

previous financial year.

This year I will make it brief.

I will communicate what is uppermost

in my mind – and perhaps the most

important communication point.

I am going to write about the spirit of our

Company.

In 1996, the Company faced its most

serious crisis when the Supreme Court

banned the felling of trees for plywood

manufacture across North East India.

Most hinted that perhaps the Company’s

business would be discontinued. The

management at Century responded with

agility; it coordinated access from other

points of supply and reported its best-

ever performance (revenues and profits)

within a year.

Never was this spirit more tested than

during 2020 when we never knew

whether the consumption markets would

be closed for one week, one months or

six months following the imposition of the

lockdown.

The team at Century Plyboards could

have gone into hibernation and waited

for the markets to reopen. Interestingly,

it was during this lockdown period that I

perceived a new face of our Company.

A company that continued to trust the

deep Indian consumption potential.

A company that continued to believe

that people would wish to live in better

homes.

A company that was convinced that all

economic blockers would be temporary.

Across various levels of the Company

– connected with each other through

remote video conference – one could

notice a certain restlessness. This

is a precise word that I have used –

‘restlessness’. Our people were impatient;

they needed to displace the status quo;

they needed to be the first into the open

(when permitted by the government).

The result is that our manufacturing

plants were possibly the first to reopen

within the country’s interior infrastructure

sector. This was just the opening we

needed. From that point onwards,

various Century teams pitched in: we

manufactured more, we marketed

quicker, we realised higher, we moderated

costs, we launched more effectively, we

generated better margins and we finished

the year with more cash on our books

than at any time in our existence.

What I want to assure shareholders is

that this is not just an instance of a rise in

the level of the water raising the level of

all ships. This is an outperformance that

could be the beginning of a new phase in

our existence.

During this phase, we expect to replicate

the growth that we achieved in the last

couple of decades in only the next few

years.

Our best is round the corner.
