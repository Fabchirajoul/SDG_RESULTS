As a lessee

Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a

corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset

is available for use by the Company. Contracts may contain

both lease and non-lease components. The Company

allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and

non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone

prices. However, for leases of real estate for which the

Company is a lessee, it has elected not to separate lease

and non-lease components and instead accounts for these

as a single lease component.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially

measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include

the net present value of the following lease payments:

a.

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments),

less any lease incentives receivable
