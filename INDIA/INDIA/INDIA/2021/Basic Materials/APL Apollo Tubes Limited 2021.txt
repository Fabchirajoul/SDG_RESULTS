12 | Integrated Annual Report 2020-21:

Dear Shareholders,

I

t is with great joy and satisfaction

that I ink this statement. My

happiness stems from our satisfying

all-round performance. It could not

have been better given the trying

circumstances in which we operated

for the first half of the year.

Akin to India Inc., we entered FY21

with considerable uncertainty

owing to the nation-wide lockdown.

The business world had come to a

standstill.

We paused too. But only for

21 days.

History proves that adversity has

always been a great teacher. It

brings out the best. At APL Apollo, it

unleashed the animal spirits to not

relent to the fear set in by an invisible

micro-organism.

With the first ray of unlocking, we

started plant and business operations.

We gained the all-important edge,

even when others in our business

space were grappling with the How’s,

Why’s, When’s, What’s etc…

We started with a

difference.

Difference in our approach. Difference

in our attitude. Difference in our

product mix. Difference in our market

focus. Difference in our sales terms.

And these bold strategic initiatives

made all the difference.

Our sales of value-added products

increased. Our presence in rural

markets intensified. Our business

liquidity multiplied. More importantly,

business profitability leapfrogged.

What is very satisfying is that our

ROCE (Return on Capital Employed)

was 26.5% despite a near wash out of

sales in the first quarter of this fiscal.

This, incidentally, also happens to be

one of the highest returns reported

by any player in the building products

space.

From the helm

“We will bring in the

power of creativity to

find newer ways to

grow. And then seize

these opportunities

with disciplined

determination.”

secured by: letter of credit, bank guarantee, post dated cheques, etc.

In case of sale to dealers certain credit period is allowed. In order to mitigate credit risk, majority of the sales made to dealers are
