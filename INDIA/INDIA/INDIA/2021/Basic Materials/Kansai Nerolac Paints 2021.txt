CORPORATE OVERVIEW

KANSAI NEROLAC PAINTS LIMITED:

Dear Shareholders,

It is with great pleasure that I present to you our

101st Annual Report.

As we turned 100, we encountered one of the toughest

years in our history. Despite the crisis situation arising out of

the pandemic, it is important to note that your Company has

performed well on all fronts.

We accorded the highest priority to human life and safety

of all our employees as well as our various stakeholders

like vendors, customers, dealers and painters as it worked

to meet the challenges and opportunities of the pandemic.

100-YEAR LANDMARK

On 2nd September 2020, Kansai Nerolac Paints Limited

(KNPL) marked the historic completion of a century in India.

At every step of this 100-year journey, we have adapted

and transformed, but what has always remained constant

is our focus on care and innovation directed at protecting,

inspiring and touching lives every day. Our Core Values

have guided the way we conduct ourselves and interact

with stakeholders.

RESILIENCE

Nerolac’s Spirit of Resilience was put to test in 2020-21.

The year saw unprecedented demand destruction across

categories, global supply chain disruptions and considerable

volatility in material prices that scaled new highs. Managing

this situation and the uncertainty called for Resilience.

Nerolites rose to the occasion and demonstrated this spirit

of Resilience whether it was in the factories, customer sites,

R&D facility or even in the market.

We conducted a sensitivity analysis and stress tested

various scenarios due to the pandemic. We identified

potential impact areas and worked on agile mitigation

strategies. A robust risk mitigation plan to protect the top-

line and bottomline was put in place and rigorously tracked

at the highest levels of the organisation.

A REVIEW

The first quarter saw unprecedented demand destruction

with virtually no sales in Industrial as well as Decorative,

even in April, the peak month of the season. However,

Decorative demand started to revive in small towns and

Tier 3 and Tier 4 markets, which led to a sharp recovery

in the second quarter. Demand remained healthy in the

subsequent quarters. Industrial demand also recovered

towards the end of Q2.

In Decorative, as the market revived, Construction

Chemicals also saw strong growth. However, KNPL being a

new entrant in this space and in the process of developing

product portfolio and distribution, was unable to take the full

benefit of this revival. We were able to close gaps in our

product portfolio by the fourth quarter.

Material costs at the start of the year were benign due to

low demand, but started moving northward once demand

picked up and increased at double digit rate towards the

end of year. As the pandemic concurrently affected different

parts of the world, many force majeures were announced,

that, coupled with disruptions in shipping lines, created

several supply chain challenges.

We

launched

a

comprehensive

cost

management

programme across all areas. Good material cost reduction,

strong overhead review and control besides focus on

assets and people productivity defined our response to the

situation. We were able to post a profitability of 17.8% for

the year gone by.

NEW THRUST AREAS

In line with our strategy, we focussed on new segments.

In Decorative, the focus was on our paint brand Soldier,

Construction Chemicals, Adhesives and High-end Wood

finishes. In Industrial, we looked at our niche areas in

Powder and Performance Coatings, ARF and Coil Coatings.

KNPL had launched its Soldier brand a few years ago to

cater to the economy segment of the paint market. The

brand has gained good acceptance over the years and will

prove to be a vehicle of future growth.

In Construction Chemicals and Adhesives, we are focussed

on strengthening the Brand and product range. We

launched new products, increased reach and distribution,

initiated influencer programmes and approvals from OEMs.

These steps will enable us to become a significant player in

these markets and participate in growth opportunities over

the coming years.

Similarly, in Wood finishes, we entered into a tie-up with

Italian company ICRO Coatings, which has a comprehensive

range of products. We have invested in branding, distribution

and capacity to ensure that we are poised to benefit from

opportunities in this market.

In Industrial, we have entered the Sealants and Underbody

segment in Automotive. We have chosen to focus on the

premium segment in powder coatings as well as functional

coatings such as rebar, heat resistant powders and super

durable powders. Similarly, in Performance Coatings, we

have focussed on high end performance coatings in areas

like Bridges, Metros and Pipes. Our products have gained

acceptance and poised to become growth drivers over the

coming years.

NEW BUSINESS AS AN OPPORTUNITY

Our deep technological leadership has enabled us to work

closely with customers to create customised solutions

providing better finish, film properties and thickness,
