Forward-Looking Statements

In this Annual Report, we have disclosed forward-looking

information to enable investors to comprehend our prospects

and take informed investment decisions. This report and other

statements, written and oral, that we periodically make are

forward-looking statements that set out anticipated performance/

results based on the management’s plan and assumptions.

We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by

using words such as ‘anticipate’, ‘estimate’, ‘expects’, ‘projects’,

‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’ and words of similar substance

in connection with any discussion of future performance.

We cannot guarantee that these forward-looking statements

will be realised, although we believe we have been prudent in

assumptions. The achievement of results is subject to risks,

uncertainties and realisation of assumptions. Should known or

unknown risks or uncertainties materialise or should underlying

assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially

from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Readers should

bear this in mind.

The Oxford Dictionary defines Resilience as “The capacity to

recover quickly from difficulties” or “the ability of a substance to

spring back into shape, elasticity”.

While the World may define 2020-21 as the Year of the

Pandemic & Disruptions, at Galaxy, we would like to define

the year as the “Year of Resilience” – The Year which tested

every aspect of our Business; be it our People, Operations,

Supply Chain or Demand but despite the challenges that

persisted

throughout

the

year;

the

Performance

has

been exceptional.

exceptional as

• At the start of the Financial Year, we had disruption on account

of lockdown in India

• Multiple Supply Chain disruptions that persisted all

through the year

• Demand Variability Challenges with excess demand for

Performance Surfactants and cut down in consumption of

Specialty Care Products at different points and finally

• A pandemic to deal with, with varying intensity levels

throughout the year

Against

that

your

Company

has

delivered

a volume growth of 5.3%.

Our Performance Surfactants have registered a healthy 8.8%

volume growth and despite the disruptions in H-1, Specialty Care

Products have ended the year with a 1% decline in volumes.

In H-2 while the demand for Performance Surfactants remained

the same in absolute terms vis-à-vis H-1; implying a structural

uptick in demand, Specialty Care products registered a 15.7%

volumes growth in H-2 over H1 FY 2020-21, thus arresting the

decline seen in H-1.

Despite the shutdown in Q-1, volumes in India have grown

11.2% vs Previous Year. AMET market which got its mojo back in

Q-2 FY2020, has not only sustained it but also registered

a healthy 8.2% volume growth for the year. Finally Rest of the

World markets primarily driven by Specialty Care Products, saw a

major decline of 16% in H-1 vs Previous Year. The markets made

a strong comeback in H-2 registering a growth of 4%, overall

ending the year with a 6.8% decline.

to summarise, if FY 2020-21 were an alphabet, it would

be called as the year of p - 5p’s.

pandemic & pressures countered by Persevering people

and Persistent partnerships which ensured we deliver a near

Perfect performance!

Having said that, I would take this opportunity to thank every

Galaxite who has made this possible. Starting with our Front

Line Yodhas - our Operators on the Floor, Operations and

Supply Chain Team Members, Business Members who held fort

when everything around them appeared hazy and turbulent.

Our support staff, who within days adopted a completely new

lifestyle of Working from Home, balancing both, the needs of their

families as well as that of Galaxy and finally our Administration

and CSR Teams, the teams that ensured we continue functioning

as well as helping our society throughout the year.

But Ladies and Gentlemen as they say, every battle has a price

– the price one pays and while the battle against the Pandemic

continues, I would take this opportunity to remember our 9

Galaxites who lost their lives battling it. Losing a family member

is not easy and while no amount of monetary compensation can

make up for human lives, your Company has taken steps to support

their families. We have introduced the ‘CoviD-Family Care’

Policy for all our employees to provide economic stability and

financial security to the families of the employees who succumbed

to COVID. A small step to ensure their families do not face any

further disruptions or challenges on account of loss of income

the year 2020-21 has

reignited the importance of

‘sustainable growth’; growth

that is consistent, balanced,

and replicable over years.:
