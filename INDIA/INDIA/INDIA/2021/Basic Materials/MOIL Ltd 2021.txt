CORPORATE OVERVIEW

59th Annual Report | 2020-21

17:

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of Board of Directors, I take great pleasure in presenting the 59th annual report of your Company, together with the auditors’ report

and financial statements for the year ended on 31st March, 2021.

(1) FINANCIAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE

(A) Key Financials

Financial results of 2020-21 and of the previous year are highlighted below.

Key financial ratios

Your Company has recorded total income of Rs. 1279.85 crore during F.Y. 2020-21 as compared to Rs. 1219.18 crore in previous year. Profit

before tax (before exceptional item) for the year is Rs. 290.11 crore in comparison to previous year’s PBT of Rs. 340.49 crore. The Company

has earned a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs. 176.63 crore as against Rs. 248.22 crore in the previous year. Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown

protocols have led to severe disruptions, affecting production, sales and profit during current reporting period. In this adverse scenario also the

operating profit has increased by 17.73 % from Rs. 159.38 crore in the year 2019-20 to Rs. 187.64 crores in the year 2020-21.

As per the Investment Policy approved by the Board, your Company has deployed surplus funds in fixed deposits and mutual funds and

earned interest income (included in total interest received) of Rs. 65.99 crore (previous year Rs. 154.64 crore) and clubbed under other

income. During F.Y. 2020-21, the interest income was lower in comparison to last year mainly due to reduction in average rate of interest.

(B) Dividend

MOIL is a dividend paying company since many years. Continuing the same during the year 2020-21, an interim dividend @ 25%,

i.e., Rs. 2.50 per equity share has been paid in March, 2021. The Board of Directors of your company has further recommended a

final dividend @ 49%, i.e., Rs. 4.90 per equity share for the year. The total dividend for the year 2020-21, thus, works out to Rs. 7.40

per equity share (previous year Rs. 6.00), which is also as per Government guidelines/ directions. The total dividend outlay for the

year is Rs. 175.62 crore (previous year Rs. 142.40 crore). The Company is having a dividend distribution policy which is available on

company’s website www.moil.nic.in.

(C) Sales:

In F.Y. 2020-21, MOIL has achieved turnover of Rs. 1177.38 crore, registering an increase of 13.42% in comparison to previous year’s

turnover of Rs. 1038.07 crore, inspite of challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic during the year adversely affecting not only

Indian economy but also global economy.:

Managing Director [Chief Executive Officer (CEO)], Director (Finance) [Chief Finance Officer (CFO)] and Company

Secretary as Key Managerial Personnel. There is no change in KMPs during the year 2020-21.

(B) Declaration by Independent Directors

All Independent Directors have given declarations that they meet the criteria of independence as laid down under Section 149(6) of the

Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. In the opinion of the Board, the

Independent Directors possess the requisite expertise and experience and are the persons of high integrity and repute. CA Mangesh P.

Kinare and Dr. Deepak Singh, Independent Directors have completed on-line proficiency self-assessment test conducted by the Indian

Institute of Corporate Affairs. They fulfil the conditions specified in the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules made thereunder and are

Act, 2013 vide notification dated June 5, 2015. As per the notification, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee is not required to

formulate the criteria for appointment of Directors, their remuneration policy and carrying out their performance evaluation. In MOIL,

being a Government Company, the appointment of Directors and their performance evaluation are undertaken by Administrative

Ministry, i.e., Ministry of Steel, Government of India. As such, performance evaluation by the Board of its own performance, that of its

Committees and individual Directors, are not applicable/required.

The remuneration of officers (executives) is fixed as per Government guidelines on pay revision and remuneration of non-executives is
