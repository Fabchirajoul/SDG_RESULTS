Managing Director of the Company for a period of three years with effect from 12th August, 2019

till 11th August, 2022 by means of an Ordinary Resolution passed by the members at the 123rd Annual General Meeting (123rd AGM)

of the Company held on 25th August, 2020 on the terms and conditions including payment of remuneration as mentioned therein.

Mr. R. K. Dalmia was appointed as a Whole-time Director of the Company for a period of three years with effect from 15th September,

2018 till 14th September, 2021 by means of an Ordinary Resolution passed by the members at the 122nd Annual General Meeting

(122nd AGM) of the Company held on 30th July, 2019 on the terms and conditions including payment of remuneration as mentioned

therein.

The payment of remuneration to Mr. J. C. Laddha and Mr. R. K. Dalmia for the financial year 2020-21 is within the limit stipulated

in the said resolutions passed at 123rd and 122nd AGM respectively.

During the financial year 2020-21, due to pandemic COVID-19 and particularly pursuant to lockdown announced by the Government

to contain spread of the pandemic, unprecedented disruption was caused to the businesses of the Company and as a result, the

Company’s profit before tax is ` 20.10 crores and net profit after tax is ` 31.50 crores. The profit calculated as per the relevant

provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, being ` 32.41 crores is inadequate to cover the managerial remuneration for the FY

2020-21 as contemplated under Section 197 of the Companies Act, 2013. The Company has taken all possible measures and is

vigorously continuing the efforts to improve the working.

Pursuant to provisions of Sections 196, 197 and 198 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with Schedule V, a Company having

inadequate or no profits may pay remuneration to its managerial personnel subject to the following:

(i)

The payment of remuneration is approved by a Resolution passed by the Board and by the Nomination & Remuneration

Committee of Directors.

(ii) There is no default in repayment of any of its debts or interest payable thereon.

(iii) A Special Resolution has been passed at General meeting of the Company.

The Nomination & Remuneration Committee and the Board have, at their respective meetings held on 06th May, 2021 subject

to approval of the members of the Company, accorded their approval for the payment of remuneration to Mr. J. C. Laddha and

Mr. R. K. Dalmia for the financial year 2020-21 which is within the limit stipulated in the aforesaid resolutions of 123rd AGM and

122nd AGM held on 25th August, 2020 and 30th July, 2019 respectively. Further, there is no default in repayment of any debts or

interest payable thereon.

While approving the remuneration of both Mr. J. C. Laddha and Mr. R. K. Dalmia, the members had also inter alia approved the

payment of remuneration as the “Minimum Remuneration” in the event of inadequacy or absence of profits in any financial year

or years during the term of appointment subject to requisite approvals. Since the said remuneration of Mr. J. C. Laddha and Mr. R.K.

Dalmia was earlier approved by Ordinary Resolutions, the approval of members is now being sought to regularize such minimum

remuneration by passing Special Resolutions.

Further, pursuant to Section 197 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Schedule V thereto, where a Company has no profits or

its profits are inadequate, it may pay the remuneration to the managerial personnel provided that, amongst others, a statement

along with a Notice calling the General Meeting contains certain information. Accordingly, the information as required to be

disclosed under para (iv) of the second proviso after paragraph B of Section II of part II of Schedule V of the Companies Act, 2013

is given in the Annexure II to the Notice in regard to both Mr. J. C. Laddha and Mr. R. K. Dalmia.

Except for Mr. J. C. Laddha and Mr. R. K. Dalmia as set out in their respective resolution at item nos. 5 & 6, none of the Directors/

key managerial personnel of the Company/ their relatives are in any way concerned or interested, financially or otherwise.

Brief profile of Mr. J. C. Laddha and Mr. R. K. Dalmia is enclosed.

The Board recommends the Special Resolutions as set out at Item Nos. 5 & 6 of the Notice for approval by the shareholders.

Item No. 7

Pursuant to the provisions of Sections 196, 197 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”), read

with Schedule V of the Act and the Rules made thereunder including the Companies (Appointment & Remuneration of Managerial

Personnel) Rules, 2014 and as recommended by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board, the Board of Directors:

Managing Director, he is entrusted with

substantial powers and authority to manage the affairs of the Company subject to

superintendence, direction and control of the Board of Directors. He is having vast

experience of Corporate management across varied businesses in his prior roles at Aditya

Birla Group and possesses all required competencies. Thus, he is ideally suited for the job.

Customer

The centre of our universe

Customers form the

cornerstone of every

business. We, at Century

Textiles, were well aware

of this reality since

our inception and have

ensured that customer

centricity is the focal point

of our business model.

We continuously engage

with our customers and

customise our products,

services and solutions to

cater to their evolving

needs. Our focus on

customer-centricity has

resulted in us emerging as

the preferred choice in our

respective industries.

• Undertaking advanced quality checks

on all our products

• Ensuring our operations are

sustainable with minimal

environmental impact/footprint and

value for our communities

A YEAR LIKE NO OTHER

In a year with unforeseen challenges,

we led with empathy, care and concern

for all our stakeholders, in line with

our beliefs and value system. We were

proactive in ensuring the safety of the

people we serve and those we work

with. Serving our customers, despite

the unpredictability and challenges,

remained a priority. We deployed our

resources and dedicated efforts to

ensure customer delivery and fulfillment

of their needs. We communicated

honestly and with transparency, keeping

our customers informed of the evolving

situation and our response, along with

the steps we were taking to ensure

business continuity.

Crisis often reveals character.

At Century Textiles, we lived up to our

commitment to customers, reinforcing

our credo of always keeping customers

at the centre of our universe.

Customer trust has been at the heart

of our vision and product excellence.

Seamless service and a focus on

delivering value-for-money are the

enablers of our customer centricity

journey. Since inception, we have worked

hard to earn customer trust by following

a few basic principles. These include:

• Manufacturing world-class products

across our three businesses of

textiles, real estate and pulp and

paper

• Embedding technology and

innovation across our businesses,

through best-in-class, contemporary

equipment, world-class processes

and consistent digitisation leading to

interactivity and convenience:

Dear shareholders,

deleterious economic effects. In 2020,

the global economy contracted by 3.3%,

the largest contraction on record, at

least since World War-II. Much of it was

concentrated in the first half of our

fiscal year FY21, as several countries

enforced strict lockdowns. Economies

bounced back – albeit at differentiated

speeds – in subsequent quarters,

on the back of large fiscal stimulus

packages, especially in the developed

countries, restocking demand after

dilution of lockdowns, and improved

confidence levels following the start

of vaccination programmes. As per the

recent forecasts from International

Monetary Fund (IMF), the US and China

are expected to record a strong recovery

in 2021, resulting in a net positive

expansion of their economies over

the 2019 levels. These two engines of

growth are expected to boost demand

for exports from other countries. But

Europe and Japan are projected to see

only a partial recovery and will possibly

fail to erase their last year’s contraction

in the current year.

In response to the pandemic, central

banks resorted to strongly supportive

Our former Chairman and

my grandfather, B.K. Birla,

always encouraged us to go

beyond the call of duty, and

I feel proud to say that we

have responded with empathy,

maturity and agility during

these challenging times.

Managing Director’s Message

A year of resilience and

new perspectives: Dear shareholders,

The year 2020 brought with it a host

of unprecedented challenges. Within a

short duration of time, the COVID-19

pandemic had raged through the

world, upending lives, hollowing health

systems, taking away jobs and bringing

economies to a standstill for a major

part of the year.

But every crisis also gives rise to new

opportunities and opens up new vistas.

And so has the pandemic. We have a

new normal where digitalisation and

technology adoption have become the

key enablers of business as well as

administration. This will become more

and more evident as governments and

service providers use these to reach

out, help and support to the public.

Our Company has a longstanding

legacy of growing with each challenge.

This time, too, we used the unique

circumstances presented by the year

to clearly identify our priorities and

come out a stronger and more resilient

business concern.

During the year, the health and safety

of all our key stakeholders were our

We made sure that we

come together for the

greater good, make

well-being our top

priority and connect

with those who matter

to us the most. In each

of these critical aspects,

our teams from across

all three businesses rose

to the challenge.

124th Annual Report & Accounts 2020-21

Responsible business:

Dear Shareholders,

We have pleasure in presenting the 124th Annual Report of the Company along with the audited statement of accounts for the

year ended 31st March, 2021. All the business segments of the Company faced disruptions during entire 2020-21 caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. These disruptions manifested into lacklustre demand and pressure on selling prices for the products

of the Company. Thus, the performance of the Company for the financial year 2020-21 has been adversely affected as compared

to the previous year. As the pandemic is still continuing with the situation being fluid, the Company continues to monitor and

assess the business operations regularly and is taking all possible precautions in terms of safety of its staff and workers at all

the locations of its offices and manufacturing plants.

The summarised financial results are given below.

value of security deposit amounts to ` 48.00 Crores (31 March 2020: ` 45.87 Crores) as it is payable on demand.

in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets and their credit worthiness are

monitored at periodical intervals. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value

of each class of financial assets.

Crores) as there was no reasonable expectations of recovery and were outstanding for more than 360 days from

becoming due.
