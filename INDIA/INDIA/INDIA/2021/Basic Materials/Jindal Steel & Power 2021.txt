Jindal Steel & Power Limited:

Dear Stakeholders,

I write to you at the close of one of the rarest and

challenging years in recent history. Starting as a

health hazard, the COVID-19 pandemic was quick

to snowball into a once-in-a-century economic and

humanitarian crisis that affected tens of millions of

lives worldwide.

While the global economic losses are pegged at

around US$ 90 trillion, we must also take cognisance

of the losses that cannot be accounted for. We stand

in solidarity with all those who were adversely

impacted.

Human spirit continues to prevail

In retrospect, I find FY 2020-21 to be a tribute to

the indomitable human spirit in the truest sense.

Humankind rallied together at a scale perhaps

never seen before to lend a helping hand to those in

utmost need and work through the crisis. A quicker-

than-usual vaccine rollout, large-scale inoculation

drives, and a fairly streamlined economic policy

dissemination have supported the global economy

to a large extent. Together, these have helped us

reach a modest stage of revival, albeit with sizable

divergence in recovery rates between developed and

developing economies.

Closer home, India grappled with the vagaries of the

pandemic at its onset and peak. However, the way

the Indian government responded with prudence

is commendable, considering the responsibility of

the lives and livelihoods of 1.3 billion people in their

hands. The consecutive lockdowns in the first quarter

of FY 2020-21 were really effective in controlling the

pandemic spread.

As the situation gradually began to ease, the

government was quick to introduce enabling fiscal

and monetary policy measures, which in conjunction

with pent-up demand, led the road to recovery

and positive GDP growth from the Q3 FY 2020-21

onwards.

Building back with steel

As the wider world, including India, gets into

the recovery mode, steel is set to play a key role.

Infrastructure will continue to act as an economic

multiplier, and with massive public expenditure

worldwide, steel will be in an upcycle for the

foreseeable future. As an affordable, reliable and

infinitely recyclable material, steel will also help build

a future that is responsible and sustainable.

As the wider world, including India, gets into

the recovery mode, steel is set to play a key

role. Infrastructure will continue to act as an

economic multiplier, and with massive public

expenditure worldwide, steel will be in an

upcycle for the foreseeable future.

Jindal Steel & Power Limited:

Managing Director

Seeing the big picture

The pandemic continues to test the resilience of the world, with

public health, economic stability and global trade still grappling

with its adverse impact. To cushion the impact, concerted efforts

were made by governments and Central Banks worldwide

by announcing large-scale fiscal and monetary measures

and collaboratively working with businesses, non-profits and

individuals.

However, towards mid-2020, the potency of the virus began to

decline, and the expectations of vaccine discovery was stronger

than ever. Considering the broad economic scenario, the IMF

in the latest July World Economic Outlook (WEO) announced

a global output drop of 3.2% in CY 2020. It also predicts the

global output to grow by 6%, with divergent recovery between

advanced and emerging economies.

Globally the steel sector witnessed a marginal dip in production

to touch 1,864 MnT in CY 2020. However, the forecast for

CY 2021 looks promising, with a 5.8% demand growth expected

in the year. In India, FY 2020-21 started as an uncertain year

with subdued economic and industrial activity. It was primarily

characterised by consecutive lockdowns and restricted

movement, where the government rightly prioritised saving lives

over everything else.

As the population adapted to the new normal, the situation

eased, and gradually commercial and social activity resumed.

The fiscal policy and the monetary policy environment remained

increasingly conducive to spur growth. According to the IMF, India

has the potential to accomplish 9.5% in FY 2021-22, from

a low base created after the steep de-growth of 7.3% in

FY 2020-21. Key indicators such as Index of Industrial Production

and Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index also point to faster

recovery than expected. The recently released Q1 performance of

the economy in FY2021-22 is impressive (the GDP for the quarter

has shot up to 20.1%), even if we consider the low-base effect of

the corresponding quarter of the last financial year.

Towards the second and third quarter of the last fiscal year,

commodity prices made a very strong comeback, with pent-

up demand and savings being released in conjunction with

large-scale public spend announcements. Indian steelmakers

benefited from this environment, and registered record volumes

and profits during the period. India’s total steel production

stood at 103.04 MnT with apparent steel consumption at

94.14 MnT at the end of FY 2020-21. Both production and

apparent consumption are 5.6% and 6% less, compared to the

previous fiscal, owing to the temporary closure of manufacturing

facilities in the first quarter of FY 2020-21.

During the year, India’s steel exports surged by 29% y-o-y

and imports reduced by 30% y-o-y. As India recovers and

construction activity is gradually resuming, the country is

expected to consume 110 MnT of steel in FY 2021-22. The record

outlay for infrastructure in the recent Union Budget and enabling

initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme

for specialty steel are expected to further augment growth of

the steel sector in the country.

In the near future, we aspire to become a net

debt-free Company, which will be a unique

feat in Global steel scenario. In pursuit of this

ambition, between April 2020 and March

2021, we reduced net debt by ` 13,734 crore,

taking our net debt to ` 22,146 crore at

consolidated level.

V R Sharma: Managing

letter as an opportunity to thank each and every one of you who

have stood with us through rain and shine. As we pursue our

ambitions with a calibrated strategy, I request your continued

confidence and support.

With best regards,

V R Sharma

for ` 22.62 Crore (AUD 4,048,000) which is in dispute. Further, the

contracts for the sale of coal and misleading and deceptive conduct.

The proceedings are at an early stage and the claim is not yet

quantified. WLC and WCPL intend to defend the proceedings.

5.

It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigations with

accuracy, the Management believes, based on legal opinions received,

that it has meritorious defences to the claims, the pending actions

will not require outflow of resources embodying economic benefits

and will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the

operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Group.
