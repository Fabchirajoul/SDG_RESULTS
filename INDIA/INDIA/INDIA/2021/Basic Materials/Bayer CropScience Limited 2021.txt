Annual Report

2020-21

01:

Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present you with the 63rd Annual

Report for Bayer CropScience Limited. The report

looks back on the Financial Year 2020-21, one

of the most unprecedented years in recent times

due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Last year saw entire countries, economies,

industry sectors, companies, communities, and

families grappling with the sudden onslaught of the

pandemic. Existing norms for day-to-day business

operations had to be overhauled and adapted to a

new normal. Good health and nutrition came into

the spotlight as areas that required a renewed

focus at national, local, and individual levels.

As a leading player in Indian agriculture, your

Company continued to support farmers with

essential agri-inputs, crop advisory and market

linkages along with additional support to tide

through the challenges arising from the pandemic.

While frontline workers worked hard to protect

people from the scourge of COVID, farmers

played a crucial role in ensuring sufficient food

production and availability.

In

2020-21,

we

launched

several

new

initiatives to enhance farmer incomes and

rural livelihoods. Through projects such

as ‘Food Chain Partnerships’ and ‘Better

Life Farming’, your Company was able to

support smallholder farmers with access to

innovative agri-inputs, modern technologies,

training and capacity building. Agriculture

will always remain an important contributor to

India’s economic growth and Bayer CropScience

Limited is well positioned to support the needs of

Indian farmers.

In a difficult pandemic year, we continued to drive

robust growth with Revenue from Operations of

` 42,613 million and Profit Before Exceptional

Items & Tax of ` 7,894 million. Seven new products

were launched in 2020: four in Crop Protection,

two in Hybrid Seeds and one in Environmental

Science. Besides business growth, we supported

our local communities, frontline workers, farmers,

businesses, and employees with pandemic

relief measures.

As we look ahead and hope for the COVID situation

to improve, on behalf of the Board of Directors,

I sincerely thank our Shareholders, Banks &

Financial Institutions, Distributors and Farmers

for partnering with us. I would also like to thank

our employees for their remarkable resilience

and ownership in ensuring business continuity.

We count on your continued support, trust

and partnership.

Best wishes,

Pankaj Patel

Chairman & Non-Executive Independent Director

Annual Report

2020-21

12:

Dear Shareholders,

2020 has been an unprecedented year that has

placed great demands on everyone. For us at

Bayer CropScience Limited (BCSL), too, it was a

challenging year. Despite the adverse conditions,

we achieved a lot – by bringing in new products

to market for our farmer customers, driving

digitalization of Indian agriculture and investing in

innovation & future growth.

Looking back on 2020, we have a lot to be proud

of. Our employees and teams worked round the

clock overcoming multiple challenges to ensure

business continuity and support farmers with

access to essential agri-inputs, training and

advisory. With our ‘Better Farms, Better Lives’

initiative, we supported 450,000 smallholder

farmers across India with Better Life Farming

care packages.

Expanding our Better Life Farming franchise

in India, we scaled up our Better Life Farming

Centers across nine states. Where in-person

field visits and advisory could not be managed,

we supported farmers through digital agronomic

advisory for integrated crop management.

Further, we collaborated with e-commerce

players for home delivery of our hybrid seed and

crop protection brands.

We also supported our local communities with

immediate COVID relief measures. At the same

time, we introduced several initiatives to keep

2021 marks 125 years of Bayer in India. Our journey

encompasses significant contributions towards

doubling farmers’ incomes, creating access to

innovative health solutions, manufacturing in India,

advancing digital solutions, and empowering people.

2021 also marks 63 years of Bayer CropScience Limited.

our employees, farmers, and channel partners

safe and minimize the spread of COVID-19. In

difficult times like these, the importance of health

and nutrition becomes more significant than ever

before. In line with Bayer’s vision of ‘Health for all,

Hunger for none’, we are working on innovative

products for agriculture that will help ensure

food security for our growing population. Apart

from portfolio innovations, we will continue to

introduce new business models and value-chain

collaborations to increase our farmer reach.

2021 marks the completion of 125 years of Bayer’s

presence in India. Our journey of 125 years

encompasses significant contributions towards

doubling farmers’ incomes, creating access

to innovative health solutions, manufacturing

in

India,

advancing

digital

solutions,

and

empowering people. 2021 also marks 63 years of

Bayer CropScience Limited being operational in

India. This journey would not have been possible

without your support.

We look forward to leveraging the emerging

opportunities in India’s food & agriculture sector

and drive sustainable growth while creating value

for all our stakeholders.

applicable regulations.

With the objective of bringing in more flexibility

as well as ease of operation, the Company has

in place an “E-board meeting” application, which

is also aimed at reducing the paper consumption

at the Board Meetings. This application enables

the Board to access all the agenda papers through

activities concerning the Company. The Board

Committees are set with clearly defined roles and

of the Company. The Board is responsible for the

actions of the Committees. The Chairpersons
