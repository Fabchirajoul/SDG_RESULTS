Dear Stakeholders,

The United Nations Global Compact, is a call to companies to align strategies and operations with universal principles

on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and take actions that advance societal goals. Launched

in 2000, it is the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world with over 12000 signatories based in more

than 145 countries. The UN Global Compact enjoys the support of the United Nations General Assembly and has

additionally been recognized in a number of other inter-governmental contexts. UN Global Compact continues to play

a vital role with regard to strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to partner strategically with the private

sector.

The Global Compact Network India works towards mainstreaming the ten universally acceptable principles in

business activities around the world, catalyzing action in support of broader UN goals, such as the Millennium

Development Goals (MDGs). At present, the India network ranks among the top 3, out of the 101 local networks in the

world, and has emerged as the largest corporate citizenship and social responsibility organization in the country with

a pan Indian membership.

NMDC has been one of the earliest signatories and has also played an active role in the formation and growth of the

Global Compact Network in India.

While setting the tone for the post 2015 development agenda within the Indian context, I reiterate NMDC’s

commitment to the cause of UN Global Compact.

With warm regards,

Yours sincerely

2.32.12 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (IndAS-37) :

Necessary details in regard to provisions have been disclosed in notes 2.14.3,2.17& 2.31.:

letter issued by Monitoring

committee and as per the guidelines given by Hon’ble

Supreme Court of India, Pellet plant is paying Basic

value, Royalty Value and bulk permit fee value to MC and

GST amount to NMDC Donimalai account. After receipt

of GST amount from Pellet Plant, DIOM/KIOM is issuing

advance receipt confirming the receipt of GST from

Pellet Plant along with necessary statutory Documents

to MC in the prescribed format. Based on the advance

receipt issued by DIOM/KIOM, Monitoring Committee is

issuing bulk permit to Pellet Plant for lifting of materials.

DIOM/KIOM is raising Tax invoice on Pellet Plant for the

dispatched quantity, showing it as sales and also paying

GST to Government.

Simultaneously, Pellet Plant is recognizing the same as

purchases and availing input credit. The above procedure

is followed due to Compulsion made by MC as they have

denied permission for Pellet Plant to lift the Iron Ore

without participating in auction and accordingly, separate

GST registration is also taken as per MC instructions.

However, the entry for un-realized profit on sale of Iron

Ore to Pellet Plant is accounted.

2.34.12 Review for Impairment of Investment in Legacy

Iron Ore Ltd, Australia (LIOL):

The total investment of the Company in LIOL is Rs.

214.70 cr as on 31.3.2021. This is 90.05% of the total

shareholding of the Company. This investment in Legacy

was reviewed for impairment with reference to Ind AS 36.

It is noted that the period of exploration is not expired

and exploration activity are being continued and the

company has not reached the stage of establishing the

commercial viability of the tenements.

Legacy Iron Ore Limited is an active exploration company

with a diverse portfolio. For an exploration company, the

future cash flows are from the exploration tenements

which have been recognised as assets ie., Exploration

and Evaluation (E&E) Assets. LIOL has E&E assets of Rs.

77.38 crores as on 31.3.2021. LIOL has reviewed these

E&E assets for impairment and concluded that there is

no indication for impairment of E&E assets after testing

the compliance of the following conditions:

1.

The rights to tenure of the area of interest are

current; and

2.

The exploration and evaluation expenditures

are expected to be recouped through successful

development and exploitation of the area of

interest, or alternatively, by its sale;

3.

Exploration and evaluation activities in the area of

interest have not, at the reporting date, reached

a stage which permits a reasonable assessment

of the existence or otherwise of economically

recoverable reserves, and active and significant

operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest

are continuing.

LIOL is systematically exploring all the exploration

tenements that are at varying levels of exploration

potential and maturity. The company plans to continue

exploration in all the above tenements and does not

intend to surrender the current list of tenements.

Further the quoted price of LIOL share in AUX as on

31.3.2021 is $0.014 with a market capitalisation of

$89.67 million. The market capitalisation of the company

is more than its net assets of $23.89m as on 31.3.21.

NMDCs share of Market cap @ 90.05% amounts to

approx. Rs.449.76 cr ($80.74) which is more than the

investment of Rs. 214.70 cr in LIOL.

In view of above no impairment of the Investment in LIOL

is felt necessary for the current FY 21.:
