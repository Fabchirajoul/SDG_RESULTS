HUMAN RESOURCES

The employees and Human Resources team at Berger Paints India Limited had to go through the unique and unprecedented COVID

situation that the entire world is going through this year. For many organisations, this has created enormous amount of disruptions.

However, the Berger Paints India team has been trying to overcome this situation with a strong internal bonding, continuous

communication and focussing on opportunities that will help grow the business.

As the pandemic hit us, we have ensured that we honour all the offers that were made, continue paying salaries to our employees and

deploy our talent in upcountry locations which had growth potential. There were stringent COVID related safety protocols placed in

our factories, offices and depots which helped us to commence manufacturing as well as sales operations as soon as the lock-down

restrictions were relaxed. The strong adherence by all our employees has ensured continuity throughout the pandemic with many of

our manufacturing locations clocking all time high production levels.

While the Berger India team has leveraged digital tools to engage seamlessly throughout, the Human Resources along with the

Finance team has taken this opportunity to embark upon digitizing the HR, Payroll and Travel processes on a single platform. The

digitization will help improve efficiencies, bring in better control and provide a better user experience of HR processes and systems

for our employees. The team is committed to develop employee capability through specific initiative for mid-management and senior

management so that the talent pipeline does not run dry, keeping in mind the business growth now and going forward. The business

has looked at new areas for growth such as Home Hygiene, Construction Chemicals and Admixtures, which have been fully resourced

by the Talent acquisition team.

The number of employees as on 31st March, 2021 was 3,814 (31st March, 2020 – 3,600). The Industrial Relations were generally

satisfactory during the financial year.

As we look back, we would like to thank all employees for their support and commitment throughout the year, which has been distinct

than other years in the recent past.
