Corporate information:

Director's statement

The Indian economy was poised for a

double-digit expansion in 2021 after

a tumultuous 2020. The devastating

second wave turned that euphoria into

paranoia; growth forecasts have since

been scaled down. Estimates suggest

that India would only just be able to

recover lost ground, effectively losing

two years of growth unlikely to be

recovered.

The COVID induced lockdown significantly

affected the operations of India’s paper

manufacturing, of which a major part is

clustered in only eight states and JK Paper

has a presence in three - Gujarat, Odisha

and Telangana. Despite initial disruptions,

the Company’s capacity utilization

improved to 70-75% by end of the first

half and by the end of the fiscal year, it was

operating at over 100% capacity utilisation;

much of this recovery was driven by

exports, which almost doubled.

India’s printing & writing segment

contracted almost 20%, following a steep

decline in the publishing and school

note books segment, which accounts for

almost 65% of the W&P market. Some of

the loss was offset by a 4-5% growth in the

packaging board segment. Overall volumes

declined almost 15% over the previous

year. The demand decline in the printing

& writing segment led to weaker paper

prices.

On the other hand, a lockdown in most

countries resulted in a global supply chain

disruption, resulting in abnormally high

pulp and other commodity prices towards

the end of the fiscal year under review.

We offset some of this cost increase with

price corrections in the last quarter of the

year. The result is that our turnover, which

had declined to H500 cr in the first quarter,

increased to H980 crores by the fourth

quarter.

During these severely testing times, your

Company achieved the best performance

in the paper industry. Team JK Paper

demonstrated its passion to outperform.

The Company’s focus on cost austerity,

especially in raw material sourcing

from plantations within 200 km of its

manufacturing facilities, enabled it to

reduce input costs. We moderated our

finance through better working capital

management and reduction in interest

rates. Optimized steam and water

consumption resulted in significant cost

savings. Digital transformation in key

manufacturing processes helped reduce

process variations, improve quality and

moderate costs. The Packaging Board

project at Unit CPM progressed well and

the Company has made a provision for

virtual commissioning and is likely to

commence trial production in the second

quarter of the current fiscal year. This bodes

well as packaging board markets are likely

to grow at more than 10% per annum for

the next few years.

To maintain quality leadership, trials were

conducted by the Company to upgrade

existing product quality and introduce

new products, which made it possible

to participate in all market segments.

The Company revamped its customer

incentive programme called JK Super Sitare,

re-launched as JK Super Sitare Premium

League to make it more interesting for

our customers. We conducted the second

season of the AutHer Awards, which

strengthened our brand recall across the

print, television and digital media.

In line with Atmanirbhar Bharat drive, we

developed lower GSM Coated Paper, with

the objective to reduce imports into India.

The Company’s farm forestry programme

enhanced rural economic sustainability by

providing over 65,000 farmers an assured

income, while enhancing raw material

supply predictability for the Company. The

Company’s state-of-art clonal production

centres ensured the production of quality

planting material round the year. As an

extension of your Company’s capacity to

pioneer and embrace latest environment

friendly technologies, the new pulp mill

will not only be efficient, but also the

quality of the pulp will be better. We are

replacing the chlorine-based pulp mill with

the Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) process.

Water saving schemes will reduce the

consumption of water, steam and power

per ton of paper. Our GHG emissions are

consistently declining.

I am pleased that our collective resilience

resulted in no job losses or pay cuts at any

level. We ensured timely payments to our

suppliers and distributors.

On account the strength of this eco-

system, your Company is prepared to

return to growth and overcome prevailing

challenges.

and usage of valuation models.

Independent reperformance:

• Our own valuation specialists independently challenged

management on the valuations where they were found outside

our expected range.

specialists assisted us in challenging the appropriateness of

significant models and methodologies used by an independent

valuer in calculating fair values, risk exposures, completeness of

risk factors, and in calculating Fair Value Assessments (FVAs).

in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31st March,

2021, its Profit including Other Comprehensive income, changes

in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current

transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values.

A

The fair values of derivatives are on MTM as per Bank.

B

Company has opted to fair value its mutual fund investment through statement of profit & loss.

C

Company has opted to fair value its quoted investments in equity share through OCI.

D

As per Para D-15 of Appendix D of Ind AS 101, the first time adopter may choose to measure its investment in subsidiaries, JVs and

Associates at cost or at fair value. Company has opted to value its investments in subsidiaries, JVs and Associates at cost.

E

Company has adopted effective rate of interest for calculating Interest. This has been calculated as the weighted average of

effective interest rates calculated for each loan. In addition processing fees and transaction cost relating to each loan has also been

considered for calculating effective interest rate.

F

The Management has obtained independent valuer’s report for Financial Liability against: Letter Of Comfort (LOC) issued by the

Company for borrowing facility extended to a step-down subsidiary by the Bank. The fair valuation of LOC is based on the best

evidence of fair value determined by the valuer which valued the Letter of Comfort by applying Black Scholes Put Option Model

using the inputs (including business projections, cash flows, terminal value etc ) provided by the management of the Company and

used applicable discount rate ( as adjusted for risk) in arriving at the expected value of LOC.

* The carrying amounts are considered to be the same as their fair values due to short term nature.

Fair value hierarchy

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices)

or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
