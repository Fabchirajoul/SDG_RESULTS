A. CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

(a)

Following measures were taken to conserve energy

• AutomaƟon of several packing lines which resulted in reduced cycle Ɵmes & savings in power.

• Increase in batch sizes of some products resulƟng into lower power consumpƟons per ton of

product.

• Replacement of Reactor by one with more eﬃcient heat transfer features

• Gradual eliminaƟon of vacuum pumps by diaphragm pumps for energy savings as well as

eﬄuent reducƟons

• Signiﬁcant reducƟon in freshwater consumpƟon at Pimpri site through several acƟons.

• Several Green & Black Belts along with Kaizens at both sites resulƟng, into reduced power

consumpƟons.

(b)

AddiƟonal investments and proposals being implemented for reducƟon of consumpƟon of

energy
