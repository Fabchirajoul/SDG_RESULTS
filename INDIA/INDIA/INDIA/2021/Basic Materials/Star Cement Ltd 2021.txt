letter. Meghalaya High Court has stayed the said demand vide its order dated 16-06-2020. Based on the legal advice ob-

tained by the Group from External Counsel as well as its own assessment there is every likelihood that the said demand will

be quashed and therefore no provision have been taken in the books of account.

(b) In respect of demand notice dated 19th February, 2020 received by the Company and its two subsidiary companies from

Director of Mineral resources, Meghalaya, for payment of royalty, MEPRF, VAT/GST for ` 25,681.91 Lakhs in pursuance

to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order dated 17-01-2020 passed in O.A. No. 110(TCH)/2012 for alleged illegal coal

procurement. By passing the said order NGT has accepted the Recommendation of the 5th Interim Report of the Indepen-

dent Committee set up by NGT, which has suggested imposition of penalty on Cement Companies and Thermal Power

Plants in Meghalaya.

The Group has not purchased any illegal coal and has complied with all disclosure requirements of the various Government

Departments. The Report of NGT Committee has been founded on the basis of assumptions and views of the Committee and not

on hard facts. Further to note that the Group has neither been issued a show-cause nor any opportunity of being heard was given

to the Group before submitting the Interim reports by the Independent Committee to NGT. Even NGT has not served any notice

on the Group before passing the impugned order dated 17-01-2020 which is clear violation of principles of natural justice.

The Group backed by the legal opinions, believes that it has a good case in the matter as the said order was issued based

on certain hypothetical assumptions and views and not on hard facts. No opportunity of being heard was provided to the

Group either by NGT committee or by NGT itself which passed order without going into the merits & facts and accepted the

recommendations of 5th Interim Report. Therefore, there is every likelihood of the Demand Notice and the order of the NGT

being set aside.The Group has preferred an appeal before the Supreme Court of India against the NGT Order, and accordingly, no

provisions has been made in the accounts.

45. eXceptional items/eXtraordinarY items

(a) Supreme Court vide its’ order dated 17-11-2020 has rejected the Review petitions filed by some of the Petitioners against

its’ Judgment dated 22-04-2020 in the matter of Union of India –vs- M/s V.V.F Limited & Others. As the said order reached its’

finality , the Group has Refunded 50% of differential Excise duty amounting to ` 3,225.96 Lakhs which was received by the Group

in previous years, and for which the demand: letter was issued by the Department. The Group has also provided for the balance

50% of such refund amounting to ` 3,231.46 Lakhs which was shown as receivable and recognised in income in previous years.

Refund/Reversal on account of both amounting to ` 6,457.42 Lakhs is shown as Exceptional items in the Statement of Profit and

Loss Account for the current financial year.

46. BorrowinG cost oF ForeiGn loan

The Company and its subsidiaries Star Cement Meghalaya Limited and Meghalaya Power Limited have exercised the option

under in paragraph 46A of the Accounting Standard 11 (AS-11) - “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”.

ated the foreign exchange (gain)/loss arising on revaluation on long term foreign Currency monetary items in so far as they

relate to the acquisition of depreciable capital assets over the balance useful life of such assets. The depreciated portion of net

foreign exchange (gain)/loss on such long term foreign currency monetary items for the period ended on 31st March, 2021 of the

Company and its subsidiaries is ` 308.09 Lakhs, (31st March, 2020 : ` 375.01 Lakhs).

47. corporate social responsiBilitY

As per Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013, a company, meeting the applicability threshold, needs to spend at least

2% of its average net profit for the immediately preceding three financial years on corporate social responsibility (CSR)
