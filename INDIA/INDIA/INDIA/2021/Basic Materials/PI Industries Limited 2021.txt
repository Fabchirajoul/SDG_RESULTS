Consolidated Financial Statement:

Dear Stakeholders of PI,

Scientific journeys are all about an ongoing

quest. At PI Industries to have enthusiastically

pursued it for 75 years evokes a great sense

of pride and joy within each one of us. It’s a

great occasion to celebrate the remarkable

successes that the Company has achieved and

what’s even more exciting is, the fact that our

quest for growth continues as we move ahead

with greater drive and tenacity. Our aim is to

accomplish more, faster while building on the

solid foundation that we have built over the last

5-6 years.

PI Industries Ltd.

As I pen down my thoughts, our world

is

undergoing

rapid,

intense,

and

all-

intrusive changes at multiple levels and in

multidimensional ways. The Covid-19 pandemic

pressed the reset button of our planet, Mother

Earth, impacting every one of its inhabitants.

While technological advances accelerate, it is

worth noting the fact that peoples’ expectations

from life are also changing. Safety, good health,

and socio-economic security have become

predominant in that order. In a nutshell, we

need a healthier planet!

Dear friends of PI,

I am excited to address to you on 75th anniversary

impelled joy of the current year, both. The

confluence of all these factors is presenting an

inflection point like never before, for PI.

I want to thank each of our stakeholders for

your invaluable contributions in making us reach

so far. We have faced challenges, charted out

our future course and have grown, together.

Ours has been a classic case of sustained value

creation based on trust, integrity, competence

and adaptability. It is our sheer grit and

determination that has enabled us to remain

firm even in the most unprecedented times such

as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our people have

been our biggest assets in this journey who

impressive growth story of innovating solutions,

cultivating relations and curating a global brand

OPERAtINg SEgMENt

An operating segment is defined as a component of the entity that represents business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs

expenses and for which discrete financial information is available. The operating segments are based on the Company’s internal reporting

structure and the manner in which operating results are reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).

The Company has evaluated the applicability of segment reporting and has concluded that since the Company is operating in the field of

Agro Chemicals both in the domestic and export markets and the CODM reviews the overall performance of the agro chemicals business,

accordingly the Company has one reportable business segment viz. Agro Chemicals.
