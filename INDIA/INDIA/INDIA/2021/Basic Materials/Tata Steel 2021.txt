Letter of Offer

dated January 22, 2018.

Pursuant to the First and Final Call, the Stakeholders’

Relationship Committee (‘SRC’), duly authorised by the Board,

on March 24, 2021 approved the conversion of 7,02,49,241

partly paid-up equity shares of face value ₹10/- each into

fully paid-up equity shares of face value ₹10/- each, against

which the first and final call money of ₹461/- (comprising

₹7.496 towards face value and ₹453.504 towards securities

premium) per share was received.

Further, the reminder-cum-forfeiture notice dated April 14,

2021 was sent to holders of partly paid-up shares on which the

call money remained unpaid.

On April 23, 2021, the SRC approved the conversion of 73,888

partly paid-up equity shares of face value ₹10/- each into fully

paid-up equity shares of face value ₹10/- each, against which

the first and final call money of ₹461/- (comprising ₹7.496

towards face value and ₹453.504 towards securities premium)

per share was received.

The converted shares rank pari passu with the existing fully

paid-up equity shares.

Credit Rating

In April 2021, S&P Global Ratings revised the issuer credit rating

of the Company from ‘B+’ Outlook: Stable to ‘BB-’ Outlook:

Stable and revised the Long-term foreign currency issuer

credit rating for ABJA Investment Co. Pte. Ltd., a wholly-owned

subsidiary of the Company, from ‘B+’ Outlook: Stable to ‘BB-’

Outlook: Stable.

The revision in rating was triggered due to strong operating

momentum and significant reduction in the Company’s debt

levels as compared to March 2020.

E. Sustainability

The Company’s philosophy of steel production is deep rooted

in the principles of zero harm, resource efficiency, circular

economy, minimising ecological footprint and care for

community and workforce. The sustainability approach of the

Company is aligned with its overall vision to be industry leaders

in the areas of climate change, water, waste and biodiversity.

Underpinning this approach are strategies on low carbon

transition, reducing dependence on freshwater consumption,

maximising value from waste and exploring opportunities

in the circular economy, enhancing biodiversity in the areas

where the Company has its operations, building a sustainable

and resilient supply chain and customer focussed product

stewardship.

The Company has adopted the UN Sustainable Development

Goals (‘UNSDG’) and linked it with its long-term strategy and

has revised its sustainability targets. Aspirations of taking our

carbon emissions to <2tCO2/tcs, mitigating dependence on

fresh water by lowering specific fresh water consumption to

<2m3/tcs, enhancing value proposition on circular economy

and scaling up the steel recycling business are significant facets

of this strategy. Tata Steel in Europe aims to decarbonise as

required under the European regulations.

The Company is a signatory to the Task Force on Climate-

related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’) for climate change and

has identified transition risks and opportunities to decarbonise

its operations over a period of time. Specific mitigation and

contingency plans for each of the identified risks have been

integrated within the Company’s long-term strategy. Tata Steel

in Europe has embraced a target to reduce its CO2 emissions

by 30% by 2030, compared to 2018, and to achieve carbon

neutrality of its steel making operations by 2050.

The Company had identified supply chain sustainability as a

key material issue and in order to take this forward, the Tata

Steel Responsible Supply Chain Policy was adopted in February

2020. During the year under review, the Company initiatied

the deployment of the Supply Chain Policy through multiple

communications across segments of supply chain partners

to set the expectations on four important principles of the

policy viz. Fair Business Practice, Human Rights, Health and

Safety and Environment Protection. Further, the Company

also initiated third-party assessment on the compliance of the

above mentioned four principles for the critical supply chain

partners. During the year under review, the Company also

became a member of ResponsibleSteel ™ - steel industry’s first

global multi-stakeholder standard and certification initiative.

The Company is committed to serving its customers through

a portfolio of eco-friendly products and disclosure of the

Managing Director, Mr. Koushik Chatterjee, Executive

Director & Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Parvatheesam

Kanchinadham, Company Secretary & Chief Legal Officer

(Corporate & Compliance). During the year under review, there

has been no change in the Key Managerial Personnel.

Audit Committee

The Audit Committee was constituted in the year 1986. The

Committee has adopted a Charter for its functioning. The

primary objective of the Committee is to monitor and provide

effective supervision of the Management’s financial reporting

process, to ensure accurate and timely disclosures with the

highest levels of transparency, integrity and quality of financial

reporting.

The Committee comprises Mr. O. P. Bhatt (Chairman),

Mr. Aman Mehta, Dr. Peter Blauwhoff, Mr. Saurabh Agrawal,

and Mr. Deepak Kapoor. The Committee met eight times

during the year under review, the details of which are given in

the Corporate Governance Report.

During the year under review, there were no instances when

the recommendations of the Audit Committee were not

accepted by the Board.

Internal Control Systems

The Company’s internal control systems commensurate with

the nature of its business, the size, and complexity of its

operations and such internal financial controls with reference

to the Financial Statements are adequate.

Risk Management

The Company has developed and institutionalised an Enterprise

Risk Management (‘ERM’) process which is based on international

standards like Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the

Treadway Commission (‘COSO’) and ISO 31000. The Company

follows coordinated risk assurance and the ERM process is

integrated with Corporate Audit, Strategy & Business Planning,

Corporate Legal and Compliance functions. This brings further

rigour in driving the ERM process across the organisation as

well as across several TSG companies. An in-house built IT

system has been deployed across the organisation to enable

recording and review of risks through live dashboards and

real-time monitoring of data.

The Risk oversight function consists of the Board of Directors,

Risk Management Committee (‘RMC’), and Group Risk Review

Committee (‘GRRC’) to oversee the risk management policy

and provide guidelines for implementing the ERM framework

and ERM process across the Company and develop a risk

intelligent culture within the organisation. The RMC, amongst

others, reviews the key risks, progress of ERM implementation

across locations and challenges faced. During the year under

review, the RMC and the Board of Directors of the Company

approved and adopted the ‘risk appetite’ of the organisation.

The risk apetitte is aligned to the Company’s Vision and is

driven by the following:

• Health and safety of our employees and the communities in

which we operate are our prime concern and our operating

strategy is focused on the above objective.

• All business decisions are aligned to the Tata Code of

Conduct.

• Management

actions

are

focussed

on

continuous

improvement.

• Environment and Climate Change impacts are assessed on

a continuous basis and business decisions support systems

including capital allocation considers impact of climate

through the internal carbon pricing framework.

• The long-term strategy of the Company is focussed on

generating profitable growth and sustainable cashflows

that creates long-term stakeholder value.

Legal proceedings in respect of title of shares

There are certain pending cases related to disputes over title to

shares in which the Company has been made a party. However,

these cases are not material in nature.

Commodity price risk

Commodities are essential inputs to the manufacturing of

steel. The dynamic geo-political landscape and climate change

issues cause unpredictability in commodity outputs leading to

volatility in commodity prices. This is an inherent market risk

for the Company as it impacts the profitability and cash flows.

However, steel prices, follow the trend of commodity prices,

over a period which is a natural hedge to the business.

The Company meets 100% of its iron ore requirements in India,

through its captive iron ore mines and about a quarter of its

coking coal requirements from its coal mines. These captive

mines provide a structural hedge to the price risk of these

commodities.

The Company has a dedicated commodity sourcing team

which engages with key raw material producers across

the globe and the commodity market at large to optimise

sourcing. The team has identified the risk of single geography

sourcing and undertakes periodic risk assessment of the

supply chain. The team proactively works on diversification

of vendors, geographies, development of substitutes &

new products, Vendor Managed Inventory and Value-In-

Use (‘VIU’) optimisation framework to mitigate the impact

of single geography sourcing and other disruptions in the

During the financial year 2020-21, the average percentage

excluding the Key Managerial Personnel (‘KMP’) was (2.85%).

The percentage increase / (decrease) in salary of KMPs during

the increase in managerial remuneration for the year is ~28%.

The increase in managerial remuneration for financial year

2020-21 is not comparable with financial year 2019-20 owing

to there being no increase in the managerial remuneration for

financial year 2019-20 in view of economic conditions impacted

by COVID-19 pandemic wherein the Directors decided to

moderate the executive remuneration for financial year 2019-

20 to express solidarity and conserve resources.

E. Affirmations: It is affirmed that the remuneration paid to

the Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and other employees

is as per the Remuneration Policy of the Company.
