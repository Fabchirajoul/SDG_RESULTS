A Responsible &

Focused

Corporate:

Message from the Chairman: Dear Stakeholders,

The past year has been one of the

most difficult in human memory.

It has challenged businesses

like never before, pushing them

to the edge of their resilience

and capabilities. Around this

time last year, the world was

barely coming to terms with

the COVID-19 crisis. We were

trying hard to understand the

unprecedented threat it posed,

and harder still to fight back.

And yet, amidst the chaos and

the uncertainty triggered by

the pandemic, at Hindustan

Zinc, we were confident that we

would successfully overcome the

short-term challenges to emerge

stronger, and continue to deliver

value consistently to all our

stakeholders.

Today, a year on, I am happy

to say that our confidence

stands validated by an

excellent performance. Despite

the challenging operating

environment, I am proud to share

that we have delivered record

production volumes, translating

into value creation for all our

stakeholders. I am pleased to

share that during this period,

Hindustan Zinc has performed

well on all operational, financial

and non-financial aspects,

despite the operational

shutdown, restrictions and

disruptions in 2020 to combat

the spread of infections.

Needless to say, this performance

would not have been possible

without the stupendous efforts

and hard work of our people, and

the exemplary guidance of the

leadership team at Hindustan

Zinc. I would like to take this

opportunity to thank all of them

for their unwavering commitment

to the organization’s growth and

the realization of its long-term

goals and vision. Each one rose to

the occasion to contribute to the

Company’s sustainable growth

and value creation through these

tough times. Our COVID war

room, which we set up soon after

the pandemic broke out, enabled

us to resume operations in a

safe and seamless manner after

the lockdown period. Extensive

protocols were put in place to

safeguard all our employees,

including our contractors at the

workplace as well as in residential

colonies. I am happy to report

that we succeeded in ramping up

our operations to normal levels by

May 2020.

It has been our consistent and

resolute effort to strengthen the

foundation of our core operations

and our delivery on volumes,

while bringing down the cost

through various initiatives. We

successfully achieved this on

the back of our streamlined

operating processes and an

organization-wide culture of

detailed planning and efficient

execution. Our structural cost

reduction initiatives have helped

bring down costs to sustainably

low levels, while our firm focus on

free cashflow generation through

working capital optimization has

enabled us to deliver industry-

leading shareholder returns.

Even as we were all working

together towards higher

efficiencies and sustained

growth, through our dedicated

focus on our business goals,

we did not lose sight of our

corporate responsibility towards

the community at large. Nor did

we, for a moment, shift our focus

Even as we were all working together

towards higher efficiencies and

sustained growth, through our dedicated

focus on our business goals, we did not

lose sight of our corporate responsibility

towards the community at large. Nor did

we, for a moment, shift our focus away

from the Sustainability Goals that we

have identified as a key strategic priority

to guide our future journey.

Message from the Chairman:

Dear Stakeholders,

We all lived through extraordinary

stories during the pandemic

and, as the management team,

it was no different for us. The

crisis challenged us to strike a

fine balance between lives and

livelihoods, as we negotiated

our way through the problems

triggered by COVID-19. From

ensuring business continuity

amid the massive disruption

in operations resulting from

lockdown during the first wave

of the COVID-19 pandemic, we

moved quickly during the more

fatal second surge in the first

quarter of FY2022 to securing

both, lives and livelihoods.

The second wave, which hit the

country even as we were adapting

to the new norms of business,

necessitated a fresh look at our

strategic approach. While the

first COVID-19 wave had caused

large-scale absenteeism and

supply chain disruptions, thus

impacting business operations,

the second one saw considerable

loss of lives and immense

suffering for our people. Thus,

even as we continued to focus

on business continuity to protect

livelihoods, we gave healthcare

equal focus and immediately

made necessary arrangements

ranging from free hospitalization

for our employees to getting

Our unwavering focus on 3S – Safety,

Sustainability and Smart Mining,

helped us deliver unprecedented

outcomes in the form of record

volumes and profitability during

FY2021. The increased use of

cutting-edge technology and

digitalization, coupled with

continuous adoption of best

practices from across the globe,

helped us in delivering target

run-rates, while also staying at

the lower end of the global

cost curve. Innovation,

streamlining consumption,

better planning, operational

discipline, sustained cost

optimization efforts, strict

capital allocation,

favorable commodity

sourcing, redesigning and

renegotiating some of

our contracts and rigorous

benchmarking further

helped us push the

bar of excellence.:
