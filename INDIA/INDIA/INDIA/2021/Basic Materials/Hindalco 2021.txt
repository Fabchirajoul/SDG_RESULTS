Managing Director

MESSAGE FROM THE: MANAGING DIRECTOR

Recognised as a Sustainability Champion

Dear Stakeholders,

The past 18 months have been a

defining period in the history of

humankind, testing the resilience

of people, companies and countries.

The pandemic experience has also

reaffirmed Hindalco’s understanding

of business sustainability, where future

readiness means a convergence of

People, Planet and Prosperity.

For years, we have been working to

build a greener tomorrow in line with

our commitment to reduce our footprint

on the environment. And we continue

to consistently create value for the

prosperity and wellbeing of all our

stakeholders, including our people

and communities.

Despite the pandemic-induced volatility

in business environment, Hindalco

marked some significant milestones.

We were recognised as the World’s

Most Sustainable Alumunium Company

by the S&P Dow Jones Sustainability

Indices 2020. We completed the

acquisition of Aleris – a major milestone

on our path to global leadership in the

Aluminium sector. The association has

already accelerated synergistic benefits

through the year and has added to the

top line and EBITDA.

Health and safety being our top priority,

we instituted new processes to protect

our employees across positions and to

support the community.

Hindalco recognises the dedication and

hard work of our people that ensured

an efficient and consistent functioning

of our business operations through

the pandemic.

A strong performance

During the year, we delivered a

strong financial and operational

performance bolstered by operational

efficiencies, a robust risk management

framework and a sustainable business

model. Our consolidated business

EBITDA was ` 18,896 Crore, up by

22% percent year-on-year and we

reported a consolidated PAT on our

continuing business of ` 5,182 Crore,

up by 38% percent on a year-on-year

basis. These results were driven by

the strong and stable performance

of our India operations and a record

performance by Novelis.

This was also an outcome of our

cost-saving actions, enhanced product

mix and lower input costs. We continued

to strengthen our balance sheet and

brought down the consolidated Net

Debt-to-EBITDA to 2.59 times at the

end of the financial year from a peak

of 3.83 times at the end of June 2020

after closing the acquisition of Aleris.

The Aleris acquisition is a key step

towards the diversification of our

downstream portfolio into certain

premium market segments, particularly

aerospace. Post the acquisition, this

year proved to be remarkable for

Novelis (+Aleris) as it delivered its

best performance.

We crossed some significant financial

milestones, clocking the highest-ever:

• Shipments of 3,613 Kt

• Adjusted EBITDA of $1,714 million

at Novelis

• Adjusted EBITDA/tonne of $474

at Novelis

Our India downstream strategy of

reducing our exposure to the global

Aluminium price fluctuations and

increasing the share of value-added

products (VAP) across businesses is

playing out well.

During the year, more than 80% of

Hindalco’s consolidated EBITDA

was delinked from the volatility

of the global Aluminium prices.

Our efforts have led to an increase

in the share of VAP to total metals

with Aluminium VAP sales going up

year after year. Our Silvassa extrusion

facility announced this year is another

step towards increasing the share

of VAP. This plant will service the

fast-growing market for extruded

Aluminium products in the western

and southern regions of India.

Our foray into the new generation of

high strength Aluminium, which would

not have been possible without the

support of our R&D team, has enabled

us to extend innovative product

offerings in the automobile sector.

In our Copper business, the shift

towards value added products

continues. We are focusing on

expansion in the Copper CCR capacity

and venturing into newer products

like Copper inner grooved tubes used

in AC coils and refrigerators.

Our performance is entirely due to

the dedication and efforts of our

people and I would like to thank every

one at Hindalco for your relentless

pursuit of the Company’s goals and

objectives. I am also immensely

grateful and proud of the way Team

Hindalco has navigated the challenges

of the past year with resolve and

commitment. It is a testament to the fact

that no challenge is too big for us.

I am pleased to share with you the

report for FY 2020-21, which is also

our first Integrated Annual Report,

detailing the value creation approach

for our stakeholders. I welcome your

valuable feedback and seek your

continued support.

Satish Pai: Managing

Managing Director, and the

Committee is responsible for reviewing

the organisation’s risk management

processes. Through the Risk

Management Committee, the senior

management periodically reviews

the Risk Management Framework.

Operational risks and challenges are

identified by site-level risk teams.

Our Risk Evaluation Framework

focusses on understanding the

likelihood/possibility of a risk event

and the severity of the impact of

that risk event. The risk reporting

tool classifies consequences into

incidental, minor, moderate, major

and extreme and categorises likelihood

into rare, unlikely, possible, likely

and expected. The identified risks

are plotted in a matrix based on the

aforementioned parameters.

Trainings specific to the ERM process

are also provided to the management.

This gives non-executive directors an

understanding of the risk management

framework of Hindalco as well as

the ongoing risks and those that can

emerge in the future. In addition to

this, the risk management function

is structurally independent of the

business lines.

Sensitivity analysis is done on strategic

risks and forex & commodity risks, as

well as plant wise operational risks

and risks of non-compliance. We also

conducted stress testing and sensitivity

analysis of the risk of COVID -19 at our

respective sites.

At the Company-level risk assessment

also includes the life-cycle

environmental impacts of our products

and external climate change related

activities. At the asset level, risk is

assessed based both on the potential

for future growth and operational risks.

We continuously assess the exposure

of our facilities to climate change

related impacts.

Risk Management Process

describe key risks and use

Developing measures and

actions to eliminate, manage

or reduce the identified risks to

RISK MONITERING

AND REPORTING

Risk culture, monitoring and

reporting

Senior executives are accountable

for enterprise risk management for

their respective areas of oversight

and implementation of risk

management ensuring compliance to

risk procedure. As a part of the process,

the business unit or functional leader

is responsible to select a Risk Champion

who owns the risk management

process at a functional level. We have

started conducting refresher course on

Risk Management for all employees

across all our sites to build a strong

culture of risk management across

operational aspects.

We are in the process of augmenting

our risk management capability by

taking measures such as appointing

Risk Champions at each site, sharing

templates of risk registers with each

department and directly approaching

the central risk management team.

Risk reporting by an employee is

being acknowledged by the organisation

and is also accounted during the

annual appraisal process. There is a

formal procedure in place to involve

employees to proactively identify

and report potential risks throughout

the organisation.

Our initiatives allow employees to

voice concerns without the fear of

retaliation. There exists a continuous

feedback mechanism via workshops

and via risk champions. This helps to

receive feedback from employees on

the risk management practices and

approach used to spread awareness

on risk management.

As part of product development process,

criteria around risk management are

incorporated during every stage of the

process. This includes a detailed exercise

to map common and latent risks, assess

their impact on project schedule, costs,

manpower and resource requirements,

to devise measures for risk prevention

and mitigation.

our role in driving change

unprecedented times has

posed a challenge to many

aspects related to life on

we continue to integrate environmental

aspects through every aspect of

our value chain. Issues such as GHG

us to act in a manner which would

accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (IND AS) as notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

Standalone full year highlights

Your Company registered a revenue of ` 42,701 crores for the fiscal year 2021 vs ` 40,242 crores in the previous year up 6%

on account of higher global prices of aluminium and copper in FY21 versus FY20. EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax,

Depreciation and Amortisation) stood at ` 4,884 crores, up 11% compared to the last year, on account of higher profitability

in Aluminium business supported by improved macros, cost optimization and a strong market recovery, partially offset by

lower profitability in copper business impacted by lockdown due to COVID and lower TC/RC in FY21. Depreciation was flat

Year on Year at ` 1708 crore in FY21 versus FY20. The Finance Cost was lower on Year by 13% at ` 1,469 crores in FY21 versus

` 1,679 crores in FY20. This reduction in finance cost was mainly due to overall reduction in the average cost of long-term loans

on account of re-financing. The Profit before Tax (and Before Exceptional Items) stood at ` 1,567 crore, up by 54% compared

to the previous year due to higher EBITDA. Net Profit for FY21 stood at ` 993 crores as compared to ` 620 crore up 60% Year

on Year compared to the previous year.

Consolidated Full Year Highlights

Hindalco’s Consolidated Revenue stood at ` 1,31,985 crore for FY21 compared to ` 1,18,144 crore in the previous year up 12%

on account of higher global prices of aluminium and copper in FY21 versus FY20. The Company recorded consolidated

EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation) of ` 18,896 crore, up by 22% due to favorable macro

and lower input costs in FY21 versus FY20. Consolidated Profit before Tax (and Before Exceptional Items) was ` 8,397 crore

in FY21, up by 35% compared to the previous year on account of higher EBITDA and lower interest costs. Net Profit after Tax

in FY21, stood at ` 3,483 crores compared to ` 3,767 crores in the previous year down 8% Year on Year mainly on account of

loss due to discontinued operations in FY21 due to loss booked on the divestiture of automotive assets in Aleris business

acquired by Novelis during the year. For detailed analysis, refer to the Management Discussion and Analysis section of the

Integrated Annual Report.

Highlights of the Company’s Subsidiaries:

1.

Utkal Alumina International Limited

Utkal Alumina revenues were ` 2,764 crore in FY21 compared to ` 2,653 crore in FY20 up by 4% because of higher transfer

pricing compared to last year on account of higher average global alumina prices in FY21 versus FY20.

“India’s COVID case load has been the highest. We are all collectively struggling to stem this extremely challenging,

and huge calamity. The Government, NGOs, corporates and other key stakeholders, have coalesced to bring COVID

relief measures. Even at the cost of being repetitive, let us acknowledge our nation’s doctors, medical and paramedical

workers. They have and continue, to go beyond the line of duty, to bring succor to the COVID afflicted. Our population

and the size of our country is beyond comparison. Enormous challenges confront us. We can overcome them with a

strong sense of solidarity.

I would like to apprise you of the various initiatives we have taken through multiple channels. I will focus on the relief

measures executed by us at FICCI Aditya Birla CSR Centre for Excellence, we took cognizance, of the immediate needs

that were COVID driven. First and foremost, was the need to address the problem of getting food for the marginalized.

We worked with ISKON, and distributed cooked meals, for lunch and supper in Delhi, Mumbai, and Noida. We reached

out to thousands of families. Likewise, we distributed ration kits, in partnership with Goonj, to thousands of families

in 11 states. We arranged for 90,000 PPE kits, for frontline health workers in six states. COVID-19 is also a livelihood

disaster. More so for the informal sector workers, migrants, small land holding farmers, returnee migrants, villages

youths and tribal women. So, with the Nudge Foundation, we launched a 3-year project, themed on “Creating Resilient

Communities” in Odisha, West Bengal, Delhi NCR, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Maharashtra. We have

impacted 4 lakh families.

If you recall we had already shared with you the immediate COVID steps taken after the outbreak of the pandemic.

Besides contributing over Rs.500 crore, we tried to address related issues at every level. Here is an update:

•

Providing 3,000 jumbo oxygen cylinders pan India

•

We have ordered 10 oxygen Pressure Swing Adsorption plants. Of these, three PSA plants have been delivered

(Gujarat and eastern UP). These plants produce 100 litres of oxygen every 60 seconds and are integral to meet the

oxygen shortage.

•

1,000 oxygen concentrators supplied by Novelis

•

750 concentrators based on the Hub & Spoke model have been instituted in the major state’s capitals, which then

pan out to the smaller towns

•

500 oxygen concentrators supplied to various hospitals and communities across locations

•

300 oxygen cylinders refilled by Hindalco and supplied to hospitals in UP daily, after reviving the defunct Karahiya

oxygen plant in Anpara, Sonebhadra

•

In addition, liquid oxygen plants are on stream across the nation at our plant sites. To give you a feel, the Birla

Copper Plant in Dahej, has been supplying ~ 50 tonnes of liquid oxygen day in and day out to bridge the gap. Up

until now 1,600 tonnes of liquid oxygen has been supplied to the Gujarat Government

•

Furthermore, specially designed 40 mobile ambulances are in service all over the country

•

More than 500 beds have been earmarked across locations

•

Proactive engagements with local communities, and other stakeholders, is an ongoing activity

•

More than a million triple layer surgical masks, have been distributed, along with tens of thousands of personal

We have built 3 school buildings (Belagavi and Taloja) and

repaired 13 school buildings (Renukoot, Renusagar and

Belagavi). At several schools, sanitation facilities were

constructed and drinking water facilities were set up (Nitale

Manpada Primary school, Taloja).

SDG-5: Women empowerment and gender equality

Our 2000 self-help groups comprising of 24,860 women

enthusiasts have all been transformed into competent and

confident women, engaged in meaningful work that earns

them a livelihood.

A special mention must be made of the “Kosala Livelihood

and Social Foundation”, a not-for-profit company. This

subsidiary of Hindalco has been spawned to mentor women

in the art of making textiles including sarees from Kosa silk.

More importantly, reviving the ancient Kosa silk art form of

Chhattisgarh. The project is housed at Gare Palma and currently

encompasses 35 women from the villages surrounding our

mines. There is a lot of excitement around the Gera Palma

project. The women reelers who produce the yarn from cocoon

and the weavers involved in the intricate weaving process

based on specified designs now feel self-assured in the sense

of long-term sustainability.

It might interest you to learn that the first set of sarees

and fabric material produced by them evoked encouraging

response. During Diwali and New Year, despite the pandemic

the Kosala project revenue was nearly ` 30 lakhs, generating

a lot of hope and optimism.

The sixth, seventh and eighth SDGs, center on water and

sanitation, reliable, sustainable, modern energy, decent

work and economic growth.

Towards providing accessibility to safe drinking water, up

until now we have installed 27 Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants.

This year we put up 5 RO plants, 24 handpumps, repaired 245

handpumps and dug wells. Pipelines and borewells provide

access to water, benefiting more than 76,000 villagers.

Additionally, 1,652 individual toilets and sanitation facilities

were set-up and facilitated at various locations. Consequently,

95% of the villages where we operate have been declared ODF.

Imparting vocational training, skills training, coupled with our

farm / non-farm-based programmes and SHGs, meet with

these goals. Collectively we have touched the lives of nearly

3,541 people.

At the Aditya Birla Rural Technology Park (ABRTP), Muirpur

and Aditya Birla Skill Centre (ABSC), Dhanupali more than 14

training batches were organised. The thrust continues to be on

computer literacy, training in repair of electric and electronic

goods, handicrafts, bag making, beautician, tailoring and

knitting, ways to enhance agricultural output, and veterinary

science. This year 149 aspirants were trained. At ABRTP on

capacity building, 15 additional programmes were held,

registering 722 participants. Our veterinary services were

availed by 2,629 farmers.

SDG-9: Build resilient infrastructure

Our infrastructure projects: connectivity, road repairs,

community halls and assets, rest places, installation of solar

lights, construction of water tanks and installation of piped

water supply, have bettered the lives of 83,430 people.

Finally, on Model Villages. Of the 611 villages in our CSR

projects, 102 villages have been earmarked for a transformative

process. Up until now, 35 villages have made the cut. Impact

assessment studies by external agencies have certified

commended the transformation of these villages.

aim even higher.
