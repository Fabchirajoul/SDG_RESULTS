Letter to

Shareholders: Dear Shareholders,

The COVID-19 pandemic has touched

every aspect of our lives across

the world. It has altered mindsets,

perceptions, and strategies for

businesses and beyond. If there is one

abiding lesson, it is that sustainable

growth and development involves

holistic nurturing of human, natural, and

financial capital. 2020 is a year that will

only gain in significance when viewed

through the perspective lens of time.

The Global Economy

The world has been fighting the Covid-19 pandemic

for more than a year now, and the struggle has had

deleterious economic effects. In 2020, the global

economy contracted by 3.3%, the largest contraction

on record, at least since World War II. Much of it was

concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year FY21, as

several countries enforced strict lockdowns. Economies

bounced back – albeit at differentiated speeds – in

subsequent quarters, on the back of large fiscal stimulus

packages, especially in the developed countries,

restocking demand after dilution of lockdowns, and

improved confidence levels following the start of

vaccination programmes. As per the recent forecasts

from International Monetary Fund (IMF), the US and

China are expected to record a strong recovery in 2021,

resulting in a net positive expansion of their economies

over the 2019 levels. These two engines of growth are

expected to boost demand for exports from other

countries. Even the other two large economies, the EU

and Japan, are expected to expand.

In response to the pandemic, central banks resorted to

strongly supportive monetary policies in most developed

economies, causing interest rates to go down to record

lows. At the same time, another consequence of this

policy has been a surfeit of liquidity. That has led to

Financial statements:

Dear Stakeholders,

FY21 was a year of unprecedented

challenges for India and the world. For

Grasim, it was also year of reaffirmation of

our abilities to withstand odds and move

forward with precision and clarity. As the

COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the way of

life, we decided to leverage our strengths

to drive breakthrough improvements, while

staying nimble to navigate the uncertainty

around.

We rationalised our costs, continued

innovating for customers, pursued our

expansion projects, sharpened focus on

our ESG goals and delivered our best-

ever results in the latter part of the year

overcoming such strong headwinds. We

also announced our foray into the Paints

segment, envisaging a key position in

the market. Staying true to our 74-year

legacy while being agile like a new-age

enterprise, we retained our leadership

across businesses, reinforcing the resilience

and reflecting the true character of a

Stronglomerate.

Message from the: Managing Director

As the year progressed, demand picked up for textiles, aided

inventory restocking and led to a huge uptick in sales. EBITDA

improved significantly, largely driven by lower costs on the

back of robust fixed cost control initiatives.

For Chemicals, realisations were very weak in the first quarter

while input costs remained unchanged, weighing heavily

on the margins. This was partially offset by higher demand

arising from disinfectant and hygiene products and other

chlorine based value-added products. A more conducive

demand scenario down the year led to higher capacity

utilisation in both the Chlor Alkali and Epoxy businesses,

backed by positive cost tailwind.

Growth plans and key

projects on track

Even as we took on the operational and business challenges

with rigour, we maintained our focus on future growth plans.

Line 1 and Line 2 of our Vilayat expansion are expected to

be commissioned in Q2 and Q3 of FY22, respectively. Once

complete, this would take our overall VSF capacity to 810

KTPA. Similarly, our expansions and maintenance projects in

Balabhadrapuram, Vilayat and Rehla will provide us

1,457 KTPA caustic soda capacity by FY22. In addition, we

increased our overall capex outlay for FY21 to `1,852 Crore.

The year also saw us enter an exclusive partnership with

Lubrizol Advanced Materials (a Berkshire Hathaway company)

to set up the world’s largest single-site resin capacity

at Vilayat. The agreement would give exclusive CPVC

manufacturing rights to Grasim.

With an objective to contribute to India’s decarbonisation

drive and help fight climate change, we also augmented our

solar portfolio, as part of Aditya Birla Renewables. The total

capacity of our solar business now stands at 502 MW.

ESG focus – a key differentiator

At Grasim, we operate a sustainable value chain led by one of

the most biodegradable products with negligible end-of-life

footprint, technological innovations focused on circularity

and green chemistry, sustainable sourcing and environment-

friendly processes that are aligned with best-in-class global

standards and responsible manufacturing norms. We

received the prestigious ‘Golden Peacock Global Award for

Sustainability’, and were ranked 11 on the S&P DJSI sectoral

indices in 2020. Our sustainability initiatives have been

covered by the renowned Ivy Publisher and is now a Harvard

Business School case study. We continue to lead the global

industry in sustainable pulp sourcing, ranking #1 in Canopy’s

Hot Button report and have been accorded the ‘dark

green shirt’.

The pandemic strengthened our symbiotic relationship

with customers and communities, as we ensured business

continuity for our customers in uncertain times and

passionately supported our communities in fighting the

pandemic. For our employees, we ensured that their health

and wellbeing remained our topmost priority, and constantly

engaged with them, albeit virtually, to keep the teams

motivated and help them overcome anxiety/mental stress.

This year our community commitments were strengthened

further in the wake of the pandemic, with our overall

CSR expenditure touching all time high way ahead of the

mandated norms and creating large-scale impact across our

core intervention areas.

We also made significant strides towards our environmental

goals. We were able to implement the EU BAT technology

for VSF manufacturing in Vilayat, and reduced air emissions

and water intensity compared to the FY17 baseline. We

introduced products such as Cavallo by Linen Club, which

utilises flax waste to create fashionable textiles.

Living the legacy

As we enter into a new financial year with renewed hope and

optimism, I can say with utmost confidence that we have

emerged stronger and wiser from this crisis, which will set us

for future growth. A key marker of our success is definitely

the way you have always reposed faith in Grasim, for almost

seven-and-a-half decades. Your confidence, aspirations and

expectations provide us the strength to move forward and

set new benchmarks in financial and ESG performance.

Our Conclusion

On the basis of our reviews carried out as per ‘Limited Assurance

Engagement of ISAE 3000’, nothing has come to our attention that

causes us not to believe that the data has been presented fairly,

in material respects, in keeping with the GRI Standards for the

specified sustainability indicators.

accountants. The guidance related to network firms was updated in July 2006.

Our assurance team and independence

Our assurance team, comprising of multidisciplinary professionals,

has been drawn from our climate change and sustainability

network and undertakes similar engagements with a number of

significant Indian and international businesses. As an assurance

provider, EY is required to comply with the independence

requirements set out in International Federation of Accountants

(IFAC) Code of Ethics1 for Professional Accountants. EY’s

Liquidity Risk:

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at reasonable

price. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability

of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due. The Company’s treasury team is

responsible for managing liquidity, funding as well as settlement. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are

overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company’s liquidity position through rolling forecasts and long

range business forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.

The table below provides details of financial liabilities and investments at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted

4.2 Pursuant to the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019, a new Section 115BAA was inserted in the Incometax Act, 1961, which

provides an option to the domestic companies to pay income tax at lower rate, subject to the giving up of certain incentives

and deductions. The Company and its subsidiary, Ultratech Cement Limited (UltraTech) is continuing to provide for income tax

at old rates, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and various exemptions and deductions available to the

Company under the Income-tax Act, 1961. However, the Company and UltraTech had applied the lower income tax rates on the

deferred tax assets/liabilities to the extent these are expected to be realised or settled in the future period when the Group

may be subjected to lower tax rate and accordingly reversed opening net deferred tax liability with a one-time corresponding

credit of C 2,350.20 Crore under deferred tax for the year ended 31st March 2020. While some of its subsidiaries, joint ventures

and associates had availed the option to pay income tax at the lower rate. Consequently, wherever applicable, the opening

deferred tax asset/liabilities had been measured at the lower rate, with a one-time corresponding debit of C 15.89 Crore and

credit of C 353.98 Crore under deferred tax and share in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investees to the Statement of Profit

and Loss, respectively.

4.3 SCHEME OF ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND GRASIM PREMIUM FABRICS PRIVATE LIMITED

(GPFPL) (IND AS 103)

The Company and Grasim Premium Fabrics Private Limited (“GPFPL”) a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (previously

known as Soktas India Private Limited) had filed a Scheme of Arrangement (the Scheme) with National Company Law Tribunal

(NCLT), Indore and Mumbai Bench respectively for amalgamation of GPFPL with the Company with effective from 01st April

2019 (the Appointed Date). The Scheme was sanctioned by NCLT, Indore Bench vide its order dated 12th November 2020 as

amended by order dated 28th January 2021. The Scheme was also sanctioned by NCLT, Mumbai bench vide order dated 23rd

March 2021. However certified true copy of the order of NCLT, Mumbai is awaited, hence the same is not yet filed by GPFPL

with concerned Registrar of Companies and therefore the Scheme has not yet become effective. Since all the requisite

approvals have been received and only procedural part of filing the certified copy of the NCLT order is pending, the effect of

amalgamation of GPFPL with the Company w.e.f. appointed date i.e. 1st April 2019 has been incorporated in the standalone

financials. This does not have any impact in the consolidated financial statements except for additional tax credit of C 20.68

Crore recognised consequent to this amalgamation.

letter and other loan securing documents agrees with its customers on collateral

security to be provided by the customers in secured loan exposures that are subject to credit risk. Collateral security enables

us to recover all or part of the outstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral asset provided, in cases where the borrower

is unable or unwilling to fulfil its primary obligations.

Collateral security accepted could be in the form of:

a)

Financial collateral in the form of pledge of equity shares, units of mutual funds, assignment of life insurance policies;

b)

Current assets in the form of inventories meant for sale or receivables arising out of the sale of finished goods;

c)

Fixed asset (in the form of immovable properties – real estate, Plant and Machinery, Equipment’s);

d)

Third-party obligation (in the form of Irrevocable Unconditional Guarantee issued by Bank, Third party);

e)

Risk participation from Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE); and

f)

Assignment of borrower’s rights and interests under agreements with third parties.

In addition, we also stipulates escrow of cash flows and a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) for project loans. Collateral

serves to mitigate the inherent risk of credit loss in an exposure, by either improving recoveries in the event of a default or

substituting the borrower.

As part of the assessment of a credit transaction the availability, adequacy and suitability of collateral for the transaction

is evaluated and decided upon. The processes includes verification of the title to the collateral offered and valuation by

technical experts where warranted. We accept as collateral only securities of good quality and have in place legally effective

and enforceable documentation.

For guarantee’s taken, the guarantor’s creditworthiness is assessed during the credit assessment process of the transaction.

We have collateral type specific haircuts in place which are reviewed at intervals as appropriate to the type of collateral.

The NBFC and HFC recognises that collateral can be a credit mitigant (alternative source of repayment), but does not replace

or dilute the underwriting standards the company adopts to underwrite credit exposures.”

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the NBFC & HFC will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial

liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the

NBFC & HFC might be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of

the cash flows under both normal and stress circumstances.

Total Trade receivables as on 31st March 2021 is C 4,114.20 Crore (excluding C 227.58 Crore of Insurance and NBFC/HFC

Business) [31st March 2020 (Restated): C 5,425.20 Crore (excluding C 367.86 Crore of Insurance and NBFC/HFC Business)].

Given the diverse nature of the Group’s businesses trade receivables are spread over a number of customers with no significant

concentration of credit risk. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Group’s net sales or for any of the Group’s

primary businesses during the current year and in the Previous Year. Therefore, the Group does not expect any material risk

on account of non-performance by any of its counter parties.

As per simplified approach, the Group makes provision of expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision matrix

to mitigate the risk of default in payments and makes appropriate provision at each reporting date, wherever outstanding is

for longer period and involves higher risk.

The ageing analysis of the receivables (net of provision) has been considered from the date the invoice falls due.
