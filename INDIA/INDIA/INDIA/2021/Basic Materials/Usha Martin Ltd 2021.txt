A detailed discussion on review of operations of the Company has

part of this Report.

Update on COVID-19 Pandemic

The entire global economy faced unprecedented disruption due to

outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic during the year under review and

its disruptive impact is still being continued with renewed vigour.

Though the impact of outbreak of the pandemic on the performance

of the Company is not possible to quantify in terms of statistics,

however such global outbreak has resulted in an unprecedented

interruption in supply chain, halted production and lock-down and

had an obvious impact on the overall performance of the Company.

The Company continues to follow stringent safety protocols to

ensure wellbeing of its employees and is in continuous process

of dynamically adopting to the ever changing global and domestic

macro-economic environment as and when the same is required

due to this outbreak of the pandemic.

Dividend & Reserves

The Board of Directors has decided that it would be prudent not to

recommend dividend for the year under review nor do they propose

to carry any amount to reserves.

Outlook and Business

Due to the rapid spread of the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic

globally, the uncertainties in growth of key sectors are high and

hence the outlook with respect to market dynamics is uncertain

and unpredictable. The Company is gearing itself up to deal with

all possible opportunities and adversaries during these uncertain

times.

However, global demand for the oil and offshore market saw

improvement during the year under review which in turn boosted

the demand for speciality rope products of the Company catering

to the said sector. It is expected that the demand from the said

sector shall sustain in the next fiscal and is expected to provide

business opportunities to the Company. Further with steady

infrastructure spending by the government, speciality products

used in construction and infrastructural sector may be growth

drivers for the Company.

respect of resource use (energy, water, raw material

etc.) per unit of product (optional):

Bare Rope resulted in reduction of steel and grease consumption during production.

b) Reduction during usage by consumers (energy,

water) has been achieved since the previous

The Company has an adequate vendor management system and takes proper measures

for identification and assessment of suppliers. Raw material, packing material and

transportation services are sourced from approved suppliers. The Company endeavors

to source its supplies in such a manner so as to minimise freight cost and avoid

uncertainty. This also helps in improving/developing socio economic conditions including

increase of employment, gives cost advantage in sourcing and also leads to lower diesel

consumption, which in turn, reduces air pollution and helps conserve natural resources.

4.

Has the Company taken any steps to procure goods

and services from local & small producers, including

communities surrounding their place of work?

a) If yes, what steps have been taken to improve

their capacity and capability of local and small

vendors?

To make the local and small producers an integral part of the supply chain, the

Company procures certain material from local manufacturers surrounding the plant.

Various training programmes for capacity and capability development are organised to

encourage local vendors. Regular technical and design related guidance are imparted to

develop manufacturing skills to meet the standards. Further, one to one meetings with

suppliers are organised as and when required.

Managing Director

Mr. P.K.Jain, Joint: Managing

Managing Director and certain other Officers under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860 for

allegedly trying to influence ongoing CBI investigation pertaining to the above proceedings. The Company strongly refutes the

aforesaid allegations made by the CBI. The matter is under investigation and the designated CBI Court has not taken cognisance

of the interim charge sheet filed by the CBI due to lack of sanction which is awaited. The Company has been providing information

sought by the CBI in this regard. The Company intends to take such legal measures as may be considered necessary based

on the outcome of the ongoing investigation. Supported by a legal opinion obtained, management believes that the Company

has a strong case in its favour on merit and law.

40. The outbreak of Corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic globally and in India is causing significant disturbance and slowdown of economic activity.

The Company’s operations and revenue during the period were also impacted due to COVID-19. The Company has taken into account the

possible impact of COVID-19 in preparation of the audited standalone financial statements, including its assessment of recoverability of the

carrying value of property, plant and equipment, investments and deferred tax assets based on internal and external information upto the

date of approval of these audited standalone financial statements and current indicators of future economic conditions. Further, management

has assessed its liquidity position as on 31st March, 2021 and does not anticipate any challenge in the Company’s ability to continue as a

going concern. The impact of the pandemic may be different from that as estimated as at the date of approval of these standalone financial

statements and the management continues to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.

41. The Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on 20th May 2021, has approved the scheme of arrangement for capital

reduction and reorganisation pursuant to the provisions of Section 230 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.

audit report which is as under:

On 11st March 2020, the World Health Organization declared

the Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak as a pandemic in

recognition of its rapid spread across the globe. The COVID-19

of the COVID-19 on the financial statements for the year ended

statements as the situation is still evolving and the uncertainty

of the outcome of the current events. It is, however, certain

that Thailand and worldwide measures against spread of the

COVID-19 will have effects on the Company’s future revenues

and operations. The Company will continuously monitor the

impact of COVID-19 on its future financial position and financial

**Includes demand aggregating to Rs. 1,730 lakhs (31st March, 2020: Rs. 1,730 lakhs) received by the Company towards entry tax in West Bengal

and Punjab. Subsequent to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, vide order dated 11th November, 2016, upholding the rights of State

Governments to impose entry tax, the Company has filed petitions before the Hon’ble High Courts of the aforesaid States and also Jharkhand on

grounds that entry tax imposed by respective State legislations is discriminatory in nature. Pending decisions by the Hon’ble High Courts, the

Company’s obligation, if any, towards entry tax is not ascertainable. Based on legal opinion obtained, management believes that there will be no

resultant adverse impact on the Company.

#The Company had given an undertaking to deposit Rs. 1,922 lakhs in six instalments in terms of the order of the Hon’ble High Court of Jharkand.

Against the same, the Company has deposited an amount of Rs. 1,922 lakhs upto 31st March, 2020.

Managing Director

Mr. P.K.Jain, Joint: Managing

Managing Director and certain other Officers under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the Indian Penal Code,

1860 for allegedly trying to influence ongoing CBI investigation pertaining to the above proceedings. The Company strongly

refutes the aforesaid allegations made by the CBI. The matter is under investigation and the designated CBI Court has not

taken cognizance of the interim charge sheet filed by the CBI due to lack of sanction which is awaited. The Company has been

providing information sought by the CBI in this regard. The Company intends to take such legal measures as may be considered

necessary based on the outcome of the ongoing investigation. Supported by a legal opinion obtained, management believes

that the Company has a strong case on merit and law.

44. The outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic globally and in India is causing significant disturbance and slowdown of economic

activity. The Group’s operations and revenue during the period were also impacted due to COVID-19. In many countries, businesses

were being forced to cease or limit their operations for long or indefinite period of time. Measures have been taken to contain the

spread of the virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures of non-essential services which has triggered

significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown and uncertainties pertaining to future operations

of their businesses.

The COVID-19 pandemic and its disruption of industrial production have impacted wire and wire ropes production in certain markets

including Thailand. The Group’s component in that geography has, however, been able to manage the challenges faced by it due to

the pandemic and hence, businesses have continued to operate at normal capacities. The Board of Directors of the Group’s Thailand

component has made an initial assessment, based on the current situation, of the likely impact of the pandemic on overall economic

environment and wire and wire-ropes industry, in particular, based on which it expects the wire and wire-ropes demand to stabilize

in due course. Based on projections of the component’s performance and a strong cash position, the Board does not anticipate any

challenge in the component’s ability to continue as a going concern or meeting its financial obligations. The component has additionally,

on a prudent basis, assessed existence of any indication of impairment of carrying values of property, plant and equipment at the

year-end in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 36 – Impairment of Assets and concluded that no indications of impairment

exist as at the reporting date.:
