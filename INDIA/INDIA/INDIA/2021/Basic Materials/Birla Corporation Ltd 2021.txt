Due to COVID-19 situation, there have been several restrictions imposed by the Governments across the globe on the travel, goods movement

and transportation considering public health and safety measures, which had impact on the Company's normal business operations by way of

interruption in production, supply chain disruption, unavailability of personnel etc. during the lockdown period. As per our current assessment, no

signiicant impact on carrying amounts of inventories, intangible assets, trade receivables, investments and other inancial assets is expected as on

the balance sheet date. The impact assessment of COVID-19 is a continuing process given the uncertainties associated with its nature and duration.

The company will continue to monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.

61

The Code on Social Security, 2020 which received the President’s assent on 28th September 2020 subsumes nine laws relating to Social security,

retirement and employee beneits, including the Provident Fund and Gratuity. The efective date of the Code and rules thereunder are yet to be

notiied. The impact of the changes, if any, will be assessed and recognised post notiication of the relevant provisions.

62

Previous year igures have been regrouped/ rearranged/ reclassiied wherever necessary. Further, there are no material regroupings/ reclassiications

during the year.
