Managing Director,

Mr. Rajendra Gogri, has been a speaker at various

events over the last few months, advising peers as a

thought leader on how best to respond to the rapid

changes caused by the pandemic.

Credit facility

We extended credit support, either with number of credit

days or credit limits, for customers and distributors who

required financial support.

Hydroxychloroquine manufacture

When Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was in demand, we

Dear Shareholders,

It has been a year of unprecedented

challenges and I fervently hope that

you and your family are keeping well.

Millions of lives have been lost during

the year and livelihoods affected.

Both the global as well as the Indian

economy have borne the brunt of

this loss, slipping into a temporary

recession in H1 FY 2020-21. Some

green shoots became visible from

Q3 of the year. However, the second

wave of COVID-19 turned out to

be more devastating than the first,

leading to intermittent lockdowns in

several states and disruptions along

the supply chain. It was not before

sometime around June 2021 that

the number of COVID cases began to

decline and the pace of vaccination

in India picked up. I personally believe

that the worst is behind us, and we

are poised to witness a steady growth

from here onwards as the rate of

infection further comes down and

we are able to build herd immunity as

more and more people get vaccinated.

Taking Care of our People

We, at Aarti industries, are committed

to 'Care' for our people, environment,

society and other stakeholders.

Committed to 'Care', we provided

medical and financial assistance to

COVID-affected employees, including

contractual staff, and their family

members. We identified healthcare

facilities near our locations to ensure

easy access to medical help for our

employees and workmen. Currently

97% of our employees have been

vaccinated. Other initiatives included

setting up of a dedicated COVID

care centre in collaboration with our

NGO partner at Vapi, distribution of

COVID-19 essentials such as medical

equipments, PPT kits, sanitisers and

oxygen cylinder etc. Additionally, we

distributed foodgrain to daily-wage

earners in the nearby communities.

With these focused initiatives, we

touched more than 45,000 lives.

Performance Review

I am happy to report that despite the

challenging external environment

during FY 2020-21, AIL demonstrated

phenomenal resilience. While our

gross revenues grew by over 8%

Y-o-Y to `5,023 crores, our exports

witnessed a spike of over 11% Y-o-Y to

`2,186 crores. EBIDTA grew marginally

at `982 crores. During the year, a

notice of termination in respect of

one of our long-term contracts was

given by a customer due to change in

the customer's strategy. Our pharma

business continued to see both growth

and margin expansion on the back of

better operating leverage from higher

volumes and our focus on regulated

markets and value-added products.

We are committed to our strategic

expansion plans and are on track to grow

our capacities. We have a robust pipeline

of new products under development

and are focusing on enhancing the

share of value-added products in our

portfolio to gain more prominence

in the global market. With continued

investments in R&D, focus on sustainable

production and improvement of our

internal competencies in line with global

best practices, I am sure we will ensure

long-term growth for the Company. In

fact, despite the challenges this year, we

invested over `1,300 crores in capex, 14%

more than last year. We also supported

our people, by enabling work-from-home

and providing necessary medical support

to them and their families. We remained

committed to employees by giving them

Sustainable and inclusive

growth have been our

core objectives since

inception, which is also

reflected in our values

of care, integrity and

excellence.
