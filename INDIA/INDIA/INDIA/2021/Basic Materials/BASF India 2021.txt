Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

I write this message to you against the backdrop of a receding second wave of the COVID-19

pandemic. Unlike the first, the second wave has been far more aggressive in its intensity and

geographic spread leading to a tremendous impact on the nation, its citizens and economy. The

national lockdown during April and May 2020 resulted in various operational and supply chain

challenges that your Company was able to mitigate by establishing stringent safe operating

protocols at its sites and offices. The measures adopted at our manufacturing sites coupled with

the resilience and commitment demonstrated by our team enabled the Company to successfully

meet the strong demand from our customers in the second half of the financial year.

Your Company undertook various measures addressing the health and welfare of its employees, their

families, and the communities in which we operate. As a preventive measure, we actively promoted

vaccination amongst our employees and organized dedicated camps at our manufacturing sites

and offices, wherever possible. In addition, your Company donated lifesaving medical equipment,

oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators to augment the medical infrastructure in the vicinity

of our facilities. We partnered with industry players to install three state-of-the-art mobile acute

care units that augmented the availability of ICU beds during the peak of the crisis. I take this

opportunity to thank you, our team and the Board of
