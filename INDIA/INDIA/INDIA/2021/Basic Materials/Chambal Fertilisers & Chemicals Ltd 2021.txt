2021 and Mr. Gaurav Mathur was appointed as: Managing

Managing Director against an

employee of the Company in the marketing function. The complaint was referred

for investigation to an external entity and no evidence of alleged malpractices was

found in the investigation.

ii) a: letter was received alleging that an employee was misguiding people and off ering

jobs / contracts in the Company but no evidence of any wrong doing / malpractices

was found against the concerned employee during investigation.

Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and contribute to sustainability throughout their life cycle

1.

List up to 3 of your products or services

whose design has incorporated social

or environmental concerns, risks and/or

opportunities.

The Company manufactures Urea which is a major plant nutrient and ensures food

security in the country. The Urea manufactured by the Company is neem coated which

results into slow release of nitrogen in the soil thereby reducing the overall carbon

footprint. The Company makes continuous eff orts to increase the energy effi ciency of

the manufacturing plants and processes involved in the manufacture of Urea and follows

the concept of Reduce, Re-use and Re-cycle of the waste management. The Gadepan-III

plant of the Company commissioned during the Financial Year 2018-19 is more energy

effi cient in comparison to existing plants resulting into saving of natural resources.

2.

For each such product, provide the

following details in respect of resource use

(energy, water, raw material etc.) per unit of

product(optional):

(a) Reduction

during

sourcing/

production/ distribution achieved since

the previous year throughout the value

chain?

(b) Reduction during usage by consumers

(energy, water) has been achieved

since the previous year?

(a) The Company is having three hi-tech Urea plants (Gadepan - I, Gadepan - II and

Gadepan - III) at Gadepan, District Kota, Rajasthan. Natural gas is the main raw

material for manufacture of Urea. Gadepan-III plant had commenced commercial

production during the Financial Year 2018-19 which has the latest technology

thereby resulting in less consumption of energy and other natural resources.

The Company has been able to reduce specifi c energy consumption in its Urea

plants as compared to previous year. The overall specifi c energy consumption for

the Financial Year 2020-21 was 5.190 Gcal/MT of Urea as against 5.250 Gcal/MT of

Urea during the previous fi nancial year.

The Company has also reduced its specifi c water consumption in its Urea plants.

The Reverse Osmosis - Zero Liquid Discharge plant commissioned during the

Financial Year 2018-19 enabled the Company to achieve almost zero discharge of

water outside the plants. This has also resulted in less fresh water intake from the

river for manufacturing Urea. The overall water consumption including Reverse

Osmosis (RO) water during the Financial Year 2020-21 in the plants was 4.30 M3/

MT of Urea as against 4.42 M3/ MT of Urea during the previous fi nancial year.

The Company uses only harvested rain water for its operations, drawn through

anicuts constructed on river Kalisindh and Parvan. Almost 70% of the waste water

is re-cycled back into the system and the balance is used in the irrigation network

within the complex. The Company discharges the treated water in the river only

during monsoon period.

(b) The Company has not developed mechanisms to track resource usage at the

consumer end. The Company’s products are mainly consumed by farmers and the

Company engages with them to create awareness on sustainable agriculture and

optimum use of fertilisers.

The accompanying notes form an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

This is the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity referred to in our report of even date.:

letter in an earlier

year from GAIL (India) Limited, informing about the possibility of levy of Central Sales Tax. The Parent Company has

been taking the delivery of Gas in the State of Rajasthan and has been accordingly paying Rajasthan Sales Tax on

the supply. Therefore, the Parent Company feels that no Central Sales Tax is payable by it. Further, the amount of

such levy is not ascertainable. However, in the event of its levy, it is reimbursable by FICC under Subsidy Scheme.

(viii) Under the Jute Packaging Material (Compulsory use of Packing Commodities) Act, 1987, a specifi ed percentage of

fertilisers dispatched were required to be supplied in Jute bags up to August 31, 2001. The provisions of the said

Act were challenged in the Supreme Court, which upheld the constitutional validity of this Act in its judgment

in 1996. In spite of making conscious eff orts to step up use of jute packaging material, the Parent Company was

unable to adhere to the specifi ed percentage, due to strong customer resistance to use of jute bags. The Parent

Company had received show cause notice from the Offi ce of the Jute Commissioner, Kolkata, for levying a penalty

of Rs. 73.80 Crore (Previous Year: Rs. 73.80 Crore) for non compliance of the provisions of the said Act. The Parent

Company has obtained a stay order from Delhi High Court against the above show cause notice and on the basis

of the stay order the Parent Company is of the view that the said levy is not tenable in law and accordingly no

provision has been considered.

Based on favorable decisions in similar cases, legal opinion taken by the Parent Company, discussions with the

solicitors, etc., the Parent Company believes that there is fair chance of decisions in its favour in respect of all the

items listed in (i) to (viii) above and hence no provision is considered necessary against the same.

(b)

In respect of Subsidiaries :

Note:

In respect of ISGN India, the tax authorities have made various adjustments relating to transfer pricing and other

disallowances to taxable income for various assessment years i.e. 2009-10 to 2019-20.

The Group is contesting aforesaid demands and the management, based on external advise, believes that its position

will likely be upheld in the appellate process. No expense has been accrued in the consolidated fi nancial statements for

the aforesaid demands raised. The management believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have

a material adverse eff ect on the Group’s fi nancial position and results of operations. The Group does not expect any

reimbursements in respect of the above contingent liabilities.:

Managing Director and Chief Financial Offi cer of the Parent Company has been identifi ed as the chief operating decision maker

(CODM) as defi ned by Ind AS 108, ‘Operating Segments’. The Parent Company is in the business of manufacturing / marketing of

Fertilisers and other Agri-inputs. Looking at the nature of business and risk involved, the operations of the Parent Company falls

into single business segment. Further, all the customers and assets are located in India. The Group does not consider Software

and Other Business as a reportable segment as it does not have continuing signifi cance. Accordingly, no segment information is

provided.

Subsidiary Company

The Board of Directors of CFCL Technologies Limited (CTL) (merged with CFCL Ventures Limited w.e.f. December 20, 2016)

approved the 2007 Share Option Plan (‘Plan’) administered by compensation committee for granting stock options to certain

employees of its subsidiary companies as per Management’s discretion. A committee has been constituted to administer

the Plan along with the Board and to determine the grant date fair value which would be the exercise price for such options.

The fair value of the shares is determined by the management on the date of the grant of the stock options to the employees

pursuant to the Plan. The fair valuation has been determined using the Black-Scholes Valuation Model. The stock options vest

equally over the period of 48 months and the exercise period is 10 years from the date of grant.

There has been no exercise of stock options during the year. The weighted average remaining contractual life for the stock options

outstanding as at March 31, 2021 is Nil (Previous Year: 8.67 Years). The weighted average fair value of options granted during the

year was Nil (Previous Year: Nil).

The Subsidiary Company measures the fair value of stock options at the grant date using Black Scholes Option Pricing Model taking

into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted. The inputs used in the option pricing model

are as below:

The expected life of the share options is based on historical data and current expectations and is not necessarily indicative of

exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility refl ects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar

to the life of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
