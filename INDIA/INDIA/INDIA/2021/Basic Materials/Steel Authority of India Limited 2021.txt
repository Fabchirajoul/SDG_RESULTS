CONTENTS:

Dear Shareholders,

It is my pleasure to present to you the Annual Report of the Company for the

Financial Year 2020-21. As you all are aware, the year gone by saw one of the

severest challenges ever faced by mankind. Covid-19 Pandemic has affected

everyone across the globe, as a direct risk to the health and lives as well as

threatening the livelihood by bringing down the economies. While the numbers

which peaked significantly during the waves have since come down drastically,

the comfort of having done away with the Pandemic has not yet been found.

Before I touch upon the performance of the Company, let me brief you on

the various proactive measures taken by your Company to counter this ruthless

pandemic. Your Company activated a scaled response towards management

of Covid-19 at its Plants, Units, Mines and Townships. Your Company

implemented the desired lockdown rules and other social distancing norms for

breaking the chain of transmission of Covid-19 virus in the peripheral areas of

Steel Plants and Units. SAIL Plants and Units are using full-body automatic

sanitizers, touch-free hand-sanitizers, water dispensers, spraying

disinfectants, using digital thermal recorders at prominent locations.

On the infrastructure front for Covid care, SAIL Hospitals at five Integrated Steel

Plant locations initially earmarked 10% of the beds (330 beds) for Covid care

which were later increased to more than 1000 beds. Your Company has also set

up additional Covid care facilities at the integrated plant locations totalling to

1100 beds with gaseous oxygen facility from the respective Plant. SAIL

Hospitals have also developed Covid-19 testing facilities like RAT, RTPCR,

TRU-NAT in coordination with respective State Governments where regular

testing of peripheral population is underway.

Partnering with the Nation in its fight against Covid-19, SAIL contributed

`25 crore to the PM CARES Fund during FY’21. Your Company also stepped

forward in making available the Liquid Medical Oxygen in different states. Till

date, we have supplied more than One Lakh Tonne of Liquid Medical Oxygen.

Coming to the performance of your Company during FY’21, the year started on

a disappointing note for the reasons mentioned above. As the demand for steel

products in the domestic markets practically dissipated, your Company seized

the available opportunity in the form of exports to sustain its cash flows and

liquidity position. Production was regulated in line with the demand. The

efficiency pointers or the techno-economic parameters also saw a major

degradation due to operation of facilities at sub-optimal levels.

However, as the markets opened upon relaxations in lockdown, the demand

started to surge. Your Company was aware of the situation and taking

advantage of the same, set records in terms of sales volumes month after

month. This helped the Company in pulling off its best ever annual sales

performance of 14.937 Million Tonne (MT), growth of 5% over previous year.

With simultaneous rise in the realisations, your Company achieved its highest

ever annual sales turnover of ` 68,452 crore during the Financial Year, growth

of more than 12% over previous year.

Your Company achieved its highest ever annual EBITDA or the Gross Margin at

`13,740 crore on the back of improved operational performance as well as

benevolent market conditions in the post lockdown period. Overcoming the

challenges in the initial months of the fiscal, the Techno-economic Parameters

viz., Coke Rate, CDI Rate and BF Productivity at 448 kg/thm, 78 kg/thm and

3

1.81 t/m /day respectively recorded best ever statistics underlining the

consistent efforts made by the Company in the area of efficiency improvement.

The Profit Before Tax (PBT) at ` 6,879 crore is the highest during last ten years,

more than doubling over previous year’s performance. The Profit After Tax

(PAT) was also the highest during the decade at `3,850 crore though it was

impacted by the one-time hit of `1,289 crore from adoption of the new tax

regime under Section 115BAA. Other factors which affected the profitability are

detailed in the Annual Report.

However, the highlight of the financial performance without a shadow of doubt

was reduction in the leverage position. Your Company has reduced its debts

st

from `51,481 crore as on 31 March, 2020 to `35,350 crore as on

31st

March. 2021, a massive reduction of more than `16,000 crore.

Consequently, the debt-equity for the Company improved to 0.87 as against

1.36 as on previous year end.

On the production front, Financial Year 2020-21was impacted significantly due

to Covid-19 Pandemic, yet the persistent efforts of SAIL Collective ensured

growth quarter after quarter. The last quarter of the fiscal saw the Company

achieve its best ever quarterly statistics in terms of Hot Metal, Crude Steel

and Saleable Steel produced at 4.978 MT, 4.557 MT and 4.419 MT respectively,

thus helping to bridge the deficit from the levels achieved in the previous year.

The annual production of Hot Metal, Crude Steel and Saleable Steel

stood at 16.582 MT (17.438 MT in FY’20), 15.215 MT (16.155 MT in FY’20)

and 14.602 MT (15.083 MT in FY’20) respectively. The Company continued to

increase production through concast route and reached 14.733 MT vis-à-vis

14.607 MT achieved during FY’20. The Company has completely stopped

production through inefficient THF route. The saleable steel production from

new facilities increased to 5.199 MT, growth of 8% over CPLY (4.799 MT).

A large number of new initiatives were undertaken across all the Plants for

process improvements, with special emphasis on productivity & quality

improvement, product development & commercialization, energy conservation

and automation. The continuous activities in respect of product development

have led to development of 17 new Steel Products during FY 2020-21 which will

strengthen the Country in strategic areas such as shipbuilding, auto, railway,

infrastructure & construction, etc. Some of these products have been

developed from the newly commissioned production facilities, the most

prominent among them being R-260 Rails, API X70 Plates, Wire Rods Coils in

High Carbon/EN8 and EWNR, WDG4 Wheels, etc. The Plant wise details are

provided in the Annual Report.

On the raw materials front, your Company met its entire requirement of iron

from its captive sources. SAIL’s captive mines produced about 30.06 MT of iron

ore. However, for input requirements like coal and fluxes, the production from

captive sources at 0.55 MT and 1.77 MT respectively was not enough to meet

the entire requirement and accordingly, the Company had to depend on

indigenous as well as foreign suppliers. Another noticeable area under Raw

Materials was sale of iron ore. After obtaining permission from the respective

State Governments in Odisha and Chhattisgarh, your Company was able to sell

3.2 MT of the mineral. The permission, however, is still awaited in the State of

Jharkhand.

On the environment front, your Company has drawn its environmental vision in

consonance with the Corporate Environmental Policy, which not only

addresses the need for compliance of stipulated norms but also emphasises on

striving to go beyond. While the SAIL Plants and Mines operate their processes

without disturbing the ecological balance, they have also been taking all

appropriate measures to restore and rehabilitate the degraded eco-system, to

maintain and enhance bio-diversity. These include ecological restoration of

mined out areas, fresh plantation, bio-sequestration of CO , enhancing

2

utilization of wastes, utilization of renewable energy sources, etc. Structured

plantation programmes are being carried out every year in the SAIL Plants and

Mines. More than 1.72 lakh saplings were planted during the FY 2020-21,

taking the cumulative plantation by SAIL to 21.21 million.

As a result of these efforts, all the sustainable parameters showed

improvement with Specific PM Emission Load standing at 0.63 kg/tcs as

against 0.68 kg/tcs in FY’20, Solid Waste utilisation improved to 90% vis-à-vis

3

88.32% during FY’20 and Specific Water Consumption reduced to 3.37 m /tcs

3

over 3.50 m /tcs during FY’20. Specific Effluent Discharge and Specific Effluent

3

3

Load declined to 1.62 m /tss and 0.080 kg/tcs as against 1.83 m /tss and

0.082 kg/tcs respectively during FY’21.: Letter to Shareholders

letter dated 21 January, 2021 has

clarified that there is no prohibition in the MMDR Act for renewal of mining

leases of coal mines, even if the total period of mining lease and all renewals

exceeds 50 years. The clarification shall facilitate second renewal of Tasra Coal

th

Mining Lease beyond 30 April, 2022, for which renewal application has already

th

been made to the Jharkhand State Government on 10 July, 2020.

However, delay in extension of lease periods of remaining leases of Chiria and

Gua leases, and reservation of area for sand for stowing, are matter of concern.

Mining Lease for Rowghat Deposit-F was granted by the Chhattisgarh State

st

Government on 21 October, 2009. However, the development work of the Mine

and construction of rail line linked with mining project got affected mainly due to

law and order issues prevailing in the area.

Though for development of 14 MTPA Mine at Rowghat, Mine Developer cum

Operator (MDO) was appointed in September, 2017, mine development may

commence only after cutting of trees and handing over the forest land to SAIL by

the State Government. In this regard, order for cutting of about 39,000 trees in

Rowghat Deposit-F was issued by the State Government and the same has

started.

letter dated 12 March, 2018 to Ministry of Coal (MoC)

th

regarding returning of Sitanala Coal Block, MoC, vide: letter dated 4 October,

2018 issued a Termination Notice against Allotment Agreement and Allotment

th

Order, in respect of Sitanala Coal Block and on 25 October, 2018 advised the

bank to invoke the Bank Guarantee(BG) of `10.43 crore. SAIL had preferred

Writ Petitions before the Delhi High Court to challenge the Order dated

th

4 October, 2018. Though, Hon’ble Delhi High Court declined to pass any

interim order, but clarified that if the petitioner prevails in this petition, the

consequential direction for refund of the amount collected by invoking the BG

will be passed. The matter is sub-judice.

th

Consequent to the SAIL’s letter dated 8 March, 2018 to Ministry of Coal (MoC)

th

about returning of Parbatpur Coal Block, MoC, vide letter dated 5 December,

2019 issued a Termination Notice against Allotment Agreement and Allotment

Order in respect of Parbatpur Coal Block and advised the bank to invoke the BG

of ` 62.57 crore.

SAIL has preferred Writ Petitions before the Delhi High Court challenging the

th

th

Order dated 5 December, 2019. In response, vide Order dated 19 December,

2019, the Hon’ble Delhi Court directed for maintaining status quo in respect of

the BG, till the next date of hearing.

In view of the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and consequential lockdown, the

matter on both the above mentioned cases could not be placed on scheduled

dates and the next date of hearing is yet to be informed.

In the meanwhile, MoC in February, 2020, has appointed

letter dated 17 November,

2020 for leasing of total Railway land measuring 36.231 acres including

29.423 acres of Surface Lease-A of SAIL as disputed land, on the insistence

of S E Railways, SAIL agreed to the terms and conditions imposed by

Railways and submitted the desired affidavit to the SE Railways on

th

18 January, 2021.

Further, to expedite the process of issuance of revised demand note and

signing of Land Lease Agreement with Railways, the matter was taken up

with Chief Project Director, SE Railways, wherein, it was informed that

proposal for issuance of revised demand note and finalization of Land Lease

Agreement is under advance stage of approval. In a another meeting held

th

with Principal Chief Operation Manager, SE Railways, on 15 March, 2021,

PCOM stated that Railways has given permission for setting up the private

siding at Gua to M/s. Rungta Mines Ltd. as the land belongs to Railways and

SAIL was requested to allow M/s. Rungta Mines Ltd. to continue to

operatethe siding within the lease hold area of SAIL.

SAIL, not adhering to the request of Railways, requested to delink operation

of Rungta Mines with Land Leasing Agreement of Gua Railway Siding as the

Land of Rungta Siding is outside 36.231 acres of land required for SAIL

Siding. However, Railways did not agree and asked SAIL to take up the

matter of operationalizing Rungta siding with the higher authorities.

th

Accordingly, Chairman, SAIL vide: letter dated 8 April, 2021 requested

letter dated

th

16 March, 2018, SAIL was directed to submit: Letter of Intent (LoI) for an

area of 407.410 Hectare for the mining lease. In 2018, consent was given

for issuance of LoI.

Pending issuance of LoI for Baraduar lease, Mineral Resource Department

(MRD), Chhattisgarh informed SAIL that Baraduar Mining Lease was

th

granted for mineral dolomite for the period of 20 years from 26 December,

th

1970 to 25 December, 1990 and first renewal of the lease was granted for

th

th

the period of 20 years from 26 December, 1990 to 25 December, 2010 for

which lease deed was not executed by SAIL. Also, SAIL has neither

commenced mining operation within a period of 2 years nor has applied for

continuity of mining lease or revival of lease. On account of these, Baraduar

Mining Lease fall under category of “lapse of lease” as per section 4A (4) of

Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act 1957 read with Rule

(28) of Mineral Concession Rule, 1960.

Detailed reply to the aforesaid Show Cause Notice was submitted by SAIL

along with written submissions. Issuance of LoI is still awaited.

Environment Clearance (EC) for the Mining Proposals involving violation

Consequent to review of the pending Forest Clearances and Environment

Clearance proposals of Steel Sector by Secretary, MoEFCC and Secretary,

Steel jointly, Joint Secretary (NCM), MoEFCC examined the pending EC

proposals of SAIL’s Mines viz. Pandridalli & Rajhara Pahar Iron Ore Mining

Lease of BSP, Chhattisgarh, Tulsidamar Dolomite Mine in Jharkhand and

Jhillingburu-I Lease of Gua Mine.

Thereafter, EC proposal of Jhillingburu-I Lease of Gua Mine was considered

and Terms of Reference (ToR) for preparing EIA/EMP has been

recommended by EAC. However, formal issuance of ToR from MoEFCC is

awaited. Further, Tulsidamar EC case is still under examination of MoEFCC.

With regard to the EC proposal of Pandridalli & Rajhara Pahar Iron Ore

Mining Lease of BSP, MoEFCC, has informed that the said proposal falls

under violation as EC was required to be taken at the time of renewal of lease

in the year 2003, and therefore, the proposal would be considered in the

Sectoral EAC meeting as a violation proposal and SAIL has to apply for ToR.

This has come as a new development as violation related to non-availability

of EC at the time of renewal of lease in 2003 was not mentioned earlier,

In response to the same, SAIL has requested MoEFCC to reconsider the

pending EC proposal of Pandridalli and Rajhara Pahar Lease of BSP without

insisting of violation and grant EC. MoEFCC has informed that EC of

Tulsidamar mine is a valid EC. However, as SAIL has exceeded the

production over and above the EC capacity on 5 occasions, it is a violation

of EIA Notification, 2006 and therefore present proposal will be dealt with as

a violation case and has advised SAIL to apply afresh. In response, SAIL

th

made a request to the MoEFCC that the Notification dated 6 April, 2018,

clearly states that it was brought for condoning the previous violations and

l

to regularize the infirmities occurred in the various mining projects.

Accordingly, the proposal of SAIL may please be re-considered to avail the

benefits without any discrimination.

With the wide spread of Covid -19 pandemic during the Financial Year

2020-21, Authorities and Governments adopted several forms of physical

distancing as a measure to contain the dissemination of the coronavirus,

with Lockdown being one of these measures. The lockdown has resulted in

the supply chain being broken, demand for industrial goods falling, and the

decline of industrial production, with steel sector no exception to it, leading

to decline in steel consumption in India.

The continuous and accelerating rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in the

advanced economies set the stage for rapid recovery in the current financial

year and rolling out into the 2022. The Global Economy is expected to

recoup the pre-pandemic level of production in 2022. However, the

emerging and developing economies are expected to achieve the pre-

pandemic level by the financial year 2022-23. With regard to the steel

industry, demand is expected to be strong around the Globe due to rapid

developments through digitisation & automation, infrastructure initiatives,

fiscal stimulus, etc.

The outlook for 2021 is expected to be positive because Indian steel

companies have started boosting steel production capacity. In addition to

the huge scope for growth due to India’s comparatively low per capita steel

consumption, the pandemic has accelerated some key trends, which will

bring about shifts in steel demand on account of Government of India’s

focus on strengthening domestic manufacturing under ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat

Abhiyan’, introduction of ‘Production Linked Incentive Scheme’ to

encourage the manufacturing in various industries, investment in

infrastructure projects, thriving automobile and railways sector, etc. Such

measures are expected to take the steel demand cross the pre-pandemic

level.

Strengths

SAIL continues to be among the leading steel producers of the Nation.

Multi located production units give SAIL an edge over other domestic steel

players.

A large number of new and modernised units after completion of the on-

going modernisation and expansion.

Well established nationwide marketing and distribution network helps in

enhancing the reach of SAIL products across the Country.

Most diversified product range offered by any domestic steel company.

Availability of land bank at existing Plant/Unit locations for future brown-

field expansion.

Input security - 100 per cent integration in iron-ore.

Highly qualified professionals with experience in steel making.

Weaknesses

Dependence on external sources for key input i.e. coking coal leads to

exposure of the Company to the market risk.

Ageing employee mix along with a high manpower cost and relatively low

manpower productivity.

letter No.- 11-599/ 2014-FC dated 1 April 2015 issued revised

Guidelines for diversion of Forest Land for non-forest purpose under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 (FC Act). These revised Guidelines stipulated

that in case of existing mining leases having Forest Land (partially or fully), where approval for only a part of forest land has been obtained under the FC

Act, the Central Government accorded general approval under Section-2(iii) of the FC Act for the remaining area also to be Forest Land, subject to

certain conditions, which includes realising Net Present Value (NPV) for the entire forest land falling in the mining lease, in case NPV of such forest land

has not already been realised.

In this matter, as per legal opinion obtained by the Company, Section 2 (iii) of FC Act, 1980 will not apply to Government Corporation and NPV is required

to be paid only for that limited area, which has been approved by MoEF& CC and in which mining activities are proposed to be done and not for the entire

forest area. The matter of applicability of NPV for total forest land has been challenged by the Company in Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand. The Hon'ble

Court, in its order, has directed to place the matter before Division Bench of this Court.

A writ petition has also been filed in the Hon’ble High Court of Chhattisgarh against the demand of `96.28 crore received during 2017-18 from the Office

of Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Chhattisgarh.

The Company has deposited `96.28 crore with Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Chhattisgarh and a Special Leave Petition has been filed in Hon’ble
