DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

The year 2020 was a very unusual

year for all of us. A year that was

challenging on multiple fronts,

but what stood out was the

extraordinary resilience and

adaptability of individuals and

enterprises. There was a tectonic

shift in the way we live or conduct

our businesses, and Vedanta was

no different. As a large natural

resources company, we have had our

fair share of challenges. However, we

were quick to adapt to the emerging

realties, backed by the relentless

support of our dynamic workforce.

contributed to a self-reliant India.

Even as temporary disruptions

materialised, we were able

to bounce back strongly with

industry-leading EBITDA margins

and exceptional quarters for key

businesses.

We continued to deliver on all

strategic levers, building on our

strengths and commitment to

operational excellence. We remained

cash flow positive; and maintained

liquidity at comfortable levels.

It also gives me great pleasure

to inform you that we performed

exceedingly well on key

environmental, social and

governance (ESG) aspects during

the year. This is validated by

our ranking in the Dow Jones

Sustainability Index, which

improved nine places to 12th

globally in our industry. It’s a

true reflection of our belief that

business and sustainability are

synergistic in nature.

While we have reasons to

celebrate, we mourn the passing

of eight of our colleagues. We

are grieved by their irreplaceable

loss and are supporting the

bereaved families. At Vedanta, we

accord paramount importance to

occupational safety and employee

well-being and continue to nurture

a safety culture that results in

zero harm. However, there is

always room for improvement, and

collective action and behavioural

change alone can help bring

transformational outcomes. Aligned

to this, we are conducting a Group-

wide review of permit to work and

isolation procedure and are instating

a safety alert dashboard to improve

implementation of fatality learnings.

Cross business safety audits and

piloting of critical risk management

are other supplementary initiatives

supporting this.

We, at Cairn, think that small

outreach initiatives for the

community goes a long way

towards empowerment at the

grassroots. This conviction has

inspired us to set up community

helpdesks across six villages of

our operations across Gujarat.

Our role is to conduct a detailed

mapping of villages to identify

areas where intervention is

required and act as a bridge

to connect the last-mile

citizens like Sadhu Manhulabe

Farshurambhai with government

schemes and support measures.

Farshurambhai, 65, of Hansalpur

village, was finding it difficult

to make ends meet after

her husband, who was the only

breadwinner of the family, died.

Her failing health made matters

worse for her. The Cairn HelpDesk

team provided her with information

regarding the benefits of multiple

government schemes and how to

take advantage of those. Today

Manhulaben is a beneficiary of

‘Vidhva Sahay Yojana’ which

provides direct cash transfers to

the underprivileged.

The financial assistance from the

government, she says, is a security

blanket to fall back on in times

of stress. We have so far helped

1,500+ community members

across our intervention areas, and

this is just the beginning.

GoI on 26 October 2018, in view

of pending non-finalisation of the

Addendum to PSC, the GoI granted

permission to the Oil & Gas business

to continue petroleum operations

in Rajasthan block, till the execution

of the Addendum to PSC or 30 April

2021, whichever is earlier.

Ravva block

The Ravva block produced at an

average rate of 19,177 boepd,

higher by 35% y-o-y. This was

primarily due to new wells bought

online through Ravva drilling

campaign which was successfully

completed during the year.

Cambay block

The Cambay block produced at an

average rate of 10,329 boepd, lower

by 29% y-o-y. This was primarily

due to natural field decline partially

offset by production optimisation

measures.

(27)

Crude oil price averaged US$44.3

per barrel, compared to US$60.9 per

barrel in the previous year driven by

multiple reasons shifting the world

from the era of supply disruption to

plenty. Global economic indicators

continued to be adversely impacted

due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Early in the year, oil prices declined

drastically as the markets struggled

with a rapidly filling storage capacity

and massive crude oil glut amid a

demand collapse caused by the virus

outbreak.

Prices continued extending gains

from the second quarter, climbing to

a six-month high as physical market

fundamentals continued to recover,

rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the

surplus in the market eased, which

was reflected in the decline in crude

oil stocks, and recovery in refinery

operations and utilisation rates in

the major economies.

Continued efforts by OPEC to

accelerate production cuts including

voluntary adjustments and weather-

related energy crisis in the US later

in the year caused a sharp decline

in oil production. This temporarily

disrupted at least a fifth of the US

refining output, and a million barrels

of crude production led to a steady

rally in crude prices.

VEDANTA LIMITED | INTEGRATED REPORT AND ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2020-21 |

Statutory reports

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

letter dated 12 May 2020 had informed

the stock exchanges that it has received a: letter dated

12 May 2020 from its Holding Company, Vedanta

Resources Ltd. (“VRL”), wherein VRL had expressed

its intention to, either individually or along with one

or more subsidiaries, acquire all fully paid-up equity

shares of the Company (“Equity Shares”) that are held

by the public shareholders of the Company (as defined

under the Delisting Regulations, to be referred to as

“Public Shareholders”) and consequently voluntarily

delist the Equity Shares from BSE Limited and National

Stock Exchange of India Limited, the recognized stock

exchanges where the Equity Shares are presently listed

(“Stock Exchanges”), in accordance with the Delisting

Regulations (“Delisting Proposal”) and if such delisting is

successful, then to also delist the Company’s American

Depositary Shares from the New York Stock Exchange

(“NYSE”) and deregister the Company from the Securities

and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), subject to the

requirements of the NYSE and the SEC.

After obtaining due approvals, the Public Shareholders

holding Equity Shares were invited to submit Bids

pursuant to the reverse book building process conducted

through the Stock Exchange Mechanism made available

by BSE during the bid period (05 October 2020 to

09 October 2020), in accordance with the Delisting

Regulations.

The total number of Offer Shares validly tendered

by the Public Shareholders in the Delisting Offer was

1,25,47,16,610 Offer Shares, which was less than the

minimum number of Offer Shares required to be accepted

by the Acquirers in order for the Delisting Offer to be

successful in terms of Regulation 17(1)(a) of the Delisting

Regulations. Thus, the Delisting Offer is deemed to

have failed in terms of Regulation 19(1) of the Delisting

Regulations.

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND BASIS OF

MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(a)

Basis of preparation

i)

These financial statements have been prepared

in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind

AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 and other relevant provisions of

the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) (as amended from

time to time) and Guidance Note on Accounting for Oil

and Gas Producing Activities issued by the Institute of

Chartered Accountants of India.

These financial statements have been prepared in

accordance with the accounting policies, set out below

and were consistently applied to all periods presented

unless otherwise stated.

These financial statements are approved for issue by the

Board of

letter dated 29 May 2018,

cancelled 342.22 acres of the land allotted for the

proposed Expansion Project. Further, the TNPCB issued

orders on 07 June 2018 directing the withdrawal of the

Consent to Establish (CTE) which was valid till 31 March

2023.

The Company has approached Madras High Court by

way of writ petition challenging the cancellation of lease

deeds by SIPCOT pursuant to which an interim stay

has been granted. The Company has also filed Appeals

before the TNPCB Appellate Authority challenging

withdrawal of CTE by the TNPCB, the matter is pending

for adjudication. Considering the delay in existing plant

matter and accordingly delay in getting the required

approval for Expansion Project, management considered

to make provision for impairment for expansion project

basis fair value less cost of disposal and accordingly

made impairment provision of `669 Crore in March 2020.

During the current period, there are no updates in the

expansion matter and impairment provision of `669 Crore

is adequate and the net carrying value of `97 crore as at

31 March 2021 approximates its recoverable value.

Impairment recognised during the year ended 31 March

2020

For the Expansion Project, the project activities are

on halt since May 2018. Further, the project EC for the

Expansion Project got expired on 31 December 2018 and

fresh application is filed before the competent authority.

However, the process will start only after reopening

of the existing plant and after obtaining all statutory

approvals, the timing of which is uncertain.

Keeping in view the above factors and the fact that value

in use cannot be reasonably ascertained, the Company

has carried out recoverability assessment of the items of

property, plant and equipment, capital work in progress

(CWIP) and capital advances. Based on the realisable value

estimate of `288 Crore, the Company had recognised an

impairment of `669 Crore (comprising of CWIP balances

of `435 Crore, capital advances of `196 Crore and other

assets of `38 Crore) during the year ended March 21,

2020.

Property, plant and equipment of `1,337 Crore and

inventories of `284 Crore, pertaining to existing and

expansion plant, could not be physically verified, anytime

during the year, as the access to the plant is presently

restricted. However, since operations are suspended and

access to the plant restricted, any difference between

book and physical quantities is unlikely to be material.

(viii) PSC Extension

Rajasthan Block

The Company operates an oil and gas production facility

in Rajasthan under a Production Sharing Contract

(“PSC”). The management is of the opinion that the

Company is eligible for automatic extension of the PSC

for Rajasthan ("RJ") block on same terms w.e.f. 15 May

2020, while Government of India ("GoI") in October 2018,

accorded its approval for extension of the PSC, under the

Pre-NELP Extension policy as per notification dated 07

April 2017 (“Pre-NELP Policy”), for RJ block by a period

of 10 years, w.e.f. 15 May 2020. As per the said policy and

extension: letter, the Company is required to comply with

certain conditions and pay an additional 10% profit oil to

GoI. The Company had challenged the applicability of Pre

NELP Policy to the RJ block. The Division Bench of the

Delhi High Court in March 2021 set aside the single judge

order of May 2018 which allowed automatic extension of

PSC. The Company is studying the order and all available

legal remedies are being evaluated for further action as

appropriate.

One of the conditions for extension of PSC relates to

notification of certain audit exceptions raised for FY

16-17 as per PSC provisions and provides for payment of

amounts, if such audit exceptions result into any creation

of liability.

The

letter dated 12 May 2020, reiterated its demand

only with respect to the retrospective re-allocation of

certain common costs between DAs of the RJ block of

`2,669 Crore (US$364 million towards contractor share

for the period upto 31 March 2017. This amount was

subsequently revised to `3,360 Crore (US$458 million) till

March 2018 vide DGH: letter dated 24 December 2020.

The Company in January 2020 received notifications

from the DGH on audit exceptions arising out of its audit

for the FY 2017-18, which comprises the consequential

effects on profit oil due to the aforesaid matters and

certain new matters on cost allowability plus interest

aggregating to US$645 million, representing share of

the Company and its subsidiary, CEHL (“the Claimants”),

which have been suitably responded to by the Company.

The Company believes that it has sufficient as well as

reasonable basis pursuant to the PSC provisions and

related approvals, supported by legal advice, for having

claimed such costs and for allocating common costs

between different DAs. In the Company’s opinion, these

computations of the aforesaid demand / audit exceptions

are not appropriate, and the accounting adjustments

sought for issues pertaining to Year 2007 and onwards

are based on assumptions that are not in consonance

with the approvals already in place. The Company’s view

is also supported by independent legal opinion and the

Company has been following the process set out in PSC

to resolve these aforesaid matters. The Company has

also invoked the PSC process for resolution of disputed

exceptions and has issued notice for arbitration and the

tribunal stands constituted. Further, on 23 September

2020, the GoI had filed an application for interim relief

before Delhi High Court seeking payment of all disputed

dues. This matter is now scheduled for hearing on 20 May

2021.

Also, on Vedanta’s application under section 17 of the

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, the tribunal in

December 2020 ordered that GoI should not take any

action to enforce any of the amounts at issue in this

arbitration against the Claimants during the arbitral

period. The GoI has challenged the said order before the

Delhi High Court under the said Act. This matter is also

scheduled for hearing on 20 May 2021.

In management’s view, the above mentioned condition

on demand raised by the DGH for additional petroleum

linked to PSC extension is untenable and has not resulted

in creation of any liability and cannot be a ground for

non-extension. In addition, all necessary procedures

prescribed in the PSC including invocation of arbitration,

in respect of the stated audit observation have also been

fulfilled. Accordingly, the PSC extension approval granted

vide DGH letter dated 26 October 2018 upholds with

all conditions addressed and no material liability would

devolve upon the Group.

Simultaneously, the Company is also pursuing with the

GoI for executing the RJ PSC addendum at the earliest.

In view of extenuating circumstances surrounding

COVID-19 and pending signing of the PSC addendum for

extension after complying with all stipulated conditions,

the GoI has been granting interim permission to the

Company to continue Petroleum operations in the RJ

block. The latest permission is valid upto 31 July 2021 or

signing of the PSC addendum, whichever is earlier.

Ravva Block

The Government of India (GoI) has granted its approval

for a ten-year extension of PSC for Ravva Block with

effect from 28 October 2019, in terms of the provision of

the “Policy on the Grant of the extension to Production

Sharing Contract Signed by Government awarding

small, medium-sized and discovered field to private joint

ventures” dated March 28, 2016. The PSC addendum

recording this extension has been executed by all parties.

The Ravva Extension Policy, amongst others, provides for

an increased share of profit petroleum of 10% for the GoI

during the extended term of the Ravva PSC and payment

of royalty and cess as per prevailing rate in accordance

with the PNG Rules, 1959 and OIDB Act. Under the

Ravva PSC, –the Company’s oil and gas business is

entitled to recover 100% of cost of production and

development from crude oil and natural gas sales before

any profit is allocated among the parties. Cost recovery

for exploration cost during extension period shall be

governed as per the provision of Office Memorandum

2013, 2019 issued by MoPNG on exploration in mining

lease area post expiry of the exploration period.

(ix) Impact of Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019

Pursuant to the introduction of Section 115BAA of the

Income Tax Act, 1961 which is effective 01 April 2019,

companies in India have the option to pay corporate

income tax at the rate of 22% plus applicable surcharge

and cess as against the earlier rate of 30% plus applicable

surcharge and cess, subject to certain conditions

like, the company has to forego all benefits like tax

holidays, brought forward losses generated through

tax incentives/additional depreciation and outstanding

MAT credit. Considering all the provisions under Section

115BAA and based on the expected timing of exercising of

the option under Section 115BAA, the Company has re-

measured its deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2021.

This computation requires assumptions regarding future

profitability, which is inherently uncertain. To the extent

assumptions regarding future profitability change, there

can be increase or decrease in the amounts recognised

(Refer note 33).

(x)

Assessment of impairment of assets at Aluminium

division

During year ended March 31,2020, considering lower

sales realisation, an impairment trigger was identified in

the aluminium division of the Company. The impairment

assessments are based on a range of estimates and

assumptions, including:

Estimates/

assumptions

Basis

Future

production

Production facilities and expansion projects

Commodity

prices

management’s best estimate benchmarked

with external sources of information, to

ensure they are within the range of available

analyst forecast

Discount to price management’s best estimate based on

historical prevailing discount

Discount rates

cost of capital risk-adjusted for the risk

specific to the asset/ CGU

During the previous year, the Company had carried out

an impairment analysis, based on value in use approach,

considering the key variables and concluded that there

existed no impairment. The Company had carried

out sensitivity analysis on key assumptions including

commodity price, discount rate and delay in expansion

of refinery. Based on sensitivity analysis, the recoverable

amount was expected to exceed the carrying value

as at 31 March 2020 of `36,992 Crore. No negative

developments have occurred since the previous year,

while the commodity price have increased. Accordingly,

it is not expected that the carrying amount would exceed

the recoverable amount and hence the recoverable value

for the year ended 31 March 2021 was not re-determined.

(xi) Going Concern

Considering the uncertainties caused due to Covid-19,

the Company prepared its cash flow forecasts under

various scenarios and has performed additional

sensitivities on certain key assumptions. Based on such

an analysis and assessment of its ability to raise additional

capital, the Company continues to prepare its financial

statements on a going concern basis.

(B) Significant Judgement

(i)

Contingencies

In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities

may arise from litigation, taxation and other claims

against the Company. A provision is recognised when

the Company has a present obligation as a result of

past events and it is probable that the Company will be

required to settle that obligation.

Where it is management’s assessment that the outcome

cannot be reliably quantified or is uncertain, the claims

are disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the likelihood

of an adverse outcome is remote. Such liabilities are

disclosed in the notes but are not provided for in the

financial statements.

When considering the classification of legal or tax

cases as probable, possible or remote, there is

judgement involved. This pertains to the application

of the legislation, which in certain cases is based upon

management’s interpretation of country specific

applicable law, in particular India, and the likelihood of

settlement. Management uses in-house and external

legal professionals to make informed decision.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the final

outcome of the legal proceedings, the Company does not

expect them to have a materially adverse impact on the

Company’s financial position or profitability. These are

set out in Note 36.

(ii) Revenue recognition and receivable recovery in

relation to the power division

In certain cases, the Company’s power customers

are disputing various contractual provisions of Power

Purchase Agreements (PPA). Significant judgement is

required in both assessing the tariff to be charged under

the PPA in accordance with Ind AS 115 and to assess the

recoverability of withheld revenue currently accounted

for as receivables.

In assessing this critical judgment, management

considered favourable external legal opinions that

the Company has obtained in relation to the claims. In

addition, the fact that the contracts are with government

owned companies implies the credit risk is low [refer note

7 (c)].

(iii) Exceptional items:

Exceptional items are those items that management

considers, by virtue of their size or incidence (including

but not limited to impairment charges and acquisition

and restructuring related costs), should be disclosed

separately to ensure that the financial information allows

an understanding of the underlying performance of the

business in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with

prior periods. Also tax charges related to exceptional

items and certain one-time tax effects are considered

Exceptional. Such items are material by nature or amount

to the year’s result and require separate disclosure in

accordance with Ind AS.
