Message

Dear Shareholder,

As we usher in a new financial year, I am motivated

to quote Jodi Picoult‘s famous quote, “The human

capacity for burden is like bamboo – far more flexible

than you’d ever believe at first glance". The quote

resonates well with the current times where we are

all stuck in the middle of the pandemic and have

exhibited sheer grit and resilience in facing the crisis.

It has been more than a year now that covid-19 has

been wreaking havoc the world over and we are

still fighting it in phases; the first wave, the second

and may be the third yet to come. The pandemic

has brought upon us emotional, physical, social and

economic distress and even though the return of

normalcy is still hidden behind the hazy clouds of

unpredictability, we have not given up as a collective

human race. The invention of vaccines and steady

adoption of new normal is a testimony that humanity

is capable of facing all the challenges head-on and is

a master of adaptability.

We, at EID Parry, have become all the more resilient

and the manner in which the unprecedented event

that panned out last year, I believe has further

strengthened our resolve to become a company

that can continue to be growth and profit oriented.

Despite a difficult 2020-21, with a shaky economic

condition, hindered market growth, disrupted supply

chain and operations, we have managed to stay the

course. Our Sugar business improved during the year

and in the middle of the disruption it has exhibited a

better performance.

We exhibited a strong resilience by focusing

on process efficiencies, cost optimisation and

strong commitment and delivery on the retail

front. We prepared ourselves meticulously

and seeing the situation, we emphasised

on savings and scaled up our efficiencies.

We also worked on gaining a healthy

volume growth and building up a strong

portfolio of our products and focused on

market development. Our deliberate focus

on improving efficiencies in the systems

and processes, lowering interest cost, and

better realisation from sugar retail sales and

alcohol sales helped us in enhancing the

Company’s bottom line. We also managed

to exhibit healthy and consistent volume growth,

which is a testimony of our resilience and strength.

We, EID Parry, have been pivotal in empowering the

cane farmers and improving their social well being

and building a long-term growth platform for the

farming community, who are one of our biggest

stakeholders. Over the years, we have supported

the farmer with sustainable sourcing and sustainable

livelihood. Your Company has also strengthened its

R&D and has revved up its technological wing with

the latest technological know -how and innovation,

which will help your company attain sustainable

growth and become an undisputed leader in the said

domain. Moreover, our customer-centric approach

has made us to create a niche for ourselves and

helped our iconic brand ‘Parry’ to develop a greater

brand resilience. We have also succeeded in creating

better penetration for Parry’s Jaggery and Parry’s

Amrit Brown Sugar and developing an efficient

supply chain and distribution network.

The year 2020-21, was marked by the launch of Parry’s

Sweet Care, a low GI Sugar aimed at catering to the

need of the health-conscious consumer segment. In

addition, we also started to harvest value from the

Nutraceuticals business, and our adjacencies apart

from sugar. Under the Nutraceuticals segment, our

products like Spirulina, Astaxanthin, and Chlorella

are

well-received

among

the

health-conscious

community the world over. As far as Spirulina and

Chlorella are concerned, both helped us to gain a

leadership position with our superlative product

quality and timely scientific interventions and

investments.

The last few years were marked by our decision to

close some of our unviable operations in TN and

Puducherry due to the non-availability of adequate

cane. We decided to shift some of our capacities

to the high cane growing areas of Karnataka

which should augur well to utilize the capacities

in a productive manner in the years to come. Your

company has embarked on its journey of building

and leveraging the brand Parry and is in the process

of delighting the consumers with differentiated

value added products. We believe that the business

need not have to manufacture sugar to sell sugar:

exceptional items) as against ` 15,879 Crore in the previous

year. Operating Profit (EBITDA) was ` 2,107 Crore (including

exceptional items) as against ` 2,016 Crore in the previous

STANDALONE OPERATIONS

Standalone Revenue from operations of your Company

the previous year. Operating Profit (EBITDA) (including

exceptional items) was ` 1,271 Crore, as against ` 235 Crore.

in the previous year. Profit after Tax for the year was at ` 865

Crore as against ` 2 Crore in the previous year.

The financial year 2020-21 has been a challenging one for

the Company with weakening macro-economic conditions,

slowing market growth in several sectors caused by the

COVID-19 outbreak and associated containment measures

disrupting the supply chain, operations and also the

eventual consumption. Against this challenging backdrop,

the Company has delivered a profitable standalone sugar

business with a healthy EBITDA supported by strong growth

in retail portfolio. Profit before tax and before exceptional

items (PBT) grew at 1813% backed by the growth in the

segments in which the company operates and increased

dividend from Coromandel International Limited.

The performance during the year has improved over the

previous year despite the inherent challenges and risks

associated with the sugar industry and the disruptions

caused by the pandemic. The selling prices of sugar

continued to remain subdued, with the stock holding

restrictions in place. Hence the business, continued to

focus on process efficiencies, cost optimisation, quality, and

delivery to increase the margin. The margin expansion is a

result of our strong cost savings agenda, scale efficiencies

achieved on the back of healthy volume growth and strong

product portfolio along with the market development. The

efficiencies in systems and process, lower interest cost,

better realisation from sugar retail sales and alcohol sales

facilitated the Company’s bottom-line to a large extent. The

business had a modest revenue growth but grew remarkably

in terms of profitability despite regulatory bottlenecks and

restrictions and an increase in Fair and Remunerative Price

(FRP) without commensurate increase in the Minimum Selling

Price (MSP) of sugar. This resilient performance is a reflection

of the strength of our brands, our execution prowess, and

rigour and discipline in implementing a well laid out strategy.

Today, the shareholders are increasingly interested

in the sustainable and social governance aspects of:

Managing Director, Mr.S. Rameshkumar, Chief

Financial Officer and Mr. Biswa Mohan Rath, Company

Secretary are the Key Managerial Personnel of the Company

as per Section 203 of the Act.

40 Impact of Covid 19 pandemic

The spread of COVID 19 has severely impacted businesses around the globe. Due to outbreak of coronavirus global

pandemic, Government of India, implemented a pan India lockdown from March 2020 with certain relaxations and

exceptions. The Company’s significant business is sugar and it has been identified as an essential service. The Company’s

factory was operating during the lockdown except for few days in the initial lock down period and was able to complete

the crushing of sugarcane as per the schedule with slight delay.

The Company has made detailed assessment of its liquidity position including the ability of the Company to continue

as going concern. The Company has sanctioned credit facilities which can be used as and when necessary and has the

ability to repay the debts as and when it falls due.

Management believes that it has taken into account all the possible impact of events arising from COVID 19 pandemic

in the preparation of the standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021, which are not significant.:

Letter of Credit to its subsidiaries

US Nutraceuticals Inc. & Alimtec S.A. to the tune of ` 8,042 Lakh (March 31, 2020: ` 8,026 Lakh) during the year. Based

on the financial performance of subsidiaries, the Company does not expect the guarantee liability to devolve on the

Company.

The credit risk on cash and bank balances is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings

assigned by international credit rating agencies.

49.6 Liquidity risk management

The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing

facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial

assets and liabilities.

The table below provides details regarding the contractual maturities of non-derivative financial liabilities including

estimated interest payments as at March 31, 2021:

53.1 The Tamilnadu Government declared State Advisory Price (SAP) for the sugar year 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The

Company has challenged the right of State Government to declare the SAP in the Hon’ble High Court of Madras. The

matter is subjudice.

53.2 Future cash outflows in respect of the above referred matters are determinable only on receipt of judgements/decisions

pending at various forums/authorities.

53.3 The Income Tax Department/Commercial Tax Department/Central Excise and Service Tax and GST Authority has filed

appeal against the favorable order passed by lower forum in favor of the Company in appropriate appellate forum to

the extent of ` 2,231 Lakh. It is expected that there will not be any outflow of economic resources embodying economic

benefits. Hence, no provision is considered necessary against the same.

53.4 The Income Tax Department has been adjusting the demand orders against other refunds receivable by the company in

various assessment years, and accordingly this does not include interest, as applicable.

53.5 Certain Industrial Disputes are pending before Tribunal/High Courts. The liability of the Company in respect of these

disputes depends upon the final outcome of such cases and the quantum of which is not currently ascertainable.:
