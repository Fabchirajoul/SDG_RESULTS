Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.

of the accounts receivable and 10% of revenue as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020.

The Company extends credit to customers as per the internal credit policy. Any deviation are approved by appropriate authorities, after

due consideration of the customers credentials and financial capacity, trade practices and prevailing business and economic conditions.

The Company’s historical experience of collecting receivables and the level of default indicate that credit risk is low and generally uniform

across markets; consequently, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. All overdue customer balances are

evaluated taking into account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the customers etc.Company computes

credit loss allowance based on a matrix based historically observed default rates over the expected life of trade receivables and is adjusted

for forward-looking estimates.

Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired

Cash and cash equivalents, investment and deposits with banks are neither past due nor impaired. Cash and cash equivalents with banks

are held with reputed and credit worthy banking institutions.

Financial assets that are past due but not impaired

Trade receivables amounts that are past due at the end of the reporting period against which no credit losses has been expected to arise.

The carrying amount of respective financial assets recognised in the consolidated financial statements, (net of impairment losses) represents the

Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Of the

trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there are no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable and 10%

of revenue as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020.

The Group extends credit to customers as per the internal credit policy. Any deviation are approved by appropriate authorities, after due

consideration of the customers credentials and financial capacity, trade practices and prevailing business and economic conditions. The Group’s

historical experience of collecting receivables and the level of default indicate that credit risk is low and generally uniform across markets;

consequently, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. All overdue customer balances are evaluated taking into

account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the customers etc. Group computes credit loss allowance based

on a provision matrix based on historically observed default rates over the expected life of trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking

estimates.

Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired

Cash and cash equivalents, investment and deposits with banks are neither past due nor impaired. Cash and cash equivalents with banks are held

with reputed and credit worthy banking institutions.

Financial assets that are past due but not impaired

Trade receivables amounts that are past due at the end of the reporting period against which no credit losses has been expected to

arise.

comprising of the Group manages its liquidity risk. The Group's objective is to maintain optimum level of liquidity to meet it's cash and collateral

requirements at all times. The Group's assets represented by financial instruments comprising of receivables, and those relating to Parbatpur Coal

meet its fund requirement. The current committed line of credit are sufficient to meet its short to medium term fund requirement.
