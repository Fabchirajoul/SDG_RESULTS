FUNCTIONAL DIRECTORS:

MANAGING DIRECTOR

Esteemed Shareholders,

I trust your family and you are keeping well in the midst

of unprecedented and intense second wave of COVID-19

Pandemic.

Thank you for your continued support which also contributed

to the success of our Company.

KIOCL’s response to COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 viral outbreak was different from variants of

the past. It was deadly combination of speed of spread with

debilitation and death. During this challenging period, your

Company faced two-fold responsibility of uninterrupted

operation of Plant and protecting the health and safety of

all its stakeholders. Your Company responded with a mix of

cautious engagement, social distance and virtual engagement.

The result is that, we could minimize the virus infection to the

employees, still continued production activities without much

hinderances.

Enhancing shareholder value

It gives me immense pleasure and sense of pride in stating

that, during the Financial Year 2020-21 your Company

has performed exceptionally well despite uncertainty in

international market for iron ore Pellets since outbreak

of COVID-19 Pandemic as well as an intense competitive

market. The performance is reflective of the hard work and

perseverance of dedicated employees working relentlessly for

your Company’s success. Please join me in congratulating the

leadership and employees of the Company for delivering an

exceptionally successful Financial Year.

Let me share the key performance highlights for the Financial

Year 2020-21. During the year your Company had:

• Produced 2.210 million tons and dispatched 2.311 million

tons of Pellet;

• Achieved Export sales of 1.844 million tonnes of Pellets

reaching to the highest after closure of its captive mine;

• Achieved a record Total Income of ₹ 2477.83 crores, which is

highest since inception of the Company;

• Earned a Profit before Tax of ₹ 410.23 crores and Profit after

Tax of ₹ 301.17 crores;

• Generated revenue of ₹ 4.57 crores from mineral exploration

activities and work in hand of ₹ 114.69 crores;

• Earned a Net Foreign Exchange of ₹ 1759.61 crores;

• Incurred a CAPEX of ₹ 41.05 crores;

• Completed Buyback of 1,41,74,469 equity shares at a price

of ₹ 110/- per equity share for an aggregate consideration of

₹155.92 crores (excluding tax); and

• Proposed to pay a total dividend of ₹ 99.67 crores for the

FY 2020-21, which is 16.40 % on the Paid-up Equity Share

Capital of the Company, subject to approval of shareholders.

Future Outlook

World steel forecasts that steel demand to grow by 5.8% in 2021

to reach 1,874 million tonnes (Mt), after declining by 0.2% in

2020. The current forecast assumes that the ongoing second or

third waves of infections would stabilize in the second quarter

and that steady progress on vaccinations would allow a gradual

return to normalcy in major steel-using countries. Despite the

disastrous impact of the pandemic on lives and livelihoods, the

global steel industry was fortunate enough to end 2020 with

only a minor contraction in steel demand. This was due to a

surprisingly robust recovery in China, with growth of 9.1%. In

the rest of the world steel demand contracted by 10%. In the

coming years, steel demand is expected to recover firmly, both

in the developed and developing economies, supported by pent-

up demand and Governments’ recovery programmes. However,

for most developed economies a return to the pre-pandemic

levels of steel demand will take a few years. While it is hoped that

the worst of the pandemic is passing, there is still considerable

uncertainty for the rest of 2021. The mutation of the virus and

progress of vaccinations, withdrawal of supportive fiscal and

monetary policies, geopolitics and trade tensions could all affect

the recovery envisaged in this forecast.

Way forward - Creating KIOCL of tomorrow

For a sustainable future, your Company is continuously working

on various long term / short term expansion / diversifications

projects, which are at different stages of implementations

/ approvals from different regulatory authorities at the level of

State Government and Central Government.:

the Financial Statements are presented in Indian Rupee

(INR), which is Company’s functional and presentation

currency.

b) Transactions and Balances: Foreign currency

transactions are translated into the functional currency

using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the

settlement of such transactions and from the translation

of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign

currencies at year end exchange rates are recognized in

Profit or Loss.

The Company enters into certain forward contracts to hedge

foreign exchange risks which are not designated as hedges.

Such contracts are accounted for at fair value through Profit

or Loss and are included in other gains/ (losses).

1.5. Revenue Recognition

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration

received or receivable. Revenue is recorded at aggregate

value of all taxable supplies, exempt supplies, export of

goods and/or services and inter-state supplies excluding

taxes, if any charged under CGST/SGST/IGST Act and net

of Returns, Trade Allowances, Volume and other Rebates.

The Company recognizes revenue when the amount of

revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that the

future economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific

criteria have been met for each of the Company’s activities

as described below. The Company bases its estimates on

historical results, taking into consideration the type of

customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each

arrangement.

Revenue from sale of goods is recognized, when all the

following conditions are met:

The entity has transferred to the buyer the significant risks

and rewards of ownership of the goods

• The entity retains neither continuing managerial

involvement to the degree usually associated with

ownership nor effective control over the goods sold

• The amount of revenue can be measured reliably

• It is probable that the economic benefits associated with

the transaction will flow to the entity; and

• The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the

transaction can be measured reliably.

Sales include Export Duty and Freight on Consignment Sales

wherever applicable and are net of GST. Sales are recognized

on dispatch of goods to the customers. In respect of sea

shipments, issue of Bill of Lading is considered as dispatch.

The Company recognizes revenue from contracts when

it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a

promised service to a customer, over time. The company’s

performance enhances an asset that the customer controls

and the company has an enforceable right to payment for

performance completed to date.

The revenue is measured on the basis of direct

measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or

services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods

before the Assessing Authority.:

letter No. H/C.474 Classification/11 dated

21.10.2011 raised an issue regarding the applicability

of distance-based charge (DBC) over and above normal

freight on Iron ore transported through railway network

for manufacture of pellets and their subsequent export.

Both South Western Railway (SWR) and East Coast

Railway (ECR) have raised demand of ₹ 14,463.93 Lakhs

and ₹ 10,361.38 Lakhs respectively towards distance-

based charge (DBC) over and above normal freight on Iron

ore transported.

DBC will attract only for iron ore fines and lumps which

are directly exported and not on the Iron Ore so moved

and utilized in the steel plants for manufacture of finished

product and exported thereafter. The same is also not

applicable to Pig iron and Sponge Iron Industry.

Against the demand of ₹ 14,463.93 Lakhs of SWR, KIOCL

had filed writ petition before the Hon’ble High Court of

Karnataka. The writ petition was dismissed and KIOCL

filed writ appeal challenging the dismissal of the writ

petition. The Hon’ble High Court has granted interim

order staying DBC, subject to the condition that 50% of the

demand excluding penalty is to be deposited. Accordingly,

₹ 8,325.15 Lakhs was paid and for the balance amount of

₹ 6,138.77 Lakhs provision has been made in the books.

Similarly, against the demand of ₹ 10,361.38 Lakhs of ECR

which after considering the freight already paid, worked

out to be ₹ 6,740.94 Lakhs, KIOCL has filed WRIT petition

before High Court of Orissa and High Court granted stay

subject to deposit of 50% amount excluding the penalty.

Against the worked-out liability, the Company paid

₹ 5,188.86 Lakhs and the balance amount of ₹ 1,552.08

Lakhs provision has been made in the books.

Both the cases are not listed so far. Railway has filed

transfer petition before Supreme Court and both the cases

are stayed by Supreme Court.

The Company has claimed refund of congestion surcharge

amounting to ₹ 6,877.86 Lakh from South Western Railway

(SWR) in respect of 573 rakes moved during 01.04.2007 to

21.05.2008 through the Company’s private Railway Siding

at Panambur, Mangalore which was commissioned in

January 2006. SWR refunded only ₹ 2,725.39 Lakh till date

which includes ₹ 206.70 Lakh adjusted by SWR towards

DBC. The Company had approached Railway Claims

Tribunal (RCT), Bangalore for refund of the balance amount

of ₹ 4,152.70 Lakh with interest. The Tribunal allowed the

claim by its order dated 07.12.2018 and directed SWR to

compute and pay the amount together with interest at 6%

per annum and in case SWR fails to comply with the order

interest at 9% per annum is payable from 01.04.2019.

SWR has filed petition against the order of Tribunal in

Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka on 11.04.2019 vide case

no MFA/3165/2019. The Company has not recognized the

above as income in line with the Company’s significant

accounting policy No.1.5, pending realization.

The Konkan Railway offered concessional freight to the

Company for movement of rakes through Konkan route

instead of shorter route i.e., Hassan-Mangaluru, which

has been accepted by the Company and 110 rakes were

booked for the Konkan route. Subsequently, Konkan

Railway allowed concessional freight for 92 rakes only and

balance 18 rakes were moved through shorter routes i.e.,

Hassan-Mangaluru. Hence, the Company claimed refund

of ₹ 254.45 Lakhs from SWR towards differential freight.

However, SWR has not refunded the amount. Hence, the

Company approached RCT, Bengaluru and has claimed

₹ 254.45 Lakhs with interest. The Tribunal dismissed the

claim and the Company filed appeal before Hon’ble High

Court of Karnataka and the same is pending.

East Coast Railway have collected 100% congestion

surcharge instead of 30% for the rakes moved during the

period from 15/04/2008 to 21/05/2008. The Company

requested ECR for refunding ₹ 436.83 Lakhs being 70%

excess congestion surcharge collected in respect of 26

rakes. As ECR failed to refund the amount, the Company

has filed a petition before the RCT, Bhubaneswar for refund

of ₹ 436.83 Lakhs with interest. The Tribunal dismissed

the claim and the Company filed appeal before Hon’ble

High Court of Odisha and the same is pending.

4.

In pursuance of the directive of the Hon’ble Supreme Court,

mining activities at Kudremukh were stopped with effect

from 1st January 2006. Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) has

approved final mine closure plan (FMCP) of Kudremukh

Iron Ore Mine and the same was communicated vide: letter

no. MS/CMG/Fe-38-52 dated 06.05.2005. At the time of

closure of the mine, the Company filed a petition with

prayers for direction, inter-alia, to permit utilization of

54.01 hectares of land required for the purpose of safety

and slope stability of the mine.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in its judgment (December

2006), directed IIT Delhi to issue global tender for, inter-

alia, re-analyzing the stability of slopes, drawing up of

mine closure plan, implementation of the above plan

and drawing up of detailed terms for the work to be

done, consistent with basic paradigm of “no or minimal

disturbance to un-broken area”.

The expenditure for this purpose was to be met out of

₹ 1,900 Lakhs paid by the company, which is presently

lying with the adhoc Compensatory Afforestation Fund

Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA).

The Hon’ble Supreme Court has also directed that if any

funds are required in excess of ₹ 1,900 Lakhs, the agency

or the designated officer shall move to the Court for

necessary direction.

letter

dated 07.02.2014, nominated the Regional Controller of

Mines, IBM Bangalore as the ‘Designated Officer’ to take

possession of Kudremukh Iron Ore Mines. Accordingly,

the Company has handed over the possession of the

Kudremukh Iron Ore Mines on 03.04.2014 to the Regional

Controller of Mines, IBM Bangalore.

Subsequently, officials of IBM Bangalore and IIT, Delhi

inspected the mine site on 20.05.2014, in which IIT Delhi

opined that, keeping in view of the environment and safety

concerns, the residual task of mine closure is relatively

minor as compared to what was originally envisaged.

Hence, the amount of ₹ 1,900 Lakhs paid by the company

to Central Empowered Committee (CEC) already lying with

the CAMPA would be utilized for restoration of Kudremukh

iron ore mine. In addition to above, the Company has also

made provision to the extent of ₹ 600 Lakhs.
