BOARD OF DIRECTORS:

Dear Shareholders,

At the outset, I hope you and your family members are safe

during these difficult times of COVID-19 pandemic. As India

faces one of its biggest challenges caused by the COVID-19

related disruptions, the importance of agriculture has been

brought to the fore more than ever. Fertilizer and agriculture

sectors provided much needed strength to Indian economy

during the 1st wave of COVID-19.

Apart from providing fertilizers, the domestic fertilizer

industry also extended all possible help and support to the

country in fighting COVID crisis including contribution

to PM Care Fund, providing direct help to the citizens

affected by COVID during lockdown. Many of the fertilizer

companies are setting up plants for medical grade oxygen

to tide over the present oxygen crisis in the country. The

fertilizer industry is fully committed to work with the

government in these difficult times.

Overview of the Economy

Indian economy had started recovering from the shocks

of 1st wave of COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in

estimated negative growth of about 8% for the year 2020-

21. But, the country again got affected by the sudden spurt

of 2nd wave of COVID-19 in April, 2021 with much higher

intensity. This has impacted the pace of recovery. Luckily,

unlike the 1st wave in 2020 when the entire nation was

locked down for a considerable stretch, so far the COVID-

related restrictions are being implemented selectively in

different parts of the country. It is expected that on account

of measures undertaken by the Government, the impact on

economy would be mitigated to some extent.

As per the second advance estimates of national income

2020-21, agriculture and allied sector registered a positive

growth of 3% during financial year 2020-21 over the

previous year. Apart from normal monsoon for the second

consecutive year, growth in agriculture was also supported
