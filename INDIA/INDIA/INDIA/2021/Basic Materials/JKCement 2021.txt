Managing Director’s message

Progressing with passion: Dear Shareholders,

FY 2020-21 was an unprecedented year like no other.

A ‘once in a century’ crisis, in the form of the COVID-19

pandemic, that adversely affected the life and livelihood

of billions of people. However, J.K. Cement is no stranger

to challenges, and we have always had the visionary

leadership of our beloved

Managing Director & CEO’s perspective

Driving responsible growth

MnTPA in FY 2019-20. We are witnessing encouraging

market share growth in premium products especially

Superstrong and Weathershield.

Focus on better efficiency

We consistently work on various energy efficiency

initiatives such as technological upgradation, process

optimisation, and productivity improvement. During

FY 2020-21, we have taken various efforts to reduce

our energy consumption across all our units. These

energy conservation measures resulted in reduction

of power consumption from 76 units per tonne of

cementitious product in FY 2019-20 to 71 units per ton

of cementitious product in FY 2020-21. Currently, our

thermal substitution rate stood at 6.5% and specific

thermal energy stood 3.07 GJ per tonne of clinker.

Further, 25% of our power requirement is met through

renewable sources.

Recently, we were awarded a limestone block in

Jaisalmer which will strengthen our raw material security

for our northern plants and enable us to further grow our

presence in the region.

Capacity building

We foresee that the overall demand for cement is poised

to grow in a stable manner and we are expanding at the

right time. Hence, we have further reinforced our growing

footprint in India, aligning with our commitment to carry

forward ‘A Solid Legacy of Trust’ and contributing to

the country’s economy and industrial prowess. In the

last couple of fiscals, we have successfully completed

our grey cement capacity expansion of 4.2 MnTPA

comprising (2 MnTPA) in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh

(1.5 MnTPA), and Gujarat (0.7 MnTPA). Now our total

manufacturing capacity of grey cement stands at 14.7

MnTPA. We also successfully commissioned the Line 3

at our Katni plant, which is now the largest putty plant in

India, with a capacity of 0.7 MnTPA.

Moreover, our line No. 3 upgradation at the Nimbahera

plant is progressing in full momentum and expected to

be complete in FY 2021-22. The work on our greenfield

grey cement capacity of 4 MnTPA at Panna, Madhya

Pradesh with a split grinding unit at Hamirpur, Uttar

Pradesh is also progressing on track. This would have

a clinker capacity of 8,000 TPD and 2 MnTPA cement

grinding capacity each at Panna in Madhya Pradesh and

at Hamirpur in Uttar Pradesh. We will also have a waste

heat recovery plant of 22 MW at the greenfield site.

New product launches

Over the years we have constantly focused on increasing

our portfolio of value-added product to grow our

relevance in the building products universe. We entered

the Wood-paint segment with the launch of Wood Amore

– a range of premium Italian wood finishes in a range of

Polyurethane (PU) products ensuring outstanding finish,

appealing aesthetics and higher durability for wood

surfaces, introduced in matte and glossy finishes and

2,000 different colours. Translated as ‘love for wood’,

Wood Amore has been formulated in collaboration

with Italian wood coatings and finishes pioneer Sivam

Coatings.

We also launched JK Cement RepairMaxX, a ready to use

white masonry cement which can fill cracks and gaps on

the interior and exterior surfaces. It is formulated with

an advanced Bonding Agent that ensures incomparable

crack bridging the ability for plaster cracks upto 10 mm.

Doing more together

We have created a robust distribution network ensuring

that our product reaches the last mile. Throughout our

journey, we have consistently engaged with our dealers,

retailers and stockists. During FY 2020-21, our grey

team have organised 3,086 virtual events attended

40,163 participants, and 3,559 physical events attended

by 77,551 participants across all our regions. In white

cement, we conducted our first ever virtual Annual

Dealer Conference. Two meets were organised to create

an immersive experience for all stakeholders and an

innovative way to stay connected with the channel

partners through the pandemic. We also have organised

6,196 events for painters, masons, and contractors

during the year.

Sustainable operations

We are strengthening our sustainability journey by broad

basing our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)

commitments. We have outlined our targets till FY30

and are closely monitoring our progress. We have also

committed to Science-Based Targets (SBTi) to combat

climate change. Our target is to reduce specific direct net

CO2 emission to 465 KgCO2/t of cementitious products

by FY30 from the current level of 589 KgCO2/t. Further,: Dear Shareholders,

Energy Conservation

Sustainable Development and continuous improvement of Key Performance Indicators are of prime

importance for the company.Energy reduction in every field is the need of time to sustain business in the

current scenario of each & every industry including Cement. Major contribution towards cost of manufactured

cement is the Electrical energy and Thermal energy consumption, so for J.K. Cement main focus to reduce

cost of production is the conservation of electrical & thermal energy .

During the year 2020-21, various efforts have been done to reduce the consumption of electrical & thermal

energy for the production of cement by our different manufacturing units . These energy conservation

measures during 2020-21 has resulted in reduction of power consumption by 960.82 lacs KWH, equivalent to

8,262 MTOE.

In an additional reduction in Thermal energy consumption, 22,822 MTOE during the year have been replaced

by alternative fuel & other Operational initiatives to conserve primary fuels. Total Investment was

` 1,04,799.22 lacs

The overall energy saving projects are classified into the listed categories:-

√

Process optimisation with nil investment

√

Installation of energy efficient equipments

√

Implementing in house kaizens & modifications

√

Downsizing of existing equipments

√

Improving Thermal efficiency.

√

Improving Production & Operational efficiecy.

√

R&D Activities and Adopting new Technology.

√

VFD installation in fans

Process optimisation

By the optimisation of various process parameters, interlockings, logics etc., many savings were achieved.

Monitoring of Production process and Analysis of data is very important for energy conservation. By various

process optimisations saving of ` 716.01 lacs achieved with reducion of 120.43 lacs KWH of electricity with

expenditure of ` 16.38 lacs only. Most of the optimisations are done without investment.

Installation of Energy Efficient Equipments

Replacement of low efficiency motors by high efficiency motors , replacement of high power consumption

lamps by energy saving LED lamps and other energy efficient equipments of the latest technology were

installed to improve the electrical efficiency of the system. By these steps saving of 538.62 lacs KWH

equivalent to 4,631 MTOE and ` 2,969.97 lacs with the expenditure of ` 15,194.5 lacs.

Implementing In-house kaizens & modifications

Small steps of energy savings like kaizen in various section of Production & Process is a big tool for energy

conservation. Such small modifications resulted in savings of 2.58 lacs KWH equal to 22 MTOE and ` 14.57

lacs of electricity with ` 4.79 lacs investment only.

Downsizing of the existing equipments

Utilisation of optimum loading on motors with respect to existing lower loading and rated KW, various motors

were replaced by lower KW ratings resulting in Improvement in loading factor and efficiency. Such steps in

total resulted in savings of ` 0.31 lacs by reducing 0.06 lacs KWH of electricity with zero investment.
