Dear Shareholders,

We started this fiscal year, with the first

Covid-19 wave, which had commenced

in March 2020, experienced some

improvement in both covid cases and

traffic during the year, but ended in

March 2021 with an even more severe

second Covid-19 wave. All in all, it was

an extraordinarily challenging year

for our customers, our employees, our

shareholders, and the communities we

serve.

Our handling of the

Covid-19 crisis

As a Management team, we conducted

an in-depth analysis of our objectives,

our practices, and our processes in

response to the unfolding environment.

The single most important objective

we established for ourselves was

to emerge from the crisis stronger

than we entered it. Observing the

volatile environment, we recognised

that we had to discard our penchant

for long term planning and replace

actions have been an important driver

behind the increased customer loyalty

and employee commitment we have

witnessed through the pandemic.

Driven by the improvement in the

customer service levels, made possible

by an engaged and enthusiastic work

force, IndiGo’s Net Promoter Scores

(NPS) are higher than they were during

the pre-Covid levels and the customer

complaints are at minimal levels.

Remaining disciplined with our cost

structure is key to our success, and

during the year, significant actions

were taken to enhance IndiGo’s cost

leadership, ensure liquidity and reduce

cash burn. One of the most crucial

elements of our success is of course

our fleet, and we are rapidly replacing

our old CEOs with fuel efficient NEO

aircraft. To bolster liquidity, IndiGo

has raised 66 billion rupees of

additional funds in FY 2021. Apart

from this, IndiGo has also announced

additional liquidity of 45 billion rupees

for FY 2022. We are also considering

Ronojoy Dutta – Whole Time Director and Chief Executive Officer:

Letter of Intent has been signed with a lessor for two aircraft.

In FY 2021, your Company was ranked the safest airline in India by the Safe Travel

Barometer. IndiGo has taken all precautionary measures as mandated by the

government and has also gone beyond, to ensure the safety of its passengers

onboard. This recognition is the evidence of IndiGo’s commitment towards safety,

and it further encourages us to strive for better services for the customers as they

travel onboard the lean, clean flying

machines.

In FY 2021, your Company was ranked

33rd amongst India’s top 100 brands

by Campaign India, a phenomenal

improvement of 52 positions as

compared to the previous year. These

awards are a testimony to IndiGo’s

best-in-class service quality.

(iii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.

Market risk comprises two types of risk namely: currency risk and interest rate risk. The objective of market risk management is

to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.

A.

Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market

interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates primarily relates to certain bank deposits,

foreign currency term loan and certain lease liabilities carrying floating rate of interest.

Exposure to interest rate risk

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from certain bank deposits, foreign currency term loan and certain lease liabilities carrying

floating rate of interest. These deposits and obligations expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The exposure of the

Group to interest rate changes as reported to the management at the end of the reporting period are as follows:
