BOARD OF

DIRECTORS

Amita Birla

Dear Shareholders,

Another unusual year, after anticipating that the last one would be the most challenging, awaits us this year.

2021 will see COVID-19 rearrange our travel, our supply chains, our ability to predict much in advance. However,

there is undeniable benefit from the worldwide rollout of vaccines, and this is already evident. We are coming to

grips with how to manage our lives and manage our businesses with more agility and creativity. The worst is not

behind us, but there are certainly better times to come. I am cautiously optimistic and have reason to be so.

The financial year 2021 was meant to be the year of consolidation. It was the year where we would see the

convergence of all systems, processes, and programs to leverage the strengths of the ‘new’ Birlasoft. It was a

year of going out, all guns blazing, and realizing the bold goals we had set for ourselves! However, this insidious

little virus had other plans. In the blink of an eye, everything had changed. The world had become an unsafe

place. Streets that used to be bustling with traffic were deserted. Economic activity came to a standstill, people

stopped buying, planes stopped flying, and our world became confined to the four walls of our homes.

Against this backdrop, let us pause for a minute and take stock of where we are: FY 20-21 has been an

exceptional year for Birlasoft, despite the odds. The Company reported revenues of ₹ 35,557 Million, a growth

of 8% YoY. The profitability stood at ₹ 3,208 Million and witnessed a jump of 43% on a yearly basis. We signed

record deals amounting to US$ 888 Million while keeping our overall attrition low and maintaining strong cash

flow through the year. Customer sentiment stayed consistently strong, as evident in our NPS scores and our

share price at a record high, a testimony to our investor sentiment.

The journey hasn’t been an easy one. We had to question and unlearn all that we knew and quickly pivot to the

new reality. “Virtuality” became the new “Reality”, and we embraced it. We found new ways to work with our

teams, different means of engaging with our customers and servicing them, newer ways to deliver on our

commitments – all this while staying true to our fundamentals and ensuring that our employees stay safe. We

were one of the first organisations to move to a complete work from home model. We also introduced a

multitude of benefits, ranging from a COVID Helpdesk to enhance health cover, procuring oxygen concentrators

for our employees, enhanced reimbursement for vaccination and hospitalisation, promoted emotional

wellbeing, and grief counselling programs through the Employee Reach Out program. And much more.

Simultaneously, we continued to strengthen our foundations in terms of leadership hiring, accelerating

cross-selling, increasing annuity revenue share, investing in key talent, forging strategic alliances with the key

software OEM’s. With our ‘Digital-is-Everywhere’ and Cloud-First approaches, we are determined to weave

industry-led solutions to help our customers unshackle themselves and accelerate their business

transformation journeys.

Annual Report 2020-21 | 01

Managing Director of the Cummins Group in India and the: Managing

Managing Director's: Letter - FY 2021

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

Financial Year 2020-21 was a year that presented a crisis at an unprecedented scale, with the pandemic having a

considerable impact on human lives and the world economy. Birlasoft responded swiftly to this situation and took

several effective countermeasures to ensure the safety of our employees and facilitate smooth operations for our

valued customers. I am extremely proud of our employees, who have shown tremendous resilience and

commitment in serving our customers in times of strife.

In the first year of our merger, we were focused on streamlining the integration between the two companies and

laying a solid foundation for future growth. With COVID-19 impacting our second year of operations,

combined with a sizeable ERP-centric business mix, it was an even bigger challenge to navigate through.

However, we sharpened our focus on strengthening the key fundamentals to transformation and converted the

crisis into an opportunity.

During these times of heightened uncertainties, travel restrictions, and work-from-home conditions, there was a

steep drop in net new sales as witnessed across the IT industry. We reinforced our efforts on cross-selling to

our key customers with whom we have had lasting relationships based on trust and confidence in our capabilities.

In addition, we consolidated our positioning by making structural changes in the organizational fabric and

business strategy, thus preparing the course for accelerated growth. Over these two years since the merger, we

have steadily built a reputation of being a formidable player in the market, with our strong Enterprise Solutions

and Digital capabilities. As a testimony to our growing brand, we have received several accolades, right from being

recognized as India’s Most Admired & Valuable Power Brand Company 2020, to winning the Aegis Graham Bell

Award (AGBA) for our intelliOpen™ solution, Manufacturing Leadership Partner Award, SABERA 2020 Award for

our community-benefiting Initiative - Project Shodhan, to being featured in the Global ISG Index™, across

categories for four times.

We have gained momentum and have delivered an encouraging performance this year, despite the pandemic. As

per our commitment made last year, we have put in unstinted efforts to ensure we fulfill our top priorities and

move forward in alignment with our long-term goals to become a billion-dollar organization. Some of the notable

highlights are listed below:

Operational rigor: Several key parameters have helped us reach our initially set target of 15% EBITDA during the

year. The employee cost came down from 60.7% in FY 2020 to 59.5% in the financial year 2021, a drop of about

1.2% YOY. This was possible due to our efforts to broaden the pyramid as we continued to add freshers and

strengthen our learning and development. Our utilization rate reached an all-time high of 85.6%, and the attrition

rate at an all-time low of 10.9% during the year. The improvement in these parameters has been possible due to

our continued focus on our optimization initiatives, despite headwinds due to the pandemic situation.

Improve annuity revenue through cross-selling: The COVID environment acted as a catalyst for us in our

transformation journey, and we were able to improve our annuity business up from ~60% in FY 2020 to ~70% at

the end of this fiscal. Our ability and desire to drive the conversation with our top customers proactively has

IDs either with the Registrar and Transfer Agent or with their respective Depository Participants. It is a welcome move for the

society at large, as this will reduce paper consumption to a great extent and allow the members to contribute towards a greener

environment. This is a golden opportunity for every member of the Company to contribute to the cause of “Green Initiative”.

In view of the above, we propose to send you the member communications and documents like Annual Reports, Notices, etc.

through electronic mode, in future. In order to facilitate electronic communication with you, we request you to register your

e-mail IDs with your respective Depository Participants (for shares held in demat form) or with our Registrar and Transfer Agent

- Link Intime India Private Limited at: pune@linkintime.co.in (for shares held in physical form). Alternatively, you may register

your e-mail ID with the Company by writing an email to contactus@birlasoft.com with the subject line – “Green Initiative”.

If you have already registered your e-mail ID, you are not required to re-register the same unless there is a change in your e-mail

ID.

We believe that by subscribing to this green initiative, you will receive all the communications addressed to the members on

time and you would also be contributing towards the protection of your environment.

We request your support for the “Green Initiative”.

Thanking you.

268 | Birlasoft Limited

Managing Director of the Company (Director Identification

Number: 08443715), has been granted Stock Options

(“Options”) and Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) under “Special

Purpose Birlasoft - Employee Stock Option Plan 2019” (“ESOP

2019”) and “Birlasoft Share Incentive Plan 2019” (“SIP 2019”) as

part of his compensation package. The details of these grants

have been appropriately disclosed in the Annual Reports of the

Company.

The perquisite value of the Options/RSUs, if any, exercised by

Mr. Kapoor during any financial year will become a part of his

total remuneration. The perquisite value is the differential value

between the fair market price of shares on the date of exercise

of Options/RSUs and the exercise price. The perquisite value

is directly linked to the fair market value of the shares of the

Company on the date of exercise of Options/RSUs.

During the financial year 2020-21, as per vesting schedule

under ESOP 2019, certain number of options have vested. Also,

in the financial year 2021-22, as per the vesting schedule under

SIP 2019, certain number of Options/RSUs are due for vesting.

Taking into account the perquisite value which will get added to

his remuneration, the total managerial remuneration payable

to him will exceed 5% of the net profits of the Company.

Pursuant to the recommendation of the Nomination and

Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors of the

Company in its meeting held on May 21, 2021, approved and

recommended to the members an increase in the managerial

remuneration limit payable to Mr. Kapoor in excess of 5% of

the net profits of the Company (computed in the manner as

laid down in Section 198 of the Act). This has been proposed

by the Board to primarily facilitate exercise of Options/RSUs

granted to and vested unto Mr. Kapoor pursuant to the grants

made under ESOP 2019 and SIP 2019, and will not entail any

additional cash outflow for the Company.

If Mr. Kapoor exercises all the Options/RSUs which he is

entitled to exercise, the aggregate remuneration payable by

the Company to Mr. Kapoor including perquisite value is likely

to exceed the limits stipulated under the Act.

Taking into consideration the present value of the shares of the

Company and the number of Options and RSUs which can be

exercised by Mr. Kapoor during the financial year 2021-22, and

the remuneration payable to the non-executive directors of the

Company, the value of the aggregate remuneration payable to

all directors of the Company is not likely to exceed 15% of the

net profits.

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 197 and other applicable

provisions of the Act, read with Schedule V thereof and the

Rules made thereunder, the total managerial remuneration

payable by a company to its directors, including managing

director, whole-time director and manager, if any, in respect

of any financial year may exceed 11% of the net profits of the

Company, provided the same is approved by the members of

the Company.

In the premises aforesaid, the members are requested to

consider increase in the overall maximum limit of managerial

remuneration payable by the Company in respect of the

financial year 2021-22, to the extent it will exceed 11% of the net

profits of the Company, computed in the manner as laid down in

Section 198 of the Act.

Further, pursuant to the provisions of Section 197 of the Act, the

members of the Company at the 28th Annual General Meeting

held on August 7, 2019, had accorded their approval for payment

of commission to the Non-Executive Directors of the Company,

not exceeding 1% of net profits (computed in the manner as

laid down in Section 198 of the Act), for a period of five years

commencing from the financial year 2019-20. The Company

does not propose to modify or alter the said limit of 1%.

Except Mr. Kapoor and his relatives, none of the other Directors,

Key Managerial Personnel or any of their respective relatives

are, in any way, concerned or interested, whether financially or

otherwise, in this resolution.

Mr. Kapoor is not related to any other Director or Key Managerial

Personnel of the Company or relatives of the Directors or Key

Managerial Personnel.

The Board of Directors recommends the resolution for approval

of members of the Company, as set out at Item No. 5 of the

Notice.
