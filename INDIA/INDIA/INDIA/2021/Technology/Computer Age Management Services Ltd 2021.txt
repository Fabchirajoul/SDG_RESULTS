Dear Stakeholders,

As I write this message, the country is

coming out of Corona second wave,

which was far more severe than the

first one. It is a crisis of the kind that

we have not seen in generations. I

urge you to stay safe, get vaccinated

and keep your spirits up. Despite the

challenges and hardships that each

one of us has been dealing with, it is

important to stay optimistic. The India

growth story is predicated around

domestic consumption and demand

will revive and the economy is bound

to grow.

This is our first annual report after the

Company has gone public. Company’s

performance, both on the business

front and in the stock market post

listing, has been gratifying.

As you are all aware, Company’s

major business is that of providing

Registrar and Transfer Agency

services to the Indian Mutual Fund

industry. My view on the Mutual Fund

industry’s growth story remains strong.

With financialisation of household

savings continuing to deepen as

a trend, Mutual Funds will remain

Agency by PFRDA, launch of new

initiatives like Recon Dynamix

and deepening of offerings in the

Payments and Insurance space.

Your Company is guided by its core

value of putting its customers at

the centre of everything it does –

“Our Mission… Your Growth”. This

is reflected in the high scores in

customer satisfaction survey results

with 95.3% of satisfied & highly

satisfied investors & distributors and

an overall 90.5 NPS score.

Your Company exited the year with

strong set of financial results and

operational performance. Looking

ahead, your Company sees immense

opportunity to grow in its chosen

areas of business and is investing in

the required skill sets and capabilities.

This performance also reflects the

confidence of the clients and investors

in the company.

On behalf of the Board of CAMS,

I would like to thank MF investors,

distributors and all our customers who

avail our services and have made

us what we are today. My heartfelt

gratitude to all the employees of

CAMS Group for their resilience

and hard work which enabled the

Company to deliver in the most

difficult circumstances. I also would

like to thank our shareholders who

have reposed their faith in us. I would

also like to thank other Directors in

the Board for their support and active

participation in the Governance of the

company.

Warm Regards,

Dinesh Kumar Mehrotra

Chairman

important and relevant in the savings

and investment landscape. Your

Company is an integral part of the

industry, sitting at the heart of the

Mutual Fund ecosystem and is well

positioned to grow with / ahead of

the industry.

On the business front, your Company

weathered the pandemic very well. It

adapted quickly to a new operating

model that prioritised the health and

wellbeing of its employees, while

enabling it to continue supporting its

customers. During the initial phase

of FY20 lockdown, Company had to

temporarily shut down many of its

front offices but scaled to provide

near full scope services after the

initial phase and quickly moved on to

business as usual by second quarter

end of last financial year.

Despite FY 2020-21 being a pandemic

year, it proved to be a hectic period

with implementation of several

high-impact regulatory & tax-related

changes, acquisition of a large

new client in the MF space, getting

selected as a Central Recordkeeping

33rd Annual Report 2020-21

Computer Age Management Services Limited:

Dear Shareholders

I am pleased to present to you the

Company’s first annual report post

a successful IPO launch which you

are aware was made in an extremely

challenging environment. The year will

go down as a truly memorable one in

the history of CAMS, as the pandemic-

led environment did not hold us

back from pursuing our vision for the

Company and achieve the aspirational

agenda that we had set for ourselves

during the year.

The legacy of commitment was built

on the strong foundation laid by the

founder Mr. V Shankar whose vision

in many ways is responsible for

where the Company is today. I take

this opportunity to acknowledge his

pioneering vision and contribution to

the Company. It gives us direction and

the drive to serve our customers and

investors in new and improved ways.

We have been focussed on enhancing

investor & distributor experience,

fortifying information security

practices, expanding the leadership

team, sowing seeds for new revenue

lines and enhancing governance in

Responding to challenges

FY21 was, by all account, an

extraordinarily difficult year, with the

unprecedented COVID pandemic-led

crisis seriously impacting economies

and industries worldwide.

For the first time in the history of the

Company, we started work-from-

home operations in March 2020. We

moved with rapid agility to roll out

our Business Continuity Plan (BCP),

in order to meet SLAs and client

commitments. This was done after

working through numerous design-

aspects of the new paradigm such

as information security, availability of

desktops and last-mile connectivity in

the houses of employees, including

those who were at Tier 2 locations.

Closing and subsequent reopening

of 270 front offices while adhering

to local laws was managed in a

disciplined fashion while serving

investors and distributors through

alternate modes. As a result of our

agile response to the transforming

situation, I am happy to share that

despite the extraordinary difficulties

triggered by the pandemic, we stayed

on course to ensure that our MF

customers and investors were not

impacted and continued to get high

fidelity service without any expansion

in risk.

It is pertinent to share with you that the

Company delivered uncompromised

service levels despite the transaction

volumes scaling to historic high of 86

million in Q4-FY21.

I would like to thank my leadership

team and the entire workforce whose

commendable spirit of commitment

and energy helped face the

unprecedented situation head-on and

order to steer the Company towards

greater achievements and delivering

to societal responsibilities.

A milestone year

The enthusiasm with which our Initial

Public Offering (IPO) was received in

the market underscores the strength

of CAMS, and its rich legacy of long-

term and sustained value creation for

all its stakeholders. It also underlines

our continued commitment to our

customers, partners, distributors,

investors, shareholders and not in the

least our employees, who have made

it possible for us to realise our vision

of inclusive, sustainable growth.

At the outset, I would like to thank all

of them for their contribution to the

success of the IPO, which opened on

September 21, 2020, to an excellent

response and was oversubscribed 47

times. This overwhelming response

will enable us to further strengthen the

foundations of the edifice on which

we have built a robust organisation,

designed for continuing and durable

business growth.
