CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE

AT INFOSYS

Our corporate governance framework ensures that we make

timely disclosures and share accurate information regarding

our financials and performance, as well as disclosures related

to the leadership and governance of the Company.

Corporate governance guidelines

The Company recognizes that the enhancement of corporate

governance is one of the most important aspects in terms of

achieving the Company’s goal of enhancing corporate value

by deepening societal trust. Strong corporate governance

founded on values is the bedrock of the sustained performance

at the Company and fuels the Company’s vision to achieve the

respect of stakeholders.

The corporate governance standards established (and updated

from time to time) by the Board of the Company provide a

structure within which directors and the Management can

effectively pursue the Company’s objectives for the benefit of

its stakeholders. These guidelines are framed in conjunction

with the Company’s Memorandum & Articles of Association,

the charters of the committees of the Board and applicable

laws / regulations /guidelines in force for the time being in

India and the US and other jurisdictions, as applicable.

The Board has defined a set of corporate governance best

practices and guidelines to help fulfill our corporate

responsibility towards our stakeholders. These guidelines

ensure that the Board will have the necessary authority

and processes to review and evaluate our operations as and

when required. Further, these guidelines allow the Board to

make decisions that are independent of the Management.

The Board, at its discretion, may change these guidelines

periodically to achieve our stated objectives. The guidelines

can be accessed on our website, at https://www.infosys.

com/investors/corporate-governance/Documents/corporate-

governance-guidelines.pdf. In addition to these guidelines,

the Company actively complies with the relevant global

guidelines and standards and corporate governance codes.

Indemnification agreements

We have also entered into agreements to indemnify our

directors and officers for claims brought against them to

the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. These

agreements, among other things, indemnify our directors

and officers for certain expenses, judgments, fines and

settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any

action or proceedings, including any action by or in the right

of Infosys Limited, arising out of such persons’ services as

our director or officer, expenses in relation to public relations

consultation, if required.

C. Board meetings

Scheduling and selection of agenda items for

Board meetings

The tentative dates of Board meetings for the next fiscal are

decided in advance and published in the Annual Report

as part of Shareholder information. The Chairman and the

Company Secretary draft the agenda for each meeting, along

with explanatory notes, in consultation with the CEO & MD,

and distribute these in advance to the directors. Every Board

member can suggest the inclusion of additional items in the

agenda. The Board meets at least once a quarter to review the

quarterly results and other items on the agenda, and also on

the occasion of the AGM. Additional meetings are held when

necessary. Independent directors are expected to attend at

least four quarterly Board meetings and the AGM. However,

with the Board being represented by independent directors

from various parts of the world, it may not be possible for

each one of them to be physically present at all meetings.

Hence, we provide video / teleconferencing facilities to enable

their participation. Committees of the Board usually meet the

day before the Board meeting, or whenever the need arises

for transacting business. This year, these meetings were held

virtually in line with the relaxations provided by the Ministry

of Corporate Affairs and the Securities Exchange Board of

India. The Board members are expected to rigorously prepare

for, attend and participate in Board and applicable committee

meetings. Each member is expected to ensure their other

current and planned future commitments do not materially

interfere with their responsibilities with us.

letter in line with

Recommendation No. 9 of the Blue Ribbon Committee

on audit committee effectiveness, to be provided in the

financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS in

the Annual Report on Form 20-F.

Relying on its review and the discussions with the Management

and the independent auditors, the Committee believes that

the Company’s financial statements are fairly presented

in conformity with Ind AS and IFRS and that there is no

significant deficiency or material weakness in the Company’s

internal control over financial reporting. In conclusion,

the Committee is sufficiently satisfied that it has complied

with its responsibilities as outlined in the audit committee

charter. The Board accepted all recommendations made by

the audit committee.

Managing Director, Head of Infrastructure Management

Services, Delivery Head for Europe, and Head of Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods, Logistics and Life Sciences. Pravin is

the Chief Operating Officer of Infosys and a Whole-time Director of the Board. He was inducted on January 10, 2014 as a

member of the Board. He is a member of the stakeholders relationship committee and the corporate social responsibility

committee of the Board. As the Chief Operating Officer, Pravin has overall strategic and operational responsibility for the

entire portfolio of the Company’s offerings. Pravin oversees the key functions of global delivery and business enablement.

Pravin was the chairperson of the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) in fiscal 2021 and

is currently a member of the Executive Council of NASSCOM. He was also part of the National Council of CII from 2014 to

2020 and is known for his strategic thinking and as an eminent industry leader.

In fiscal 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first broke, Infosys was swift to react under the leadership of Pravin, providing

the required support to the workforce, clients and the community. From setting up a core team to monitor the situation

closely and staying in constant touch with the local authorities, sharing timely updates with the global employee base

through local anchors, to enabling the near-seamless transition to the remote mode of work – he steered the Company

to scale up its efforts quickly and rise to the challenge. Central to these efforts was the need to ensure the physical safety

and mental wellbeing of our global workforce. Today, 96.5% of Infosys employees continue to work from home. With a

more virulent surge of the pandemic in India, Infosys has ramped up its efforts significantly. Infosys has set up exclusive

COVID care centers across seven DC locations including Bengaluru, Pune, NCR, Chennai, Hyderabad, and similar centers

are on the anvil in the coming weeks across all other Infosys locations. We have comprehended the importance of the role

that vaccines play in our fight to counter this pandemic. By working very closely with the government authorities and

medical experts, we have put together various frameworks for the immunization drive to encourage employees and their

family members to get vaccinated. The Company was able to achieve all these seamlessly thanks to Pravin's guidance and

leadership. Pravin will be superannuating on December 12, 2021 as per the Company’s retirement policy.

The nomination and remuneration committee, in view of his outstanding service in his exemplary career spanning 35 years

with the Company, has recommended to amend the terms of his appointment and remuneration to include the following:

(i) Payment of a special one-time bonus of ` 4 crore on his retirement in December 2021 after a career spanning over

35 years, in view of his outstanding contribution to the Company, especially during the pandemic. Under U.B. Pravin

Rao’s leadership, the Company immediately shifted to remote working and met customer expectations. He led the

comprehensive efforts of the Company to scale up IT infrastructure, enhance focus on employee safety, health and

well-being, and in successfully managing the operations during the pandemic. He drove actions that helped the

Company to become very resilient and responsive in face of this enormous crisis.

(ii) Accelerate vesting of 31,725 Restricted Stock Unites (RSUs) due for vesting during fiscal 2022, which is due for vesting

within 90 days after the retirement date [Total of 31,725 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) due to vest in fiscal 2022 under the

2015 Incentive Compensation Plan, of which 17,062 RSUs are due to vest on February 1, 2022 and 14,663 RSUs are due to

vest on February 27, 2022. Total of 46,388 RSUs will be forfeited, of which 31,725 RSUs are due to vest in fiscal 2023 and

14,663 RSUs are due to vest in fiscal 2024].

Accordingly, the Board has taken note of Pravin's outstanding service and approved the inclusion of the above revision to

his terms of appointment and remuneration.

The said changes have been approved by the nomination and remuneration committee and the Board of Directors of the

Company in accordance with Sections 196, 197 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules

made thereunder, read with Schedule V of the Act (including any statutory modification(s) or reenactments(s) thereof).
