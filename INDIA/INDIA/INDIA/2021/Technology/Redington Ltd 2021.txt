Forward-Looking Statement

In this annual report, we have disclosed forward looking information to enable investors to comprehend our prospects and take informed investment

decisions. This report and other statements – written and oral – that we periodically make, may contain forward-looking statements that set out

anticipated results based on the management’s plans and assumptions. We have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words

such as ‘anticipates’, ‘estimates’, ‘expects’, ‘projects’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’ and words of similar substance in connection with any discussion

of future performance. While these forward looking statements indicate our assessment and future expectations concerning the development of our

business, a number of risks, uncertainties, inaccurate assumptions and other unknown factors could cause actual developments and results to differ

materially from our expectations.

These factors include, but are not limited to, general market, macroeconomic, governmental and regulatory trends, movements in currency

exchange and interest rates, competitive pressures, technological developments, changes in the financial conditions of third parties dealing with us,

legislative developments, and other key factors that could affect our business and financial performance.

Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially

from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of

new information, future events or otherwise.

Managing Director:

Dear Shareholders,

I begin by thanking you – all our Shareholders,

for supporting us and standing by us, through

good times and through challenging times.

I raise a toast to all my extraordinary

colleagues, who, over many years, have given

this great Company of yours, the highest

possible levels of commitment, dedication

and unqualified support.

I wish to express my deep gratitude to all our

Business Partners – Vendors and Dealers,

who continue to bestow their confidence in

your Company.

My sincere appreciation for the whole-hearted

support that we have received at all times

from our bankers and our auditors.

My heartfelt thanks to the Members of

Redington’s Board, whose guidance, advice

and support has been invaluable, especially

during one of the most momentous periods in

your Company’s history.

FY21 was unprecedented. An unknown

virus, originating from deep within China in

December 2019, had, by March 2020, spread

across the Globe like a wildfire, in the form of

a pandemic, aided by a supremely mobile &

connected society. All of us are acutely aware

of how this has fundamentally changed our

lives. Many sectors of the economy, especially

those engaged in Hospitality, Travel, Tourism,

Entertainment and a multitude of Small &

Medium businesses have witnessed closures

for long durations, leading to loss of livelihood

for millions. Rapid vaccination is now the

single most important agenda for most

National Governments.

The widespread “Engage-from-Home” has

required individuals, societies, businesses &

governments to turn to technology in order

to evolve a working model and this placed

your Company in an advantageous position.

Demand for IT & Mobility products, which help

people engage with each other, witnessed

a tremendous surge in demand and your

Company’s position as a premier distributor of

such products enabled it to fully capitalize on

this opportunity.

But this required planning, discipline and

preparedness. As I had reported last year,

we quickly devised a customized play-book

to ensure the highest possible degree of

Risk Mitigation & Business Preparedness.

The principle of 7Cs (Cash Flow, Collection,

Cost, Customer, Contract, Control and

Communication), was always an integral

part of our business philosophy, but our

heightened focus during the last financial year,

has now embedded it in our daily & routine

decision making.

Across the diverse markets & geographies;

with challenges arising out of the pandemic

and often stoked by economic circumstances

or socio-political turmoils, Redingtonians

leveraged the 7Cs, to not only overcome

challenges, but to do that with style and

panache, going on to deliver historic

Revenue & Profits. Each & every constituent

came together to craft this record breaking

performance.

The results require no elaboration

• Revenue growth of 10.7%

• EBITDA growth of 34.3%

• PAT growth of 46.8% (PAT growth without

one-time tax effect - 64.1%)

• A 16.4% ROE

• A 19.9% ROCE (Gross); 36.5% ROCE (Net

of Cash)

• Net Debt : Equity of (0.58) [Negative NDE]

The outstanding results are attributable to

Top & Bottom line growths in India as well

as Overseas theaters and through stellar

contribution from both IT & Mobility business

verticals. Growth in Mobility business, on
