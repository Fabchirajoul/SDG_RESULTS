letter dated January 7, 2009 Mr. B. Ramalinga Raju, the then Chairman of erstwhile Satyam,

stated that the Balance Sheet of erstwhile Satyam as at September 30, 2008 carried inflated cash

and bank balances, non-existent accrued interest, an understated liability and an overstated

debtors position. Consequently, various regulators/investigating agencies such as the Serious Fraud

Investigation Office (‘SFIO’)/Registrar of Companies (‘ROC’), Directorate of Enforcement (‘ED’),

Central Bureau of Investigation (‘CBI’) had initiated investigations on various matters and conducted

inspections and issued notices calling for information including from certain subsidiaries which have

been responded to.

In 2009, SFIO initiated two proceedings against erstwhile Satyam for violations of Companies Act,

1956, which were compounded.

Further, ED issued show-cause notices for certain non-compliances of provisions of the Foreign

Exchange Management Act, 1999 (‘FEMA’) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Realisation,

Repatriation and Surrender of Foreign Exchange) Regulations, 2000 by the erstwhile Satyam.

These pertained to

letter dated January 7, 2009 Mr. B. Ramalinga Raju, the then Chairman of erstwhile Satyam, stated that

the Balance Sheet of erstwhile Satyam as at September 30, 2008 carried inflated cash and bank balances,

non-existent accrued interest, an understated liability and an overstated debtors position. Consequently,

various regulators/investigating agencies such as the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (‘SFIO’)/Registrar

of Companies (‘ROC’), Directorate of Enforcement (‘ED’), Central Bureau of Investigation (‘CBI’) had initiated

investigations on various matters and conducted inspections and issued notices calling for information

including from certain subsidiaries which have been responded to.

In 2009, SFIO initiated two proceedings against erstwhile Satyam for violations of Companies Act, 1956,

which were compounded.

Further, ED issued show-cause notices for certain non-compliances of provisions of the Foreign Exchange

Management Act, 1999 (‘FEMA’) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Realisation, Repatriation and

Surrender of Foreign Exchange) Regulations, 2000 by the erstwhile Satyam. These pertained to:

a)

alleged non-repatriation of American Depository Receipts (‘ADR’) proceeds aggregating to USD

39.2 Million; and

b)

non-realisation and repatriation of export proceeds to the extent of foreign exchange equivalent to

` 506 Million for invoices raised during the period from July 1997 to December 31, 2002.

These have been responded to by the erstwhile Satyam/the Company, the Company has not received

any further communication in this regard and with the passage of time, the Company does not expect any

further proceedings in this regard.

As per the assessment of the Management, based on the forensic investigation and the information

available, all identified/required adjustments/disclosures arising from the identified financial irregularities,

were made in the financial statements of erstwhile Satyam as at March 31, 2009. Considerable time has

elapsed after the initiation of investigation by various regulators/agencies and no new information has come

to the Management’s notice which requires adjustments to the financial statements. Further, as per above,

the investigations have been completed and no new claims have been received which need any further

evaluation/adjustment/disclosure in the books of account.

B. proceedings in relation to ‘Alleged Advances’:

Erstwhile Satyam received letters from 37 companies seeking confirmation by way of acknowledgement of

receipt of certain alleged amounts by the erstwhile Satyam (referred to as ‘alleged advances’). These letters

were followed by legal notices from these companies dated August 4 and August 5, 2009, claiming repayment

of the alleged advances aggregating ` 12,304 Million stated to be given as temporary advances but without

any evidence in support of the nature of these transactions. This was also borne out in the internal forensic

The Group has identified business segments as reportable segments. Accordingly, Information Technology

(IT) Business and Business Processing Outsourcing (BPO) has been disclosed as business segments.

Geographical information on revenue and business segment revenue information is collated based on

individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.

Segregation of assets (except trade and other receivables), liabilities, depreciation and other non-cash

expenses into various business segments has not been done as the assets are used interchangeably

between segments and the Company is of the view that it is not practical to reasonably allocate liabilities

and other non-cash expenses to individual segments as the same will not be meaningful.

Information on reportable segments for the year ended March 31, 2021 along with comparatives

is given below:
