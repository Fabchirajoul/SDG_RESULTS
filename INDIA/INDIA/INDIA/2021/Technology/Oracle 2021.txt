Letter to Shareholders

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to report that for the financial year ended March 31, 2021, your

Company posted consolidated revenue of ₹ 49.8 billion. Consolidated net profit for the current financial year grew

20% over the previous financial year to reach ₹ 17.6 billion.

We continued to show customer acquisition momentum across all business areas - Corporate Banking, Retail Banking,

Risk and Finance, and Financial Crime. As the Financial Services industry pivoted to digital faster than ever to meet

customer demand in a new normal, we responded with continued product innovation to launch more digital and

cloud-based solutions. We also saw secular growth across regions, highlighting our product's universal acceptance,

flexibility, and capability to service institutions of multiple types and sizes.

The global footprint and market leadership of Oracle FLEXCUBE continues to expand with wins across the world.

Banks across the United Kingdom, Europe, United States, Japan, and the Middle East, chose us to drive working

capital clarity for their customers and embark upon much-needed digitization of corporate banking. Our new solution

for retail banks, Oracle FLEXCUBE Onboarding enables them to deliver seamless cross-channel consistent origination

experiences over cloud and on–premise deployments. Oracle Banking Branch, our latest solution for retail banks, blurs

the digital and physical divide, empowering bankers to take on an advisory role, enrich customer relationships and

drive revenue growth.

Cloud technologies are gaining significant traction, and during the last fiscal, we made significant investments in rapidly

moving our solutions to cloud. We launched solutions for Liquidity Management, Virtual Account Management, and

Supply Chain Finance as cloud services, much ahead of the market. Banks can take advantage of these solutions to

quickly deploy a wide range of banking services that help their corporate customers easily access their cash position

and manage working capital at any time. We also launched Oracle Financial Crime and Compliance Management

Cloud Services an application suite designed for midsized banks and smaller financial institutions. It offers services for

the full anti-money laundering (AML) lifecycle, where organizations can quickly identify abnormal customer behavior

and streamline compliance activities.

We added further momentum to our efforts to "build in" innovation for our customers. We now use machine learning

and Artificial Intelligence ('AI') as a core principle in our product development, enhancing processes within our solutions

to help banks serve customers better and faster, and drive their profitability.

The industry recognizes us for our marketing leadership, product innovation, and customer success in multiple forums.

Gartner continued to place us in the leader's category for Global Retail Core Banking. Of the six companies evaluated,

Oracle was recognized as a Leader for its completeness of vision and ability to execute in the market. We remain

among the top three vendors in Chartis RiskTech100® report for the sixth consecutive year and were recognized as a

winner in five solution categories — Core Technology, Data Integrity and Control, Financial Crime–AML, IFRS 17–Data

Management and Reporting, and Risk Data Aggregation & Reporting. Oracle Financial Services won ‘Best Solution in

Enterprise Risk Management’ at Regulation Asia Awards for Excellence 2020.

We continued our mission to deliver customer success; we had significantly large implementations that went live

across the world. These implementations were on time even with the challenges that came with remote working and

no onsite resources.

Your Company is in a good position to respond to market demands, with the right combination of domain expertise,

functional depth and a modern set of IT solutions.

On behalf of the Board of Directors and Management of Oracle Financial Services Software, I would like to thank you

for your support through this financial year. I look forward to your continued patronage as we chart a new path towards

fulfilling our mission of providing world-class solutions for the financial services industry.

Regards,

S Venkatachalam
