Letter

on August 29, 2021, Happiest Minds will complete ten years from the date of launch.

the theme of my: letter is therefore looking back at the last decade and looking

ahead to the next.

However, before that, it is my painful duty to talk about the havoc being brought by

the Coronavirus in our country. Most of the developed world has largely recovered and

their economies are back to their pre-CoVID levels. Sadly, in India we are reeling under

the onslaught of the second wave which has found us ill-prepared.

The virus continues to mutate, and we must keep adapting. In the first wave,

fatalities were largely among the elderly. In the current wave, young adults in the

prime of their careers have lost their lives. We, at Happiest Minds have not been

spared. During the fortnight preceding the date of this letter, we lost 5 of our fine

young men with promising careers and 38 family members. the pervasiveness and

infectiousness of the virus in the current wave can be gauged by the fact that 8% of

our team tested positive as on 17th May, of whom 26% had to be hospitalized. We are

hoping that no effort will be spared to increase the pace of vaccinations to stem any

further resurgence of infections or a possible 3rd wave. When the pace of vaccinations

should have been increasing exponentially, the vaccination rate has been declining

every day, due to an extreme shortage of vaccines.

the low coverage of population vaccinated makes India more vulnerable to a potential

third wave which, by the looks of it, will increasingly attack young children. the scary

situation further increases the need for vaccine availability. the Central Government

on August 29, 2021,

A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 2 0 - 2 1

letter, I hope to

share some of the highlights and features of the 2021 – 2031 VISIon with you.

the uS Supreme Court in 1819 declared that “a Corporation is an immortal being”.

unfortunately, most organizations survive less than half the lifetime of an average

human being and the period of longevity for corporations is becoming shorter and

shorter. this is partly due to faster changes in the business environment, industries

becoming obsolete due to new technologies etc. However, a key component is also

an appropriate succession planning approach. I have always had in place a plan for my

succession in the event of an exigency to me, in every company I have led. During the

Ipo process, we exposed the contours of the succession plan to our potential investors.

The fulcrum of our succession planning is our Executive Board (‘EB’), comprising our

three Bu Heads and the CFo. eB members work individually and collectively as the

Ceo of the Company. our eB was created in December 2017. the improvement in our

financial results from that date has been dramatic and contributed significantly to our

successful Ipo. equally important, the eB has provided us organizational continuity

and stability. Collaboration has improved and also the quality of decision-making.

Very few issues come to me for resolution and this contributes to organizational

agility. Concurrent with our Ipo, we have added two new roles, Joseph Anantharaju as

executive Vice Chairman, and Venkatraman narayanan as: Managing Director & CFo.

Both continue to be on the eB. In their new roles, one of their key responsibilities is

to lead our M&A initiative. this will have to be an important part of our future plans

as Happiest Minds seeks to become a much larger company. Creating a company

“designed for perpetuity” will require much more than just this, including ownership

structure. this framework will also be part of our Vision 2021-2031. All I can say at

this point is that there will be enormous change. the Happiest Minds of 2031 will be

very, very different from the Company of 2021 and we expect that articulating the

Vision will help us prepare for the change, which will surely arrive.

Before I end, I need to bring myself back to the present moment. As an industry,

we are fortunate that business has been able to continue on a work-from-home basis

without interruptions to project delivery for our customers. Since our major markets

of uS and europe have recovered, demand is strong, and we look forward to

achieving our goal of 20% organic growth. We expect to sustain profitability, though

Profits After Taxes will bear the impact of higher taxes on account of us becoming a

full-tax paying Company having exhausted all benefits of tax deductible ‘brought

forward business losses’ from earlier years.

In conclusion, I would like to conclude by expressing my gratitude to our customers

and partners for their steady support and to our outstanding team whose tireless

efforts have brought us thus far. Also, many thanks to our Board of Directors and

other stakeholders.

Letter

Dear Stakeholder:

this: letter comes to you in the background

of a year and period which has seen

significant changes in your Company,

business, and the overall environment.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, one

of the key focus areas for the executive

Board was to drive sustainable operations

with minimal disruption. our mission of

‘Happiest people . Happiest Customers’

ensured that we balanced both these

constituencies. We transitioned to a

remote working environment smoothly,

successfully and effectively, by ensuring

superior quality of delivery with no

disruption to customer projects and

commitments. We constantly monitored

potential

impact

and

proactively

increased the bandwidth of our teams,

especially where we saw risk because of

CoVID exigencies.

During the pandemic, your Company

provided logistic, financial, and emotional

support to Happiest Minds and their

families.

the

MItHRA

team,

your

Company’s Good Samaritan program

for emotional wellbeing reached out to

more than 1,000 Happiest Minds during

the year. Your Company runs the Internal

First Responder program for people

who are directly or indirectly impacted

by the pandemic, a CoVID-19 Microsite

to publish useful information, and has

developed

an

in-house

Vaccination

tracking System. these initiatives have

tremendously helped our Happiest Minds

to cope with and adapt to uncertainties

related to the pandemic. the executive

Board conveys its deep appreciation to

our Happiest Minds who did everything

possible to support each other as a family

in these adverse times. to summarize, in

spite of disruptions in the environment,

the fact that we as a team rallied together

has been the story of the year.

the pandemic has not only caused

significant damage in terms of life and

the executive Board

conveys its deep

appreciation to our

Happiest Minds who

did everything possible

to support each

other as a family in

these adverse times.

livelihood; it has also taken its toll on

your Company. We lost young and bright

Happiest Minds and family members and

many went through a cycle of infection

and prolonged recovery. our condolences

to the near and dear of those who lost

their battle with the virus.

As you may recall from our letter of

the earlier year, we had filed our draft

Red Herring prospectus for a possible

Initial Public Offering (IPO) in June

of 2020. All work on the document,

financial statement and many other

activities associated with the Ipo and

taking the Company public were done

by Happiest Minds and our partners,

working remotely across many locations.

The filing was followed by multiple

Investor

presentations,

roadshows,

with the issue finally opening for

subscription on September 7 and closing

on September 9.

Your

Company’s

issue

saw

an

overwhelming

response

from

Institutional,

High

net-worth

and

Retail investors and the issue was

oversubscribed 151 times. equity shares

of Happiest Minds listed on the BSe

and nSe on September 17 and opening

at a high of ` 351 per share versus an

issue price of ` 166. Reportedly, your

Company’s Ipo was one the best in the

decade and seen by many as that which

opened the floodgates to many others

waiting hesitantly to venture into the

public market, given the pandemic

situation. Your Company’s successful

Ipo was a culmination of our vision

of establishing a successful business,

with Happiest people and Happiest

Customers,

with

highest

levels

of

corporate governance, in line with our

strong value systems while returning

good

returns

to

our

stakeholders.

We now look forward to the decade

ahead of us with new goals and

challenges which will be articulated in our

Vision 2021-2031.

A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 2 0 - 2 1

letter,

demand - both pent up and new - are at

new highs. the challenges are around

hiring and retaining our talent.

We are seeing increased demand for

delivering

solutions

around

Cloud

Infrastructure,

real-time

Business

Intelligence using Analytics, Iot, AI /

Ml, Automation, Remote Collaboration,

eCommerce, Security Services, Robotics,

Blockchain, Customer / user experience,

Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality

(VR)

across

our

chosen

verticals.

Just as much as the idea of ‘offshoring’

needs no further selling, enterprises

now do not need convincing on the

need to adopt and adapt to digital and

agile technologies to stay relevant in a

competitive environment.

We believe enterprises in a post pandemic

world will align themselves along three

technology themes:

1. people Centricity – people will be at the

center of all businesses which involves

capturing

human

behavior

(aka

Internet of Behavior) globally through

technologies like Iot & wearable

devices to garner sophisticated data

and make informed decisions. this will

entail a shift from multi-experience to

a total experience strategy that links

people and customers in a connected

ecosystem. Connected experience will

be crafted by context, data, design,

innovation, technology, and behavior.

Your Company’s issue

saw an overwhelming

response from

Institutional, High

net-worth and

Retail investors

and the issue was

oversubscribed 151 times.

2. Location

independence

–

the

pandemic may have shut international

borders

and

hampered

physical

movement of people. However, the

technology ecosystem pivoted itself to

a location independence model which

blurred the computing boundaries

for

teams,

customers,

suppliers,

and

organizational

ecosystems.

location

Independence

will

be

achieved through:

• distributed Cloud infrastructure –

Single Cloud providers are making

their

cloud

services

available

at

different

physical

locations

while

managing

operations,

governance, updates, and evolution

by themselves. this has enabled

computer storage, networking, and

processing closer to the end user

resulting in network scalability, low

latency, and compliance with local

data regulations.

• anywhere

operations

–

the

pandemic

caused

accelerated

adoption

of

many

technology

innovations such as Hybrid Cloud,

eDGe Computing, and Automated

Digital operations. the Anywhere

operations

lays

down

the

infrastructure to support teams and

customers everywhere.

• Cybersecurity Mesh – the shift to

a distributed cloud and anywhere

operations is making a strong case

for ring fencing security around data

privacy and safety. this is enforced

through a cybersecurity mesh which

shifts the security requirements

from a single security parameter to

multiple nodes of computing.

3. resilient

delivery

–

enterprises

having seen and experienced an

unprecedented

event

like

the

CoVID-19

pandemic

are

now

recalibrating

themselves

to

exist

and prosper in a world of continued

uncertainty.

this

shift

requires

businesses

to

build

resilient

infrastructure with the use of:

• intelligent Composable Business

Model – this is a composable

enterprise application (architecture)

building strategy to define the

organization’s packaged business

capability (PBCs) which necessitates

developing

business

applications

that are modular, composable, easily

adapted and ready for change.

• ai engineering – the use of

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is only

set to increase to find solutions

for

business

problems

across

any industry. the advent of novel

software development life cycles like

– Dataops, Modelops, and Devops

has helped deploy AI at scale to

modular

and

complex

business

problems alike. the new world will

see AI adoption with much more

focus on trust, transparency, ethics,
