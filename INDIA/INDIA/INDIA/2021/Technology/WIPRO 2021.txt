Message from the Chairman

Technology is often at the forefront of economic

recovery, but especially so now, as the pandemic

precipitated structural changes across industries and

challenged established ways of working. So, whether it

is digital commerce, online education, or telemedicine,

technology-enabled business models have emerged

across the board, with Cloud technology as the

cornerstone of this transformation.

As vaccination efforts ramp up globally, and

economies start seeing a rebound, our customers are

ever so keen to invest in and accelerate their digital

transformation. For companies such as ours, the key

to success is to respond to this opportunity with speed

and agility.

With the rapid shift to digital, the demand for talent

will outpace supply, and become a key dependency

for growth. Already we see new delivery models, such

as ‘work from anywhere’ and ‘Crowdsourcing’, become

the mainstay. We expect virtual, remote, community-

based, and distributed work models to be the future

of work.

Building a Bold Tomorrow

for Wipro

I believe Wipro is well-positioned to leverage, as well

as enable such transformations. In the last six months,

we have effected bold changes to help serve our

customers better.

Early last year, we set out to make the first bold

change, embracing the direction set by our new CEO

&: Managing Director, Thierry Delaporte. The Board

and I cannot be more confident of Thierry, and his

leadership. As a result, I feel more optimistic about our

future than ever before.

The difficult but necessary changes we have made,

has made us a stronger and better organization.

Proximity to customers is key, as is reflected in our

new business model.

Deep and prioritized focus on countries, industry

sectors, offerings, and partnership, along with an

operating structure that makes us agile and nimble

in a post-crisis world, that will be all about impact at

speed. Overall, I see a much stronger external market

orientation at Wipro. Several new leaders have joined

us to take forward this transformation.

The acquisition of CAPCO, a leading strategy and

consulting firm in the Banking and Financial Services

Industry, was our largest ever and another bold move

for us. With a purchase consideration of $1.45 billion,

CAPCO brings to us over $700 million in annual

revenues and over 5,000 consultant colleagues

around the world. With this acquisition, we are now

in a select league of service providers, who provide

integrated end-to-end consulting, digital, cloud and IT

transformation services for the BFSI sector at scale. It

also expands our presence into a large set of strategic

clients uniquely complementary to our existing

customer base. Most importantly, CAPCO and Wipro

share similar culture and values.

Building a Bold Tomorrow

for our employees

As I write this letter, India, where over 160,000 of our

employees are based, is emerging out of a ravaging

second wave of COVID-19. The last couple of months

have been incredibly hard, mentally and emotionally, on

us all. In this time of deep stress and grief, we are doing

everything we can to help our employees. These include

providing COVID-19 Isolation Care centers for our staff

and their families, partnering with major hospitals

to provide medical support to critically ill employees,

additional medical reimbursement and leaves related

to COVID-19, as well as vaccination at our campuses.

We have also partnered with leading global EAP

providers to help employees seek counselling 24x7.

Earlier last year, when the pandemic broke out, we

triggered our business continuity plans to quickly

enable remote working. Even today, less than 3% of

our global workforce work from our offices. We have

settled well into this new way of working and have

continued to make our customers successful. We

enjoy their confidence, and I have no doubt that a

hybrid model may well be how we work in the future.

But for the inspirational, inclusive and seamless

teamwork, this massive change wouldn’t have been

possible. We must take a moment to recognize and

celebrate the tremendous commitment and

ownership our teams have demonstrated.

Dear Stakeholders,

This has been an unimaginable year. And despite

all the pain and suffering, the unbreakable human

spirit shines through – in the large and small acts of

kindness, empathy and compassion.

In many ways, humanity has come together to fight

this global pandemic. Global cooperation has never

been more important than it is now. The vaccines

for COVID-19 are one of the greatest examples of

collaboration and pioneering science. We must now

work to scale the supply chain, build mechanisms

for equitable distribution and drive an efficient

administration for these life-saving vaccines.

We complete 75 years since

incorporation! This fabulous

journey would not have been

possible but for the tireless efforts

of our employees, their dedication

and inventiveness. They embody

the true spirit of Wipro!

Rishad A Premji,

Dear Stakeholders,

It has been my privilege and honor to lead Wipro

for the past year, an exceptional company that is

both an industry pioneer, and a force for good in the

communities which we serve.

The financial year that ended March 31, 2021 capped

a landmark 12 months for Wipro, a period of total

transformation. We announced a new strategy,

completed the biggest organizational restructuring

in our history, delivered strong performances for

consecutive quarters, and sealed our largest-ever

acquisition, all in the middle of a global pandemic.

We finished FY21 with healthy revenue growth,

prestigious deal wins, strong margins and robust cash

flows.

Change takes time, but I am pleased to share that we

are now well-settled into these new ways of working

and remain resolutely focused on fulfilling our

customers’ needs.

Technology is at the core of

business transformation, but

talent remains the driving

force. In the new world of work,

Wipro’s commitment is to our

clients’ success, and to that of

our employees, and the larger

community.

Thierry Delaporte, CEO

letter and spirit of being a

responsible corporate citizen.

Our vision of ‘value through values’ drives our goals of (i)

making Wipro a more sustainable business in its operations

and value chain as defined broadly by the triple bottom-line

and ESG frameworks (Environment, Social and Governance)

and (ii) contributing to a more just, inclusive and sustainable

society.

i. As a first principle, we constantly strengthen the

alignment of our core business purpose with salient

ESG goals in the areas of Energy, Climate Change,

Water, Diversity and Inclusion at the workplace and

Health and Well-Being of employees. All of this is based

on the bedrock foundation of good governance and

ethical conduct. During the year, we made a significant

commitment to transforming to a Net Zero Company

by 2040. Our targets of net zero greenhouse gas

emissions are based on the globally accepted Science

Based Targets Initiative. Our approach prioritizes deep

decarbonization of our own operations and value chain

while deferring offsets till 2040. This is in line with our

core values and we believe we are well positioned to

meet our commitments.

ii. In the larger social sphere, our primary areas of work

are in Education, Urban Ecology, Primary Health Care,

Disaster Response and Public Spaces in cities. A

common strand running across our social initiatives

is a deliberative focus on inclusion and empowerment

of disadvantaged communities. Our emphasis is on

deep, meaningful, long-term work implemented by our

carefully identified network of nearly 200 partners in

India and all the major overseas geographies we are

present in US, Europe, LATAM and APAC.

The year 2020 threw up the biggest challenge humanity

has faced for a long time, the Covid-19 pandemic. From the

very beginning, it was clear to us that our response had to

be commensurate with the severity and scale of the crisis.

Together with Azim Premji Foundation and Wipro Enterprises

Private Limited, we committed ` 11,250 Mn of which our

contribution was ` 1,000 Mn. For more than 12 months now,

we have been engaged deeply in crafting and executing an

integrated response that addresses the deeply intertwined

humanitarian and healthcare aspects of the problem. We

recognize that the pandemic and its after-effects is going

to be with us for some time. Keeping this in mind, we have

ensured that a significant part of our support is towards

strengthening and augmenting the capacity of the public

health system in India, especially in some of the most

underserved areas. Of the several initiatives we supported,

there were two outstanding projects that represent our ability

to respond with agility and innovatively: (a) the first involved

leveraging the canteen infrastructure in our Bengaluru, Pune

and Kolkata facilities to deliver nearly 3 Mn cooked meals

to vulnerable communities in distress and (b) the second

project conceptualised and executed the converting of our

Pune campus to a full-fledged 450 bed Covid hospital that

has seen nearly 5,500 patients treated till now.

We would like to highlight the fact that our Covid response and

investments were in addition to the regular CSR work, which

we continued to support to the fullest extent. Our partners

adopted a hybrid model of online and field work over the

course of the year adapting dynamically to the situation on

the ground. For example, our healthcare partners combined

primary healthcare with essential frontline Covid work.

You will find a comprehensive articulation of our work in

the Annual Report, which is based on the International

Integrated Reporting framework of how value is created on

both, financial and non-financial capitals and how they feed

and reinforce each other.
