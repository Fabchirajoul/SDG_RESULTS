Dear Shareholders,

Fiscal 2020-21 has been a strong one

for Firstsource. We achieved historic

levels of revenue and profitability

while responding to the market and

operational challenges posed by

Covid. Despite the unprecedented

challenges, we rapidly transitioned to

a distributed work model to facilitate

business continuity for our clients –

while prioritizing the wellbeing of our

colleagues and their families. I would

like to express my deep appreciation

to our leadership team and associates

across the world who have worked

tirelessly over the past year to

maintain our market leading position.

FIRSTSOURCE SOLUTIONS LIMITED

GROWING WITH

PURPOSE

002:

Managing Director & CEO: Dear Shareholders,

Fiscal 2020-21 has been a

year unlike any other, both

in terms of the monumental

challenges we confronted

and the extraordinary

results we delivered. As

much of the world reeled

under the impact of the

health crisis, we stayed

true to our purpose of

taking care of our people

and empowering them

to deliver excellence. I’m

extremely proud of how

our team of over 28,000

Firstsourcers around the

globe remained empathetic

and agile, looking out

for their colleagues and

supporting our clients on

mission critical work.

While the first Covid wave

forced us to drive agility

and innovation to ensure

business continuity for our

clients, the second wave in

India demanded humane

solutions. We mobilized a

host of support services for

our employees and their

families. These include

critical medical equipment

and supplies, remote doctor

consultations, isolation

facilities, and dedicated

support desk for triaging

requests – in addition to

financial assistance. We also stepped

up our partnerships with NGOs,

volunteering our time, financial support

and expertise to provide Covid relief.

Amidst all this chaos, our world-

class talent and a maturing Digital

First, Digital Now strategy helped us

deliver the best results in our history.

Our revenues totaled Rs.5078 crore

during the fiscal year – up 23.9% Y-O-Y

– with our operating margins coming

in strong at 11.8%. I’m grateful to all

our associates around the world who

helped sustain the accelerated growth.

Unifying people and

technology with purpose

Becoming a ‘purpose-led’ company

at every level is key to staying on this

accelerated growth path. We believe

that an inside-out approach – one

that puts our employees at the heart

of everything – is the most effective

way to achieve this. To this end, we

are connecting our people to their

role’s purpose, upskilling and reskilling

them in new-age digital technologies.

We are attracting top talent – we

welcomed over 6,000 new associates

to our Firstsource family, onboarding

and upskilling them remotely. We have

intensified our focus on physical, mental

and financial wellbeing – both at work

and home – especially in light of the

health crisis. Inclusion and Diversity

and Impact Sourcing form the building

blocks of our people-first approach.

Winning the digital game

Our ‘Digital First, Digital Now’ strategy

permeates everything – from our

internal processes to how we develop

solutions and service our clients.
