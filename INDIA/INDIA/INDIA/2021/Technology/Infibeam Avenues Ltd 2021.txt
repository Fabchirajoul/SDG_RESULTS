Letter: Dear Shareholders,

I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy and

vaccinated. The world entered the second year of the

global Covid-19 pandemic, with millions more impacted by

the known and unknown dangers the virus has presented.

While India got off a little easy during the first wave of the

coronavirus, even as Europe and the US suffered high

death rates during that time, we got hit brutally during the

second wave. While there are several debates and opinions

about the hows and whys of it, we must acknowledge

and accept that the virus, and a pandemic, both are

almost unknown to the larger populace that is currently

living through these unprecedented times. We also must

acknowledge the efforts underway by humanity as a whole

- the scientific community, the healthcare workers, the

good Samaritans and the common man – each playing

their part, contributing their best to alleviate the emotional,

social, health and economic impact of the virus.

Infibeam, which began as a platforms company in 2010

and became a digital payments and platforms focused

company in 2017, has consistently delivered value to the

shareholders, investors, and society at large. With our

platform being adopted by the Government of India for

its e-marketplace, to our growing presence across the

spectrum in the digital payments space, we have put all our

energies and forces into bringing the best products and

services to our merchant customers. Digital adoption is not

a choice anymore, and we want to be the digital payments

and ecommerce platform provider of choice for merchants,

enterprises, financial institutions, and governments around

the globe.

Covid-19 – challenges, impact and action

The Covid-19 pandemic brought challenges to the entire

globe, and impacted individuals, enterprises and the

economies. Some industries were more affected than

others – travel, tourism, transportation and hospitality were

harder hit, while technology companies, grocery retail,

delivery companies, healthcare and pharma companies did

well. In India, the festive season rang in good tidings for

the retail sector, and the manufacturing PMI Index went up

to 54.1 in October 2020 after being down for 6 months.

Overall, power, rail, auto sales, GST collections and digital

transactions started doing well around this time.

Government initiatives of Atmanirbhar Bharat, financial

assistance to the MSME sector and infrastructure spend

commitments gave a further boost to the economy. While

the beginning of January 2021 started on a positive note

with approved vaccinations underway in production,

India got impacted by the second wave of the Covid-19,

stronger and more hard hitting than the first wave. Even

as healthcare systems tried to gear up to tackle the

severity of cases, the central and state governments,

NGOs and volunteers, all worked towards doing their

best to help the people during the crisis. By June 2021,

things have started easing up. The country has now

successfully administered more than 25 million doses of

vaccines, and daily average new Covid positive cases are

under 100,000, after having peaked at over 400,000 in

early April 2021.

Global Fintech story

Digital payments, remote consumption of services, online

shopping and online banking got a huge acceleration due

to the pandemic, which necessitated social distancing and

staying indoors. In short, the payments and remittances

market started growing fast, with several merchants,

vendors and providers of goods and services trying to

digitize their offerings and processes to retain market

share, survive the pandemic and sustain beyond it.

While financial and economic indicators were negative

the world over, the startup segment saw a lot more

innovation, investment and excitement. The global fintech

industry saw about $56.1billion infused during 2020-21

(April to March), compared to $84.billion in 2019 and

$77.8billion in 2018.

Opportunities landscape

India, with its 1.4 billion population, jumped on the

digital bandwagon and is steadily racing ahead. Most

Indian families now have access to at least one mobile,

India, with its 1.4 billion population, jumped on the

digital bandwagon and is steadily racing ahead. Most

Indian families now have access to at least one mobile,

and thus, the telecom and internet revolution paved

the way for other technological revolutions such as

fintech, e-commerce, digital banking, e-governance

and more.

Infibeam Avenues Limited

Managing Director

I sincerely hope that all of you, along with your families, are

safe and well. In times of distress that the current pandemic

has caused, we are extremely grateful to every single

person, enterprise and institution that is helping alleviate

our nation, and the world, from the problems caused by

the pandemic. We, at Infibeam Avenues Limited, have tided

through the pandemic, even grown our operations, and are

ever thankful to our customers, stakeholders, employees

and all the people whose lives we touch, and who touch our

lives.

The year gone by: delivering sustainable returns

We had a great FY 2020-21, during which we grew in

higher double-digit percentages in terms of processing

volume and increased the value of transactions processed

from ` 85,251 crore ($12bn) in FY 2019-20 to ` 139,405

crore ($19bn) in FY 2020-21. We saw a great build up in

the momentum for flat fee-based transactions, which got

a big boost during both waves of Covid, compensating for

the drop in percentage-based revenues from impacted

segments such as airlines, travel & tourism, hospitality,

entertainment and discretionary spends largely related to

e-retail. Overall, our gross revenues went up to

` 676 crore, a 7% growth YoY. Our Q4 contributed to

end the year strongly. We achieved major milestones

in our Q4 FY 2020-21 KPIs – TPV worth nearly ` 17,000

crore ($2.3bn) per month (up 93% YoY), over 0.5 million

transactions processed daily (up 20% YoY), and an

increase in GeM revenues in Q4 FY 2020-21 by 78% YoY.

Based on Q4 FY 2020-21 TPV run-rate we will achieve

a TPV of $28 billion in FY 2021-22 and are targeting to

achieve an overall TPV of $100 billion in the next four-

five years as we expand our transaction processing

businesses under Payments and Platforms.

TPV in Payments business increased 55% YoY to

approximately ` 100,780 crores in FY 2020-21. For a like-to-

like comparison, we included the TPV of our subsidiary Go

Payments in FY 2019-20 while calculating growth, without

which the growth is higher at 64%. We consolidated Go

Payments financials from May 2021. Monthly payment

processing in Q4 averaged about ` 10,000 crore, from

` 5,300 crore in the same period last year. Thus, we are at

an annual run rate of processing ` 1.2 lakh crore to ` 1.3

lakh crore, or about $18 billion in payments in FY 2022. This

is coming from two major geographical markets - India

and UAE. Soon, we’ll also see international markets like the

Saudi and a few of the GCC countries and USA adding to

this growth. We will add more international markets in the

next few years.

Merchant registrations continue to be robust, and our

alliance partnerships continue to deepen, opening up

more business for us. Our retail contribution continues

to dominate in terms of number of merchants on the PG

platforms. Education, utility, grocery, IT are among the

larger contributors in FY 2020-21. Basically, merchant

registrations in FY 2020-21 has been the best we have seen

in our history, at nearly 300 registration on an average

We grew in higher

double-digit

percentages in terms

of processing volume

and increased the

value of transactions

processed from

` 85,251 crore ($12bn)

in FY 2019-20 to

` 139,405 crore ($19bn)

in FY 2020-21

The Company has fixed Thursday, September 16, 2021

dividend for the financial year ended March 31, 2021,

if approved at the AGM. For members who have not

that dividends paid or distributed by a company after

April 1, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of members.

The Company shall therefore be required to deduct tax

at source (“TDS”) at the time of making the payment

of final dividend. In order to enable us to determine

the appropriate TDS rate as applicable, members are

10% or as notified by the

Government of India

Members not having PAN /

20% or as notified by the

Government of India

However, no tax shall be deducted on the dividend

payable to a resident individual if the total dividend

to be received by them during fiscal year 2022 does

not exceed ₹ 5,000 and also in cases where members

provide Form 15G / Form 15H (Form 15H is applicable

to individuals aged 60 years or more) subject to

conditions specified in the IT Act. Resident shareholders

may also submit any other document as prescribed

under the IT Act to claim a lower / nil withholding tax.

PAN is mandatory for members providing Form 15G /

15H or any other document as mentioned above.

For non-resident shareholders, taxes are required

to be withheld in accordance with the provisions of

Section 195 and other applicable sections of the IT Act,

at the rates in force. The withholding tax shall be at the

rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) or as
