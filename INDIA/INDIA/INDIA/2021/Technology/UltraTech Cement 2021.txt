Dear Shareholders,

The COVID-19 pandemic

has touched every aspect of

our lives across the world.

It has altered mindsets,

perceptions, and strategies

for businesses and beyond.

If there is one abiding

lesson, it is that sustainable

growth and development

involves holistic nurturing of

human, natural, and financial

capital. 2020 is a year that

will only gain in significance

when viewed through the

perspective lens of time.

The Global Economy

The world has been fighting the COVID-19

pandemic for more than a year now, and the

struggle has had deleterious economic effects.

In 2020, the global economy contracted by 3.3%,

the largest contraction on record, at least since

World War II. Much of it was concentrated in the

first half of FY21, as several countries enforced

strict lockdowns. Economies bounced back –

albeit at differentiated speeds – in subsequent

quarters, on the back of large fiscal stimulus

packages, especially in the developed countries,

restocking demand after dilution of lockdowns,

and improved confidence levels following the

start of vaccination programmes. As per the

recent forecasts from the International Monetary

Fund (IMF), the US and China are expected to

record a strong recovery in 2021, resulting in a

net positive expansion of their economies over

the 2019 levels. These two engines of growth

are expected to boost demand for exports

from other countries. Even the other two large

economies, the EU and Japan, are expected

to expand.

Mr. Aditya Vikram Birla

We live by his values.

Integrity, Commitment, Passion,

Seamlessness and Speed.

Dear Shareholders,

Your Directors present the 21st Annual Report together with

the audited accounts of your Company for the year ended

31st March, 2021.

OVERVIEW AND THE STATE OF YOUR

COMPANY’S AFFAIRS

The year 2020 saw mayhem around the world as COVID-19

threatened all that humanity had come to take for granted –

mobility, safety and a normal life itself. This, in turn, posed the

most formidable economic challenge to India and to the world.

Bereft of a cure or a vaccine, the public health system in every

country faced enormous pressure trying to tackle this all-

pervasive crisis. The imperative of flattening the disease curve

was entwined with the threat of an imminent recession and job

losses, given the restrictions on economic activities enforced

by the lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. In other

words, all containment measures had to consider a trade-off

between lives and livelihood.

Despite the severe economic contraction of ~3.3% in 2020,

the International Monetary Fund now projects global growth at

6% in 2021, which would moderate to 4.4% in 2022. This is the

result of the additional fiscal support provided by governments

in a few large economies, the anticipated vaccine-powered

recovery in the second half of 2021, and the continued adaption

of economic activity to restricted mobility. However, there is

uncertainty around this outlook, and much will depend on the

path of the pandemic, the effectiveness of policy support in

shoring up the vaccine-powered normalisation, and how the

financial conditions of countries eventually shape up.

The Indian economy witnessed a contraction in H1FY21,

followed by a subdued but positive growth in the second half.

Higher capital expenditure of the government budgeted for

FY22, expectation of a third consecutive normal monsoon and

continued normalisation of economic activities following the

progress of vaccination augur well for the Indian economy.

However, recovery will not be easy, given that the scars of

the pandemic run deep and there are uncertainties around

the massive second wave of COVID-19 infections, which has

registered a sharper spike than the first wave.

The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has taken several steps

to maintain easy liquidity conditions and low interest rates,

despite higher government borrowings. Such support is

expected to continue until the growth recovery becomes more

durable. The Government of India has announced measures

such as Production-linked Incentive (“PLI”) Scheme and

monetisation of assets to fund infrastructure development.

These, along with the improving cyclical impulses, are helping

improve business confidence and may stoke a revival of project

investment activity in due course.

The cement industry witnessed de-growth of 10-12% due to

the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in H2FY21 the industry

began to show signs of early recovery. Lockdown-led demand

disruption was the highest in Q1FY21 on account of suspension

of production, stalled construction activities and mass exodus

of labour. The total lockdown period from late March to

end-April 2020, was a huge challenge for all manufacturing

industries. But with the central and state governments taking

measured steps towards the opening up of the economy, some

encouraging trends were seen from the latter part of May 2020,

driven largely by a better-than-expected pick-up in cement

consumption in the rural markets. Amidst the pandemic,

cement consumption witnessed strong growth in the rural,

semi-urban and retail markets. In rural India, better labour

availability, increase in construction of rural infrastructure and

low-cost housing drove cement demand. Demand is also

getting influenced by the resumption of construction work

related to institutional infrastructure projects such as road and

metro rail networks.

Amidst the pandemic, cement consumption

witnessed strong growth in the rural, semi-

urban and retail markets. In rural India, better

labour availability, increase in construction

of rural infrastructure and low-cost housing

drove the cement demand.

Cement demand is closely linked to the housing and

infrastructure sector. The industry has been on a volume

growth path, motivated by the government’s ‘Housing for

All by 2022’ mission and large infrastructure projects in the

pipeline. Government spending on infrastructure projects and

affordable housing schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas

Yojana (“PMAY”) with enhanced budgetary allocations will be

the primary drivers of growth for the cement industry. Going

forward, prospects for the industry in FY22 look bright.

Your Company managed the crisis with a sharp focus on

operational efficiencies. In the face of the pandemic, your

Company’s operations across locations were stopped in

line with the government directives. It was in continuous

engagement with all stakeholders through various digital

platforms. Critical Response Teams were set up across the

organisation to plan scenarios and respond to the rapidly

changing situation. With the easing of the lockdown, operations

gradually stabilised. Your Company recovered the carrying

amount of all its inventories, receivables and loans in the

ordinary course of business. It was able to service all its debt

obligations as per schedule, with its capital and financial

resources remaining entirely protected and its liquidity position

adequately covered. As part of its commitment to society,

your Company undertook various initiatives during the year to

support the country in its fight against the pandemic.

Uses of Cash

Net Capital Expenditure

Your Company spent ` 1,726 crores on various capex during

the year, primarily towards:

• WHRS at various locations

• Cuttack Grinding Unit

• Patliputra Grinding Unit

• Dankuni Grinding Unit

Directors’ Report and Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.)

• Pali Integrated Unit

• Bicharpur Coal Block

• Other normal capex schemes for efficiency improvement

and compliance with the changing regulatory framework

• Plant modernisation and maintenance

Increase in Investments

Your Company’s higher operating cash flows, resulted in an

increase in liquid investment during the year.

Repayment of Borrowing

In line with its endeavour to maintain optimal capital structure,

your Company repaid high-cost, long-term debt amounting to

` 5,227 crores and also repaid short-term loans as per due dates.

The loan repayments have been done through free cash flows

that your Company has generated over the last few quarters,

despite the challenging circumstances and severe business

interruptions during the first quarter of the current fiscal year.

The aforesaid steps have resulted in improved Net Debt Equity

ratio and Net Debt/EBITDA ratio.

Transfer to General Reserves

Your Company proposes to transfer an amount of ` 4,500

crores to the General Reserves.

DIVIDEND

Prudent working capital management and control on cash

flows, resulted in your Company’s strong performance, even

during trying times. Aided by deft financial management, your

Company was able to successfully reduce Consolidated Net

Debt/EBITDA ratio to 0.55x from 1.72x as on 31st March, 2020.

With adequate cash flows and the confidence of sustaining its

performance going forward, your Directors have recommended

a dividend of ` 37 per equity share (as compared to ` 13 per

equity share in the previous year) of ` 10 each for the year

ended 31st March, 2021. Except for unforeseen circumstances

or the need to retain cash for its operations, your Company will

endeavour to maintain this trend in future years as well.

The recommended dividend is in line with your Company’s

dividend policy, which is given in Annexure I of this Report and

is also available on your Company’s website.

In terms of the provisions of the Finance Act, 2020, dividend

shall be taxed in the hands of shareholders at applicable

rates of tax and your Company shall withhold tax at source

appropriately.

Unclaimed dividend for the year ended 31st March, 2013,

aggregating to ` 1.30 crores has been transferred to the

Investor Education and Protection Fund (“IEPF”). Your

Company has also credited to the IEPF set up by the

Government of India, equity shares in respect of which

dividend had remained unpaid/unclaimed for a period of seven

consecutive years within the timelines laid down by the Ministry

As per simplified approach, the Company makes provision of expected credit losses on trade receivables using a

provision matrix to mitigate the risk of default payments and makes appropriate provision at each reporting date

wherever outstanding is for longer period and involves higher risk.

As per policy receivables are classified into different buckets based on the overdue period ranging from 6 months –

one year to more than two years. There are different provisioning norms for each bucket which are ranging from 25%

to 100%.

III)

Liquidity risk management:

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at

reasonable price. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities

and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due. The

Group’s treasury team is responsible for liquidity, funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes

and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Group’s liquidity

position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.

The table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities and investments

held for managing the risk at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted payments.
