Dear Shareholders,

The past financial year has been a year of

caution, introspection, transformation, and hope

for all of us. The year was an unprecedented

one that provided long-lasting learnings and

taught new ways of existence. During COVID-19,

organizations globally geared up to adapt

to the new normal. Digital workplaces and

working-from-anywhere became a necessity for

enterprises across industries, which are now

expediting their digital transformation journeys.

Newgen, with its scalable and reliable

digital transformation platforms, resilient

business model, and agile development and

implementation approach, is ideally positioned

to enable enterprises and make a positive impact

in today’s environment.

Ensuring Employee Well-Being

Throughout the year, ensuring safety and well-being of our

employees and their families has been the topmost priority

for us. Newgen is providing all the necessary assistance

and guidance to our employees. Our COVID-19 volunteer

teams have done exemplary work in supporting each

and every member of the Newgen family in these tough

times. I appreciate and salute their spirit. Further, we are

collaborating with hospitals and other agencies to quickly

vaccinate our employees and their family members across

multiple locations.

We continue to have our employees work from the safety

of their homes. We are also designing our organisation to

become more resilient and agile. We are also working on

building an efficient hybrid workplace that will foster increased

productivity and yet provide a better work-life balance for the

employees. We are transforming our complete work culture

to a more result-oriented one and our services and human

resource function to become touchless but more responsive

to Newgenites needs.

Empowering Customers

Our major focus has been on ensuring uninterrupted

and quality services for our customers and we have a

comprehensive and reliable programme in place for this.

It includes synchronized cloud-based continuity strategy,

product-based implementation framework and development

of support zones with direct presence in multiple countries.

During the pandemic, our cloud-based products ensured

uninterrupted services for close to 550 active customers

across 72 countries, helping them transform many of their

complex and mission-critical business processes. We not only

supported our customers remotely but also developed new

solutions to fulfil their fresh and time-sensitive requirements.

We have received encouraging appreciation from our

customers for our continued support and engagement.

Demonstrating Steady Performance

We witnessed a resilient performance during the fiscal year

2020-21, clocking in revenues of ` 673 crores. We continued

to witness business momentum with expanded customer

engagements and an addition of 67 new logos under our

umbrella. We are happy to share that the US is now our largest

revenue contributor and one of the fastest expanding markets

for us, growing at 16% YoY.

During the year, the Company has also adopted a strategic

approach to cost management and cash flow optimization.

We reported an EBITDA of ` 192 crores and a Profit after Tax of

` 127 crores. We are optimizing our execution capabilities, while

continuing with long-term investments in R&D and sales.

Transition to Subscription Model

Our subscription revenues witnessed a growth of 19% during

the year. Our overall annuity revenues remained consistent,

contributing 57% to the revenues.

We continue on our path to transition from our existing model

of new license revenues and Annual Technical Services to
