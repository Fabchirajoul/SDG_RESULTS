MANAGING DIRECTOR

Therefore, having a proper demo is crucial,

and even before the pandemic we barely had

two demos a month. Simply speaking, the

demos improve our chance of sales. But with

the advent of COVID-19 our customer visits

were reduced to none and we had to do some

introspection, and it is then that we had an

epiphany. We thought to ourselves, how can

we take our demos to the customers if they

are unable to visit the demo centre? With this

larger question in mind, we finally embarked

on a journey to create a world-class remote

demonstration facility. This was an extremely

successful initiative as it had its intended effect

– the number of potential customers going

through the product demo shot from twice in

a month to an average of four times in a week.

These demos were given to both our national

and international customers. At Zen, we expect

such innovations to result in huge increase in

orders in the near future.

During the crisis, we also expanded our range

of products to include drone and anti-drone

solutions. We believe that in the anti-drone

space we enjoy a privileged position and are

in the top of the list of companies providing

such solutions. Our solutions were developed

completely in-house and are used for

identifying and jamming drones in all bands (not

restricted to 2.8Ghz or 5.6-5.8Ghz, which most

of our competitors solutions are restricted to).

We have integrated a camera to this solution

as well and are just a few months away from

developing our own radar solution. Currently,

we offer off-the-shelf radars along with our

system. Finally, in the space of hard kill, we are

partnering with companies that have hard kill

equipment like laser, micro-missiles, guns, etc.

At the moment we have an integrated solution

but just in a few months we should be in a

position to offer a range of hard-kill options

tailor made to customer requirements.

Another product that we have developed

during the crisis is the logistic drone, which is

capable of taking 20kgs of weight over 10kms

distance in high altitude areas. This product has

a tremendous demand within the armed forces.

In addition to the armed forces, we expect lots

of non-military applications for this product

as well. Other areas that we are focusing on

include anti-drone and drone simulators, and

integrated air defence combat simulators.

Our Company is unique and one of a kind in the

defence industry. The number of players in this

space is very limited, and our experience of three

decades puts us at the leading position within

this industry in India. Moreover, with respect

to some of our products, Zen Technologies

enjoys a very deep and meaningful position

with the customers. This puts our Company on

a great footing to remain the industry leader in

the future. In addition, our years of experience

inspire further confidence and trust from our

customers, thus making our Company stronger.

At Zen Technologies, our consistent research

efforts have resulted in the creation of diverse

technological solutions and a corresponding

patent portfolio. To date, our Company has filed

about 109 patents for the pioneering initiatives

undertaken by us. Since our business is IP-driven

and our bill of materials costs usually between

10-30% of the final price, our contribution post

break-even point is significant. We are also a

highly asset-light business entity as we outsource

most of our manufacturing to a reliable supply

chain which we have developed over the last

three decades. Further, our high investments in

R&D throughout our Company’s lifetime create a

high entry barrier for any new entrant, making it a

competitive advantage for us.

Our Company has always been at the helm

of innovation and has always paved the way

for advanced research in training solutions for

military forces. We saw a huge opportunity in

the anti-drone technologies and are proud to

share that we have invested heavily in these new

technologies as we strongly believe that this is

the future of warfare.

formulated policies that promote and support

self-reliance, simplify procedures and

provide serious impetus to defence export.

200 defence

items under

import embargo

MoD is encouraging innovation and any

innovation by the industry can now be shared

proposals will be holistically analysed by MoD

products will be initiated by the Government.

equipment and is supporting export through

suitable strategy for the same, simpler
