Managing Director

Message from

the Chairman

Dear valued Shareowners,

I am delighted to share with you our 31st Annual

Report for the Financial Year 2020-21. This

year was extremely challenging and let me

start with a prayer for all those we lost during

the pandemic, with gratitude for all the Corona

Warriors who served the sick and needy, and

with hope and best wishes for times ahead.

The year began with uncertainty, and the first

task was to secure the safety of all employees

and their families. Next, we fully enabled the

team to work from home. Our team adapted

very quickly to working remotely, and I am

proud to state that we did not miss a beat and

were able to meet our customers’ requirements

and ensure that all the deliverables were

met. This demonstrated resilience.

Next, we reached out to our customers,

suppliers, and vendors to assure them of our

support. We explored all the obvious and the

latent customer requirements and challenged

our team to See Beyond and Rise Above.

Relationships are strengthened by being

there in times of need. This was our time

to deliver, and that is exactly what we did!

The events of the year have challenged

the status quo and forced us to take

a fresh look at our assumptions. The

technology roadmap has accelerated,

and circumstances have forced us to

look at new ways of getting things done.

The world is ready to reinvent itself.

We believe that we are responsible to a

broader group of stakeholders that includes

our employees and their families, our

Year in Review

Persistent Foundation

Corporate Information:

letter,

we have been focused on ensuring the well-

being of our employees, their families, the

local communities we live in as well as strong

business continuity for our clients throughout

these difficult times. We are confident that

with time the pandemic will be behind us,

and brighter times lay ahead for all of us.

FY2021, for us, was a year of disciplined

execution and strengthening the muscles for

the next phase of growth, while leveraging

Persistent’s solid foundation built over the

past 30 years. We invested in bringing in new

senior talent across functions, deepening

our capabilities across industries and service

lines, enhancing our partner ecosystem and

embarking on disciplined client centricity.

As a result, we not only survived but thrived

through a year of virtual operations and

personal challenges. That is not to minimize

the personal challenges and loss many of

our team suffered but to recognize their

incredible strength in persevering in the

face of such hardships. Thank you.

We ended the year at US $566.1M, representing

an industry leading +12.9% growth year on

year in US$ terms and 17.4% in Indian Rupee

terms. We built on the transitional foundation

of FY2021, extending our reach into key

industry sectors of banking, financial services

and insurance; healthcare and life sciences;

software and hi-tech; and other emerging

industries like telco and media. Improved

operational rigor and optimization across

all businesses and enabling functions also

aided in delivering significant improvements

in EBIT, ending +55.2% year on year.

Segregation of assets (other than trade receivables and unbilled revenue), liabilities, depreciation and amortization and other

non-cash expenses into various reportable segments have not been presented as the assets are used interchangeably among

segments and the Group is of the view that it is not practical to reasonably allocate the other assets, liabilities and other non-

cash expenses to individual segments and an ad-hoc allocation will not be meaningful.
