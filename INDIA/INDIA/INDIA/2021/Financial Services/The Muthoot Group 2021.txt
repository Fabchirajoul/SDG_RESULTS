Managing Director of the Muthoot Group

in 1979. When he took over the Company, we had

presence only in four states with 31 branches. Under

his strategic leadership, the Muthoot Group grew

into a multidimensional business entity with 4,600+

branches and is now the undisputed market leader in

the gold loan industry. Muthoot Finance is present in

every nook and corner of the country, providing timely

and adequate credit to those who have no access to

formal channels of credit. His efforts catapulted Kerala

to the top of the NBFC chart in India. In recognition of

his contribution, he was conferred the Businessman of

the Decade Award by the World Malayalee Council in

2011, Golden Peacock Award for Business Leadership

in 2012 and Emerging Business Leader of the Year

Award at the 5th AIMA Management Award, 2014. He

was a member of the Executive Committee, Federation

of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI),

and Chairman of the FICCI Kerala State Council.

In 2019, Forbes Asia Magazine listed him as 44th richest

man in India and in 2020, the same magazine listed

him as the 26th richest Malayalee in India. For a man

defined by his humility and altruism, it was enough that

he was being able to contribute to the best of his ability

to society. He was not only a successful businessman,

but a committed philanthropist and community leader.

His initiatives in the field of education, healthcare, and

community welfare benefited millions of marginalised

people across various spheres of life. As a result of his

undeterred commitment, he was awarded the Mahatma

Gandhi National Award for social service in 2001 by the

Mahatma Gandhi National Foundation.

His untimely demise is an irreparable loss to everyone

who knew him, including his family, employees,

stakeholders, the people of Kerala and the entire nation.

He will live on in our memories as the ‘Man with a

Golden Heart’.

*An extract from an interview to The Hindustan Times in 2013:

Dear Stakeholders,

FY21 has been a tumultuous year and will

forever remain stamped in our memory. The

year started with widespread disruptions

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which

affected lives all over the world. The year

also saw the untimely death of our erstwhile

Chairman and my elder brother, Shri M.G.

George Muthoot. His unexpected demise on

March 5, 2021, is an irreparable loss for us,

for all those who knew him, the organisation

he so lovingly built up, and for the people of

this great nation whom he dutifully served

with his philanthropic work and through

a business which serves underserved

segments of the population. He has left

a void that will be difficult to fill, yet we

understand that we must carry on with his

mission. I am beyond humbled to have been

elected the Chairman of this prestigious

Group and will be fully committed to

uphold the values and benchmarks set by

my brother, both in the professional and

personal spheres.

Gold rush

The year was characterised by the

outbreak of the novel coronavirus across

the globe, which caused massive trade

disruptions, affecting economies across

“Over the years, we have

consolidated our presence as the

most respected and largest gold

loan company in the country in

terms of the loan portfolio and

other financial parameters.”

the world, including that of India.

The pandemic-induced lockdown across

the country resulted in manufacturing

activities coming to a halt, disruptions in

the supply chain and labour shortage as

migrant labour returned home. The Indian

economy de-grew for the first two

quarters before finally re-emerging in

the growth territory in the third quarter.

The proactive measures taken by the

Government of India, particularly its

boost to the Micro, Small and Medium-

sized Enterprises (MSME) sector, resulted

in the situation improving towards the

second half of the year. However, the

resurgence of infections led to disruptions

again towards the fag end of the year, as

localised lockdowns had to be imposed to

control the spread of the virus.

The frequent lock downs/restrictions to

control the pandemic has created stress

in the business sector, particularly among

MSMEs, given their limited ability to

manage liquidity beyond their trade cycle.

The demand for gold loans, both through

banks and NBFCs, saw a spike as a

result. For one, every household owns

some jewellery and using it as collateral

is a preferred option, especially when

unsecured loans, whether personal

or group loans, is difficult to come by.

The uncertainty of the pandemic increased

the hesitance of various financial

institutions to extend unsecured credit.

This led many to use gold loans to meet the

liquidity requirements. The rise in the price

of gold also increased the attraction of gold

loans. Access to organised and trustworthy

lenders such as Muthoot Finance made gold

loans a credible option as loan of upto 75%

of the value of the holding could be easily

availed by the borrower, who could either

approach any of our 4,600+ branches or

access our digital platform that granted

instant loans within five minutes. This

resulted in a 26% growth in our gross

loan assets.

Consistent performance

Over the years, we have consolidated our

presence as the most respected and largest

gold loan company in the country in terms

of the loan portfolio and other financial

parameters. During the year under review,

our consolidated gross loan assets under

management increased by ~24% to reach

I582,802 millions from I468,705 millions

in FY20. This was driven by growth in gold

loan assets under management by 27%

at I519,266 millions. Despite the gloomy

economic scenario, our consolidated
