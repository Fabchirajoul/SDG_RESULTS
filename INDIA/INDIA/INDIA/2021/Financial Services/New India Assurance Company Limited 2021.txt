Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to share with you the highlights

of your Company’s performance during the financial year 2020-

21. The Company continues to be the market leader with over

14% market share. As the Company enters into its 103rd year

of operations, I thank all the stakeholders who have supported

the company and reposed their faith on the company over

these years.

The COVID-19 pandemic

In the backdrop of an unprecedented crisis, the financial year

2020-21 has been a challenging one. We witnessed loss of

many lives and livelihoods. My prayers are with the people

who lost their lives battling the dreaded disease. Our Company

salutes the medical community and health workers for risking

their lives to save ours. We are doing our bit for the cause

by managing the Insurance Scheme for these healthcare

workers in the frontline under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan

Yojana. We have ensured that every claim under this policy

is settled within a short timeline of 48 hours. The Company

also contributed Rs.17.80 crore to the Prime Minister’s Citizen

Assistance and Relief (PM CARES) fund strengthening the

Nation’s fight against Covid-19 Pandemic.

During the year 2020, lockdowns were imposed in various parts

of the Country. Lockdown and other control measures enforced

by the central and state governments to reduce the spread of

Covid-19 had a significant impact on the economic activities

of many sectors and insurance sector was no exception.

However, the company, equipped with a robust IT infrastructure,

and having the business continuity plans in place, ensured

that the business operations were not hampered. We took

steps to ensure that business continues smoothly even with

majority of employees working from home and only skeletal

staff attending office. The Company’s strong digital presence

has also been an advantage for us with about 25% of our

overall business coming from the online platform. Despite all

adversities, we have managed to face the challenges without

getting overwhelmed by them. I am proud of the way your

Company has risen to the extreme challenges. We faced the

challenges with nimbleness, flexibility, and courage and with

a caring heart. The first quarter of the current financial year,

in terms of business, has rather been remarkable wherein

we have registered a business growth of approximately 20%,

significantly ahead of the industry and we have also increased

our market share. However, the 2nd wave of COVID-19

pandemic will have an impact on the company’s financials.

Performance in 2020-21

The company has performed remarkably well in the year 2020-

21. The gross written premium increased by 6% to 33,046

Cr compared to the previous financial year. Here It may be

kept in mind that this growth of ours is almost the double

that of what General Insurance Industry, excluding SAHI &

Specialised insurers, grew at during this period. The profit

before tax increased by 24.27% to Rs. 2,037 crore compared

to the previous financial year. The company continues to be

the market leader in the general insurance industry with a

market share of ~14%. The combined ratio, which indicates

the operational efficiency of a general insurance company

has come down from 116% to 113%. The solvency ratio of

the company is at 2.13x, which is significantly higher than the

IRDAI mandated control level solvency of 1.5x. The foreign

operations of the company also performed well in 2020-21

compared to the previous year.

Outlook

On the macroeconomic front, these were testing times. The

RBI Bulletin stated that even with a 9.5 per cent GDP growth

in 2021-22, there will be substantial slack in the economy. The

Government of India is taking several proactive steps to ensure

that the growth trajectory is restored at the earliest.

In operations across insurance organisations, what remains

crucial is not only to offset the added costs incurred to respond

to the outbreak but also to come in with innovative products,

spur quick recovery to drive future growth. Further, the

pandemic has prompted the insurers to contend with paperless

handling of claims and a move towards automation of small

claims. New technologies are being adopted for making the

process seamless. The goal is to better leverage the power of

technology to automate the claim settlement process.

Profitable growth, coupled with Policyholder delight, remains

the goal for the Company. Transforming the company into

a more agile, digital, and customer-centric entity, is the way

forward for us. The Company continues to be debt free and

well capitalised.

Finally, I would like to thank all our beloved customers and all

Stakeholders and assuring you that New India Assurance shall

live up to its legacy and continue to lead the way creating value

for every stakeholder associated with the Company.

I would like to reassure you that your Company will strive to

retain the leadership position and to grow strongly and profitably

in the coming years. I wish to thank all the Stakeholders, Board

of Directors, Customers, Associates, Intermediaries and all

New Indians for their continued support and co-operation all

throughout this long successful journey.

letter ref.: -411/F&N(NL)Amort-EB/2019-20/124 dated 07.07.2020 has granted approval for the

amortization of the pension liability on account of regular employees, over a period of not exceeding five years with

effect from FY 2019-20. Accordingly, the balance unamortized liability of Rs. 1,64,056.00 lakhs as on April 1, 2020

would be amortized in the remaining four years. During the year ended March 31, 2021 an amount of Rs. 41,014.00

lakhs (P.Y. Rs. 41,014.00 lakhs) is charged to the profit and loss account and the balance amount remaining to be

amortized in remaining period is Rs. 1,23,042.00 lakhs.

4.

Taxation:

a)

Income Tax: Provision for Tax Rs. 44,505.76 Lakhs (P.Y. Rs. 24,257.24 lakhs) (Current Tax) shown in Profit and Loss

Account includes Rs. 5,483.11 lakhs (P.Y. Rs. 3,003.65 lakhs) relating to foreign taxes.

b)

The Income Tax Assessments of the Company have been completed up to assessment year 2018-19. Major disputed

demands are in respect of profit on sale of investment, expenses paid to Auto tie-up dealers and related exemptions

from tax liability. Based on the decisions of the appellate authority, the interpretations of the relevant provisions, the

management of the Company is of the opinion that the demands are likely to be either deleted or substantially reduced

and accordingly no provision has been made for the same.

c)

Deferred Taxes:

The components of temporary differences resulting into deferred tax assets/(Liabilities) are as under:

A sum of Rs. 1,303.16 Lakhs (PY Rs. 2,149.85 lakhs) has been credited to the Profit and Loss Account on account

of creation of deferred assets during the year.

II.

On prudence basis recognition of deferred tax asset on unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward losses has

not been given effect in the books of account, as in opinion of the management there are no sufficient evidence to

establish virtual certainty that sufficient future taxable income would be available against which such deferred tax

assets can be realised.:
