Message from the: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

I hope you and your loved ones are keeping safe. The second

wave of the coronavirus pandemic has been more severe and

scaring for many. The ripple effect of this devastation has left

people and economies struggling to get back on their feet.

Amid the gloom, ‘Hope’ has emerged as a saviour as always.

It is ‘hope’ that binds humanity, helping it overcome every

challenge, no matter how daunting. Further, when you

combine ‘hope’ with ‘support’, most of the obstacles can be

overcome.

The insurance industry has played a critical role in supporting

efforts of humanity during times of distress, since centuries.

Be it man-made calamities or natural catastrophes, insurance

has been a key mechanism to compensate for the losses and

bring things back to normalcy. However, a critical issue in this

journey has been the embracing of this important solution by

only a few.

The under-penetration of insurance products in India has

been red-flagged in many forums, for several years. The risk

that such under-penetration presents is not just limited to few

sections of the society, but the burden of this risk is borne by

the entire nation. The need to scale up the reach and

penetration of insurance across India’s rural and urban

populace can no more be ignored.

Being a part of this industry endows us with a responsibility

that is far greater than simply meeting the demand for

insurance products. As we come to realise the limitations of

the traditional insurance solutions in providing an armour

against a pandemic-like situation, there is a need to explore

ideas to address new age as well as pandemic risks, which

have a much wider impact compared to regular risk events.

The role that the pandemic has played in accelerating

digitisation across sectors has been spoken at length. When it

comes to the insurance industry, this journey began a while

the Chairperson

letter finds you and your family, safe and well.

As I connect with you today through my annual shareholder: letter, life has come full circle. We continue to wade through

a recurring pandemic, with the virus mutating into new

variants. While many thought the vaccine would be the

panacea to all problems, issues related to supply and

logistics as well as concerns about efficacy against the

emerging variants, keep the on-ground situation uncertain.

What this tells us is that we may need to navigate the crisis

for some more time than anticipated. More importantly, we

need to stay nimble, agile and resilient while focussing on our

long-term goals.

From the long-term perspective, we, at ICICI Lombard,

remain steadfast and focussed on our value creation

approach for our shareholders and our brand ethos of

‘Nibhaye Vaade’, thereby reaffirming our commitment to

support our customers, business associates, and the society

at large, in times of need. This is the purpose of our

existence.

Impact of COVID-19

In our view, this pandemic will have far-reaching implications

on consumers, businesses, and the society at large. The

immediate impact and responses have been played out;

however, the real transformation is a journey that has just

begun. We strongly believe that the world on the other side

of this crisis is a phygital one that blends the best of the

physical experiences, with the convenience of the digital

tools. In our view, there is a re-assessment of risk perception

across the globe and particularly by consumers in India,

which

(i) Qualitative Disclosures

A. Information relating to the design and structure of

remuneration processes

1. Key features and objectives of remuneration policy

The Company has under the guidance of the Board and

the Board Nomination and Remuneration Committee

(“BNRC/Committee”), followed compensation practices

intended to drive meritocracy and fairness.

The twin pillars of performance management and talent

management system are closely intertwined with the

compensation, benefits and reward mechanism of the

Company. While the Company strives to ensure internal

and external equity that are consistent with emerging

market trends, its business model and affordability based

on business performance sets the overarching boundary

conditions. This approach has been incorporated in the

Compensation Policy, the key elements of which are given

below:

a. Effective governance of compensation:

The BNRC has oversight over compensation. The

Committee defines Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for

Whole-time Directors and the organisational performance

norms for bonus based on the financial and strategic plan

approved by the Board. The KPIs include both

quantitative and qualitative aspects. The BNRC assesses

organizational performance as well as the individual

performance for Whole-time Directors of the Company.

Based on its assessment, it makes recommendations to

the Board regarding compensation for the Whole-time

Directors of the Company and bonus for employees,

including senior management and key management

personnel.

b. Alignment of compensation philosophy with

prudent risk taking:

The Company seeks to achieve a prudent mix of fixed and

variable pay, with a higher proportion of variable pay at

senior levels and no guaranteed bonuses. Compensation

is sought to be aligned to both financial and non-financial

indicators of performance including aspects like risk

management and customer service. In addition, the

Company has an employee stock option scheme aimed at

aligning compensation to long term performance through

stock option grants that vest over a period of time to senior

management and Whole-time Directors. Compensation to:

Managing Director and CEO)

The following table sets forth, for the period indicated, the

details of quantitative disclosure for remuneration of

Whole-time Directors:

1. Fixed pay includes basic salary, supplementary allowances, contribution to provident fund and gratuity fund by the

Company.

2. For the year ended March 31, 2021, variable pay and share-linked instruments represent amounts paid/options awarded

for the year ended March 31, 2020 as per IRDAI approval.

3. Pursuant to the issuance of bonus shares by the ICICI Bank under ICICI Bank ESOS scheme on June 24, 2017, the

share-linked instruments have been adjusted with increase of one option for every 10 outstanding options.

Number of Whole-time Directors including: Managing

Managing Director & CEO, based

on the certification from respective functional heads, is

placed at the Audit Committee and Board of Directors on

a quarterly basis.

iii. Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

The Company has in place adequate internal financial

controls commensurate with size, scale and complexity of

its operations. The effectiveness of internal controls over

financial reporting is exhibited through controls testing

with samples and has not reported any deficiencies. The

Company has in place Entity Level Controls which broadly

cover Corporate Governance, Core Committees, Core

Policies and Risk and Fraud Control framework and have

found no deficiencies in its annual evaluation for FY2021.

The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has had far reaching

impact on several critical risk areas of the business. The

Company on assessment of the associated risks,

commenced preparation for risk mitigation at the

beginning of March 2020. The Company activated the

Crisis Management Team (“CMT”) that has been regularly

reviewing the developing situation to calibrate the

Company’s response. The CMT conceptualised and

formulated the business continuity plans for the Company

prioritizing the dual objectives of employee safety and

delivering customer commitments. From an entity level

risk evaluation perspective, the Company believes that

the risks arising out of the pandemic are presently at

manageable levels for the Company. Processes and

controls followed to prepare the financials are found to

hold good and no new financial reporting risks were

identified or observed on account of COVID-19. The

Company is closely watching the developing situation for

appropriate risk mitigation and management.

Risk Management Framework

The objective of the Risk Management Framework (“the

Framework”) of the Company is to ensure that various

risks are identified, measured, mitigated and that policies,

procedures and standards are established to address

these risks for systemic response and adherence. The

Company has identified enterprise wide risks, which are

categorized under five broad risk groups namely Credit

Risk, Market Risk, Underwriting Risk, Operational Risk

and Strategic Risk. The broad structure of the Framework

is as follows:

Risk Identification, Assessment and Mitigation process;

Risk Management and Oversight structure; and

Risk Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism.

The Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") function of the

Company undertakes a comprehensive Risk and Control

Self-Assessment (R & CSA) activity for all units forming

part of the risk universe of the Company, to manage the

existing and emerging risk areas for the Company.

The senior management of the Company is responsible

for a periodic review of the risk management process to

ensure that the process initiatives are aligned to the

desired objectives.:
