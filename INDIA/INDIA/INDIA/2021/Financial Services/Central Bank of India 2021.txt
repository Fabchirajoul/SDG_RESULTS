Dear Stakeholders,

I hope you are well. I pray for your safety and wellbeing during these difficult times precipitated by the pandemic.

The year 2020 will go down in history as one of the most calamitous years as the novel Covid-19 virus caused widespread

devastation by taking lives and livelihoods of millions across the world. The global economy was brought to a standstill by

the necessary measures of lockdowns and physical distancing restrictions.

The April 2021 Report of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects the growth of the global economy by 6.0% in

2021 from an estimated contraction of (-) 3.3% in 2020 and further projects a growth of 4.4% in 2022. However, the global

growth in 2021 is likely to be uneven. The countries that can open up earlier due to ebbing infections and faster inoculation

are expected to grow faster. The April 2021 Report of the IMF estimates advanced economies to grow by 5.1% in 2021

from a contraction of (-) 4.7% in 2020. Among the advanced economies, the USA is projected to have an impressive

growth in 2021 due to several measures taken by the government. The emerging markets and developing economies are

projected to grow by 6.7% in 2021 after an estimated contraction of (-) 2.2% in 2020. In 2022, the emerging markets and

developing economies are projected to grow by 5.0%.

On the domestic front, as per the provisional figures, real GDP contracted by (-) 7.3% in 2020-21 despite agriculture

showing resilience and registering positive growth. Sectors like mining, manufacturing, construction, and some other

service sectors have witnessed negative growth in 2020-21. The quarterly data shows that the domestic economy slowly

started to recover from the pandemic. The Q4 2020-21 real GDP grew by (+) 1.6% vis-à-vis (+) 0.5% in Q3 2020-21.

However, private final consumption expenditure as percentage of real GDP softened to 55.4% in Q4 2020-21 as compared

to 58.3% in Q3 2020-21. On the other hand, gross fixed capital formation as percentage of real GDP inched up to 34.3% in

Q4 2020-21 vis-à-vis 33.0% in Q3 2020-21.

The second wave of Covid-19 infections in India thwarted the recovery process as several states had to impose different

restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. Due to which we expect growth to remain muted in Q1 2021-22. Nonetheless,

with the rapid vaccination drive and scaling up of healthcare facilities we expect the economic activities to gain traction.

The Government of India has proactively undertaken various policy measures to boost the economy and the “Atmanirbhar

Bharat” is one such step towards that. Through the “Atmanirbhar Bharat”, the Government of India announced different

stimulus measures to boost various sectors of Indian economy and provided several relief measures. There were a

host of measures for the MSMEs, street vendors, agriculture infrastructure, etc. in the “Atmanirbhar Bharat”. Recently in

June 2021, the Hon’ble Finance Minister further announced a slew of measures to provide economic relief from pandemic,

strengthening public health and impetus for growth and employment. Towards this end, the Hon’ble Finance Minister

announced `1.10 lakh crore loan guarantee scheme for Covid affected sectors, credit guarantee scheme for micro finance

institutions, free one month tourist visa to 5 lakh tourists, extension of Atmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana, extension of

tenure of PLI scheme for large scale electronic manufacturing, etc.:

Letter DOS.ARG.No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020 (as amended) (the “RBI communication”)

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Central Bank of India (“the Bank”) as of March

31, 2021 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date

which includes internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Bank’s branches.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal

control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control

stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of

Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate

internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business,

including adherence to the Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds

and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial

information, as required under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve

Bank of India.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our

audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial

Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and the Standards on

Auditing (SAs) issued by the ICAI, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and

the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable

assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting were established and maintained and

if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls

over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting

included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material

weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal financial controls based on

the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of

material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors, in terms of

their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit

opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance

regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting

includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,

accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance

that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance with

authorisations of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or

timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on

the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion

or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject:

5.14 The outbreak of Corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic globally including India has resulted in slowdown of

economic activities and increased volatility in financial markets. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will

impact the Group’s financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Given the

uncertainty, because of COVID-19 pandemic, the Group is continuously monitoring any material change in future

economic condition which may impact the Group’s operations and its financial results in future depending on the

developments which may differ from that estimated as at the date of approval of the financial statements. Looking

to the present scenario and COVID-19 situation, as a one time measure, Bank has made a provision of ₹ 1049.84

crore in certain NPA accounts as a matter of prudence.
