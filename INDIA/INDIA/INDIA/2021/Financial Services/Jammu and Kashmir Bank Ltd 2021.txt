Dear Shareholders,

Our core strength originates from the wellsprings of

emotional equity that the people of J&K, Ladakh and rest of

the country have invested in the Bank for decades now. Our

customers are our forte and the increasing competition will

only further strengthen our resolve to deepen our bonds with

our people, improve our customer services and stimulate us

to keep offering them with best-in-class, innovative, easily

accessible financial products, banking services and facilities

at competitive rates across the physical and digital domains.

We perceive our role in the region as that of a developmental

financial institution, which extends our resolve to work for

the overall socio-economic empowerment and progress

of the people in this region. Financial empowerment of

people being the quintessence of our vision, we have always

envisaged our home region, J&K and Ladakh, as financially

inclusive, economically vibrant with expanding avenues for

entrepreneurship and progressive enterprises. In the rest

of India, we are pursuing increasing our footprint in niche

markets and augmenting our share in the retail segment

while capitalizing on lending opportunities in PSU and

higher rated corporate segments.

On behalf of my colleagues on the Board-of-Directors of the

Bank, my heartfelt gratitude to our customers who continue

to repose faith in us and continue to inspire us to perform

with renewed vigor. I would like to take this opportunity to

express my deep sense of gratitude to our promoters, the

Government of UT of J&K and Government of Ladakh UT

for lending their kind, unflinching support in toughest of the

times. I am also grateful to the esteemed Board of Directors

for their support and guidance. And I am highly thankful

to the members of J&K Bank Family whose commitment,

exceptional annual performance possible.

Looking forward for your continued support and patronage.

of Corporate Governance codes and apply it innovatively in a

more meaningful manner, thereby making it relevant to the

organization that is operating in a specific environment.

In line with its vision, Bank wants to use Corporate Governance

innovatively in a transitional economy like Jammu and

Kashmir. The Bank wants to use Corporate Governance as

an instrument of economic and social transformation. Given

the fact that J&K Bank is seen as a great success of “public-

private partnership”, our Bank as a business is expected to

play a pivotal role in social transformation of the economy.

This lends urgency to implementation of good governance

practices which go beyond the Corporate Governance code.

We, as the prime corporate of Jammu and Kashmir and

Ladakh, have a focused interest in making the Union

Territories a safe place for business. Bank has a key role

to play in providing public and private services, financial

infrastructure and employment. As such, the efficiency and

accountability of the corporation is a matter of both private

and public interest and governance, therefore, comes at the

top of the agenda. The fact that the Bank is majoritarily owned

by the Government of UT of J&K but professionally managed,

to take care of interests of all stake holders which include

sizeable number of other investors, governance is critical. For

us, Corporate Governance is concerned with the systems of

laws, regulations and practices, which will promote enterprise,

ensure accountability and trigger performance. The Bank, for

one, stands for being more accountable, practice self-policing

and make financial transactions transparent and legit.

VISION

“Pioneering the economic and social transformation”

To become a committed partner in fostering economic and

social transformation across the country through a deep

commitment to value creation for all our stakeholders, while

continuing to build on our historic business relationship with

Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.

MISSION

•

To acquire an enhanced business footprint across

geographies and emerge as a prominent national brand

in the financial sector.

•

To position the Bank as the “Most Preferred Bank”

for Customer focus, Operational Excellence and High

Integrity towards one and all stakeholders.

•

To be the best-in-class financial intermediary, leveraging

our digital and physical banking channels;

•

To observe customer centricity through service

excellence,

integrity

and

transparency,

and

a

comprehensive range of innovative products and

services responsive to customer needs.

•

To be a lean, learning and efficient banking organization

focusing on prudent, sustainable, profitable growth and

value creation.

•

To adopt the best standards for corporate governance,

business ethics and risk management.

•

To vigorously promote financial inclusion as a business

proposition to harness the potential at the bottom of the

pyramid.
