long hours to navigate through this crisis. It helped in delivering reasonable results for

Loan losses and provisions grew by 52% to ` 5,969 crore.

Profit before tax decreased by 18% to ` 5,992 crore.

Profit after tax reduced by 16% to ` 4,420 crore.

Bajaj Finance’s capital adequacy ratio as of 31 March 2021 was 28.31%, which

continued to be well above the RBI norms. Tier I adequacy was 25.11%.

Rahul Bajaj, the founder Chairman of your Company, has decided to retire as a director.

He has been a beacon to all of us, and your Board has unanimously decided to have

him as Chairman Emeritus. On your behalf, allow me to offer him our heartfelt

thanks for his long leadership.

Amidst the second COVID-19 wave, it is difficult to predict what the first and second

quarter of FY2022 will bring. However, notwithstanding my innate conservatism,

I can say one thing with a fair degree of certainty - Your Company has the team,

the commitment, the capability and the financial strength to overcome the second wave

as well. Indeed, as I write, the team is actively working on this.

Remember the song, “We Shall Overcome”. That is the motto and leitmotif of your

Company. And will forever be.

Stay safe. Vaccinate yourself and your family. Wear masks. Maintain social distancing.

Never forget that all grey clouds must pass.

With my very best,

Sanjiv Bajaj

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Managing Director (MD) and

Audit Committee periodically. The CoC

includes commitment to health, safety

and environment, eliminating waste

and conserving resources, with zero

tolerance towards non-compliance.

The Company has a separate CoC for

Directors and Senior Management

which provides that ‘Directors and

Senior Management shall observe the

highest standards of ethical conduct

and integrity and shall work to the

best of their ability and judgement’.

A declaration from the Directors and

Senior Management's affirmation to

the said CoC is communicated to all

stakeholders by the MD, through the

Annual Report.

BFL and its subsidiaries have zero

tolerance towards unethical business

practices and ensures adherence to

necessary policies with respect to anti-

bribery, conflict of interest, prevention

of insider trading, prevention of money

laundering, prevention of sexual

harassment at workplace and related-

party transactions.

BFL and its subsidiaries adhere to

the Code of Practices and Procedures

for Fair Disclosure of Unpublished

Price Sensitive Information (UPSI).

Concerned employees of BFL, its parent

company, subsidiaries and other group

companies, and their executive staff

and directors are covered by the CoC

for regulation of trades by designated

persons, pursuant to SEBI (Prohibition

of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015,

as amended. The policy provides for

protection against victimization in cases

where insider trading is reported by an

employee. These policies are reviewed

periodically and updated as required.

Non-compliance is viewed seriously

by the Board, which initiates action

commensurate with proven violations.

Employee complaints linked to CoC

adherence received in FY2021 have

been suitably resolved, except for 2

complaints pending as on date.

Transparency

Transparency and fairness in dealings

with customers is one of the stated

principles to which BFL and all its

subsidiaries adhere to. None of

the products withhold any relevant

information needed by the customers

to make informed choices.

The Company follows a transparent

and detailed investor communication

protocol which includes investor

presentations, quarterly and event-

based investor calls, publishing of

earnings call transcripts, prompt

dissemination of price sensitive

information, and so on.

After the end of each quarter, BFL

voluntarily provides provisional key

financial metrics pertaining to that

quarter to the stock exchanges. This

ensures symmetry of information in

line with the principles of fair and

uniform disclosures.

The Company’s senior management

engages with all employees on a

quarterly basis in an open townhall

session called ‘Confluence’. The

management shares financial

performance, updates on business;

and new initiatives undertaken in HR,

operations and technology amongst

others. This forum encourages

employees to make suggestions, raise

concerns and seek direct response from

the senior management.

Accountability

‘Accountable Empowerment’ is one

of the core principles of BFL and its

subsidiaries. It strongly believes that

empowerment and accountability go

hand-in-hand.

The Company and its subsidiaries are

managed by competent professionals,

while being overseen by the respective

Boards of Directors.

The remuneration of Senior

Management is benchmarked with

appropriate peer groups and consists

of fixed pay, annual variable payout

and long-term incentive in the form of

stock options.

BFL and its subsidiaries follow practices

which reflect their endeavour to

maintain high standards of governance,

going beyond legal requirements:

i. BFL holds higher number of Board

meetings as against the minimum of

four required by law;

ii. Independent Directors meet senior

management twice a year;

iii. Quarterly meeting of Chief Risk Officers

of BFL and BHFL with their respective

Boards without the presence of MD;

iv. BHFL Board consists of three

independent directors, more

than prescribed under the SEBI

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure

Requirements) Regulations, 2015;

‘Accountable Empowerment’ is one

of the core principles of BFL and its

subsidiaries and it strongly believes that

empowerment and accountability go

hand-in-hand.

letter, no dues certificate,

communication of mandate success,

etc. on messaging apps.

BFL provides e-mandate registration

process to its customers – resulting

in turn around time reducing from

approximately 15 days to nearly real

time. In FY2021, e-mandate was nearly

30% of new business.

Enhancing customer

experience

Customer experience and servicing of

customers in a seamless manner has

been the cornerstone of BFL’s business

transformation journey. It focuses on

delivering significant enhancements in

self-service infrastructure which lead to

superior experience, greater stickiness

and larger share of customers’ financial

services wallet.

BFL has instituted multiple cross-functional

teams to identify areas requiring process

simplification across businesses, operations

and collections to deliver superior

customer experience. These initiatives

involve a combination of process, policy

and system changes which includes:

leveraging Machine Learning (ML)

and Robotic Process Automation

(RPA) to enable quick response to

customer requests in an automated

manner - approximately 30% of the

service requests were responded on a

near-to-real-time basis without human

intervention;

instituting a dedicated customer

complaint reduction unit to identify

the root cause of customer complaints

through data analysis;

setting up a dedicated team to monitor

customer queries and grievances on

various social media channels and

provide quick resolution;

opening dedicated collection service

desks across top 10 branches;

setting up a centralised call monitoring

infrastructure for its outsourced

collection agency network to improve

controllership. All agencies are

mandated to make collection calls only

through this infrastructure. Collection

calls are now being recorded and

monitored periodically to ensure

compliance with collection code

of conduct;

Suo-moto Debt Recovery Agent (DRA)

training and Change Agent program for

its collection agents — first phase of

training of approximately 6,700 agents

has been completed and it endeavours

to train rest of its agents in next

12-18 months;

A well-established Net Promoter Score

(NPS) framework to gauge customer

experience — expanded its scope to

cover collections processes.

Support extended to

customers amidst the

pandemic

BFL took various steps to support its

customers during the pandemic situation.

Some of these actions included:

offering moratorium based on request

and on a suo-moto basis where

customers were unable to make their

payments or raise requests due to

pandemic;

offering one-time loan restructuring

for COVID-19 related stress basis RBI

guidelines;

providing an option to existing good

customers to convert term loans into

hybrid flexi loans and thereby enable

them to manage cashflows better;

Introducing a ‘book an appointment’

option for customers for visiting

branches in appropriate timeslots in

view of social distancing norms; and

crediting ex-gratia amounts to eligible

customers as per the Government

guidelines.

Customer protection and

education

Through its small-ticket financing options,

BFL enables millions of customers to

begin their credit journey with bureaus

and become part of the formal financial

ecosystem. Over the last three years, BFL

offered financing to nearly 10 million such

customers. In partnership with various

agencies, BFL promotes financial discipline

among customers by keeping them

abreast of various credit metrics evaluated

by financiers. BFL also creates awareness

amongst the customers about devious
