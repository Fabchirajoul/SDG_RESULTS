SECRETARY

sujathap@chola.murugappa.com:

Dear Shareholders,

The COVID-19 pandemic has cost the world millions of lives and

jobs. It has compelled people all over the world to make changes in

their way of working and living.

During the year gone by, the safety and health of our employees

has been of paramount importance for the Company. We have

been continually educating them on the importance of

self-discipline and adherence to all safety directions and guidelines

issued by the government and extending support to them and

their families in every possible way.

The pandemic continues to be an unprecedented challenge that

the country and the world is facing. However, such times of crisis

also lead to points of inﬂection and I am happy to say that your

company continues to be on a strong platform with a solid

foundation. The inherent strengths that your company has built

over the past four decades, coupled with the strong community

focus and enormous trust among stakeholders have enabled it to

sail through this year of adversity.

Industry review

FY 21 was one of the challenging years for the auto industry that

reported de-growth in sales in every segment, as the economy reeled under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The

domestic commercial vehicle industry closed FY 21 with a 21% de-growth after recording a 29% negative growth in FY 20 which

is predominantly on account of the disruption in sales and supply chain, negative customer sentiments and economic

slowdown. Medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV’s) recorded a 22% de-growth, light commercial vehicles (LCV’s)

18% de-growth and small commercial vehicles (SCV’s) 25% de-growth. Domestic car and utility vehicle industry has witnessed

three years of negative growth which is the ﬁrst time in a decade which were majorly attributed to muted consumer

sentiments and higher cost of ownership. Tractor industry had a growth of 27% in FY 21 due to healthy farm cash ﬂows on the

back of a normal monsoon and minimal COVID-19 impact in rural areas. Two-wheeler industry had a de-growth of 13% in FY 21

due to higher inﬂation levels and reduced discretionary spending.

The Loan against property (LAP) segment was impacted during the ﬁrst half of FY 21. Most of the players in LAP were cautious

in terms of disbursements in FY 21. Initiatives by Government of India and RBI through Emergency Credit Line Guarantees

Scheme (ECLGS), moratorium and restructuring helped the industry to rebound in the second half of FY 21 and it is expected to

continue providing momentum in FY 22.

In home loan segment, the repayments were signiﬁcantly impacted especially in marginal communities and self-employed

semi-formal segments. The demand in home loan segment was subdued through FY 21 and green shoots began to emerge by

Q3 FY 21. The housing sector is expected to grow 6-10% in FY 22 and aﬀordable housing to grow at 12-15% in the same period.

Further, lowering the threshold for NBFCs to avail debt recovery under SARFAESI from ₹ 50 Lakhs to ₹ 20 Lakhs will aid

recoveries of NPAs in LAP and Home Loan segments.
