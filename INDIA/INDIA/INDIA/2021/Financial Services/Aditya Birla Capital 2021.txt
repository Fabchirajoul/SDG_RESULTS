recommended for the approval of the Members, the appointment

of B S R & Co. LLP, Chartered Accountants (Firm Registration

No. 101248W/W-100022) (“B S R & Co”), as the Statutory

Auditors of the Company, for a term of 3 (three) consecutive

Meeting till the conclusion of the 17th (Seventeenth) Annual

be within the limits specified under section 141(3)(g) of the

Act and will be in compliance with the eligibility criteria /

requirements specified under the Companies Act, 2013 and

the RBI Guidelines.

p.a. (for full year) (exclusive of certification fees, goods and

services tax and reimbursement of out of pocket expenses

incurred in connection with the Audit) which will be prorated

for the current year i.e. FY 2021-22 depending upon the scope

of their work in the manner as may be fixed by the Board (on

of preparation and finalization of quarterly consolidated financial

results, at least eighty percent of each of the consolidated

revenue, assets and profits, respectively, shall have been

subject to audit or in case of unaudited results, subjected to

limited review.

Due to the above reason, there would be an increase in the

proposed fees payable to B S R & Co. as they shall be required

to do additional audit work for the purpose of consolidation,

compared to what was being paid to Deloitte.

LETTER

TO SHAREHOLDERS: Dear Shareholders,

The COVID-19 pandemic has touched every aspect

of our lives across the world. It has altered mindsets,

perceptions and strategies for businesses and beyond.

If there is one abiding lesson, it is that sustainable

growth and development involves holistic nurturing of

human, natural, and financial capital. 2020 is a year

that will only gain in significance when viewed through

the perspective lens of time.

The Global Economy

The world has been fighting the COVID-19 pandemic

for more than a year now and the struggle has had

deleterious economic effects. In 2020, the global

economy contracted by 3.3%, the largest contraction

on record, at least since World War II. Much of it

was concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year

FY21, as several countries enforced strict lockdowns.

Economies bounced back – albeit at differentiated

speeds – in subsequent quarters, on the back of large

fiscal stimulus packages, especially in the developed

countries, restocking demand after dilution of

lockdowns, and improved confidence levels following

the start of vaccination programmes. As per the recent

forecasts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),

the US and China are expected to record a strong

recovery in 2021, resulting in a net positive expansion

of their economies over the 2019 levels. These two

engines of growth are expected to boost demand for

exports from other countries. Even the other two large

economies, the EU and Japan, are expected to expand.

In response to the pandemic, central banks resorted

to strongly supportive monetary policies in most

developed economies, causing interest rates to go

down to record lows. At the same time, another

consequence of this policy has been a surfeit of

liquidity. That has led to a strong rally in prices of many

industrial commodities, which has also been supported

by the evolving economic recovery, stimulus-related

demand expectations and certain supply-side

disruptions. This has caused inflationary pressures on

the cost dynamics of several manufacturing industries.

The latest IMF forecast suggests a strong 6% growth in

global GDP in 2021. But the occurrence of second and

third waves of COVID-19 in different parts of the world

and reports of virus mutations have created downside

risks to the outlook of a strong growth rebound. Recovery

remains uneven and uncertain, with the extent of fiscal

support and level of vaccination being key differentiators

of the short-term economic outlook across countries.

LETTER

TO SHAREHOLDERS: Dear Shareholders,

What a year it’s been! We have all lived through perhaps

one of the most unprecedented and challenging years

of our lives. Some of you might have memories of World

War II and even the Great Depression. But for many, the

lockdowns around the world, the waves and mutations

of the virus and the significant impact on lives and

livelihood will remain etched in memory for all time.

The concerted action of policy makers around the world

helped economies recover and markets soar. But, its only

with the increase in vaccinations around the world that

apprehension, fear and anxiety will slowly give way to

some form of normalcy that we all were used to before

2020 began.

While the pain of FY 2020-21 will not abate anytime

soon, history shows that typically a crisis is followed

by a period of strong growth and we have seen this

happen post the World Wars, the Great Depression

and even the global financial crisis. So, one can expect

growth to rebound strongly once normalcy sets in.

Such crises have also been the times when innovations

have flourished and we should expect innovations in

different areas that we would be able to trace to the

times we have all recently experienced.

At Aditya Birla Capital we had a choice to make. We

could either buckle up and wait for the storm to pass

or we could look for hope in adversity and opportunity

in the crisis. The 22,500+ employees at Aditya Birla

Capital chose to reinvent, innovate and focus to

find ways to continue to help our customers lead

fulfilling lives.

* Diminution in investment

letter and other loan securing documents agrees with its customers on collateral

security to be provided by the customers in secured loan exposures that are subject to credit risk. Collateral security enables

us to recover all or part of the outstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral asset provided, in cases where the borrower is

unable or unwilling to fulfil its primary obligations.

Collateral security accepted could be in the form of:

a)

Financial collateral in the form of pledge of equity shares, units of mutual funds, assignment of life insurance policies

b)

Current Assets in the form of inventories meant for sale or receivables arising out of the sale of finished goods

c)

Fixed Assets (in the form of immovable properties – real estate, Plant and Machinery, Equipment)

d)

Third-party obligation (in the form of Irrevocable Unconditional Guarantee issued by Bank, Third party)

e)

Risk participation from Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE)

f)

Assignment of borrower’s rights and interests under agreements with third parties

In addition, we also stipulates escrow of cash flows and a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) for project loans. Collateral serves to

mitigate the inherent risk of credit loss in an exposure, by either improving recoveries in the event of a default or substituting the borrower.

As part of the assessment of a credit transaction the availability, adequacy and suitability of collateral for the transaction is evaluated

and decided upon. The processes include verification of the title to the collateral offered and valuation by technical experts where

warranted. We accept as collateral only securities of good quality and have in place legally effective and enforceable documentation.

For guarantee’s taken, the guarantor’s creditworthiness is assessed during the credit assessment process of the transaction.

We have collateral type specific haircuts in place which are reviewed at intervals as appropriate to the type of collateral.

The NBFC & HFC recognises that collateral can be a credit mitigant (alternative source of repayment), but does not replace or

dilute the underwriting standards the company adopts to underwrite credit exposures.

Financial Risk Management and its Policies for NBFC & HFC Businesses

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the NBFC & HFC will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial

liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the

NBFC & HFC might be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of the

cash flows under both normal and stress circumstances.

NBFC & HFC manages its liquidity requirement by analysing the maturity pattern of NBFC & HFC's cash flows of financial assets

and financial liabilities. The Asset Liability Management of the NBFC & HFC is periodically reviewed by its Risk Management

Committee.

The table below summarises the maturity profile of the undiscounted cash flows of the NBFC & HFC’s financial liabilities as at

31st March 2021 and 31st March 2020.
