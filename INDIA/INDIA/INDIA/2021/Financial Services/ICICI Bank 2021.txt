towards the successful navigation of these challenges

by our institution. on behalf of the Board, i would like

to thank all employees for their dedication and response

during this difficult period, and for upholding the ethos

to cushion the balance sheet from the potential risks

arising out of uncertainties around the trajectory of the

pandemic and level of economic activity. throughout the

year, the Bank carried substantial excess liquidity, as it

saw very healthy deposit inflows. Despite the challenging

environment, the Bank saw a healthy growth in core

operating profit and profit after tax in fiscal 2021. the

Bank raised additional equity capital with the objective of

further strengthening its capital adequacy and improving

its competitive positioning. While regulatory guidelines

did not permit banks to declare dividend last year, the

Board of Directors has recommended payment of

dividend to the shareholders in the current year.

the performance of the Bank in terms of growth, portfolio

quality and profitability is a result of the focussed

execution of its strategy over the past few years. the

Digital initiatives are at the core of all activities at icici Bank. in fiscal 2021, we came out with

a slew of innovative digital solutions to help our customers tide over the challenges posed by

the pandemic. our mantra – Banking with care – was aimed at empowering our customers

to undertake banking transactions from the comfort of their home/office, without visiting a

branch. icici StAck played an important role as the backbone of our digital offering for retail

customers. in addition, we offered a range of solutions for merchants and businesses to meet

their requirements digitally. our mobile application, iMobile pay, took the lead in offering

interoperability by allowing individuals, who are not our customers, to connect their bank

account with the app, make payments and undertake banking transactions. it also gave them

instant access to the entire range of services of icici Bank. During the year, we continued to

focus on data analytics-led underwriting and digitising our mortgage and loan businesses.

Anup Bagchi

Executive Director

our employees showed extraordinary commitment and went beyond the call of their duties

to serve our customers and take care of each other in the wake of the pandemic. the welfare

and well-being of our employees and their families is of utmost importance to us. We have

supported covid-19 affected colleagues and their families with medical e-consultation, and

assisted them in quarantine and hospitalisation. We have launched a focussed programme to

vaccinate all our employees and their immediate family members. in order to facilitate seamless

operations for non-branch colleagues, we rolled out a large work-from-home infrastructure

within a few weeks from the onset of the pandemic. We continue to invest in technology to

build a robust architecture for tomorrow. the four pillars of the architecture are a resilient and

flexible backbone, deep understanding of customers, delivering delightful experience and a

digitally native engagement with them.
