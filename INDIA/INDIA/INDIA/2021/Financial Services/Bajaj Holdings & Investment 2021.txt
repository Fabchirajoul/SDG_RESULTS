such payment by a special resolution passed on 27 July 2016 for a five-year period, which expired on 31 March 2021.

In view of the increased demands on non-executive directors’ participation in Board and Committee meetings and the

higher responsibilities they are expected to bear in the interest of higher level of excellence in corporate governance on

directors for a further period of five years upto and including the year 2025-26.

or makes inadequate profits in a financial year, any non-executive director of such company, including an independent

director, may be paid remuneration in accordance with Schedule V of the Act.

No approval of Central Government will be required for the said payment of commission, since it is within the prescribed

limits as specified under section 197. The above payment to non-executive directors will be in addition to the sitting fees

payable to them for attending Board/committee meetings, which at present is fixed at ` 100,000 per meeting.

None of the Directors/key managerial personnel and/or their relatives, except the concerned non-executive director are

directly or indirectly concerned or interested, financially or otherwise, except to the extent of remuneration that may

be received by them and their respective shareholding, if any, in the Company, in the resolution set out in Item No.

Statement of Cash Flows (Contd.):

Managing Director who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Core Management

Committee examines performance both from product and a geographical perspective.

15. Foreign currency translation

Functional and presentational currency

The standalone financial statements are presented in INR which is also functional currency of the Company.

Transactions and balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of exchange ruling at

the date of the transaction.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the

spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–trading activities are taken to other

income/expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange

rates as at the date of recognition.

16. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk of firm commitments. Derivatives are

initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured

to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit

and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the

timing of the recognition in the Statement of Profit and Loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the

nature of the hedged item.

The Company enters into derivative financial instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts to manage

its exposure to foreign exchange rate risks. The Company does not hold derivative financial instruments for

speculative purposes.

Hedge accounting:

The Company designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk as cash flow hedges. At the

inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which

the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the

hedge. The documentation includes the Company’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge,

the hedging/economic relationship, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, hedge ratio

and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair value in offsetting the

exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are

Managing Director in the Annual Report.

BHIL follows the Code of Practices and Procedures for Fair Disclosure of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI).

The Company has established a Whistle Blower Policy, which describes the process to report any unethical behaviour or

violation of the Code of Conduct. Any employee can report to the management regarding instances of unethical behaviour,

suspected fraud or violation of the Code of Conduct or ethics policy. In order to safeguard employees, who report any

unethical behaviour, against victimization, sufficient measures have also been put in place. In exceptional cases, there is

also a provision for direct access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. All whistle blower complaints are investigated

and actions are initiated, where required.

No stakeholder complaints linked to adherence of the Code of Conduct were received in the reporting year.

Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and contribute to

sustainability throughout their life cycle

BHIL is a holding and investment company and is not involved in any manufacturing activity or services under the

purview of BRR.

Principle 3: Businesses should promote the well-being of all employees

As of 31 March 2021, BHIL had a total of 20 employees, which included 7 women employees. The Company did not have

any specially-abled employees or recognized employee association.

BHIL is aware that employees are an essential part of a company’s success. The Company aims to attract qualified

personnel and invests in their growth and development. BHIL regularly engages its employees and conducts various

learning and development programs. In order to gain wider exposure, employees are also provided opportunities to move

BHIL has various policies and procedures in place to prevent any kind of discrimination. The ‘Policy on Prevention of Sexual

Harassment at Workplace’ ensures the safety and security of its female employees. The Company did not receive any

complaint relating to child labour, forced labour, involuntary labour or sexual harassment in 2020-21 and none are pending

as of 31 March 2021.:

Managing Director & CEO of the Company, was the Chairman of CII, Western Region for the year 2019-20

The Company is active in putting forward its views on formulation of new industry standards and regulatory developments

pertaining to the non-banking finance sector. Furthermore, the Company strives to balance the interests of various

stakeholders while proposing any recommendations.

Principle 8: Businesses should support inclusive growth and equitable development

The vision and philosophy of late Shri Jamnalal Bajaj, the founder of Bajaj Group, guides the Corporate Social Responsibility

(CSR) activities of the Group. He embodied the concept of trusteeship in business and common good, and laid the

foundation for ethical, value-based and transparent functioning.

The Bajaj Group believes that measurement of growth and success lies beyond balance sheets and conventional economic

indices, rather it is best reflected in the difference that business and industry make in the lives of people. Thus, community

development forms the core of all CSR initiatives undertaken by Bajaj Group. These initiatives are designed, planned &

implemented in consultation with key stakeholders such as governments, NGOs, local communities along with other local

institutions to ensure community ownership and meet the needs of the target population.

As the economy of major developing countries, including India, has been severely impacted due to the COVID-19 related

restrictions, the brunt of adverse impacts has been borne by the economically weaker and migrant daily wage workers.

BHIL has contributed ` 800 lakh towards the fight against COVID-19 to support the weaker sections of the society. The

contributions made by BHIL to combat the pandemic during FY 2020-21 were utilised as follows::
