MATERIAL CHANGES AND COMMITMENTS

The sudden spread of ﬁrst wave of COVID-19 pandemic during February and March 2020 resulted into national

lockdown by Govt. of India to protect the population from the pandemic. Simultaneously, the Govt. and RBI

announced several measures, which included loan moratorium for borrowers across lenders. We had provided

moratorium to 100% borrowers during ﬁrst phase till May 31, 2020, and based on customers’ request thereafter

till August 31, 2020. Later, RBI also came up with resolution plan 1.0 with restructuring options for the businesses

impacted due to pandemic and accordingly the Company had supported borrowers through restructuring/

additional funding during Q3 and Q4 of FY2021. Now that COVID-19 second wave has again led to many states

announcing lockdown, we took a decision to safeguard our employees and customers through necessary

measures. RBI too extended the support by announcing resolution plan 2.0 for COVID impacted businesses by

way of restructuring, additional credit lines, deferred payment or moratorium etc. The Company is in the process

of extending such support to the customers.

The Company had strong liquidity position as on March 31, 2021, on the back of adequate funds mobilised

during the year and undrawn sanctions, comfortably covering the ﬁxed obligations during the months of April

to June 2021. The Company continued to secure conﬁdence from its lenders who were committed to provide

funds against the undrawn sanctions as on March 31, 2021. The Company has been maintaining a higher liquidity

position, in the range of 10%-15% during FY2021 compared to usual range of 5%-8%. The Company decided to

hold liquidity at higher levels till June and gradually revert to normalized levels after evaluating the improvement

in on-ground situation.

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if the counterparty to a financial instrument, whether a customer

or otherwise, fails to meet its contractual obligations towards the Company. Credit risk is the core business risk of the

Company. The Company therefore has high appetite for this risk but low tolerance and the governance structures

including the internal control systems are particularly designed to manage and mitigate this risk. The Company is

mainly exposed to credit risk from loans to customers (including loans transferred to SPVs under securitization

agreements, excluding loans sold under assignment presented as off-balance sheet assets).

The credit risk may arise due to, over borrowing by customers or over lending by other financial institutions

competitors, gaps in joint-liability collateral and repayment issues due to external factors such as political, community

influence, regulatory changes and natural disasters (storm, earthquakes, fires, floods) and intentional default by

customers.

DNBS.PD.NO.4906/03.10.038/2012-13 dated April 4, 2013 to Micro-finance Institutions Network (the “MFIN

format”) read with the FAQs issued by RBI on October 14, 2016 and RBI circulated dated March 13, 2020 on

implementation of Indian Accounting Standards.

2. Average loan outstanding determined for the purpose of calculating NIM is based on carrying value of loans

under Ind AS, excluding effect of following:

a. Fair value changes recognised through other comprehensive income;

b. Securitised loans qualifying for de-recognition as per RBI’s “true sale” criteria and related interest income

have not been considered for computation of “average interest charged” in accordance with the MFIN format.

Accordingly, the purchase consideration received towards such securitisations and related finance costs have

also not been considered for computation of “average effective cost of borrowings”.

c. Impairment allowance adjusted from the carrying value of loans in accordance with Ind AS 109;

d. Carrying value of loans classified as Stage III loans (i.e. erstwhile NPA classification) as per specific communication

from RBI.

3. Interest income considered for computation of “average interest charged” excludes loan processing fee

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if the counterparty to a financial instrument, whether a customer

or otherwise, fails to meet its contractual obligations towards the Group. Credit risk is the core business risk of

the Group. The Group therefore has high appetite for this risk but low tolerance and the governance structures

including the internal control systems are particularly designed to manage and mitigate this risk. The Group is mainly

exposed to credit risk from loans to customers (including loans transferred to SPVs under securitization agreements,

excluding loans sold under assignment presented as off-balance sheet assets).

The credit risk may arise due to, over borrowing by customers or over lending by other financial institutions

competitors, gaps in joint-liability collateral and repayment issues due to external factors such as political, community

influence, regulatory changes and natural disasters (storm, earthquakes, fires, floods) and intentional default by

customers.

To address credit risk, the Group has stringent credit policies for customer selection. To ensure the credit worthiness

of the customers, stringent underwriting policies such as credit investigation, both in-house and field credit verification,

is in place. In addition, the group follows a systematic methodology in the selection of new geographies where to

open branches considering factors such as the portfolio at risk and over indebtedness of the proposed area/region,

potential for micro-lending and socio-economic risk evaluation (e.g., the risk of local riots or natural disasters). Loan

sanction and rejections are carried out at the head office. A credit bureau rejections analysis is also regularly carried

out in group.

Credit risk is being managed by continuously monitoring the borrower’s performance if borrowers are paying on

time based on their amortization dues. The group ensures stringent monitoring and quality operations through

both field supervision (branch/area/region staff supervision, quality control team supervision) and management

review. Management at each Group’s head office closely monitors credit risk through system generated reports (e.g.,

PAR status and PAR movement, portfolio concentration analysis, vintage analysis, flow-rate analysis) and Key Risk

Indicators (KRIs) which include proactive actionable thresholds limits (acceptable, watch and breach) developed by

CRO, revised at the the MLRC and at the Risk Committee at the Board level.
