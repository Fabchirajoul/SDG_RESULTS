Dear Shareholders,

Fiscal 2020-21 was truly an extraordinary

year in history. The unprecedented health

crisis that still continues to unfold across

the country, brought the best out of us

as we made steady progress towards

our medium-term GPS objectives while

delivering on our ‘Dil Se Open’ promise to

our stakeholders.

Through the year, our support to

customers and communities in helping

them emerge from the COVID pandemic

remained unwavering. I am proud of

the commendable efforts and character

displayed by all the team members of

Axis family. I would also like to thank all

the COVID Warriors for the tremendous

job that they have been doing, especially

the healthcare professionals, who are

constantly fighting all odds to save

thousands of lives.

As the economy continues to combat the

second wave of unprecedented COVID-19

pandemic, we as a Bank reiterate our

commitment of being ‘Open’ to our

customers’ needs, concerns, challenges

and aspirations. My heart goes out to

all who have been directly impacted by

the pandemic. However, the fast pace

of vaccination and slowdown in new

infections in several states do provide hope.

I am confident that we can and will come

out of this together.

Employee Stock Purchase Scheme) Guidelines, 1999 / Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits)

Regulations, 2014, as amended. The objective of the said ESOS is to enhance employee motivation, enable employees to

participate, directly or indirectly, in the long-term growth and financial success of the Bank, to act as a retention mechanism by

enabling employee participation in the business of the Bank as its active stakeholder and to usher an ‘owner-manager’ culture and

to achieve greater synergy between the Bank and the subsidiary companies.

In terms of the ESOS, as on 31 March, 2021, up to 26,50,87,000 stock options are available for grant by the Bank to the eligible

Employees / Directors of the Bank and that of its subsidiary companies. The eligibility and number of stock options to be granted

to such eligible Employees / Directors is determined on the basis of the outcome of their performance evaluation and such other

criteria as may be approved by the NRC / Board, from time to time.

During the period from February 2001 to January 2019, the Shareholders of the Bank had approved the grant of stock options,

as aforesaid, on seven occasions. Under the first two ESOS of the Bank and in respect of the grant of stock options made by the

Bank up to 29 April, 2004, the option conversion price was set at the average of the daily high-low price of the Bank’s equity shares

traded during the 52 weeks preceding the date of approval of grant by the Board / NRC, prevailing on the Stock Exchange which

had the maximum trading volume of the Bank’s equity share during the said period. Thereafter, under the third and subsequent

ESOS of the Bank and in respect of the said grants made by the Bank on or after 10 June, 2005, the stock option conversion price

was changed to the latest available closing price of the equity shares of the Bank, prevailing on the Stock Exchange which recorded

higher trading volume, on the day prior to the date of approval of grant by the NRC.

Pursuant to the sub-division of the equity shares of the Bank, the Shareholders of the Bank at the 20th Annual General Meeting

held on 27 June, 2014, also approved the consequential adjustments to the stock options granted to the eligible Employees /

Directors, under the various ESOS of the Bank, such that all stock options available for grant (including lapsed and forfeited

options available for reissue) and those already granted but not vested and those vested but not exercised, as on the record date

fixed for the purpose of sub-division, were proportionately converted into options bearing equity shares of the face value of

` 2/- each of the Bank and the grant price of all the outstanding stock options (unvested, vested and unexercised) as on the said

record date for the purpose of sub-division were proportionately adjusted by dividing the existing grant price by 5. The record

date for the said sub-division was 30 July, 2014.

Since 24 February, 2001 up to 31 March, 2021, the NRC / Board had out of the said 26,50,87,000 stock options, approved the

grant of 29,47,96,853 stock options (including 3,04,10,573 stock options which had lapsed and were forfeited) to the eligible

Employees / Directors, in terms of the various ESOS of the Bank. The said stock options are non-transferable and vest at rates of

30%, 30% and 40% on each of three successive anniversaries following the date of respective grant, subject to standard vesting

and other conditions as set out in the respective ESOS of the Bank. The said stock options are required to be exercised by the

concerned eligible Employees / Directors, within a period of five years, from the date of its respective vesting, in terms of the

respective ESOS of the Bank.

As of 31 March, 2021, out of the said 29,47,96,853 stock options so granted, 23,75,38,932 stock options have been vested, out of

which 21,24,76,626 stock options have been exercised and the balance 2,50,62,306 stock options remain unexercised. Further,

2,68,47,348 stock options remained unvested and 3,04,10,573 stock options had been treated as lapsed and forfeited.
