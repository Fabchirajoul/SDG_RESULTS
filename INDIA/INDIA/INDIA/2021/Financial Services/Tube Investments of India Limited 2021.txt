Item no.8

As per Section 197 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”), the Company can pay a remuneration to its Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) in the

form of Commission on profits up to 1% of the net profits calculated in accordance with Section 198 of the Act. This is in addition to payment

of Sitting Fees for attending meetings of the Board/Board Committees.

Remunerating the NEDs by way of Commission not exceeding 1% of the net profits of the Company for a period of 5 years from FYs 2016-17

to 2020-21 has been approved by the Shareholders of the Company at their Extraordinary General Meeting held on 29th May 2017.

The Company’s policy on remuneration provides for the Commission to be distributed based on the attendance and contribution of the NEDs

at the Board and certain Committee meetings as well as the time spent on operational matters other than at the meetings.

In view of the considerable time and efforts put in by Mr. M M Murugappan, former Chairman (non-executive, promoter) on pro rata basis

till the end of his period of office towards the affairs of the Company during FY 2020-21, on the recommendations of the Nomination and

Remuneration Committee, the Board has proposed that a higher remuneration by way of Commission be paid to him.

actively guiding and nurturing the Company with business interests spanning multiple product segments, most of which have emerged to be:

Managing Director(s)/Manager of the Company, be paid, for each of the five financial years commencing from the

1st day April 2021 up to the financial year ending on the 31st March 2026, a remuneration not exceeding one per cent per annum of the net

profits of the Company computed in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the applicable Rules thereunder, if any.

This remuneration will be distributed amongst all or some of the Directors in accordance with the directions given by the Board of Directors

and subject to any other applicable requirements under the Act and its Rules. This remuneration will be in addition to the fee payable to the

Directors for attending the meetings of the Board/the Committees thereof or for any other purpose whatsoever, as may be decided by the

Board and the reimbursements of expenses for participating in the Board and other meetings. It may be noted in this regard that although the

shareholders approval is sought for the payment of a commission up to one per cent of net profits of the Company for each year, the actual

commission paid to the Directors per annum is subjected to a review by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Board and is

normally restricted to a fixed sum, which is well below the statutory limit. Presently, the commission paid to the Non-Executive Directors is

subject to a maximum of `10 Lakhs per annum per Director.

Accordingly, approval of the Members is sought by way of a Special Resolution under the applicable provisions of the Act and the Rules

thereunder for the payment of remuneration, by way of Commission, to the Directors of the Company (including alternate Directors), who

Dear Shareholders,

I trust your family and you are

keeping well amid this unprecedented

pandemic. The year 2020 was the most

challenging year in the history of our

Company. As the country was reeling

under a severe pandemic due to the

outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus

(COVID-19) at the end of March

2020, the nation was facing the twin

challenges of not just safeguarding

the health of the people but also to

scale up the medical infrastructure to

treat millions of people affected by this

deadly virus.

At TII, as we navigated the turbulent

market and the pandemic induced

disruption, we serviced our customers

despite the challenges, pledged our

support to our channel partners

and vendors and ensured that our

employees and their families were

safe and healthy. We served the

neighboring

communities

through

various initiatives providing food

and succor to the needy, arranging

vaccination camps and quarantine

centers, lending our support to the

Government through contributions to

the ‘Prime Minister’s CARES Fund’ and

the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s Relief

Fund as well as extending support to

hospitals and voluntary organizations

engaged in frontline work. We stayed

true to our vision by creating value

for all our stakeholders, while being

anchored to our collective commitment

to society as a responsible business

organization.

TII was one of the first few companies

during the early phase of the outbreak

in the year 2020 to cover all its

employees including contract and

temporary employees under a special

COVID Insurance Scheme to meet

any medical requirements on account

of COVID. We set up a quarantine

centre within our premises to treat

asymptomatic employees and their

family members who were affected

by COVID. This isolation facility with

around 66 beds provided round-the-

clock medical support, with the help of

a doctor and paramedical staff. During

2020-21, about 107 patients were

treated in this facility.

Global Economy

2020 will long be remembered

for the global pandemic and the

unprecedented scale of disruption,

which impacted people and economies

across

the

world.

The

sharp

contraction in manufacturing and trade

plunged global economic growth to

(-) 3.3 percent in 2020. Fortunately,

GDP rebounded to a sharp V-shaped

recovery in the second half of 2020,

with a higher than expected growth

across both advanced and emerging

market economies. According to the

IMF, the global economy is projected

to grow to 3.3 percent over the medium

term before touching 6 percent in

2021. Thereafter, growth is projected

to moderate at 4.4 percent in 2022.

Indian Economy

The Indian economy plunged to

(-) 8 percent in 2020 with growth

deceleration

which

started

the

previous year further escalated by the

lockdown disrupting operations and

paralysing businesses across sectors.

Signs of a revival were evident in

the second quarter of the year, with

manufacturing activity gaining pace,

driven by pent-up market demand

and supportive Government policies to

resurrect the economy.

Chairman’s

Message:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to share with you the performance

of your Company for the year 2020-21. It has been a

watershed year in more ways than one. It was a year when

the pandemic crisis pushed the world into turmoil and the

economy into a near shutdown. It was a year that challenged

the strongest and brought about a tectonic shift in the way

people and businesses operated, changing familiar zones and

force-leading humanity to a new landscape, a new normal.

At TII, though it was a difficult year for the Company, we drew

on our reserves of resilience to emerge stronger, to record

one of our best Balance Sheets ever. It was a year when our

strategies for inorganic growth culminated in the acquisition of

CG Power and Industrial Solutions Limited and organic growth

crystallised into new adjacencies, in emerging technologies,

in each of our verticals. It was a year when our businesses

proved their resilient strength to forge ahead and embarked

on the journey to redefine the future.

Our Growth Strategy

We have articulated a clear growth path with our 3 engine

model of growth i.e. TI-1 comprising our core, an organic

business which we are in at present, building it as a sustainable

growth engine and free cash flow generator, TI-2 which

would include our new step-outs and frontier businesses

such as optic lens, EV three-wheelers, etc., and TI-3 which

would focus on inorganic growth through acquisitions without

stressing the balance sheet.

Performance -TII

One of the advantages of a volatile business environment is a

strong Balance Sheet. Our biggest growth drivers of the year

were the efficiency initiatives and the four-cardinal metrics

of Revenue Growth, Profitability, Return on Invested Capital

and Free Cash Flow that we have been working on for the

past few years where we have achieved reasonable success

despite the COVID-19 lockdown situation which is reflected

in our quarter on quarter performance.

Report together with the audited financial statements of

Business Environment

Outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020

and the sharp resurgence of the pandemic again

in the recent months of 2021, even as the situation

appeared to be kept under good control, in the form

of a more serious and devastating second wave,

have come to pose an unprecedented global crisis,

of a scale never witnessed before in the annals of

the history of mankind. Measures to contain rapid

spread of the pandemic through the imposition of

lockdowns/lockdown like restrictions, while helping

in stemming the spread of the pandemic to a large

extent, have, at the same time, applied brakes

on economic activity with serious implications to

consumption and investment. The impact is well

evident as India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

contracted by 7.3%, in 2020-21 as per the provisional

National Income estimates released by the National

Statistical Office recently. The Gross Value Added

(GVA) in the economy shrank 6.2% in 2020-21

compared to an increase of 4.1% in the previous year.

While this is the bleakest performance on record for

the economy, the fourth quarter of 2020-21 helped in

repairing the damage, with a higher than expected

growth of 1.6% in the GDP. This marked the second

quarter of positive growth after the country entered

a technical recession in the first half of the year.

With a lower contraction in the GDP as well GVA in

2020-21, the sharp recovery projected for 2021-22

for the Indian economy by a number of agencies like

the International Monetary Fund, at 12.5% and the

Reserve Bank of India, at 10.5% may appear difficult

at this point as the scourge of the Novel Coronavirus

has returned to hurt and blunt economic activity

once again.

Although the global economic output is recovering

from the collapse triggered by the COVID-19

pandemic, it appears that it will remain below pre-

pandemic trends for a prolonged period of time. The

pandemic has exacerbated the risks associated with

a decade-long wave of global debt accumulation. As

per the World Economic Update issued by the World

Bank, although the recent vaccine approvals have

given rise to hopes of a turnaround in the pandemic

situation later this year, renewed waves and new

variants of the Coronavirus pose concerns for the

outlook. Amid exceptional uncertainty, the global

economy is projected to grow 5.5% in 2021 and 4.2%

in 2022.

For the Indian automotive industry, which accounts

for nearly half of the manufacturing GDP of the

country, the year 2020-21 was an exceptional one

for the wrong reasons. The industry was replete with

and staring at a series of problems, one bigger than

the other, that affected production, productivity and

sales. Even as the year started in the backdrop of a

very long slowdown still looming large, the industry

was a witness to a further list of bigger problems

like economic uncertainty, transition to BS-VI, the

pandemic and the resultant lockdown, constraints in

supply chain and the migration of labour.

As

per

the

Society

of

Indian

Automobile

Manufacturers (SIAM), the apex automobile body in

the country, all segments of the Indian auto sector

witnessed a de-growth in sales during 2020-21 with

passenger vehicles (PVs) witnessing a CAGR of

-6.2%, commercial vehicles (CVs) at -12.8%, three

wheelers (3Ws) at -30.2% and two-wheelers (2Ws)

at -9.2%.

As the country is still trying its best to navigate

through this unparalleled crisis, the Government and

the Reserve Bank of India are taking well calibrated

measures to support a robust economic recovery.

The Union Budget 2021 was one good example of the

initiatives of the Government in focusing on regaining

the growth momentum in the economy through

several measures including keeping the tax rates

stable and enhancing investments in infrastructure.

In November, 2019, CGPISL has rescinded the Royalty Agreement with AHL. Consequently, CGPISL does not have

liability towards payment of brand royalty. AHL, while directing CGPISL to discontinue the usage of Avantha brand, has

contested the rescinding of the Royalty Agreement. AHL has also issued notice invoking arbitration under the brand

royalty agreement, which was rejected by CGPISL. AHL has further filed an arbitration petition before Delhi High Court

and is reserved for orders.

d.

CGPISL had received notice of demand under Income Tax Act for `606.30 Crores for financial year 2016-17, and

the Hon’ble Bombay High Court has granted the interim stay against the notice of demand until admission of appeal

before the High Court. CGPISL, also received a notice from National Faceless Assessment Center requiring it to file

its submission in respect of the appeal filed before Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), and CGPISL has filed the

submissions, as directed. Considering the facts and underlying documents with respect to the demand raised under

section 68 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, the management strongly believes that the demand is not sustainable, bad in

law and will be reversed at appellate levels.

e.

CG Power Solutions Limited (CGPSOL) had received assessment order u/s 143(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for

for levy of penalty. On February 5, 2021, CGPSOL appointed the Directors and filed an appeal before Commissioner

of Income Tax (Appeals) on February 15, 2021 against the additions made by the AO along with a request: letter to

condone the delay in filing the appeal.

f.

A customer of a wholly owned step-down subsidiary of CGPISL in relation to non-performance of a contract for supply

of transformer by the subsidiary had claimed in the court in Ontario, Canada damages of CAD 11.85 million from the

subsidiary, its parent CG International BV (CGIBV) and CGPISL. On 4th February 2021, the customer subsequently asked
