228 Notice of the AGM:

Dear Shareholders,

The year 2020 belonged to active listeners, better observers,

and fast learners. Today, as i write this: letter to you, i am

thinking of how far and fast the world has changed within

the last twelve months. We have experienced profound

changes starting from better awareness towards health,

discovering the power of flexibility in businesses, to rapid

digitalisation, and growing interest towards sourcing

alternative energy options. A lot we see around today was

barely there a year back and yet, we have all seamlessly

become a part of ‘this new normal.’

Amidst this, our team’s undying hard work, unwavering

commitment and strong resolution to smoothly transition

into ‘this world’ have helped support our customers and

other stakeholders. Each one of them deserves our deepest

gratitude and sincerest appreciation.

As the nation continues fighting a pandemic, the spotlight

is drawn on the shock absorbers of our economy – our

respected government and esteemed regulatory bodies,

banks, nBFCs and other supporting financial service

intermediaries. i have extreme gratitude for these financial

warriors responsible for keeping our engines up and running.

Together, we will win and emerge stronger from this crisis.

From a business standpoint, the pandemic definitely created

headwinds. But like i mentioned earlier, active listeners and

better observers who focussed on lessons learned, adapted

swiftly to this new normal. Your Company, backed by

prudence, proactiveness and preparedness, waded through

the tide of every quarter to ensure business continuity and

continued to build on strengths.

Macro-economic Headwinds

The economy witnessed sharp degrowth owing to lockdowns

with restrictions on travel and trade dampening business

sentiment. As commerce started slowing down, the indian

government promptly took measures, to announce fiscal and

monetary policies to limit economic disruption. in the second

half of the year, gradual un-locks and phased resumption of

business across sectors boosted confidence. However, the

second wave of CoVid-19 once again pulled brakes on the

otherwise improving economic scenario.

Building on Strengths

despite the challenging operating environment, your

Company focused on building strengths and concentrated on

getting the basics right during the year.

Business: We continued being one of the leading financers

in our focused Rural and infrastructure Finance businesses.

our digital and data analytics capabilities allowed us to

identify the right sales point leading to strengthening of

market share for Farm and Two-Wheeler financing. in the

Micro loans business, we largely focussed on collections for

most part of the year and only in Q4FY21, did we cautiously

start underwriting new customers. in our Housing Finance

business, we mostly focussed on existing real estate projects

and restricted disbursement for lAP. under infrastructure

Finance, we continued to maintain our sell down abilities and

concentrating on projects with strong sponsors. our Mutual

Fund business, saw an increase in Assets under Management

this year owing to our consistent focus on building a high-

quality portfolio.

Collection: Being in the lending business, collections play a

crucial role in establishing business stability. our continuous

on-field efforts, rebalancing the sales and collection teams

within products, coupled with analytics-led prioritisation and

resource allocation, led to improved collections across all our

businesses. The collection efficiencies reached pre-Covid levels

and surpassed FY20 collections by ~20%.

ALM and Liquidity: The objective of our liability franchise

has always been to raise funds in a timely manner and ensure

sufficient liquidity. during the year, your Company proactively

built its liquidity buffers as a cover against unforeseen

disruptions resulting out of moratorium and tight funding

scenarios. With easing of liquidity from Q3FY21 onwards,

your Company was able to reduce cost of borrowing.

Asset Quality and Provisioning: Your Company maintained

sharp focus on asset quality backed by a strong collection

performance, strengthened the balance sheet and built a

strong risk management framework. despite the pandemic,

we have had the lowest ever nS3 and a good level of PCR.

We also created additional cushion and reserves through

macro prudential provisions and additional overlays on

standard assets.

Balance Sheet: Your Company raised additional capital

through a successful rights issue during the year which was

oversubscribed by ~15%. This helped in strengthening the

balance sheet and enabling your Company to pursue long

term growth opportunities. Besides, we maintained a strong

capital adequacy and lowered our debt-to-equity ratio.

in summary, your Company’s agility, preparedness and solid

financial strength will help counter future uncertainties.

Future Trends

The short-term scenario appears vulnerable considering the

prevailing situation owing to the second wave. Furthermore,

ongoing concerns around a potential third CoVid-19 wave,

its impact on business, especially rural, as well as on our

society and the economy is yet to be calibrated. However,

with the country’s rollout of vaccination and improving public

awareness, i do hope there will be a rebound in H2FY22. Your

Company’s preparedness is aimed at agilely navigating the

future trends of our businesses in order to propel growth over

the medium to long term.

Digital & Data Analytics

in these uncertain times, digital and data Analytics will

continue to radically change the way business is conducted.

Right from intuitive customer experience to robust risk

management framework, giving early warning signals

and driving business efficiencies, and more will undergo

transformation. We believe digital and data Analytics being

‘Core’ in our ‘Right to Win’ framework, right from the start, has

positioned us well ahead of the curve in navigating the Covid

related crisis. Your Company will continue to leverage digital

and data intelligence to drive Scale, Cost Effectiveness and

Customer Experience across businesses.

Commitment to ESG

We believe sustainability is the nucleus of comprehensive

growth, and addressing its issues is your Company’s topmost

priority. For us, sustainability is a dynamic process of

meeting the needs of our employees and our society with a

compassionate mindset and responsible approach. To this end,

your Company’s Corporate Social Responsibility Committee’s

remit extends to ESg initiatives as well.

Your Company’s Covid Care support for employees was

immediate. in addition to safety kits and vaccination cost

reimbursement, we were amongst the first to announce ex-

gratia and two-year salary payment, as well as education and

vocational training support for families of deceased employees.

our long-standing commitment is to create value for society

through our initiatives, and investments.

E: our environment stewardship is reflected through our

investments in renewables. We believe we are rightly positioned

to empower india’s journey to net Zero.

S: our social endeavours are reflected through our Rural

Finance business. our products and services facilitate financial

inclusion for our customers through strong linkages in the Rural

sector, especially in unserved and underserved communities.

Besides, our community initiatives are further highlighted

through our flagship program ‘digital Sakhi,’ which promotes

women empowerment and nurtures an ecosystem of digital

financial transactions.

G: on the governance front, your Company has a diverse

and independent board. it keeps a constant track of the

management’s operation of the business and effective handling

of all the governance issues. You Company already has

separate offices of the

which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as

at March 31, 2021, and the Consolidated Statement

of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive

Income), the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity

for the year then ended, and a summary of significant

accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and

according to the explanations given to us and based on

the consideration of reports of the other auditors on

separate financial statements of the subsidiaries referred

to in the Other Matter section below, the aforesaid

consolidated financial statements give the information

required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in

the manner so required and give a true and fair view

in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards

prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015,

as amended (‘Ind AS’) and other accounting principles

generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state

of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2021, and

their consolidated profit, their consolidated total

comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows

and their consolidated changes in equity for the year

ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial

statements in accordance with the Standards on

Auditing specified under section 143 (10) of the Act

(SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are

further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the

Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section

of our report. We are independent of the Group

in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by

the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI)

together with the ethical requirements that are relevant

to our audit of the consolidated financial statements

under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made

thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical

responsibilities in accordance with these requirements

and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit

evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained

by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred

to in the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and

appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on

the consolidated financial statements.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to Note 54 of the Consolidated

Financial Statements, in which the Group describes the

continuing uncertainties arising from the COVID 19

pandemic.

Our report is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our

professional judgment, were of most significance in

our audit of the consolidated financial statements of

the current period. These matters were addressed in

the context of our audit of the consolidated financial

statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion

thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion

on these matters. We have determined the matters

described below to be the key audit matters to be

communicated in our report.:

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2021

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1.1 Statement of compliance:

The Consolidated financial statements of L&T

Finance Holdings Limited (the “Company”)

and its subsidiaries and associates (together the

“Group”) have been prepared in accordance

with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013

and the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)

notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to

time) issued by Ministry of Corporate Affairs in

exercise of the powers conferred by section 133

of the Companies Act, 2013. In addition, the

applicable regulations of Reserve Bank of Indi (RBI)

/National Housing Bank (NHB) and the guidance

notes/announcements issued by the Institute of

Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) are also

applied.

1.2 Basis of preparation:

The consolidated financial statements have

been prepared on the historical cost basis except

for certain financial instruments that are measured

at fair values at the end of each reporting period.

Fair value measurements under Ind AS are

categorized into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the

degree to which the inputs to the fair value

measurements are observable and the significance

of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its

entirety, which are described as follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in

active markets for identical assets or liabilities

that the Group can access at reporting date.

•

Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted

prices included within level 1, that are

observable for the asset or liability, either

directly or indirectly.

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the

valuation of assets or liabilities

1.3 Presentation of financial statements:

The Balance Sheet, Statement of changes in

Equity for the year, and the Statement of Profit

and Loss are prepared and presented in the format

prescribed in the Division III of Schedule III to the

Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) applicable for

Non-Banking Finance Companies (“NBFC”). The

Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared

and presented as per the requirements of Ind

AS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”. The disclosure

requirements with respect to items in the

Balance Sheet and Statement of Profit and Loss,

as prescribed in the Division III of Schedule III to

the Act, are presented by way of notes forming

part of the financial statements along with the

other notes required to be disclosed under the

notified accounting Standards and the SEBI

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)

Regulations, 2015.

Amounts

in

the

financial

statements

are

presented in Indian Rupees in Crore rounded off

to two decimal places as permitted by Division

III of Schedule III to the Act. Per share data are

presented in Indian Rupee to two decimal places.

1.4 Basis of consolidation:

a) The

consolidated

financial

statements

incorporate the financial statements of the

Parent Company and its subsidiaries. For

this purpose, an entity which is, directly or

indirectly, controlled by the Parent Company

is treated as subsidiary. The Parent Company

together with its subsidiaries constitute the

Group. Control is achieved when the Group,

directly or indirectly:

•

has power over the investee.

•

is exposed, or has rights, to variable

returns from its involvement with the

investee; and

•

has the ability to use its power to affect

its returns.

b) The Group reassesses whether or not it

controls an investee if facts and circumstances

indicate that there are changes to one or more

of the three elements of control listed above.

c) Profit or loss and each component of other

comprehensive income are attributed to

the owners of the Parent Company and

to the non-controlling interests (NCI) and

have been shown separately in the financial

statements. Total comprehensive income of

the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners

of the Parent Company and to the non-

controlling interests even if this results in

the non-controlling interests having a deficit

balance.

d) Where necessary, adjustments are made to

the financial statements of subsidiaries to

bring their accounting policies into line with

the Group’s accounting policies. The financial

statements of all entities used for the purpose

of consolidation are drawn up to same

reporting date as that of the Parent Company.

e) All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity,

income, expenses, unrealised profits/losses:

Managing Director of the Company together constitute the Chief Operating

Decision Makers (“CODM”) which allocate resources to and assess the performance of the segments of the

Company.

The Group has identified business segments as its primary segment and geographic segments as its secondary

segment. Business segments are primarily Rural, Housing, Infrastructure, Defocused and Other businesses.

Revenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under each reportable segment. Expenses

which are not directly attributable to each reportable segment have been allocated on the basis of associated

revenue of the segment and manpower efforts. All other expenses which are not attributable or allocable

to segments have been disclosed as others. Assets and liabilities that are directly attributable or allocable to

segments are disclosed under each reportable segment, Tax assets and liabilites are disclosed as Unallocated

and all other assets and liabilities are disclosed as others. The composition of the reportable segments is as

follows:

(i) Rural finance comprises of farm equipment finance, two wheeler finance, micro loans and consumer

finance.

(ii) Housing finance comprises of home loans, loan against property and real estate finance.

(iii) Infrastructure finance comprises of infrastructure business.

(iv) Defocused Business comprises of structured corporate loans, debt capital market, commercial vehicle

finance, construction equipment finance, SME term loans and leases.

(v) Others comprises of asset management, wealth management etc.

(vi) Unallocated represents tax assets and tax liabilities.
