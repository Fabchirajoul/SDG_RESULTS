Dear Shareholders,

The financial year gone by will go

down as one of the most unusual and

challenging years in living memory.

The world experienced unprecedented setbacks due to

COVID-19, which resulted in the global economy witnessing

one of the worst contractions since World War II. The Indian

economy too contracted by 7.3% in FY 20-21 – an event seen

only for the second time since Independence and the first since

the economic liberalisation in 1991.

As expectations of a sharp recovery started gaining ground,

India bore the brunt of the second wave from March 2021.

With localised lockdowns and varying degrees of restrictions

imposed by state and local governments, the recovery remains

fragile and prospects of any sharper uptick remain largely

reliant on the pace of vaccination. Inoculating a population as

vast as India’s is no doubt a mammoth task, but it is the only

way to overcome the crisis.

Since the outbreak, the RBI has taken several steps to reduce

the financial stress on the economy by lowering interest rates,

The outlook on the mutual fund industry

remains positive, given the growth

potential and under penetration of mutual

funds in the country.

Evaluation of the Board and Directors

During the year, the Board carried out an annual evaluation

of its own performance and that of Board committees

and Directors pursuant to the provisions of the Act and

Listing Regulations. Based on the recommendation of the

Nomination & Remuneration Committee, the Board laid

down the criteria for evaluation. This exercise was carried

out through an online module consisting of questionnaires

prepared separately for the Board, Committees, Chairman and

individual Directors. The evaluation process was completed

by the Company which evaluated the Board as a whole i.e.

its structure, diversity, experience, functioning, Board

members’ understanding of their roles and responsibilities,

quality of decision making of the Board and its effectiveness.

Additionally, the performance evaluation of individual

Directors, including the Chairman was based on the

parameters such as meeting attendance, participation and

contribution at the meeting. The said criteria are broadly

based on the Guidance Note on Board evaluation issued by

the Securities and Exchange Board of India on January 5, 2017.

All the Directors participated in the Board evaluation and

review exercise including peer evaluations excluding the

Director being evaluated. Since Mr. Rushad Abadan and

Mr. Navneet Munot were recently inducted on the Board, they

did not participate in the evaluation exercise. The Directors

who have completed their term or resigned have also not

participated in the evaluation questionnaire. The Chairman’s

performance evaluation was carried out by Independent

Directors at a separate meeting.

At separate meetings of the Nomination & Remuneration

Committee, Independent Directors meeting and Board

meeting, responses of the Board evaluation questionnaire

were reviewed, discussed and the suggestions provided

by the Directors were noted. The Management of the AMC

was advised to implement one of the recommendations on

detailed strategy planning for business of the Company.

It also expressed its satisfaction with the evaluation results

and the overall engagement and effectiveness of the Board

and its various Committees.

Stakeholders Relationship Committee

During FY 20-21, four Stakeholders Relationship Committee

meetings were held on May 9, 2020; July 23, 2020; October 22,
