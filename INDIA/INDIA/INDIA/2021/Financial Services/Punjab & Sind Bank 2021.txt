Dear stakeholders, I place before you the highlights of your Bank’s performance for the FY 2020-

2021, details of which have been given in the Annual Report.

Punjab & Sind Bank, set-up in 1908, was founded with the vision and principle of social commitment

to help and uplift the weakest and raise their standard of living. Today, the Bank, with Pan India

presence through 1531 branches, proudly carries the legacy and is contributing in development of

the society and nation. Our tagline Where service is a way of life is woven to the core of our fabric

and inculcated in each and every PSBian.

The year 2020-21 has posed many challenges globally, predominantly by COVID 19. It has challenged the social and economic

fabric globally. Indian economy, though was in negative trajectory for first two quarters, showed its resilience and rebounded with

positive growth in the third quarter itself, registering a ‘V’ shape recovery.

To support the economy, social and health infrastructure of the country, the Government took various initiatives, which acted as a

sanjeevni and revived the economy at a much faster pace as compared to various other western economies.

The pandemic has brought a paradigm shift in the way businesses are transacted and given a new buzzword new normal.

Key performance of the Bank

During the year, the business of the Bank grew by 7.68% on YoY basis. Deposits grew by 7.18% and Advances by 8.39%. The thrust

on CASA deposits bore its results and it grew by 18.90% on YoY basis. The bank’s reemphasis on RAM Segment advances (Retail,

Agriculture and MSME) also gave good results thereby achieving growth of 12.25 % in Retail, 15.47% in Agriculture (Excluding

RIDF) and 7.07% in MSME Advances (Excluding RIDF & including PSLC of Rs. 2130 Crore), respectively.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

During the financial year 2020-21, the cost of deposits improved by 98 basis points, which was more than the decrease of 76 basis

points in yield on advances. Consequently, the Net Interest Income (NII) has improved by Rs.204 crore and Net Interest Margin

(NIM) has improved by 23 basis points from 1.88% (2019-20) to 2.11% (2020-21).

Operating Profit of the Bank has decreased to Rs.771 crore during 2020-21 as compared to Rs.1097 crore during 2019-20 mainly

due to providing one time expenditure of Rs.369 Crore towards provision for terminal benefits as per revised actuarial projection

on account of latest mortality rate IALM 2012-14. The Bank reported a Net Loss of Rs.2733 crore for 2020-21 on account of higher

provisions. After posting net loss consecutively for eight quarters, the Bank registered a Net Profit of Rs. 161 crore for the quarter

ended March 2021

PRIORITY SECTOR AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION

During 2020-21, the Bank has credibly achieved the following mandated targets:

 41.36 % of the Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) against 40% norm in Priority Sector

 9.62 % of the ANBC against 8% to Small and Marginal Farmers

 8.12 % of the ANBC against 7.50 % mandated target to Micro Enterprises

Letter

DOS.ARG.No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020 (as amended) (the “RBI communication”)

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Punjab & Sind Bank (“the Bank”) as of March 31,2021

in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date which includes

internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Bank’s branches.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control

over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the

Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants

of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that

were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Bank’s policies,

the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting

records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Banking Regulation Act,1949 and the

circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We

conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the

“Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued

by the ICAI, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that

we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate

internal financial controls over financial reporting were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all

material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over

financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included

obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness

exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal financial controls based on the assessed risk.

The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the

financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors, in terms of their

reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on

the Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures

that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions

of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of

financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank

are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable

assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank’s assets that could

have a material effect on the financial statements.:

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the Bank’s result will depend on future development which are

highly uncertain including among other things the severity of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and action to

contain its spread or mitigate impact including further stimulus and regulatory packages, if any. While there has been an

improvement in the economic activity since the easing of the lockdown measures, in the opinion of management, there

would not be significant impact on bank’s financials.

during the moratorium period.

29, 2020, the bank has permitted moratorium of three months on all term loan installments falling due between March

1, 2020 and May 31, 2020, deferred the recovery of interest on working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash
