Dear Shareholders,

Well into the second year as Chairman of the Board of

a redefined YES BANK, I thank you for your invaluable

support to the Bank’s journey of transformation. Over

the past year, the Bank has accomplished one of

the most significant balancing acts in Indian banking

history – successfully forging the transformation from

a very precarious situation in March 2020, into an

organization truly motivated and ready to deliver value

to all its stakeholders. This extraordinary journey of

completely reinventing the Bank, was done in parallel

to the continuance of unusual circumstances and

unknown risks induced by COVID-19, which has left no

portion of our shared existence unaffected.

The transformation journey

The Bank in its transformational journey has made

significant changes – bringing in clear responsibility

and accountability at multiple levels across the

organization. Having committed to responsible

banking and social engagement last year, your Bank

has, as promised dealt with all legacy governance,

compliance and risk issues with dexterity and alacrity.

In addition, the Bank has focused on building and

reinforcing the foundation for high quality sustainable

growth. It has successfully delivered a very robust

liabilities momentum with 55% growth in deposits over

previous year. This reflects very encouraging customer

confidence across all segments.

Sunil Mehta

Chairman

Over the last year, the Bank focused on creating

a more granular franchise with balanced earnings

mix between wholesale and retail, monetized

new businesses through digital innovation – while

conforming to the highest standards of risk

management, compliance and governance. I am

delighted to share that in FY21, the Bank recorded 9.06

billion UPI transactions, a 102% growth over previous

year, thereby positioning the Bank as a clear market

leader in the banking industry.

I especially feel proud of each and every YES BANKer,

who stepped up, putting in their best through these

very difficult times, to help the Bank cross various key

milestones of success. At this critical hour, with the

Black Swan event of COVID-19 extending into 2021,

I express my unreserved regard and gratitude, for

the immeasurable contribution of essential service

providers and many other nameless heroes who are

working tirelessly for the collective well-being of the

nation.

With unflagging commitment, YES BANK has also

paved its way through this daunting situation, steadily

and surely. After a historic Reconstruction Scheme

executed in March 2020 by the Reserve Bank of India

(RBI) and a consortium of investing banks, YES BANK

undertook a systemic overhaul, putting in place a

significantly more robust corporate governance model

with extensive changes across organization, processes

The Bank has

brought in clear

responsibility and

accountability at

multiple levels across

the organization. It has

successfully delivered

a robust liabilities

momentum with 55%

growth in deposits

over the previous

year. This encouraging

development reflects

growing customer

confidence across all

segments.

gradually trying to mend its balance sheet problems with

respect to the NPAs. The consequences of COVID-19 set

back this process. The RBI sought to ease the burden by

announcing moratorium for borrowers and standstill on

asset classification by the banks.

As the ‘unlock’ process started, amid optimism fueled by

festive demand, GDP growth in Q3 FY21 bounced into

a positive zone and recorded +0.4%. Official estimates

highlighted an 8% contraction of the economy for FY21

while looking forward to a 10.5% growth in FY22. These

expectations now face a risk as the country is engulfed

by a second wave of infections.

Challenges abound. But there is hope now as the

vaccination drive is expected to get back on track

as supplies stabilize with increased production. The

Union Budget for FY22 has continued with the reforms

process by announcing the setting up of a Development

Financial Institution and creation of a National Asset

Reconstruction Company, along with a sharp increase

in the allocation for the healthcare sector. As the

second wave of infections begins to ebb, it remains our

collective responsibility to follow COVID-19 appropriate

behavior and avert a third wave. Once this is managed,

the reform measures of the government alongside easy

financial market conditions should push India towards a

sustained higher growth path during the year.

Continuing our

transformational journey

Incidentally, COVID-19 has been the unexpected

backdrop of YES BANK’s institutional transformation

which began in March 2020. The Bank, steered by a

new leadership and a reconstituted Board of Directors,

set upon a forward-looking journey of positive

change, guided by the principles of transparency

and accountability. Over the past year, we laid the

foundation for accelerated growth while maintaining a

strong focus on corporate governance. Even as we tide

over the challenges of COVID-19, we continue to work

towards creating a robust, resilient and future-ready

franchise, creating value for all our stakeholders.

In line with the strategic objectives set out at the

start of FY21, the Bank has been able to demonstrate

significant progress across all parameters:

Growth of deposit franchise by 55% to

approximately INR 1.63 lakh crore with CASA ratio

at 26%

Strong growth in Retail and MSME advances which

now account for 51% of total advances – a first for

the Bank and up 700 bps YoY

Successfully raised INR 15,000 crore of capital via

an FPO in July, 2020 to recapitalise the Bank

Healthy operating profits growth of 42% YoY to INR

4,977 crore on back of increase in NII and reduction

in operating expenses by 14 per cent

Strong track record of recovering INR 4,933 crore

by the dedicated Stressed Asset Management team

despite COVID-19 related disruptions and incidental

process delays

Significantly stronger and robust governance model

with changes across organization, processes and

business strategy

Lastly, in FY21, the Bank prudently absorbed

COVID-19 related impact by stepping up the bad

loan buffers. Despite such accelerated provisioning,

the Bank’s CET1 remains healthy at 11.2 per cent and

CRAR at 17.5 per cent

Customers at the heart of all we do

Amid restrictions on mobility of goods and people,

we reinforced our resolve to put the customer at the

center of all our activities. In an environment of physical

distancing, the Bank established an unbroken link

with customers via proactive communication to retain

and reinforce trust. Not only were we able to scale

up our digital infrastructure across touchpoints,

but we also made innovations that allowed people

17.5%

CRAR healthy capital buffers and

CET1 at 11.2%

easy and continued access to finance through

this time. We rolled out personalized products and

solutions tailor-made to satisfy a range of banking

needs. Solutions such as AI-backed customer support,

contactless transactions, easy digital loans, startup

funding and other online innovations allowed continuity

and convenience to both micro, small and medium

enterprises (MSMEs) and individual customers across

segments. By building platforms to connect businesses

with prospective customers, we also helped create a

digital space where our customers could conduct and

grow their businesses securely.
