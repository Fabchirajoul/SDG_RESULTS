Dear Stakeholders,

It gives me immense delight and

satisfaction to share with you the

performance of our organization during

the past financial year despite facing

myriad challenges posed by the COVID-19

immense respect and gratitude to all

the frontline warriors and others who

selflessly fought the daunting challenges

posed by the pandemic to save and

protect lives. I would also like to express

my heartfelt condolences to the families

of those who lost their loved ones during

SBI Life Insurance Company Limited:

Dear Stakeholders,

We strive to go beyond expectations

to lead the industry, taking on various

challenges with integrity and agility in

these times of global crisis. Looking back

at FY21, we realize that the past year has

been one of unprecedented situations

and large-scale disruptions. Through

these times, our customers remained at

the heart of our operations.

Our sincere efforts to serve our customers to the

best of our abilities has helped us secure their future

while delivering another year of great performance

in all aspects. Our strong brand recall, widespread

distribution network and relentless workforce

have helped us maintain our position as leaders

in our industry.

We are happy to announce that we surpassed the

C500 billion mark in GWP, touching over 12+ million

lives in FY21. We saw a 38% rise in AUM to C2.21 trillion

vis-à-vis FY20 which is one of the highest in the life

insurance industry. Our operations are backed by stable

profitability supported by strong back book surplus.

We saw an overall prudent growth with C206.24 billion

of New Business Premium (NBP). We strive to develop

innovative solutions to create value for our stakeholders

while contributing to high profitability.

All-round performance

FY21 brought about a wave of uncertainty and adapting

to these changes was imperative. Through it all, we

have not only managed to stay afloat but also continued

to be one of the India’s leading private life insurers.

Although the start of the year was slow due to onset

of the pandemic, our performance picked up speed in

the third and fourth quarters. Our Individual NBP grew

from C112.45 billion to C124.99 billion in FY21 showing

a growth of 11% and GWP grew 24% to C502.54 billion.

Our renewal premiums saw a growth of 23% y-o-y to

C296.30 billion and New Business Premium saw a 24%

y-o-y growth to C206.24 billion.

The PAT registered a 2% Y-o-Y increase at C14.56 billion

over FY20. Our IEV saw a growth of 27% from C262.91

billion in FY20 to C333.86 billion in FY21. Our VoNB

margin reported a growth of 170 bps from 18.7% in

FY20 to 20.4% in FY21. We showed strong 13th month

persistency at 87.92% and 61st month persistency at

61.63%. At the same time, we managed to improve

our operating cost efficiency further to 4.8% from

12+ million

5.9%, which was reflected in our robust margin expansion.

Our solvency ratio remained strong at 2.15. Through the

year, we maintained stable profitability and continued to

grow as an organization, cementing our position as the

industry leader.

Digital Transformation

The growth in digitalization in the past year was faster

than ever. We employed digitalization to strengthen our

processes, making our service effortless and easy for

our customers. We introduced a simple and intuitive

on-boarding experience based on E-submission of

documents, E-payment, E-verification and E-policies.

This system has 41% automated underwriting and

reduced issuance TAT by 34%. The application process

was completed within 10 minutes and led to an adoption

by 99% of the customers.

Apart from this, our mobile app, web service and real-time

dashboard were revamped to make all processes online

and reduce physical contact. This made our systems faster,

more efficient and time saving. We also conducted our

employee trainings online through interactive courses,

simulations, and gamified micro modules. Our recruitment

process was done online as well and we recruited more

than 50,000 individual agents through the year. We have

60+ API platforms for quick on-boarding of partners &

faster system integration. Our digital quotient was raised

substantially by empowering distributors, customers and

employees and creating a robust end-to-end scalable and

integrated digital system.

Wellbeing for all

We believe in creating a better life for all and this has

pushed us to demonstrate our commitment to our

employees and our communities by taking timely and

adaptive decisions to ensure safety and well-being for

Our performance is a testament to our strong

business model, strong financial profile and

agile responses to a dynamic environment.
