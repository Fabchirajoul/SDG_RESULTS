During FY21, your Bank continued to

consolidate its overseas operations by

rationalizing

offices

with

sub-optimal

performance enabling improvement of

cost efficiencies. The Bank has closed

four foreign offices- Lenasia Marketing

Office (South Africa), Selatar Remitance

Center

(Singapore),

Bab-al-Bahrain

Limited Service Centre (Bahrain) and

its

Representative

Office

at

Istanbul

(Turkey). During this period, your Bank

has not ventured into opening of new

branches/offices on account of its focus

on consolidation and prevailing global

scenario due to Covid 19 Pandemic.

Covid 19 and IBG Response: Covid-19, the

global pandemic, has disrupted the global

economic system pushing countries into

various degrees of recession. Apart from

repercussions of the pandemic, countries

have also been handling the economic

contraction caused both by the pandemic

and the health measures like lock down,

movement restrictions etc. Slow-down

in the economic activity and consequent

impact on levels of global trade, investments

etc. have been witnessed.

Your Bank has shown remarkable resilience

in continuity of its core functionalities

at our offices across the globe despite

heterogeneous challenges on account of

the pandemic.

IBG has adapted well to optimize its cost

of resources in view of liquidity flush

in the market by substituting its high

cost resources with various low-cost

alternatives by diversifying its liability base.

It has raised sizeable long-term resources

from

developments

banks

in

Asian

countries like Japan and Korea apart from

borrowings from multi-lateral agencies at

finer rates. It has also leveraged its digital

offerings like SBI YONO by launching in

new geographies to improve penetration

through contactless offerings for raising

retail deposits.

Despite subdued business growth for the

first half year, IBG has not only crawled

back to reclaim its pre-Covid business

levels but has also registered growth in its

overseas portfolio while ensuring control

over the quality of assets in the wake of

stretched effect of Covid 19 on various

sectors. Apart from meticulous credit

monitoring, IBG has been agile in shedding

Global Presence

The Bank’s first global footprint was with

the branch of Bank of Madras in Colombo,

Sri Lanka in July 1864 (First amongst Indian

Banks). With a presence across all time

zones through 229 offices in 31 countries,

Your Bank has gradually spread its wings

across the globe and has become a pioneer

of International Banking among the Indian

PSBs. The overseas offices of SBI offices

are being managed by IBG.:

Letter of Credit,

Secondary Market Participations in Bank

/ Corporate Risk, India centric Trade

Credit, ECA/MLA backed Trade Finance,

Supply Chain Finance program, Letters

of Credit, Bank Guarantees etc. During

the FY21, Bank has introduced Factoring

into its Trade Finance product portfolio

and it is now available to our customers

at our foreign offices. Robust Trade

Finance technology solutions for back end

operations with a customer interface and

AML / CFT compliance solution integrated

to it, is available at all FOs.

GTD facilitates Trade Credit to Indian

Corporates for their imports by centralized

handling of Quote process. It plays an

important role in synergizing business flows

between Domestic and Foreign offices

for maximizing returns. It also organizes

Trade related workshops/ Conferences, by

partnering with BAFT (Bankers Association

for Finance and Trade), GTR (Global Trade

Review) etc., which provide a good platform

for Trade Finance operating officials to

acquaint with latest trends in Global Trade

Finance market. Further, Workshops are

also organized by partnering with ICC, FIEO

etc. to provide platform for networking with

Exporters/ Regulators/ Industry majors.

Trade finance business has a contribution

of ~ 27% in the IBG advances portfolio. SBI

Provider (India) –2021” for ninth consecutive

to this, TMG also utilizes various means of

in check. During the FY, in order to optimize

cost of resources, TMG has prepaid high-

cost borrowings and deposits and replaced

them with lower cost funds. TMG is actively

engaged

with

Supranational

our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued

by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by the ICAI, to the extent applicable

to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan

and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting were

established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the Internal Financial Controls over financial

reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding

of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design

and operating effectiveness of internal financial controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s

judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors, in terms of their reports

referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Bank’s

internal financial controls over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability

of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting

principles. A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance

of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide

reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorizations

of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized

acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper

management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of

any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial

controls over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the

policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion, and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of the reports

of the branch auditors referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, the Bank has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial

controls over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2021,

based on “the criteria for internal control over financial reporting established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal

control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI”.

Other Matters

Our aforesaid report in so far as it relates to the operating effectiveness of internal financial controls over financial reporting of 576

branches is based on the corresponding reports of the respective branch auditors of those branches.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
