Board of

Dear Shareholders,

I hope this note finds you and your families healthy and

safe, especially in these current times of unprecedent-

ed health challenges.

Following my appointment as Chairman of Cummins

India Limited, it is my pleasure to introduce myself to

you. Prior to my current role, I have been with Cum-

mins for over 35 years, serving in various capacities,

the most recent one being Group Vice President of

China and Russia. I had the opportunity to work with

India for about a third of my Cummins career, and I

consider it my privilege to be part of an organization

whose very purpose of existence is to make people’s

lives better.

In 2019, our 100th year of sustainability, Cummins

globally delivered record performance, and we

followed this by 2020 marking the 100th anniversary of

Cummins Power Generation business. This sustain-

ability has been built on a bedrock of our core values

that have helped us deliver on our brand promise of

innovation and dependability in everything we do.

Among the many strengths that have helped us meet

our goals is the balance we strike between the needs

and interests of all our stakeholders, including custom-

ers, employees, shareholders, communities, partners

and suppliers. It is this approach that has not only

differentiated us throughout our history, but continues

to be central to our strategy for success.

Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,

the global economy had begun confronting turbu-

lence due to disruptions in trade flow and diminishing

growth. This situation has been further aggravated by

the pandemic, resulting in an unprecedented decline in

demand and facility shutdowns for ourselves, our cus-

tomers and suppliers. As we continue operating amid

a pandemic, demand is slowly recovering in many of

our key geographies worldwide. In these challenging

times, our customers and business partners relied on

us to help them power their customers’ success. It is

especially during such times that we feel so proud of

living our mission.

Our approach to corporate responsibility is firmly

grounded in a stakeholder model articulated by former

Cummins Global Chairman J. Irwin Miller, who believed

Steven M. Chapman

Chairman,

Cummins India Limited (CIL)

that businesses have a responsibility to help create

healthy communities. The tools and actions that define

our work to remain a responsible company may have

changed over the years, but the underlying principles

have not. While we augmented our community relief

efforts to support the COVID-19 impacted and front-

line warriors, we made sure we did not lose sight of

our ongoing programs. Our flagship project to accel-

erate gender equality, the Cummins Powers Women

program, has funded training resulting in the launch

of over 60 advocacy projects globally. These projects

have changed laws and policies that benefit 17 million

women and girls across globe and 1.9 million in India.

The past year has been wrought with challenges, but

Cummins’ century-old history shows that we have

been through several downturns in the past and have

a great track record of navigating them and emerging

even stronger. As we navigate through the current

challenges, I am confident that with your trust and

support, the dedication and hard work of our people

and the collective experience of our leaders, we are

ready to embark on a new journey of sustainability.

In closing, I urge you and your families to continue to

follow COVID-19 appropriate protocols. Together, let’s

win this war against the virus.

Thank You,

Steven M. Chapman

Chairman, Cummins India Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

2020 is a year that we will never forget. We expe-

rienced a pandemic, a healthcare crisis, and the

economic fallout of COVID-19. Even today, through

the second wave of the pandemic, many companies

continue to experience economic and operational

uncertainty.

At Cummins, nothing has been more important to us

than keeping our employees safe and continuing to

deliver value to our stakeholders.

We have always believed that our ability to innovate is

one of our greatest strengths, and that we are only as

strong as the communities we serve. From introducing

new products and services to power our customers’

success, to providing aftermarket support through the

lockdown, and serving communities through our relief

effort, we have tried our best to follow through on our

commitment of making people’s lives better.

Cummins has been around for over a hundred years

globally, and close to sixty years in India. We have

survived many crises and taken away valuable lessons

from them each time. So, amid the economic head-

winds, decline in demand, and supply chain disrup-

tions, we remained disciplined and focused on fulfilling

customer commitments, and controlling our costs. We

had to take some exceedingly tough decisions and

temporarily reduced employee headcount and salaries.

Even as I write this, uncertainties continue to prevail as

India is still reeling under the effect of the pandemic.
