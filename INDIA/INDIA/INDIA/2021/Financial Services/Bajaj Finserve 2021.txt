its policies and practices in this regard include:

BFS’s Code of Conduct (‘COC’) covers good working, cultural

and integrity norms. It includes ‘disciplinary actions & grievance

redressal policy’ and ‘whistle blower policy/vigil mechanism’

which allows employees to consult on issues, report and/or

escalate grievances of any nature including harassment, fraud /

suspected fraud, unethical behaviour, instances of leak or

suspected leak of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information, etc.

which are detrimental to the Company’s interest or/and is a

process/policy violation.

The Group has in place policies and processes to safeguard

employees who report any unethical behaviour, against

discrimination, harassment, victimisation or other unfair

employment practice. BFS and its material subsidiaries also

accord direct access to Chairman of their Audit Committee.

BFS and its listed subsidiaries have a separate CoC for its

Directors and Senior Management – ‘Directors and Senior

Management shall observe the highest standards of ethical

conduct and integrity and shall work to the best of their ability

and judgement’. The Annual Report carries Directors’ and Senior

Management’s affirmation as communicated to all stakeholders

by the Chairman &: Managing Director.
