NOTE 40 : (Contd.)

letter dated 16th December, 2020 for special dispensation to HUDCO for granting exemption from the clause pertaining to 50%

lending to individuals and treat HUDCO as HFC.

The RBI in its reply: letter dated 10th February, 2021 has informed its inability to accede to HUDCO’s request for exemption and

accordingly suggested to submit a Board approved plan to fulfil the principal business criteria for HFC or to convert into a NBFC-

ICC.

In the meantime as per RBI’s Master Directions issued vide Notification dated 17th February, 2021 for NBFC-HFC, certain circulars

issued by NHB have been repealed. As HFC status is ruled out by the RBI, the decision to convert HUDCO into NBFC- Investment

and Credit Company (ICC) or Infrastructure Finance Company (IFC) from the present HFC status, requires detailed analysis to be

carried out on various pros and cons. RBI was requested vide letter dated 8th March, 2021 to grant six months’ time for transition

to NBFC and to retain the status of HFC and to continue operations with the special dispensations/ relaxations given earlier with

regard to credit concentration norms/ exposure norms permitted by NHB/ RBI.

In response to HUDCO’s request, RBI vide letter dated 26th March, 2021 has granted six months’ time to submit Board approved

plan for conversion to NBFC. RBI has further advised that the exemptions from concentration/exposure norms granted previously

by NHB/RBI would continue to apply at present subject to the conditions specified while granting such exemptions.

RBI has issued Master Directions for NBFC-HFC vide their Notification dated 17th February, 2021. RBI’s credit concentration

NOTE 40 : (Contd.)

letter has informed that the earlier decision for merger of IBHL with the parent bank was taken by the IBHL

Board on account of the then situation prevailing at that point of time. IBHL took various steps towards revival of housing finance

business. The authorized capital of the Company was increased from ` 50 crore to ` 150 crore. The Company initiated steps

for restructuring of capital by converting loan liabilities of Indian Bank into Compulsory Convertible Preference shares (CCPS)

carrying 0.01% rate for ` 130 crore. However, the required permission of RBI was not forthcoming and hence conversion of loan

liability to CCPS could not be carried out.

NHB/ RBI, from time to time, has given certain relaxations from credit concentration norms considering the role envisaged for

HUDCO. However, vide its: letter No. NHB(ND)/ DRS/ SUP/ 3911/ 2018 dated 2nd April, 2018, NHB capped the credit concentration

(Exposure) limit for Government/Public agencies as follows:

(a)

The individual exposure limit of HUDCO to Government/Public Agencies (inclusive of the exposure limit of upto 30% for

infrastructure/ non-housing related activities) shall be capped at 50% of its NOF.

(b)

The exposure limit of HUDCO for State Government (under group exposure) shall be capped at 150% of its NOF in respect

of State of Telangana and 100% of NOF for all other States. HUDCO is required to take suitable steps to bring down the

group exposure in respect of State of Telangana also to 100% within a maximum period of 3 years. The conditions relating

to compliance by the concerned State with the FRBM limits shall continue to be ensured by HUDCO.

The Board of

letter no 1736/3.10.136/2019-20 dated 5th March, 2020 granted relaxation of credit concentration norms

for exposure to Telangana State Housing Corporation Limited (TSHCL) upto 75% of Net Owned Fund of HUDCO subject

SUP/880/2019: letter dated 8th March, 2019 .A detailed action plan to this effect may be forwarded to NHB.

(iii)

Loans granted by the Company directly to individuals and bulk loans under HUDCO Niwas Scheme are secured fully/partly by:

(i)

Equitable Mortgage of the property and /or

letter dated 16th December, 2020 for special dispensation to HUDCO for granting exemption from the clause pertaining to

50% lending to individuals and treat HUDCO as HFC.

The RBI in its reply: letter dated 10th February, 2021 has informed its inability to accede to HUDCO`s request for exemption

and accordingly suggested to submit a Board approved plan to fulfil the principal business criteria for HFC or to convert into

a NBFC-ICC.

In the meantime as per RBI’s Master Directions issued vide Notification dated 17th February, 2021 for NBFC-HFC, certain

circulars issued by NHB have been repealed. As HFC status is ruled out by the RBI, the decision to convert HUDCO into

NBFC- Investment and Credit Company (ICC) or Infrastructure Finance Company (IFC) from the present HFC status, requires

detailed analysis to be carried out on various pros and cons. RBI was requested vide letter dated 08th March, 2021 to grant

6 months’ time for transition to NBFC- ICC or IFC and to retain the status of HFC and to continue operations with the special

dispensations/ relaxations given earlier with regard to credit concentration norms/ exposure norms permitted by NHB/ RBI.

In response to HUDCO’s request, RBI vide letter dated 26th March, 2021 has granted 6 months’ time to submit Board approved

plan for conversion to NBFC. RBI has further advised that the exemptions from concentration/exposure norms granted

previously by NHB/RBI would continue to apply at present subject to the conditions specified while granting such exemptions.

2.

RBI has issued Master Directions for NBFC-HFC vide their Notification dated 17th February, 2021. RBI’s credit concentration

norms state that a Housing Finance Company’s lending exposure to any single borrower or investment in the shares of another

Company should not exceed 15% of its owned funds and lending exposure to any single group of borrowers or investment in the

shares of single group of companies should not exceed 25% of its owned funds. As per the said circular, Investment of a Housing

Finance Company (HFC) in the shares of another HFC shall not exceed 15% of the Equity Capital of the investee Company.

The Company is complying with RBI’s credit concentration norms except in one case of investment in another HFC viz.,

Indbank Housing Ltd. (IBHL), a subsidiary of Indian Bank in which HUDCO has invested 25% capital of investee.

HUDCO had invested ₹ 2.50 crore, even before guidelines were applicable, in the Equity Shares of IBHL, whose total paid-up

capital is ₹10 crore resulting in investment to the extent of 25% of the equity.

IBHL through their letter has informed that the earlier decision for merger of IBHL with the parent bank was taken by the IBHL

Board on account of the then situation prevailing at that point of time. IBHL took various steps towards revival of housing

finance business. The authorized capital of the Company was increased from ₹ 50 crore to ₹ 150 crore. The Company-

initiated steps for restructuring of capital by converting loan liabilities of Indian Bank into Compulsory Convertible Preference

shares (CCPS) carrying 0.01% rate for ₹ 130 crore. However, the required permission of RBI was not forthcoming and hence

conversion of loan liability to CCPS could not be carried out.

NHB/ RBI, from time to time, has given certain relaxations from credit concentration norms considering the role envisaged

for HUDCO. However, vide its letter No. NHB(ND)/ DRS/ SUP/ 3911/ 2018 dated 2nd April, 2018, NHB capped the credit

concentration (Exposure) limit for Government/Public agencies as follows:

(a)

The individual exposure limit of HUDCO to Government/Public Agencies (inclusive of the exposure limit of upto 30%

for infrastructure/ non-housing related activities) shall be capped at 50% of its NOF.

letter dated 2nd April, 2018 and

permit HUDCO to continue on the already approved pattern of credit concentration norms communicated by NHB vide

its letters from time to time”.

NHB vide its: letter No. NHB(ND)/DRS/SUP/7085/2018 dated 13th July, 2018 has conveyed its decision to allow HUDCO

to continue its disbursals as per the schedule in relation to the existing sanctions made upto 31st May, 2018. However,

HUDCO shall be required to take suitable steps to bring down the exposure to Government/Public Agencies and State

Governments (under group exposure) in the above cases also to 50% and 100% respectively latest by March, 2023.

The exposure limits of upto 50% for Government/Public Agencies (inclusive of the exposure limit of upto 30% for

infrastructure/non-housing related activities) and upto 100% for State Governments (under group exposure) will

continue to be applicable in all other cases. The condition relating to compliance by the concerned State with the

FRBM limits shall continue.

HUDCO vide letter dated 06th March, 2019 requested NHB seeking relaxation in the individual/group exposure norms.

Further, HUDCO also sought exemption from exposure norms for funding of PMAY (U) programme through Extra

Budgetary Resources (EBRs).

concentration norms (under individual borrower exposure to Government /public agency) to HUDCO to extend loan

upto ₹ 20,000 crore to BMTPC under the PMAY-U subject to the condition that demand under Credit Linked Subsidiary

Scheme (CLSS) is met on priority while utilizing funds lent to BMTPC.

NHB has vide its letter no. NHB(ND)/DRS/SUP/880/2019 dated 08th March, 2019 granted relaxation to HUDCO in
