architecture, market leading

innovation and a trusted brand.

growth in assets

` 1,360 crore.

37%: Dear Shareholders,

We started the year on an uncertain note, hit as we were by a once-in-a-century

health crisis, with economic activity across India brought to its knees by the long

lockdown that followed. Through the major part of the year, we were confined

to our homes, with restricted mobility. The pandemic led to a significant loss of

human life and now presents a challenge to our public health systems, the way

we work and even our social norms.

In the wake of such an unprecedented crisis, we had to move quickly and

manage a near overnight transition to a virtual working model. As always, our

focus during these uncertain times was to ensure the health and safety of

our employees, and to minimise the difficulties faced by our customers. As the

pandemic spread across India, we transitioned quickly and effectively, to a work

from home arrangement, in almost every location in which we were present.

This also included moving all our customer-facing branch service staff and

15,700 frontline sales personnel from a traditional in-person environment to a

completely virtual one.

Our all-round robust results in the pandemic year stand testament to the

resilience of our differentiated business model – a customer-centric one, well

supported by a diversified distribution architecture, market leading innovation

and a trusted brand. We ranked consistently amongst the top two private sector

companies in the private sector in terms of new business premium; closing the

year at ` 20,107 crore with a market share of 21.5%. We registered a growth

of 37% in assets under management, with an Indian GAAP profit growth of 5%

to ` 1,360 crore. We achieved this amidst an economic slowdown exacerbated

by the pandemic, liquidity crises in the financial sector, an uncertain business

environment with changing customer preferences and a volatile stock market.

Our strategy of having diverse distribution channels helped us tide across a

year that witnessed disruption in our ‘face to face’ networks, including our

branches that were largely closed in the first half of the year. These disruptions

notwithstanding, we continued to add a wide range of partners and have

successfully closed the year at 300+ partners, including 50+ in the emerging

Consistently rated

sector companies

Dear Shareholders,

As I am writing to you, we are passing through the second wave of the pandemic,

which has changed many aspects of our lives. It has been a year of paradigm

shifts: large scale digital embracement, new modes of stakeholder engagement,

changing needs of the customer and new models of working. In a nutshell, it

has changed the way we do business and has made us rethink the concept of

‘business as usual’.

The pandemic tested our agility as well as

resilience as a company. I am proud to say that

we collectively tackled numerous adversities and

continued to deliver value to our stakeholders,

without compromising on the safety of our

employees, our outsourced staff, vendors and

partners. I am also happy to say that we played

a socially important role over the course of the

year, having settled over 2.9 lakh death claims,

resulting in payouts in excess of ` 3,000 crore.

Despite challenges through the year posed by

extended periods of lockdown, we also insured

close to 4 crore lives in FY 2020-21
