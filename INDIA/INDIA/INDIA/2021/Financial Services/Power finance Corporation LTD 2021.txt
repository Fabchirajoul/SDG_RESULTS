Letter of Comfort (LoC):

The Company measures ECL on loan assets at an

amount equal to the lifetime ECL if there is credit

impairment or there has been significant increase

in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. If there

is no SICR as compared to initial recognition, the

Company measures ECL at an amount equal to

12-month ECL. When making the assessment

of whether there has been a SICR since initial

recognition, the Company considers reasonable

and supportable information, that is available

without undue cost or effort. If the Company

measured loss allowance as lifetime ECL in the

previous period, but determines in a subsequent

period that there has been no SICR since initial

recognition due to improvement in credit quality,

the Company again measures the loss allowance

based on 12-month ECL.

ECL is measured on individual basis for credit

impaired loan assets, and on other loan assets

it is generally measured on collective basis using

homogenous groups.

The Company measures impairment on

commitments under LoC on similar basis as in

case of Loan assets.

(iv)

De-recognition of financial assets

The Company derecognises a financial asset when

the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset

expire, or when it transfers the financial asset along

with all the substantial risks and rewards of ownership

of the asset to another party.

On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the

difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the

sum of the consideration received & receivable, and

the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised

in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated:

letter vide D.O.No.32024/17/97 – PFC dated 23.09.1997 and O.M.No.32024/23/2001 – PFC dated 07.03.2003, irrespective of actual

repayment schedule, moratorium period and duration of repayment. The amount of interest subsidy received and to be passed on

to the borrowers is retained as Interest Subsidy Fund Account. Impact of difference between indicative rate & period considered

at the time of claims and at the time of actual disbursement can be ascertained only after end of respective schemes.

(ii)

(iii) Project Monitoring

The Company has comprehensive project/loan monitoring

guidelines that captures aspects relating to monitoring

and tracking of project construction and implementation,

progress of commissioned projects; identifies risks where

intervention is required to minimise the time & cost overruns

and consequent slippages in disbursements.

For State sector projects, monitoring is carried out based on

project progress details obtained regularly from borrowers

through progress monitoring reports, site visits, discussions

with the borrowers, information/reports available on Central

Electricity Authority’s (CEA) website etc.

For private sector, where the Company is Lead Financial

Institution (FI), the Company engages Lenders’ Engineers

(LEs) and Lenders’ Financial Advisors (LFAs), which are

independent agencies to act on behalf of various lenders/

consortium members. The LEs conduct periodic site visits,

review relevant documents, discusses with the borrowers

and submit its reports on progress of the project. LFAs

submit the statements of fund flow and utilization of funds in

the project periodically. In cases the Company is not the lead

FI, the tasks related to LEs and LFAs services are coordinated

with the concerned lead lender.

Also, the consolidated periodic progress report of certain

projects is prepared comprising important observations/

issues viz. areas of concern, reasons for delay, issues

affecting project construction/implementation etc. and is

reviewed by the Company on a regular basis.

The Company continuously monitors delays and/or default of

borrowers and their recoverability. On occurrence of default

in the borrower’s account, the Company initiates necessary

steps which may involve action(s) including, but not limited

to, Special Mention Account (SMA) reporting to RBI, credit

information reporting to Central Repository of Information

on Large Credits (CRILC) etc., regularisation of the account by

recovering all over dues, invocation of guarantees/ securities

to recover the dues, conversion of loan into equity as per

loan agreement, restructuring of loan account, formulating

resolution plan with the borrower, change in ownership,

Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), sale of

the exposures to other entities/investors, other recovery

mechanisms like referring the case for legal action before

Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), SARFAESI, National Company

Law Tribunal (NCLT) (IBC -2016) etc. and other actions as

specified under regulatory/legal framework.

40.1.2 Credit Risk Measurement - Impairment

Assessment

(i)

Staging of loans

Ind AS 109 outlines a three staged model for measurement

of impairment based on changes in credit risk since initial

recognition. For classification of its borrowers into various

stages, the Company uses the following basis:

- A financial asset that is not credit impaired on initial

recognition is classified in ‘Stage I’.

- If a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) is identified, the

financial asset is moved to ‘Stage II’.

An assessment of whether credit risk has increased

significantly since initial recognition is performed at each

reporting date by considering the change in the risk of default

occurring over the remaining life of the financial assets.

In accordance with Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’, the

Company has applied rebuttable presumption that considers

more than 30 days past due as a parameter for determining

significant increase in credit risk.

- If the financial asset is credit-impaired, it is moved to ‘Stage

III’ category.

In case of Stage III financial assets, after implementation of

the resolution plan (except for change of ownership and/or

resolution through NCLT), the financial asset is upgraded

and classified as Stage II for two quarters from the date of

implementation of resolution plan.

(ii) Default

In accordance with Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’, the

Company considers the rebuttable presumption to define a

financial asset as in default, i.e. when the loan account is more

than 90 days past due on its contractual payments. Credit

impaired financial assets are aligned with the definition of

default.

(iii) Measurement of Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

The Company recognises impairment loss allowance for

the financial assets in accordance with a Board-approved

expected credit loss (ECL) policy. ECL is measured on either

a 12 month or lifetime basis depending on whether there

is significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

ECL is the product of Probability of default (PD), Loss Given:

Letter of Comfort of ` 57.03 crore (as at 31.03.2020 ` 180.47 crore).

Loans to state sector are well diversified as these are extended to multiple entities under the control of various State Governments

and Central Government. The Company considers that these loans have a low credit risk in comparison to lending to private

sector mainly due to low default/loss history in state sector and availability of government guarantee in certain loans. Presence

of Government interest in these projects also lowers the risk of non-recoverability of dues.

Further, the Company has a lending portfolio comprising of loans to generation (renewable and non-renewable), transmission

and distribution power projects spread across diverse geographical areas.

Letter of Comfort (LoC):

The Group measures ECL on loan assets at an

amount equal to the lifetime ECL if there is credit

impairment or there has been significant increase

in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. If

there is no SICR as compared to initial recognition,

the Group measures ECL at an amount equal to

12-month ECL. When making the assessment

of whether there has been a SICR since initial

recognition, the Group considers reasonable and

supportable information, that is available without

undue cost or effort. If the Group measured loss

allowance as lifetime ECL in the previous period,

but determines in a subsequent period that

there has been no SICR since initial recognition

due to improvement in credit quality, the Group

again measures the loss allowance based on

12-month ECL.

ECL is measured on individual basis for credit

impaired loan assets, and on other loan assets

it is generally measured on collective basis using

homogenous groups.

The

Group

measures

impairment

on

commitments under LoC on similar basis as in

case of Loan assets.

(x)

separately under the head ‘Dividend Income’.

(xi) Interest

expense

(xii) Other income and expenses are accounted on accrual
