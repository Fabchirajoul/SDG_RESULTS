Dear Stakeholders,

A key outcome of the

unprecedented environment

has been an impressive

growth in India’s digital

payments ecosystem.

What an extraordinary year FY21 has

been, never imagined or experienced

before. A closer look at different aspects

of the business at different stages is

indicative of the environment and how

the year unfolded. As we saw, the

economy and businesses got drastically

impacted during the Q1, subsequently

with every quarter the economy &

consumer sentiments picked up.

A key outcome of the unprecedented

environment has been an impressive

growth in India’s digital payments

ecosystem. Owing to lockdowns and

social distancing guidelines, consumers

preferred using varied digital payment

modes and online shopping. The

period also witnessed emergence of

newer

spend

categories,

including

OTT, utilities, online education, online

health consultation and pharmacies.

Capitalizing on many such existing

and emerging opportunities, SBI Card

continued to operate with resilience

and reported an all-round performance

on major business parameters. We

also

restructured

and

developed

strategies to withstand the impact of an

unprecedented economic situation.

We observed a surge in cashless and

digital payments, backed by surge in

online spend with our cards, which rose

to an astounding 51.9%. More than 1

in every 4 Point of Sale transaction was

a ‘non-touch’ transaction on our digital

platform. We introduced products such

as the tokenisation-based e-card for

Android, which allows users to make

contactless

payments

at

point-of-

sale terminals that support Near Field

Communication (NFC).

We

continued

to

forge

strategic

partnerships to deliver a differentiated

value

our

valued

customers. We launched our flagship

Managing Director

& CEO: Dear Stakeholders,

We scaled our operations

based on detailed macro-

market studies and

enabled smooth transition

to a remote working

environment.

FY21 has been an extremely

challenging year. To combat the

negative effects of the pandemic,

we responded with resilience.

Our agility and potential to adapt

to new methods and develop

sound strategies enabled us to

consistently serve our growing

customer base. I am delighted to

report that, as of March 31, 2021,

we

are

India’s

second-largest

credit card issuer, with a base of

over 1.18 Cr cards in force.

Our priorities were clear, right

from the onset of the pandemic.

When the lockdown was imposed,

we were focused on guaranteeing

business continuity, improving the

quality of our services, and, most

importantly, ensuring the safety

of our employees. We scaled our

operations

based

on

detailed

macro-market studies and enabled

smooth transition to a remote working

environment. Owing to our digital

excellence, all our critical business

processes were virtually supported, and

we allowed majority of our employees

to Work from Home. Virtual platforms

like Office365, Skype and MS Teams

enabled our workforce to ensure

business continuity.

Leveraging data analytics, we identified

newer

opportunities

for

customer

engagement

at

different

stages,

accordingly we rolled out timely and

relevant offers to grow spends in relevant

categories. For instance, during Q1FY21

we identified emergence of newer spend

categories and sharpened our focus on

categories such as OTT, utilities, online

education, online health consultation

and pharmacies. Business momentum

picked up pace in Q2 owing to pent up

demand and our varied initiatives. In

Q3 to harness the positive consumer
