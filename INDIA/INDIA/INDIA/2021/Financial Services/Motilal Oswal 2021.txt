Dear Shareholders,

FY2021 was an eventful year for MOFSL. Despite the pandemic

situation and uncertainties thereof, it was a remarkable year for

us. India stepped into FY2021 with Covid-19 induced lockdown in

place. Lockdown restrictions caused unprecedented job losses

and impacted livelihoods of many. Demand remained muted and

GDP contracted to 23.9% in Q1FY2021. But markets started

gradually recovering led by phase wise unlocking, various policy

measures announced by government RBI as well as a better than

expected corporate earnings performance. From the lows seen

during the end of FY2020, markets bounced back to erase its

losses in November. Investors further gained confidence with the

approval of vaccines against Covid. Both Sensex and Nifty closed

at an all-time high in the month of February'21.

FY2021 has been a landmark year for our company, touching all-

time highs on several parameters. We reported highest ever

consolidated revenues of ` 3,923 Cr, +69% YoY and PAT of ` 1,245 Cr, +579% YoY. PAT excluding exceptional items

stood at ` 1,311 Cr, +615% YoY. Our ROE, excluding other comprehensive income stood at 38% as compared to

6.6% in FY2020. Going forward, our focus on knowledge, talent, processes, technology, brand & culture and

inter-segment synergies will pave the road for achieving milestones across all business verticals. We continue to

remain optimistic on the growth potential of all our business verticals given the robust fundamental structure

and revival in macro-conditions.

On the capital markets front, Indian equity markets posted their best performance in a decade in FY2021. The

industry witnessed a record of 1.44 Cr of new demat accounts being opened. FII inflows were also at an all-time

high. Our broking business focuses on a “Phygital” Business model which offers best of both the worlds. Success

of this model has yielded results as we recorded our highest ever broking revenues and ADTO in FY2021. We

were successful in adding around 6.2 lakh clients taking the total retail client base to ~19.7 lakh. Online volumes

contributed ~60% of the total retail volumes traded. Our distribution AUM stood at ` 12,785 Cr, and has huge

head-room for growth as the client penetration stands at ~13% of our retail client base. We made huge

investments in this business in FY2021 by adding 1,600+ people and 60+ branches in order to benefit from the

industry consolidation opportunity. In the institution business, our rankings and clientele continued to remain

robust. We were awarded #1 Local Brokerage and #2 Overall Sales in the Asia Money Brokers Poll 2020. On the

investment banking side, we associated with HDFC and ICICI Bank for their QIPs. We continue to engage on a

wide cross-section of mandated transactions across capital markets and advisory.

Our AMC AUM which includes MFs, PMS and AIFs stood at ` 45,692 Cr in FY2021, +54% YoY. In FY2021, we were

ranked 9Ǧǚ in terms of new MF folio addition. Our new SIP count market share improved by 90 bps YoY to 2.2%.

Our gross sales at AMC level increased by 22% YoY and net flows turned positive in the last quarter. We have

received strong traction in our Passive offerings; our AUM reached 10x in a years time. We have strengthened

our sales vertical by adding 20 sales employees in FY2021 including some senior level hiring. Further, we

expanded our reach by adding 5 more branches. During the year, PE AUM stood at ` 6,569 Cr. We launched IREF

V which received commitments aggregating to ` 650 Cr. Our wealth management business recorded 26% YoY

growth in revenue led by strong net sales of Rs 2,711 cr in FY2021. Our AUM touched an all-time high of ` 25,286

Cr, +62% YoY. Client acquisition saw encouraging growth with the number of families under our business

crossing the 5,000 mark. With the improvement in the vintage of RMs, the profitability of our wealth

management business is poised for further traction. Mr. Ashish Shanker was promoted as CEO of our wealth

management business.

On our housing finance business, our efforts were concentrated in strengthening our organisation in terms of

processes, systems, manpower, culture and structure to create foundation for strong and sustainable growth.

We on-boarded Mr. Arvind Hali as MD & CEO and under his leadership our entire senior management team with

all key heads is now in place. Our full year disbursement stood at ` 273 Cr, +42% YoY. In FY2021, we further

diversified our liability sources by National Housing Bank borrowings and Securitization transactions and also

lowered our average cost of borrowings by 95 bps YoY to 9.25% in FY2021. We have expanded our sales force

during the year and will continue to hire more as business is gears up for growth.

In our fund based businesses (comprising of sponsor commitments to quoted equity and private equity funds),

we recorded highest ever gains on investments in a year at ` 779 Cr. As per IND-AS, these gains are a part of our

reported earnings. Our QGLP philosophy, niche expertise in equities, proven track record and belief in 'skin in

the game', augurs well for our fund based business

Some of the key highlights of FY2021 include group's asset under advice crossing ~2 tn mark, balance sheet size

crossing ` 100 bn, 61% growth in PAT of broking business, 352% growth in PAT of wealth management business,

highest ever NIM and lowest ever COF for home finance business and successful launch of S&P 500 index fund.

Our dividend payout ratio excluding MTM gains stood at 28%. Company has also completed Buyback of equity

shares of ` 1.5 bn (including tax).

Our strategy to diversify our business model towards linear sources of earnings has showed results. Capital

Market business which is our oldest and cash cow business has achieved new highs on various parameters and

continues to benefit from industry consolidation led by knowledge driven phygital offerings. Our Asset

Management business is likely to gain from strong product performance and its niche offerings. Going forward,

with ample room for scalability of our Housing Finance and other businesses, we remain excited for the future

prospects of the company.

Although World Bank slashed its FY2022 growth projection to 8.3% from 11.2% as the second Covid wave hit

hard, India still stands to benefit in this uncertain environment. Many global MNCs are likely to consider

diversifying their manufacturing operations from China to India given the low corporate tax rate, skilled

population, relatively low wages and a large domestic market. Also, the growing demand for affordable housing

industry stands positive for our business. Sustenance of macros at reasonable levels augurs well for our

business and industry as a whole. As these macro trends open up opportunities, our experience and emphasis

on 'Knowledge First' give us the ability to capture these growth prospects.:
