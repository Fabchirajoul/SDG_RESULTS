Dear Shareholders,

I have great pleasure in welcoming you to the 49th Annual General

Meeting of your Company.

I am addressing you all at a time when the nation has valiantly

emerged from the second wave of Corona virus. Having made good

progress on vaccination, the general expectation is now towards

very muted third wave, if at all it strikes. There is good news on

the economic front in terms of recovery from the shrinkage of

economic output of last year which bore the full impact of the

pandemic.

Your company is now entering the golden jubilee year, half a

century of its existence. This is also time when the Corporation

has witnessed a full circle from being at the core of nationalization

to opening up and now a reasonable balance between public and

private sector market participation.

The business model, hitherto characterized by underwriting losses

getting cross-subsidised by investment income is changing to

underwriting profitability, will dictate goals, as the market further

matures. Indian economy will continue to be an important part

of the Asian economic growth engine and its knock-on effect on

insurance will be experienced by the industry. Insurance under-

penetration of the Indian market will certainly provide the tailwinds.

Macro-economic and Industry overview

India’s real gross domestic product (GDP) at current prices stood

at ` 135.13 lakh crore in FY 2020-21, as per the provisional

estimates of annual national income for 2020-21.

Health and fire insurance segments witnessed decent growth while

the motor was impacted due to the nationwide lockdown. The

growth in fire segment can be attributed to upward revision in the

premium rates while growing demand for health covers on the back

of Covid-19 pandemic boosted the health segment.

On the domestic front, GIC Re has been prudently participating in

the Indian Agriculture insurance industry with implementation of

the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana scheme (PMFBY) in 2016.

PMFBY scheme is a yield index-based product and Restructured

Weather Based Crop Insurance product is a weather index product.

GIC Re has been cautiously underwriting both domestic and foreign

business with a keen interest to increase the premium volume while

simultaneously controlling the combined ratio.

The Aviation sector globally has been majorly impacted by the

COVID-19 pandemic with flight operations being grounded for the

most part of the year 2020-21. This situation is reflected in drop of

GIC Re’s premium income by 17.2% for the Financial Year.

The climate change is still posing a serious concern for most of the

insurers. Amid the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, India

witnessed some cyclones like Tauktae, Yaas, Amphan and Nisarga,

leaving behind a trail of destruction across several Indian states.

Economy activity picked up from the fourth quarter of the financial

year on the back of robust fiscal and monetary stimulus, mega

vaccination drive and low inflation. During the year stock market

indices reflected continuous increase from their historic low levels

of March 2020 and the interest rates remained subdued.

Economic growth picked up during the year and the global GDP

surpassed its pre-pandemic level mainly aided by strong policy

support and ongoing vaccine deployments leading to resumption

of economic activities, especially in the service sectors. As per

the OECD Economic Outlook, the Organization for Economic Co-

operation and Development projected that the Global GDP would

grow by 5.7% in 2021 and 4.5% in 2022. The recent moderation

in some countries due to the impact of delta variant and supply

side constraints are expected to unwind over time and lead to faster

recoveries in 2022.

of the Risk and Mitigation Plan Owners (RMOs), primarily Scale

V level officers, where new risks are brought for discussion and

thereafter the entire risk universe is re-calibrated with the objective

of prioritization for mitigation. During the exercise, RMOs also

implemented. The ERM department conducts periodic review

of the risk universe and checks the control effectiveness. ERM

Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer:

letter of comfort given by the parent company provides support to the company in order

to maintain adequate capital, to meet solvency and policy holder liability requirements and financial obligations.

Credit risk

The company has several exposures to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when

due. Key areas where the company is exposed to credit risk are:

l

amounts due from reinsurance policyholders;

l

amounts due from reinsurance contract intermediaries;

l

investments excluding equities; and

l

retroceded technical liabilities.

Exposure to individual policyholders and groups of policyholders are monitored as part of the credit control process. Reputable

financial institutions are used for investing and cash handling purposes.

Under the terms of the retrocession agreements, retrocessionaires agree to reimburse the ceded amount in the event that a gross

claim is paid. However, the company remains liable to its cedants regardless of whether the retrocessionaire meets the obligations it

has assumed. Consequently, the company is exposed to credit risk.

GIC Re South Africa Ltd reinsures with Sirius International Insurance Corporation which has been rated A (Excellent) by A.M.Best

and A- (Strong) by S&P Ratings.

Sirius International Insurance Corporation arranged a 70% whole account quota share treaty whereby 70% of the claims are

recovered from Sirius International Insurance Corporation. In addition to this GIC Re South Africa Ltd continues to withhold 40%

of the premium as premium reserve deposit and retain 100% of the outstanding claims reserve as an outstanding claims reserve

deposit.

None of the company’s financial assets exposed to credit risk are past 182 days due and are not impaired. The company does not

hold any collateral as security held for receivables.

letter

of credit to Lloyd’s (Funds at Lloyd’s) to collateralise its reinsurance obligations to the Company and deposited an additional £56.5 million

during the year (2019: £30.8 million).

Operational Risk

Since the Company ouly undertakes a few transactions of its own, it has limited systems and staffing requirements.Therefore, the Directors

do not consider the Company’s operational risks to be significant. Close involvement of the Directors in the Company’s key decision making

and the fact that the Syndicates conduct a majority of the Company’s operations provides control over any remaining operational risk.

Foreign Exchange

The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through the Syndicates’ liabilities under policies of insurance denominated in currencies:

letter of credit and the funds provided by the Parent Reinsurer at Fund’s at Lloyd’s.

Since the Company did not undertake many transactions of its own, the Directors do not consider currency or credit risk to be significant.

Regulatory and Compliance Risk

The Company is subject to continuing approval by Lloyd’s to be a corporate member of the Syndicates. The Company reduces the risk of

this approval being revoked by monitoring and fully complying with all of its Lloyd’s membership requirements.

The capital requirements to support the proposed amount of Syndicate insurance capacity for future years are set by Lloyd’s. Lloyd’s takes

a variety of factors into account when setting these requirements including market conditions and Syndicate performance. Though Lloyd’s

intends for the process to be fair and reasonable, the requirements can fluctuate from one year to the next, which may constrain the amount

of Syndicate insurance capacity that the Company can support going forward.

Section 172(1) Reporting

The Directors have acted in a way that they considered, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of Company for the

benefits of its members as a whole, and in doing so had regard (amongst other matters) to the matters listed in section 172(1)(a) to (f)

when performing their duties and comment as follows:

(a) the Directors are satisfied that its investment in Lloyd’s Syndicates it participates on are in the long term interest of the Company and

its Shareholder;

(b) the Company has no employees;

(c) the Directors have adequately fostered the business relationship with the Syndicates, and Lloyd’s;

The Company manages credit risk at the Corporate level by ensuring that investments and cash and cash equivalent deposits are
