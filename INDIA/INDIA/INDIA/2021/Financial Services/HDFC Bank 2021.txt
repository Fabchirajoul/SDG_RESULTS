HDFC Bank Limited | Integrated Annual Report 2020-21

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Dear Stakeholders,

Let me start by wishing all of you good

health and happiness. The financial year

gone by has taught all of us to value

this more than anything else. Many of

you may have lost your near and dear

ones. My heartfelt condolences to all

of you. We in the HDFC Bank family

too have lost several colleagues. My

head bows in grief and sorrow. We are

supporting and will continue to support

their families.

The year gone by saw people across

the world being largely confined to their

homes with several travel restrictions in

place. They faced myriad personal and

professional challenges perhaps never

before encountered in our lifetime. This

obviously had an effect on the economy

with the world officially being plunged

into recession.

Governments and Central Banks across

the world reacted introducing a range

of measures to revive the economy and

help people move forward.

Challenging Environment

Our country was no exception. The

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the

Government introduced a slew of

measures to revive the economy.

These measures bore fruit with the

economy growing by 1.6 per cent in

the fourth quarter of the year while it

had contracted by 24.4 per cent at the

end of the first quarter. In the current

financial year India is expected to be

one of the fastest growing economies

in the world. The second wave of the

pandemic has dented the optimism

a bit, but the peak of the pandemic

clearly appears to be behind us. As the

vaccine rollout gathers momentum, the

economy is expected to be on a much

stronger footing especially from the

second quarter.

Our Performance

We posted a healthy growth in Net

Profit, Net Interest Income and Balance

Sheet size without compromising on

asset quality. Net Profit increased by

18.5 per cent to `31,116.5 Crore in

FY21 and balance sheet size by 14.1

per cent to `1,746,871 Crore. Gross

NPAs increased to 1.32 per cent in

FY21 from 1.26 per cent in the previous

year. Net interest income, an indication

of the difference between interest

earned and interest paid grew by 15.5

per cent to `64,879.6 Crore. The details

of our performance are elaborated in

the report.

I am proud of my colleagues and thank

all of them (and their families too) for

this performance despite, the difficulties

they had to face during the year. As an

organisation we learnt and relearnt on

the way, pivoted our way to a Work from

Home culture and continued to serve

our customers. I am delighted by the

way our colleagues responded to the

myriad challenges we all faced.

Strengths

At this point I would like to elaborate

on some of our strengths and also talk

about things that we could have done

better.

One of our biggest strengths has been

the legacy of over a quarter century.

Responsible

Business:

Dear Stakeholders,

Your Directors take great pleasure in presenting the 27th Annual

Report on the business and operations of your Bank, together

with the audited accounts for the year ended March 31, 2021.

First of all, wishing all of you health and happiness on behalf of

the HDFC Bank family.

As the virus casts a shadow over the entire world, the first thing

that all of us must do is take every possible step to ensure

our safety and that of our loved ones. And say a prayer for

our collective well-being. Especially for all the frontline COVID

warriors who served the nation, often at great risk to their own

lives. Our heads bow in respect for those who lost their lives in

this fight. This includes some of our colleagues too.

Needless to say, the pandemic affected the economy.

If FY 2019-20 was one of the most challenging years for the

Indian economy, then the challenges only multiplied in FY 2020-

21. And this was accentuated further by geo-political tensions.

The year started with one of the most severe lockdowns in

the world. Although it was eased in stages, the economy was

bound to take a hit. For the first time in many years, India’s

GDP contracted by 7.3 per cent in FY 2020-21. This was an

improvement after the first quarter low of -24.4 per cent. As

the lockdown eased, the economy contracted by 7.4 per cent

in the second quarter and touched positive territory in the third

quarter, posting a growth of +0.5 per cent and 1.6 per cent in

the fourth quarter.

The Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

announced a host of measures to cushion the direct impact of

the lockdown on the economy. The Government announced

a stimulus package of ` 20 trillion in five different tranches in

FY 2020-21 to provide support to 1) the MSMEs and the Non

Banking Financial Companies via a credit guarantee scheme and

liquidity support 2) Migrant labourers via direct spending, and

generating employment via enhanced allocation to MNREGA,

3) Small traders, vendors and farmers via loan facilities and 4)

Announced structural reforms across sectors like coal, power,

agriculture, etc.

On the monetary policy side, the RBI also took a number of

steps to provide liquidity and enhance credit flow in the system.

It delivered a total rate cut (repo) of 115 bps since February 2020,

taking the repo rate down to 4.0 per cent. The central bank also

took a slew of measures to address liquidity constraints such

as the announcement of moratorium, liquidity infusion through

TLTRO (Targeted Long Term Repo Operations) for NBFCs

(` 500 billion), liquidity facility of ` 500 billion for mutual funds,

liquidity support of ` 500 billion for all India financial institutions

and a cut in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 100 bps to 3

per cent. These measures helped anchor borrowing costs in

the economy, support credit growth and cushioned the impact

of the disruptions in the financial market (Please refer to the

Macroeconomic and Industry section on page 128 for

more details).

The Budget announcements for FY 2021-22 too have given

confidence to business with its focus on stimulating growth

through expansionary fiscal policy at the centre and increasing

capital expenditure at the central as well as state Government

levels.

While all these have been clear positives, what has cast a

shadow on the economy again has been the resurgence of the

pandemic in many parts of the country, resulting in partial or

complete lockdowns. The mitigating factor has been the arrival

of the vaccine and the decision to step up the vaccination drive

by making all those over 18 years eligible for taking the vaccine.

The Government has invited more manufacturers from abroad

to come to India to boost supply in the country.

In this uncertain environment, your Bank continued on its growth

path by conducting its business responsibly and reinforcing its

commitment to the environment and community at large.

Financial Parameters

Your Bank recorded an improvement in a majority of its key

financial parameters, largely due to its prudent credit evaluation

of targeted customers and diversified loan book across

customer segments, products, and sectors. Managing risk-

return decisions with discipline also contributed to the Bank’s

performance. Net Profit at ` 31,116.5 crore went up by 18.5

per cent. Net Interest Income at ` 64,879.6 crore rose 15.5 per

cent. Net Interest Margin remained stable at 4.1 per cent. Gross

Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) at 1.32 per cent were among the

lowest in the industry.

Parivartan

Your Bank continued to transform lives through its umbrella CSR

brand, Parivartan, which denotes change.

The Bank believes that businesses can only prosper if the

communities in which they operate prosper as well. This belief

has inspired its social initiatives, which have potentially made a

difference to the lives of over 8.5 crore people, predominantly

in rural India. Driving this change is the Sustainable Livelihood

Initiative (SLI) team, which employs about 10 per cent of the

Bank’s workforce and works exclusively on improving livelihood

opportunities. The ‘Teaching-The-Teacher’ initiative has

impacted over 2 crore students since inception. The Holistic

Rural Development Programme has touched another 20 lakh

people across more than 1,970 villages. Having an umbrella

brand enables the Bank to lend a sharper focus to these efforts.

Your Directors are also happy to report that your Bank met the

mandatory CSR expenditure through a spend of ` 634.91 crore.

The Bank contributed ` 70 crore towards Prime Minister’s CARES

Fund to support the Government’s fight against the COVID-19

pandemic.

Summary

In FY 2021-22, the pandemic and vaccination drive are critical

factors for the pace of economic recovery. In the near-term, the

resurgence of COVID-19 cases across the country does pose

a risk to the pace of economic recovery but the absence of a

national lockdown is a positive. This, of course, poses challenges

for your Bank in the short run.

In the long run, the market in the post-pandemic recovery period

presents tremendous opportunities, given the under-penetration

of banking services in the country. Your Bank is well positioned

to capitalise on these opportunities, given the strength of its

major franchises. It is also poised to make a greater contribution

to bridge the urban-rural divide - be it through its business or

social initiatives. This, of course, will not be possible without

the contribution of the ever-growing family of over two lakh

employees (including those of the subsidiaries) across the

country, who remain at the forefront of taking your Bank forward

every day.

Your Directors would like to especially thank those who went

well beyond their call of duty during the COVID-19 pandemic

to keep your Bank functioning. Many of them soldiered on

despite the loss of loved ones. During the year, we also lost a

few of our colleagues. While we have structured a compensaton

package for the families of the deceased, no word or action can

adequately convey our sorrow.

Your Directors would also like to place on record that we did

not reduce salaries during this trying period. Your Bank paid

bonuses and increments on time in the year under review and

followed the normal promotion cycle. It is doing the same this

year as well.

Mission and Strategic Focus

Your Bank’s mission is to be a ‘World-Class Indian Bank’. Its

business philosophy is based on five core values: Customer

Focus, Operational Excellence, Product Leadership, People and

Sustainability. Sustainability should be viewed in unison with

Environmental, Social and Governance performance. As a part

of this, your Bank, through its umbrella CSR brand Parivartan,

seeks to bring about change in the lives of communities mainly

in rural India.

During the year under review, the bank did not lose its human

touch but continued building sound customer franchises across

distinct businesses to achieve healthy growth in profitability

consistent with your Bank’s risk appetite.

In line with the above objective, the Bank aims to take digitalisation

to the next level to:

t Deliver superior experience and greater convenience to

customers

t Increase market share in India’s growing banking and financial

services industry

t Expand geographical reach

t Cross-sell the broad financial product portfolio

t Sustain strong asset quality through disciplined credit risk

management

t Maintain low cost of funds

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Managing Director.

The Compliance function independently tracks, reviews and

ensures compliance with regulatory guidelines and promotes a

compliance culture in the Bank.

Your Bank has a comprehensive Know Your Customer,

Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of

Terrorism (CFT) policy (based on the RBI guidelines/provisions

of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002) incorporating

the key elements of Customer Acceptance Policy, Customer

Identification Procedures, Risk Management and Monitoring of

Transactions. The policy is subjected to an annual review and is

duly approved by the Board.

Performance

How We

Create Value

Your Bank has taken significant measures in developing and

enhancing an effective and sustainable KYC AML and CFT

Compliance Programme. Adherence to the guidelines prescribed

in the policy is monitored by your Bank at various stages of the

customer lifecycle. Your Bank has robust controls in place to

ensure adherence to the KYC guidelines at the time of account

opening.

Your Bank also has a continuous review process in the form

of transaction monitoring, including a dedicated AML CFT

monitoring team, which carries out transaction reviews for

identification of suspicious patterns/trends that helps your Bank

to further carry out enhanced due diligence and appropriate

actions thereafter. The status of adherence to the KYC, AML and

CFT guidelines is also placed before the Audit Committee of the

Board for their review at quarterly intervals.

The Audit team and the Compliance team undergo regular

training both in-house and external to equip them with the

necessary knowhow and expertise to carry out the function.

The Audit Committee of the Board reviews the effectiveness

of controls, compliance with regulatory guidelines as also the

performance of the Audit and Compliance functions in your Bank

and provides direction, wherever deemed fit.

Your Bank has always adhered to the highest standards of

compliance and has put in place appropriate controls and risk

measurement and risk management tools to ensure a robust

compliance and governance structure.

G) Performance of Subsidiary Companies

Your Bank has two subsidiaries, HDB Financial Services Limited

(HDBFSL) and HDFC Securities Limited (HSL). HDBFSL is a

leading NBFC that caters primarily to segments not covered

by the Bank while HSL is among India’s largest retail broking

firms. The financial results of the subsidiaries are prepared in

accordance with notified Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind-AS’)

with effect from April 1, 2018 (April 1, 2017 being the transition

date). Accordingly, the financial results for the comparative

reporting period have also been prepared in accordance

therewith.

The detailed financial performance of the companies is given

below.

Transacting customers of HSL

10.10 lakh

HDFC Securities Limited (HSL)

HSL’s Total Income under Indian Accounting Standards was

` 1,399.43 crore as against ` 862.26 crore in the previous year

and Net Profit was ` 703.23 crore as against ` 384.15 crore in

the previous year. The company has a customer base of 27.26

lakh to whom it offers an exhaustive range of investment and

protection products. In the year under review, HSL had 10.10

lakh (a little over a million) transacting customers. The focus

on digitisation continued. Notably, 92 per cent of its customers

accessed its services digitally, against 79 per cent in the previous

year.

In a conscious effort to rationalise the distribution network with

greater emphasis on digital offerings, HSL consolidated its

existing branches to end with 216 branches across 159 cities/

towns at the end of the year. It created Digital Boarding Journeys

which led to more than 50% customers being onboarded digitally.

In the case of Margin Trade Funding (MTF), the average book

size during the year was ` 932 crore, which is 71% higher than

the average book size of ` 544 crore in the last financial year.

The book size at the year end stands at ` 1,680 crore. The

stock markets started FY 2020-21 with pessimism and ended

with optimism. An important indicator of this has been the Nifty

50’s sharp swing from 8,473 in March 2020 to 14,720 by the

end of the year. This resulted in HSL’s improved performance.

The benchmark index Nifty rose 73% whereas the Sensex rose

68% over this year. Digitisation, along with the vaccination drive,

the various stimulus packages and the FY 2021-22 Budget have

added to investor confidence in the markets.

As on March 31, 2021, your Bank held 96.34% stake in HSL.

HDB’s AUM

` 61,560.7 crore

as of March 31, 2021

HDB Financial Services Limited

Incorporated in 2007, HDB Financial Services Limited (‘HDB’) is

a subsidiary company of HDFC Bank. It has a strong network of

over 1,319 branches spread across 959 cities/towns. HDB’s net

interest income grew 6.8 per cent to ` 4,262.7 crore for the year

ended March 31, 2021, from ` 3,991.0 crore in the year ended

March 31, 2020. Profit for the year under review was ` 502.8

crore against ` 1,036.9 crore in the previous year. Its Assets

Under Management for the year ended March 31, 2021 stood

at ` 61,560.7 crore. HDB is a leading NBFC that caters to the

evolving needs of its customers by re-imagining opportunities

and fulfilling their aspirations. As a one-stop financial services

provider, HDB offers a comprehensive suite of products and

service offerings that are tailor-made to suit its customers’

requirements, including first-time borrowers and the under-

served segments.

Products

HDB is engaged in the business of Loans, Fee based products

and BPO services.

letter addressed to the Chief

of Internal Vigilance of the Bank. Such complaints can also be

filed directly by the employee in the internal Information Portal of

the Bank. In case the whistle blower wishes to raise a complaint

directly to the members of the Audit Committee of the Board

(ACB), and not through above mentioned normal channels, the

complaint may be directly made to the Chairperson of the ACB.

All such complaints are enquired into by the appropriate authority

within the Bank while ensuring confidentiality of the identity of

such complainants. On the basis of their investigation, if the

allegations are proved to be correct, then the Competent

Authority shall recommend to the appropriate Disciplinary

Authority to take suitable action against the responsible official

and corrective measures in consultation with the concerned

stakeholders. The decision of the Whistle Blower Committee

is final and binding on all. Other actions/measures considered

necessary to prevent/ curb recurrence of events are also taken

by the Competent Authority.

Details of whistle blower complaints received and subsequent

action taken and the functioning of the Whistle Blower

mechanism are reviewed periodically by the ACB. No person

has been denied access to the ACB. During the financial year

2020-21, a total of 86 such complaints were received and taken

up for investigation of which 56 whistle blower complaints were

resolved as of March 31, 2021. Further, 21 cases have resulted in

certain staff actions post investigation. The broad categories of

whistle blower complaints were in the areas of improper business

practices, behavioural related issues and corruption related.

The Whistle Blower Policy is available on the website of the

Bank at the link- https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/about-

us/corporate-governance/codes-and-policies

Securities Class Action Suit

On September 3, 2020, a securities class action lawsuit was filed

against the Bank and certain of its current and former officers in

the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New

York. The complaint was amended on February 8, 2021. The

amended complaint alleges that the Bank, its former Managing

Director, Mr. Aditya Puri, and the present: Managing Director

& CEO, Mr. Sashidhar Jagdishan made materially false and

misleading statements regarding certain aspects of the Bank’s

business and compliance policies, which resulted in the Bank’s

American Depository Share price declining on July 13, 2020

thereby allegedly causing damage to the Bank’s investors. The

Bank believes that the asserted claims are baseless and without

merit and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations.

March 31, 2021, the Profit and Loss Account, Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial

statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial

statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in

the manner so required for Banking Companies and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally

accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2021 and its profit and its cash flows for the year ended on

that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our

responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial

Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of

Chartered Accountants of India (“the ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone

financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities

in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient

and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to Note 43 of Schedule 18 to the standalone financial statements, which describes the extent to which the

COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the Bank’s standalone financial statements will depend on ongoing and future

developments, which are highly uncertain.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone

financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial

statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

d)

Employee Stock Option Plan (‘ESOP’s)

The Bank considers ESOPs as a vehicle to create a balance between short term rewards and long term

sustainable value creation. ESOPs play a key role in the attraction and retention of key talent. The Bank grants

equity share options to its Whole Time Directors and other employees above a certain grade. All plans for

grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and

are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post approval by

the NRC.

The NRC grants options after considering parameters such as the incumbent’s grade and performance rating,

and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate by the NRC. Equity share options granted to the Whole

Time Directors are also subject to the approval of the NRC, the Board of Directors of the Bank and the RBI.

The Bank grants ESOPs to eligible employees. Such ESOPs vest over four tranches spread over a period of

48 months. The ESOPs granted subsequent to April 1, 2019 vest no faster than on a pro rata basis.

III. Remuneration Processes

Fitment at the time of Hire

Pay scales at the Bank are set basis the job size, experience, location and the academic and professional credentials

of the incumbent.

The compensation of new hires is in line with the existing pay ranges and consistent with the compensation levels of

the existing employees of the Bank at similar profiles. The pay ranges are subject to change basis market trends and

the Bank’s talent management priorities. While the Bank believes in the internal equity and parity as a key determinant

of pay, it does acknowledge the external competitive pressures of the talent market. Accordingly, there could be

certain key profiles with critical competencies which may be hired at a premium and treated as an exception to the

overall pay philosophy. Any deviation from the defined pay ranges is treated as a hiring exception requiring approval

with appropriate justification.







1BZ*ODSFNFOU1BZ3FWJTJPO

The Bank strives to ensure external competitiveness as well as internal equity without diluting the overall focus on

optimising cost. In order to enhance the Bank’s external competitiveness, it participates in an annual salary survey of

the banking sector to understand key market trends as well as get insights on relative market pay position compared

to peers. The Bank endeavors to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of

fixed pay over time. This coupled with key internal data indicators like performance score, job family, experience,

job grade and salary budget form the basis of decision making on revisions in fixed pay.

Increments in fixed pay for majority of the employee population are generally undertaken once every financial year.

However, promotions, confirmations and change in job dimensions could also lead to a change in the fixed pay

during other times of the financial year.

The Bank also makes salary corrections and adjustments during the financial year for competitive pay positioning of those

employees who have a good performance track record. However, such pay revisions are done on an exception basis.

Risk, Control and Compliance Staff

The Bank has separated the Risk, Control and Compliance functions from the Business functions in order to create a

strong culture of checks and balances and to eliminate any possible conflict of interest between revenue generation

and risk management and control. Accordingly, the overall variable pay as well as the annual salary increment of the

employees in the Risk, Control and Compliance functions is based on their performance, functional objectives and

goals. The Bank ensures that the mix of fixed to variable compensation for these functions is weighted in favour of

fixed compensation.

C. Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration

processes, including the nature and type of the key measures used to take account of these risks

The Bank takes into account various types of risks in its remuneration processes. The Bank follows a comprehensive

framework that includes within its ambit the key dimensions of remuneration such as fixed pay, variable pay and long

term incentives (i.e. Employee Stock Options).

Fixed pay: The Bank conducts a comprehensive market benchmarking study to ensure that employees are competitively

positioned in terms of fixed pay. The Bank follows a robust salary review process wherein revisions in fixed compensation

are based on performance. The Bank also makes salary adjustments taking into consideration pay positioning of

employees vis-à-vis market reference points. Through this approach the Bank endeavors to ensure that the talent risk due

to attrition is mitigated. Fixed pay could be revised downwards as well, in the event of certain proven cases of misconduct

by an employee.

Variable pay: The Bank has distinct types of variable pay plans as given below:

(a)

Quarterly / monthly performance-linked pay (PLP) plans:

All quarterly / monthly PLP plans are based on the principle of balanced scorecard framework that includes within

its ambit both quantitative and qualitative factors including key strategic objectives that ensure future competitive

advantage for the Bank. PLP plans, by design, have deterrents that play a role of moderating payouts based on the

non-fulfillment of established quantitative / qualitative risk factors. Deterrents also include risks arising out of non-

compliance, mis-sell etc. Further, a portion of all payouts under the PLP plans is deferred till the end of the financial

year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are part of the PLP plans are excluded from

the Annual Bonus Plan.

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Managing Director resulting in an incident of willful and deliberate misinterpretation /

misreporting of financial performance (inflating the financials) of the Bank, for a financial year, which comes

to light in the subsequent three years, the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of bonus payout

received pertaining to the relevant performance year.

The specific criteria on the applicability of malus and claw back arrangements are reviewed by the NRC annually.

Employees other than Whole Time Directors

The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:





t

"OOVBMCPOVTQMBO

The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the individual employee,

job band of the employee and the functional category. Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk

alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed. Market trends for specific businesses / functions along

with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout.

Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the quantum

and the method of payout across functions. Typically higher levels of responsibility receive a higher proportion of

variable pay vis-à-vis fixed pay. The Bank ensures that the time horizon for risk is assessed and the deferment period,

if any, for bonus is set accordingly. Employees on the annual bonus plan are not part of the PLPs.

The following is taken into account while administering the annual bonus:

In the event the proportion of variable pay exceeds 50% of fixed pay, for employees in certain grades, the Bank

has devised the following deferment schedule after taking into consideration the nature of risk, time horizon of

risk, and the materiality of risk.

In cases of deferment of variable pay, the Bank makes an assessment prior to the due date for payment of

the deferred portion for any negative contribution. The criteria for negative contribution are decided basis pre-

defined financial benchmarks. The Bank has in place appropriate methods for prevention of vesting of deferred

variable pay or any part thereof, on account of negative contribution. The Bank also has in place claw back

arrangements in relation to amounts already paid in the eventuality of a negative contribution.

PLPs are formulated for sales personnel who are given sales targets but have limited impact on risk since credit

decisions are exercised independent of the sales function. All PLP payouts are subject to the achievement of

individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred

till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks.

F.

Description of the different forms of variable remuneration (i.e. cash, shares, ESOPs and other

forms) that the Bank utilises and the rationale for using these different forms

The Bank recognises the importance of variable pay in reinforcing a pay for performance culture. Variable pay stimulates

employees to stretch their abilities to exceed expectations.

These are paid to reward performance for a given financial year. This covers all employees (excluding employees

under PLPs). This is based on performance of the business unit, performance rating, job band and functional

category of the individual. For higher job bands the proportion of variable pay to total compensation tends to be

higher.

t

These are paid to frontline sales staff for the achievement of specific sales targets but have limited impact on risk as

credit decisions are exercised independent of the sales function. Further, it has been the endeavor of the Bank to

ensure that the objectives set are based on the principles of a balanced scorecard that takes into account quantitative

and qualitative measures rather than just the achievement of financial numbers. Further all PLPs have inherent risk

adjustment mechanisms manifested in the form of deterrents. All PLP payouts are subject to the achievement of

parameters, both qualitative and quantitative enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees. A portion

of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks.

This is to reward for contribution of employees in creating a long term, sustainable earnings and enhancing shareholder

value. Only employees in a certain job band and with a specific performance rating are eligible for stock options.

Performance is the key criteria for granting stock options.

G. Key changes to the Remuneration Policy pursuant to the revised guidelines on remuneration issued

by the RBI on November 4, 2019

27. Segment reporting

Business segments

Business segments have been identified and reported taking into account, the target customer profile, the nature of products

and services, the differing risks and returns, the organisation structure, the internal business reporting system and the guidelines

prescribed by RBI. The Bank operates in the following segments:

a)

Treasury

The treasury segment primarily consists of net interest earnings from the Bank’s investment portfolio, money market

borrowing and lending, gains or losses on investment operations and on account of trading in foreign exchange and

derivative contracts.

b)

Retail banking

The retail banking segment serves retail customers through the Bank’s branch network and other channels. This segment

raises deposits from customers and provides loans and other services to customers with the help of specialist product

groups. Exposures are classified under retail banking taking into account the status of the borrower (orientation criterion),

the nature of product, granularity of the exposure and the quantum thereof.

Revenues of the retail banking segment are derived from interest earned on retail loans, interest earned from other

segments for surplus funds placed with those segments, subvention received from dealers and manufacturers, fees from

services rendered, foreign exchange earnings on retail products etc. Expenses of this segment primarily comprise interest

expense on deposits, commission paid to retail assets sales agents, infrastructure and premises expenses for operating

the branch network and other delivery channels, personnel costs, other direct overheads and allocated expenses of

specialist product groups, processing units and support groups.

How We

Create Value

The impact of COVID-19, including changes in customer behaviour and pandemic fears, as well as restrictions on business and

individual activities, has led to significant volatility in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and

local economic activities. The slowdown during the year led to a decrease in loan originations, the sale of third party products,

the use of credit and debit cards by customers and the efficiency in collection efforts. This may lead to a rise in the number

of customer defaults and consequently an increase in provisions thereagainst. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic,

including the current “second wave” that has significantly increased the number of cases in India, will continue to impact the

Bank’s results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among other

things, any new information concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and any action to contain its spread or mitigate

its impact whether government-mandated or elected by us.

In accordance with the COVID-19 Regulatory Packages announced by the RBI on March 27, 2020, April 17, 2020 and May 23,

2020, the Bank, in accordance with its board approved policy, offered a moratorium on the repayment of all instalments and

/ or interest, as applicable, due between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 to all eligible borrowers classified as standard,

even if overdue, as on February 29, 2020. In respect of such accounts that were granted moratorium, the asset classification

remained standstill during the moratorium period.

The disclosures as required by the RBI circular dated April 17, 2020 are given below:

In accordance with the instructions in the paragraph 5 of the RBI circular dated April 07, 2021, the Bank shall refund / adjust

‘interest on interest’ to all borrowers including those who had availed of working capital facilities during the moratorium

period, irrespective of whether moratorium had been fully or partially availed, or not availed. Pursuant to these instructions,

the methodology for calculation of the amount of such ‘interest on interest’ would be finalised by the Indian Banks Association

(IBA) in consultation with other industry participants / bodies and is awaited as on the date of approval of financial statements.

The Bank has however estimated the said amount and recognised a charge of ` 470.00 crore in its Profit and Loss Account

for the year ended March 31, 2021.

45. Comparative figures

Figures for the previous year have been regrouped and reclassified wherever necessary to conform to the current year’s
