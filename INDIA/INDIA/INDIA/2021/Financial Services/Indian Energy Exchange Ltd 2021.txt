Managing Director

The strength and robustness of your Company’s business

model along with regulatory and policy initiatives towards

deepening the power markets, enabled Power Exchange

Markets to continue their growth despite a challenging year

for the economy and humanity.

Fiscal year 2021 was an exemplary year in the 13-year

journey of your Company. The year was marked by digital

transformation and the launch of new market segments to

meet the dynamic power procurement needs of the market

participants. When the entire economy was under lockdown

for an extended period due to the pandemic, your Company

ensured 24x7 operations of the Exchange through a robust

business continuity plan and helped distribution utilities

provide uninterrupted power supply to their customers in the

most cost-efficient way.

The competitive price discovery on the platform has further

provided an opportunity for cost optimization to market

participants, leading to a reduction in the cost of doing

business. Many state distribution companies are buying

power from the Exchange platform to get flexibility and

transparency and to optimize their power procurement

cost. In fact, the Andhra Pradesh Central Power Distribution

Corporation saved more than INR 2300 cr in the last two

years by procuring power through the Exchange Markets.

During the year, we launched new market segments and

received a very encouraging response from our customers. The

Real Time Market (RTM), for which we operate 48 half- hourly

auctions every day, allows customers to purchase power at

an hour’s notice. The market launched on June 1, 2020 has

been supporting Discoms to manage their demand-supply

variations and renewable energy integration in an efficient

and effective manner besides supporting safe and reliable

grid operation. We also forayed into renewables trading with

the launch of Green Term Ahead Market (GTAM) on August

21, 2020. As India moves towards large scale renewable

capacity additions, both these markets will play a key role in

meeting our national sustainability aspirations. Recently, we

also commenced the much-awaited Cross Border Electricity

Trade, towards our endeavor to create a South Asian Regional

Power Market.

Government is working towards

building an efficient power sector

The Power sector has witnessed several significant

developments in the last few years. With peak demand at

190GW vis-à-vis installed capacity at 380GW, India is now a

power surplus country. On the transmission side, our country

has successfully developed an integrated single grid, which

is the largest in the world. Power can now flow seamlessly

across the country resulting in ‘one nation one price’ round

the year. Further, the Government has approved a revamped

reforms-based result-linked power distribution sector

scheme with an outlay of INR 3 lakh crores over the next 5

years to improve operational efficiency and financial viability

of Discoms. This will help build a commercially viable power

sector, which is necessary to ensure a vibrant power market.

Andhra Pradesh saved more than Rs 2,300 crores

in the last two years by purchasing electricity in

Exchange markets at cost effective prices.

INDIAN ENERGY EXCHANGE:

letter

dated April 28, 2020, advised generating companies to make

efforts to replace their import for blending purposes with

domestic coal.

India has signed Memorandum of Understanding with Bhutan,

Bangladesh, Nepal, and Myanmar to inter-alia improve power

connectivity with these neighbouring countries for cross

border trade of electricity.

In order to address the problems faced by electricity Distribution

Companies due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Ministry of Power

issued directions to Central Electricity Regulatory Commission,

for specifying reduced rate of Late Payment Surcharge for

payments which become delayed beyond a period of 45

days (from the date of presentation of the bill) during the

period from March 24, 2020 to June 30, 2020 to generating

companies and licensees treating the restrictions placed by

the central government vide its order dated March 24, 2020 to

contain COVID-19 as an event of force majeure.

Guidelines for procurement of Round the Clock power from RE

through Tariff Based Competitive Bidding were issued by the

Ministry of Power, with the aim of promoting RE power and to

provide round the clock power to the distribution utilities from

renewable energy sources.

To adequately address the issues w.r.t Change in Law instances

and compensation to Renewable Energy generators for loss

of generation due to non-scheduling issues, a draft Electricity

(Change in Law, Must-run status, and other Matters) Rules,

2020 was issued by the Power Ministry.

Regulatory Initiatives: Centre

The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission notified various

regulations such as amendment to DSM regulations linking

deviation settlement with power exchange price, regulations

for sharing of inter-State Transmission charges and losses and

the Power Market Regulations, 2021. The Sharing Regulations

came into effect from November 2020 and have exempted

the distribution utilities from paying their Short-Term Open

Access charges if their overall drawl/injection is within long-

term access /medium-term open access. Power Market

Regulations 2021 will facilitate the Power Exchanges to

introduce contracts for trade beyond 11 days, giving flexibility

to the Power Exchanges to introduce new bid types or bring

certain changes in the operations without going through the

time-taking approval process. Central Electricity Regulatory

Commission has also accorded its approval to new contracts

for real time trade and green energy trade through Real Time

Market and Green Term Ahead Market during the fiscal.

year 2020. Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission and

Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission took the initiative of

linking Deviation Settlement Mechanism price with Exchange

Prices, Maharashtra issued the Revised Grid Code Regulations

and Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission issued

the Merit Order Despatch regulations. The increasingly high

competitiveness of Renewable Energy is prompting several

states like Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka to issue

the draft notifications for rolling back the exemptions earlier

provided to RE sector to help them integrate with the market

and make them self-sustainable. Orissa Electricity Regulatory

Commission issued the new Open Access regulations and

Gujarat issued the Solar Policy 2021.

Power markets: Key drivers for growth

The short-term power market in India is set to transform. The

sector is poised to recover following the overall economic

growth expected by the Reserve Bank of India, which has

predicted a robust GDP growth at 10.5% in fiscal 2022. The

highest ever peak demand at 189.6 GW seen during January

2021 is an indicator of the strong growth due in the next fiscal.

Managing Director & CEO of the Company,

had resigned from his post on 24 August 2020, with

immediate effect, and the position of Managing

Director & CEO of the Company became vacant.

It is further informed that the Company commenced

the search process for identifying a suitable candidate

for the position of: Managing Director of the Company,

however due to COVID and other factors the process

could not get completed within the stipulated time

frame of six months. Also, as IEX is in a unique business

segment and with its complex and specialized nature

of business, it would require a candidate with

specialized experience and qualification, which shall

also meet the requirements of Power Market

Regulations with respect to qualification and market

experience.

As per the provisions of section 203(4) of the

Companies Act, 2013, if the office of any whole-time

key managerial personnel is vacated, the resulting

vacancy shall be filled-up by the Board at a meeting of

the Board within a period of six months from the date

of such vacancy. Accordingly, the Company had to fill

up the said vacancy on or before February 23, 2021 to

avoid any statutory default. Similarly, the CERC (Power

Market)

Regulations,

2010

(“Power

Market

Regulations”), also requires that a Power Exchange

shall have a Managing Director & CEO who shall be

solely responsible for running of day-to-day operations

of the Power Exchange.

Considering that the search for new Managing

Director will take some time till things normalize and

the Company was required to have a leader for

managing the business and affairs of the Company on

full time basis till the time new Managing Director joins

the Company therefore to ensure compliance with

Statutory requirements, the Board of Directors of the

Company on recommendation of the Nomination and

Remuneration Committee (NRC) has appointed Mr.

Satyanarayan Goel, (who earlier held the position of

non-executive

Managing Director & CEO and during this time the

Company has performed exceptionally well in terms of

business with about 60% growth in the volumes.

Therefore, as a token of recognition and appreciation

of his efforts and intrinsic guidance to the Company

during this period, the Board based on the

recommendations of Nomination and Remuneration

Committee has proposed to compensate him by paying

one time amount of Rs. 35 lakh (Rupees Thirty-Five

Lakh only) as an honorarium for the deep guidance and

time devoted by him during the absence of MD & CEO

(i.e. period starting from August 24, 2021 till February

18, 2021), subject to the Shareholders approval, and

other applicable provisions of Companies Act 2013

and SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015.

Members are informed that the proposed one time

payment of Rs. 35 lakh shall be in addition to aforesaid

commission paid to him as Non-Executive Chairman.

This is to further clarify that the aforesaid commission

as Non-Executive Chairman was paid only till February

18, 2021, as w.e.f. February 19, 2021, Mr. Goel was

appointed as Chairman and: Managing

Managing Director

and Chief Executive Officer of the

Company.
