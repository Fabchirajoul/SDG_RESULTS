MANAGING DIRECTOR

A digital future,

built on sustainability: Dear Shareholders,

I want to start by wishing all of you and your loved ones good

health. FY21 was an extraordinary year by any measure and it

was a year of unprecedented challenges both at personal and

professional levels. The year had a considerable amount of

uncertainty with the virulent outbreak of COVID-19, followed by

stricter lockdowns, bringing economic activities to a standstill.

The Indian economy has shown great resilience towards the

COVID-19 challenges and after reporting two-quarters of

negative GDP, we saw a strong economic recovery in the 2nd

half of FY 21. However, the economic recovery got interrupted

by the 2nd wave of COVID-19. The economic impact of 2nd wave

of COVID-19 has been severe but short term compared to last

year. As the pandemic gets under control and the vaccination

drive is lifting consumer and business confdence, economic

recovery is expected to gain momentum as the year progresses.

Measures announced by the Government of India and

accommodative policies by RBI, will continue to boost the overall

economic growth.

We, being part of the essential services, have to balance between

customer convenience and the safety of our employees. We have

accorded the highest priority to continuity of the services to our

customers and the safety of our employees during the

pandemic. IndusInd Bank has taken several signifcant steps in

improving client experience including an “All-in-One store” in the

IndusMobile App, Video Branch, Video KYC, Banking on

WhatsApp and Alexa-based servicing, supported by

Natural Language Processing. We have deployed a large scale

Work From Home setup for over 15,000 staf. We have also

conducted a large scale vaccination drive and over 40,000 i.e

70% of the employees in the Bank and our MFI subsidiary have

received a minimum of one dose of vaccine.

It was my frst fnancial year as the Managing
