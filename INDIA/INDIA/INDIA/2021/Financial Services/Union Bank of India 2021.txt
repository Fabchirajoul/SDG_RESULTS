Dear Shareholders,

The Board of Directors are pleased to present the 102nd

Annual Report of the Bank for the Financial Year 2020-

21 together with the ‘Audited Balance Sheet’, ‘Profit &

Loss Account’, ‘Cash-Flow Statement’ and the report on

‘Management Discussion & Analysis’. The ‘Corporate

Governance Report’ and ‘Business Responsibility Report’

also form part of the Annual Report 2020-21.

1. Highlights:

1.1 The year 2020-21 was dominated by the COVID-19

pandemic and the resultant global economic

downturn, the most severe one since the Global

Financial

Crisis.

The

lockdowns

and

social

distancing norms brought the already slowing

global economy to a standstill. As per the latest

World Economic Outlook of International Monetary

Fund (IMF), the Global economic output contracted

by 3.3% in 2020.

1.2 Governments and central banks across the world

deployed a range of policy tools to support their

economies, such as, lowering key policy rates,

quantitative easing measures, loan guarantees,

cash transfers and fiscal stimulus measures. The

global economy is projected to grow at 6% in 2021,

moderating to 4.4% in 2022. Among advanced

economies, the United States is expected to surpass

its pre-COVID GDP level this year, while many others

in the group will return to their pre-COVID levels

only in 2022. For emerging and developing market

economies, China had already returned to pre-

COVID GDP in 2020, whereas many others are not

expected to do so until 2023.

1.3 For the Indian economy, the year 2020-21 was

challenging due to both supply and demand side

disruptions, due to the pandemic. The Indian

economy entered a technical recession in the first

half of FY21 with GDP plunging by 24.4% in Q1 FY21,

7.4% in Q2 FY21. India recognized the disruptive

impact of the pandemic and charted its own unique

path amidst its huge population, high population

density and an overburdened health infrastructure.

The intense lockdown implemented at the start of the

pandemic characterized India’s unique response in

several ways. The Government has ramped up its

fiscal spending through Atmanirbhar scheme and a

favorable monetary policy ensured support for the

economy.

1.4 Union Budget 2021-22 has further provided a strong

fillip to the capex momentum with clear emphasis

on infrastructure investment, as a key focus area, to

revive demand and overall growth.

Setting up the National Bank for Financing

Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), as

the principal Development Financial Institution

(DFIs) for infrastructure financing and aiming to

achieve lending of Rs.5 lakh crore in 3 years to

infrastructure projects, is an important measure.

It will also dovetail with the ongoing efforts of the

government to enhance capital for implementing

infrastructure projects under National Infrastructure

Pipeline (NIP). Further, the setting up of an Asset

Reconstruction and Asset Management Company

(ARC&AMC) to clear off the bad loans, privatization

of two PSU banks and the enhancement of FDI limits

in insurance from existing 49% to 74% are some of

the important reform measures announced by the

Government in the Budget.

1.5 During the year 2020-21, the RBI undertook several

conventional and unconventional measures to

ensure ample system-level liquidity as well as

targeted liquidity to support vulnerable sectors,

institutions and financial instruments. The RBI

ensured immediate relief to debtors via temporary

loan moratorium, while unclogging monetary

policy transmission. Besides this, the regulator has

allowed a one-time restructuring scheme to help

companies and individuals to manage the financial

stress caused by the Covid 19 pandemic.

1.6 Prospects for 2021-22 have strengthened with

the progress of the vaccination programme. High

frequency indicators point to the growth momentum

gaining strength, especially in the fourth quarter of

FY 2020-21. The GDP shrugged off the contractions

in the preceding quarters and moved into expansion

zone in the third and fourth quarter of FY 2020-21.

However, the recent surge in infections has imparted

greater uncertainty to the outlook, especially as

localized and regional lockdowns could dampen

the improvement in demand conditions and may

delay the return of normalcy.

15.1Union Bank of India has been in the forefront

in meeting its CSR commitments. Towards this

the Bank has established Union Bank Social

Foundation Trust (UBSFT) in the year 2006

as an extended arm for carrying out the CSR

activities of the Bank. The major CSR activities

of the Bank are now being carried out through

the UBSFT. Its Board is headed by the Bank’s: Managing Director & CEO with executive

DPSS.CO. RPPD.No.309:04.07.005:2020-21 dated

the customers’ interest and avoid possible dispute

and time taken in settlement of such disputes and

to have cross verification system available to the

officials to review the information in Positive Pay

System to take the decision on behalf of customer.

24.6 Digital Document Execution: Bank has tied up

with NeSL for execution of loan documents in case

of personal and vehicles through digital mode.

namely Rajasthan, Delhi, UP, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka,

the Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to the Standalone Financail

Statements as at 31 March 2021.

Letter DOS.ARG.

No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020 (as amended) (the “RBI communication”)

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Union Bank of India (“the Bank”) as of March

31, 2021 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date

which includes internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Bank’s branches.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal

control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control

stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute

of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of

adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its

business, including adherence to the Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of

frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable

financial information, as required under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the circulars and guidelines issued by

the Reserve Bank of India.

Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on

our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and

the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by the ICAI, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls.

Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the

audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting were

established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls

over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting

included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that

a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal financial

controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the

assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors, in terms

of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our

audit opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance

regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial

reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable

detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable

assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance

with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made only

in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable assurance

regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank’s assets that could

have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of

collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and:
