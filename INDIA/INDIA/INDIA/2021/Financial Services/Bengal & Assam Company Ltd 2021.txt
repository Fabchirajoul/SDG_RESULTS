(Rajasthan Government) shown under the heading “Deposit with Government Authorities and others”. In

view of the fact that the materials supplied met all the quality specifications and was accepted by the said

corporation, the receivable is considered good and recoverable. During the previous year the arbitration was

adjudged against the Company on grounds of limitation. The subsidiary company is of the opinion that the

arbitrator has erroneously denied the benefit of section 19 of the limitation act to the subsidiary company by

falsely appropriating the part payments to specific supplies made/seeds under subject agreements, when

clearly subject transaction was a composite transaction and part payment was not made for any specific supply/

letter of credit to the extent possible. The Company has a well defined sales policy to minimize its risk of

credit defaults. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and assessed. Impairment analysis

is performed based on historical data at each reporting date on an individual basis. However, a large number

of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively.

The Group applies expected credit losses (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of loss allowance on

financial assets measured at amortised cost, wherever required.

(iii)

Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk, where the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations

associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s

approach is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due,

under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the

Group’s reputation. The table below summarizes the maturity profile of Group’s financial liabilities based on

contractual undiscounted payments :-
