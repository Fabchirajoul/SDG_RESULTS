Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to

write to you as the Chairman of your

Company, and present the 33rd Annual

Report and consolidated financial

statements of PNB Housing Finance

Limited (PNB Housing) for the financial

year ended March 31, 2021.

The COVID-19 led pandemic, which

unfolded during the last quarter of

FY 2019-20, had unprecedented impact

on the human life as well as economies

across the globe. The complete lockdown

witnessed during the first quarter had

a deep impact on the economy and led

to steep fall in the domestic output.

A series of measures taken following

the unlock phase helped the economy

recover in the second half of the year.

However, the pace of recovery was

impacted again by the second wave

which resulted in localized restrictions in

movement and economic activities.

The healthcare and the frontline workers

have been the pillars of support during

these challenging times, and we are

forever grateful to them for their

unconditional services.

At PNB Housing, we supported

the government’s initiatives to

help individuals and businesses by

implementing measures like moratorium,

Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme 2.0,

Emergency Credit Line Guarantee

Scheme; and also participating in

Special Refinance Facility, Targeted

Long-Term Repo Operations, deferment

of interest on working capital facilities,

among others.

The RBI took decisive steps to ease the

monetary policy to help the economy

recover from this unprecedented shock.

There have been subsequent cuts in

repo rates to support liquidity. The RBI

pushed more than `2.7 lakh crores

through Open Market Operation (OMO)

purchases between February 6 and

December 04, 2020. Targeted long-term

With our retail focus and especially on

Affordable Housing Segment, we remain

steadfast in supporting PM’s Mission of

‘Housing for All’. The current scenario

highlights the urgent need to accelerate a

sustainable business environment and PNB

Housing Finance is committed and prepared

to lead the change and build a healthy and

progressive housing finance company.

CH S. S. Mallikarjuna Rao

Chairman:

MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CEO’S DESK

PROGRESSING WITH

OPTIMISM: Dear Shareholders,

I hope all of you are healthy and safe.

The last few months have witnessed a

devastating second wave of the pandemic,

affecting India and many other countries,

in ways that are more severe than the first.

The human cost of the last few months is

incalculable and across societies, there has

been a deep impact. That said, things are

improving rapidly with timely restrictions

and widespread vaccination, leading to a

gradual return to normalcy. We all hope that

this happens sooner than later. On behalf of

all of us at PNB Housing Finance, I would

also like to pay my tribute to all healthcare

professionals and frontline workers for their

relentless and selfless efforts at this time, in

service of the nation.

(MD) post, where an employee can directly write to the MD

without disclosing his/her identity on any suspected fraud/

malpractices/harassment etc.

The Company has an In-house magazine, Vibes, which

provides a medium for employees and their family members

to know about colleagues and the latest happenings within

the Company. The employees needed continuous motivation

to maintain their desired level of performance amid extreme

stress. The Company initiated ‘Sampark’ to engage with each

of our employees. Each of the HR team members connected

with around 30 members on a regular basis to enquire about

their wellbeing.

The gaps in competencies, job specific knowledge gaps,

skills and attitudes are identified during the performance

appraisal process and also on the basis of dynamic business

requirements. The Company conducts regular training

programmes for its employees, which are aimed at skill

development, behavioral competence and other learning and

development programmes, in house as well as in association

with various reputed institutes. These training programmes are

based on our philosophy of Organizational Needs, Functional

Needs and Individual Needs.

Employees are nominated for various skill development

programmes to enhance their effectiveness and for improved

productivity levels. Various types of trainings such as

On-the-job training, cross-functional training, workshops

international universities are organised for employee capability

development. The organization has also nurtured in-house

training expertise in the form of dedicated trainers and subject

matter experts from the core functional and business teams.

model to a digital and social learning model in FY 2020-21.

on various functional areas including Selling skills, Credit

Appraisal techniques, Fraud containment and Loan Lifecycle

Management. On the behavioural side, the programs were

designed around Talent-pool Development, Succession

Planning, Leadership Skills, Customer Centricity and

many more.

During the year, the focus on more digital form of trainings

remained priority. We have also been leveraging technology,

by using our web-based e-learning platform called "eGuru"

and its mobile app, which provides our employees with

the ease to learn on-the-go. Due to movement restrictions

and to exercise abundant precautions, the Company used

technology based virtual learning interventions to meet the

diverse learning needs of the workforce. Various e-learning

modules are available on the platform to help employees

enhance their knowledge on products, policies and processes.

Various knowledge enhancing courses were launched during

the year on functional areas like Affordable Housing, Loan

against Property, Fixed Deposits and Information Security &

Awareness which were very well received by the employees.

The online platform is extensively used to conduct compliance

based e-learning modules on topics such as Prevention of

Sexual Harassment at Workplace for Women, Prohibition of

Insider Trading, Employee’s Code of Conduct and Anti-money

Laundering & KYC.

NOTE 47: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The principles and techniques of fair valuation measurement of

both financial and non-financial instruments are as follows:

(a) Valuation principles

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an

asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction

in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the

measurement date under current market conditions (i.e.,

an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly

observable or estimated using a valuation technique.

For determination of fair value, financial instruments are

classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as

summarised below:

Level 1: Those where the inputs used in the valuation are

unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for identical

assets or liabilities that the Company has access to at the

measurement date. The Company considers markets as

active only if there are sufficient trading activities with

regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical assets

or liabilities and when there are binding and exercisable

price quotes available on the balance sheet date.

Level 2: Those where the inputs that are used for

valuation and are significant, are derived from directly or

indirectly observable market data available over the entire

period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include quoted

prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,

quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive

markets and observable inputs other than quoted prices

such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities

and credit spreads. In addition, adjustments may be

required for the condition or location of the asset or the

extent to which it relates to items that are comparable to

the valued instrument.

Level 3: Those that include one or more unobservable

input that is significant to the measurement as whole.

(b) Valuation governance

The Company’s fair value methodology and the

governance over its models includes a number of controls

and other procedures to ensure appropriate safeguards

are in place to ensure its quality and adequacy. All new

product initiatives and their valuations are subject to

approvals by related functions of the Company.

NOTE 48: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The principles and techniques of fair valuation measurement of

both financial and non-financial instruments are as follows:

(a) Valuation principles

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an

asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction

in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the

measurement date under current market conditions (i.e.,

an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly

observable or estimated using a valuation technique.

For determination of fair value, financial instruments are

classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as

summarised below:

Level 1: Those where the inputs used in the valuation are

unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for identical

assets or liabilities that the Company has access to at the

measurement date. The Company considers markets as

active only if there are sufficient trading activities with

regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical assets

or liabilities and when there are binding and exercisable

price quotes available on the balance sheet date.

Level 2: Those where the inputs that are used for

valuation and are significant, are derived from directly or

indirectly observable market data available over the entire

period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include quoted

prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,

quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive

markets and observable inputs other than quoted prices

such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities

and credit spreads. In addition, adjustments may be

required for the condition or location of the asset or the

extent to which it relates to items that are comparable to

the valued instrument.

Level 3: Those that include one or more unobservable

input that is significant to the measurement as whole.

(b) Valuation governance

The Company’s fair value methodology and the

governance over its models includes a number of controls

and other procedures to ensure appropriate safeguards

are in place to ensure its quality and adequacy. All new

product initiatives and their valuations are subject to

approvals by related functions of the Company.
