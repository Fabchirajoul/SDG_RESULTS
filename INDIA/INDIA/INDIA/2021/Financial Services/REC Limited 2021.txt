BOARD OF DIRECTORS:

Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to present to you the 52nd Annual Report of your Company. Despite the challenges posed by Covid-19 pandemic,

I am happy to report that your Company has performed impressively on all fronts during the financial year 2020-21.

The pandemic has led to an evolution of human behavior and corporate management. The future belongs to those who can achieve

seamless communication, reduce vertical hierarchies and have robust systems to garner business intelligence. Your Company is

investing keenly in becoming a future-ready organization.

In the energy sector, we are witnessing a transition like never before. The demand for electricity is increasing, supported by the

picking up of economic activity and enhanced electrification in rural areas. There is a clear movement towards green energy. The

Government is implementing various reforms to make the sector modern, efficient and sustainable. These initiatives in the power

sector are likely to enhance the consumer experience and also the overall quality of life.

Your Company has championed ‘rural electrification’ since its incorporation in 1969, when it used to energize irrigation pump-sets to

support the Green Revolution. Five decades later, your Company’s funding illuminates every fourth bulb in India. With a consistent

track record of serving the power sector, your Company remains committed to support the reforms agenda of the Government.

ECONOMIC OVERVIEW

The global economy is still weathering the setback caused by Covid-19. Most of the economic activities have been hit by reduced

personal interaction, uncertainty about economic landscape, lesser investments, changed methods of imparting education and

slowdown in the international trade & tourism. It will take some time, before trade and industry resume to their pre-pandemic levels.

The United States was able to avert economic disaster with significant fiscal and monetary policy response. China, on the other hand,

saw a rapid yet uneven recovery driven by manufacturing and exports. Prospects for emerging market and developing economies

have been generally marked down for 2021. Eventually, the recovery in global economy would be dependent on widespread

vaccination and moving ahead with cautious optimism.: MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Letter of Undertaking, modification in Renewable Energy Guidelines on grading of state power utilities, revision of project appraisal

and entity appraisal guidelines and modification in re-financing policy for renewable energy projects.

Further, your Company also reduced its interest rate structure across the board, in order to align with the market rates and to

contribute towards the overall profitability of the sector.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE

As a financial institution serving the entire power sector value chain, your Company’s key products include rupee term loans and

the said Special Resolution, except to the extent of their shareholding in the Company.

Item No. 6

The Objects Clause of Memorandum of Association (MoA) of REC Limited was last amended in the year 2009. Since then, the Power

sector scenario in the country has undergone a paradigm change with increased focus on renewable energy power generation,

energy conservation, new & emerging technologies like e-vehicles and associated charging infrastructure, use of Information and

Communication Technology for smart city projects, energy efficiency, efficiency in transmission and strengthening of the distribution

sector. As a result, newer business opportunities are emerging in the Power sector, albeit with increased competition from banks,

financial institutions and other NBFCs. Further, as per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, the Objects Clause of Memorandum

of Association is to be bifurcated into two categories viz. (i) Objects for which the Company is established and (ii) Matters considered

necessary in furtherance thereof.

In order to align the Objects Clause of Memorandum of Association of REC as per requirement of the Companies Act, 2013 and with

a view to enable the Company to tap emerging business opportunities in the Power Sector and explore potential in new areas of

business, it is proposed to alter the Objects Clause of Memorandum of Association of the Company.

As per provisions of Section 13 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 22 of the Companies (Management and Administration)

Rules 2014, the shareholders of the Company may, by passing a special resolution through Postal Ballot and after complying with

the statutory provisions, alter the Objects of its Memorandum of Association. However, MCA vide Notification dated February 9, 2018

inter-alia amended Section 110 of the Companies Act, 2013 and prescribed that any item of business required to be transacted by

means of postal ballot, may be transacted at a general meeting by a company, which is required to provide the facility to members

to vote by electronic means under Section 108.

In terms of the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, REC is providing the facility to its members

to enable them to vote on resolutions at the general meeting, by electronic means. Accordingly, the Special Resolution for alteration

of Objects Clause of Memorandum of Association of the Company, is proposed to be passed in this AGM.:

letter dated March 24, 2021 accorded approval to the

Objects clause of Memorandum of Association of the Company. Further, after adoption of revised objects, it is envisaged that the

following areas of business will be explicitly covered, which will enable the Company to explore the following business opportunities:

•

Funding or undertaking studies, research on any project including training;

•

Financing of projects, activities or works in respect of electrical and electromechanical/hydro systems, projects of lift irrigation,

smart city, electrification of railway line, airport;

•

Financing of projects, activities or works for energy conservation, waste heat recovery system(s), e-mobility & associated

infrastructure;

•

Financing of projects for establishment, expansion, modernization, operations and maintenance of units for manufacture/supply

Members of the Company.

In view of the above, Members are requested to grant their consent to the Special Resolution as set out at Item No. 6 of this Notice.

The Directors or Key Managerial Personnel or their relatives do not have any concern or interest, financial or otherwise, in passing

of the said Resolution, except to the extent of their shareholding in the Company.

PRESENT TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION SCENARIO

As the country’s installed generation capacity is at a high of 382 GW (as on March 31, 2021) and there are huge capacities

planned in the renewable energy space, the Transmission and Distribution (T&D) sector is poised to witness growth. There

is also a need to strengthen the technically old and aging distribution infrastructure. Need of the hour is to install a state-of-

the-art robust and reliable evacuation and distribution system, capable of handling higher loads. Distribution is all the more

a focus area, with accomplishment of targeted household connections under the Government of India’s flagship programme

SAUBHAGYA. Therefore, T&D segment shall play a significant role in making the sector reliable, affordable and capable of

absorbing envisaged future growth.

Your Company, as the nodal agency to various schemes of the Ministry of Power, Government of India, plays an active role in

creating new infrastructure and augmentation/strengthening of the existing network. Your Company finances entire gamut of

transmission and distribution projects, broadly with the objectives of system improvement and augmentation, loss reduction

measures, IT based system implementation, consumer satisfaction etc., thus playing a significant role in the development and

sustainability of the power sector and overall socio-economic progress of the country.

6.1

Major reforms in the Distribution Sector

The outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in the country and consequent nationwide lockdown imposed by the Government aggravated

the liquidity problems of power sector. The Government of India announced a liquidity infusion scheme under Atmanirbhar

Bharat on May 13, 2020, followed by an advisory issued by the Ministry of Power (MoP) on May 14, 2020, envisaging funding

by REC and PFC to discoms for clearance of their outstanding dues towards CPSU gencos & transcos, independent power

producers and renewable energy generators as on March 31, 2020. Further, MoP vide OM dated September 2, 2020 also

granted one time permission to REC and PFC to extend loans to discoms above UDAY limits, for clearance of outstanding

dues of CPSU gencos & transcos, independent power producers and renewable energy generators as on June 30, 2020.

Implementation of the aforesaid schemes has significantly improved the liquidity situation of discoms during the pandemic.

Further, various schemes and programmes have been implemented by the Government in the recent past, to improve the

financial and operational performance of discoms. The policy framework of Government to support distribution sector includes

initiatives like Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA),

Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), National Electricity Fund (NEF),

Smart Grid, Automatic Meter Reading etc. Many more initiatives are in pipeline, to provide reliable and better power supply to

the consumers.

Your Company encourages discoms to expedite various reform measures and to adopt best practices, including modernization

and automation of systems and smart grid, IT-enabled systems for metering and consumer services and other technological

interventions in the distribution sector. Your Company is also the nodal agency for implementation of DDUGJY, operationalization

of SAUBHAGYA and NEF schemes. Further, your Company has been instrumental in development of Power For All web-portal

and is engaged in assisting the Ministry of Power in this endeavor.:

Managing Director (CMD), Director (Finance), Director (Technical) and Company Secretary as Key Managerial Personnel

(KMPs) of the Company. The role of CEO is being performed by CMD and the role of CFO is performed by Director (Finance)

of the Company.

The Ministry of Power, vide Order no. 46/2/2019-RE [247264] dated November 5, 2020, had appointed Shri Sanjay Malhotra,

IAS (DIN 00992744) as Chairman and: Managing Director of the Company, with effect from the date on which he assumes

the charge of the post. Shri Sanjay Malhotra took over the charge as

Managing Director of REC upto May 31, 2020, superannuated from the services of the

Company and ceased to be a Director since June 1, 2020. The Board places on record appreciation for the esteemed contribution

made by Shri Ajeet Kumar Agarwal and Shri Mritunjay Kumar Narayan, during their tenure as Directors of the Company.

After the completion of tenure or cessation of office of all erstwhile Independent Directors of the Company, including Woman

•

Appropriate systems and practices to protect, promote and safeguard the interests of all its stakeholders; and

•

Establishing a climate of trust and confidence among various stakeholders by means of transparent and timely disclosure

Managing Director. The Company also has Functional Directors

and Non-Executive Directors (i.e., Nominee Director of the Ministry of Power, Government of India and Nominee Director of

Power Finance Corporation Limited). The Company also had Part-time Non-official Independent Directors, including Woman

Independent Director, during financial year 2019-20. However, after the completion of tenure or cessation of office of all

erstwhile Independent Directors including Woman Independent Director in the financial year 2019-20, there are no Independent

Directors including Woman Independent Director on the Board at present.

During the financial year 2020-21, the composition of REC’s Board was not in conformity with the provisions of the Companies

Act, 2013, SEBI LODR Regulations and DPE Guidelines on Corporate Governance, due to absence of Independent Directors

including Woman Independent Director, as stated above. The composition of some Committees of the Board, which require

presence of Independent Directors, was also not in conformity with the applicable statutory provisions.

Being a Government company within the meaning of Section 2(45) of the Companies Act, 2013, the power to appoint Directors

on the Board of REC vests with the President of India acting through the administrative ministry i.e., the Ministry of Power,

Government of India (MoP). REC has been regularly writing to the MoP to appoint requisite number of Independent Directors

including at least one Woman Independent Director on its Board, to enable compliance with the applicable statutory provisions

of the Companies Act, 2013, SEBI LODR Regulations and DPE Guidelines on Corporate Governance. The matter is being

followed-up and the Independent Directors, including Woman Independent Director, are likely to be appointed shortly.
