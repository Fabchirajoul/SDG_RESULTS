Leading change responsibly: Dear Stakeholders,

Greetings to all of you.

I sincerely hope all of you are

taking care of yourselves and family

members and staying safe and

protected. These are unprecedented

times that bring new challenges

every other day, as the world is still

discovering the New Normal. The

financial year 2020-21, as it turned

out, opened on a very low note with

the spectre of pandemic staring in

the face, with uncertainty looming

large on lives, livelihoods, business

and the economy. The pandemic

also ensured that mankind came

together and supported each other

in an altruistic manner. People were

ready to help each other even on

a distress call received from an

unknown person on a social media

platform. Let me take this opportunity

to acknowledge and express our

gratitude to all our frontline workers

and real-life heroes who showed

Courage, Compassion and Character

during these trying times.

The year was marked not only by

challenges, but the extent to which

the world braced itself to meet the

challenges. Amidst the scenario of

gloom caused by the pandemic at

the global level, I am proud to share

with you all, that AU Bank remained

undeterred in the pursuit of its goals

and objectives, ending the year on a

strong positive note with substantial

progress made during FY 2020-21.

The adversity tested our fundamental

strengths such as deep engagements

with customers, employees and other

stakeholders, along with unwavering

focus on governance, compliance,

risk mitigation and special care for

those affected by the pandemic.

Based on our close connect with the

customers, we adopted a hands-on,

pragmatic approach, proactively

helping them in times of distress to

avail facilities under different schemes

announced by the Government and

RBI, with care and due diligence.

Throughout this difficult period, we

have given priority to the health

and well-being of our teams and

customers, depositors and borrowers

and all other stakeholders. We began

FY 2020-21 with a lot of concern, as

the pandemic challenged global

economic growth and the human

development index. The Indian

economy also contracted for two

consecutive quarters. It was only

in the third quarter that we started

seeing signs of recovery in the

economy, with GDP expanding

by 0.5% in Q3 FY21 and by 1.6% in

Q4 FY21. Although the second COVID

variant seen in Q1 FY22 poses the

risk of jeopardising India’s fragile

economic recovery, we remain

cautious in our overall growth outlook

for FY 2021-22. The RBI expects

the pace of economic growth to

accelerate in the coming quarters

and estimates an overall GDP growth

rate of 9.5% for FY 2021-22.

During the year, the Reserve Bank

of India (RBI) and the Government

of India took some unprecedented

steps and introduced several

time-critical measures to help the

economy tide over the crisis. Other

than conventional measures like

changing the policy rates and various

liquidity ratios (CRR, LCR, SLR ratios,

etc.), the RBI introduced long-term

repo operations (LTROs) and targeted

long-term repo operations (TLTROs)

to augment systemic as well as

sector-specific liquidity to meet credit

requirements in different sectors and

reduce stress in vulnerable segments

of the economy. Special refinance

facilities were provided to select All

India Financial Institutions (AIFIs),

while a special liquidity facility for

mutual funds (SLF-MF) was introduced

to ease redemption pressures.

To support Micro Small and Medium

Enterprises (MSMEs), which were

hit hard by the pandemic, the

Emergency Credit Line Guarantee

Scheme (ECLGS) and the Credit

Guarantee Scheme for Subordinate

Debt (CGSSD) were introduced by

the Government of India. These have

been duly supported by various

monetary and regulatory measures

by the RBI in the form of interest rate

cuts, higher structural and durable

liquidity, moratorium on debt

servicing, asset classification freeze for

180 days, loan restructuring package

and CRR exemptions on credit

disbursed to new MSME borrowers.

During the year, Small Finance

Banks (SFBs), as a differentiated

banking category, faced formidable

challenges, being a relatively new

entity in the Indian banking universe,

with focus on priority sector, last mile

credit delivery and financial inclusion.

As India’s largest SFB by asset size,

AU Bank used its deeper geographic

presence in semi-urban and rural

India to successfully reach out to the

unserved and underserved sectors

of the society, such as MSMEs, and

ensure a constant delivery of credit

and essential banking services during

these challenging times. Our biggest

strength as an SFB is that we act as a

reliable bridge between the formal

sector of the economy and the

semi-formal and the informal sector,

spanning Urban centres to semi-

Dear Stakeholders,

Namaskar!

The ongoing pandemic situation has

affected all of us in some or the other

manner and we wish good health for

you and all your loved ones. We stand

in solidarity with the world for the global

loss of lives and livelihoods that it suffered

in the last year. As an essential service

provider, we are humbled to have served

our nation at this critical time anchored on

our strengths of execution and agility.

The power and responsibility of the

banking platform continues to amaze us.

The euphoria of the first year, the stable

operations of the second year and an

eventful third year led to a resilient fourth

year. FY 2020-21 provided us with the

opportunity to consolidate our learnings

and move forward with greater resilience

and determination to sustainably build

ourselves forever.

“Life’s roughest storms prove the

strength of our anchors.”

Integrated Annual Report 2020-21:

Dear Stakeholders,

Namaskar!

I hope you and your loved ones are

keeping safe.

FY 2020-21 brought an overwhelming

challenge to lives and livelihoods. As

the world battled the unprecedented

circumstances, we, as a Bank, realised

our responsibility in a whole new light.

We are proud to have supported our

customers and stakeholders in this

critical hour of need as an essential

service provider. We salute our fellow

frontline warriors who showed Courage,

Compassion and Character in these

trying times and went beyond their call

of duty.

I would also like to congratulate all

my colleagues at AU Bank for being

credible bankers in these uncertain

times. As banking is considered

an essential service, our branches

remained open throughout the

lockdown. Following all COVID-related

protocols, we continued to serve our

customers with smiles on our faces

along with a lot of pride and a deep

sense of responsibility. I am deeply

humbled by the commitment of the

on-ground team and would take this

opportunity to thank their families for

their understanding and support.

As the crisis continues to unfold, we

remain agile in carefully calibrating our

strategies, applying our learnings from

last year, operating more effectively in

the new reality and playing a positive

role in the economy and society at

large.

Performance for the fiscal

Despite a challenging operating

environment, we, as a Bank, stood

strong and delivered a resilient

performance on all key metrics.

During the nationwide lockdown in

Q1 FY21 and gradual reopening in

Q2 FY21, we were present on the

ground, continuously engaged with

our customers which, in turn, helped

us in capturing the demand during

the second half once economic

activity resumed with the onset of the

festive season.

‘‘We continuously

engaged with our

customers in their hour of

need and judiciously used

various Govt. of India and

RBI schemes to support

them – be it Moratorium,

ECLGS or Restructuring.’’

During the year under review, our

overall fund-based disbursements

were at `17,590 crore as against last

year’s `17,717 crore – a significant

achievement, given that economic

activities came to a halt in Q1 FY21.

We saw broad-based demand in

all our key segments – Wheels, SBL,

Home Loans and Business Banking.

Accordingly, our Assets Under

Management (AUM) increased by

22% to `37,712 crore and our Bank’s

balance sheet size stood at `51,591

crore – an increase of 5.3x in four years,

driven by the power of the banking

platform.

Assets – Portfolio resilience

increased our confidence further

In our two main businesses –

Wheels and SBL – we have built

necessary credit systems to support

self-employed customers who have

little or no access to formal banking

credit. They have the necessary

aspirations, skill sets, and intentions,

but lack the much-needed resources

to realise them. Credit availability to

this segment has always been scarce

and mostly informal – primary reasons

being high cost of operations and

lack of behavioral data on credit. The

current pandemic was a litmus test not

only for our chosen customer segment

but also for our unique underwriting

model.

Despite this pandemic being extremely

harsh on marginal borrowers and

micro-businesses operating in mostly

unorganised and informal segments,

the performance of our borrowers has

been resilient with our 90+ day overdue

borrowers only being at 2.7% of our

overall portfolio. Similarly, our Gross NPA

remained well in control at 4.3% as of

31st March 2021 (our GNPA includes

1.5% of customers who were below 90

DPD but tagged as NPA).

We continuously engaged with our

customers in their hour of need and

judiciously used various Govt. of

India and RBI schemes to support

these borrowers – be it moratorium,

ECLGS or restructuring. Our collection

efficiencies returned to normalcy in

Q3 FY21 at 97% and increased to 107%

in Q4 FY21 signifying the resilience

and sustainability of our borrowers,

their underlying businesses and our

collection infrastructure.

This pandemic has given us a lot of

confidence and has reinforced our

belief in our strong underwriting models.

As we move forward, we will continue

driving growth from these two businesses

where we provide secured loans to

retail borrowers for income-generating

assets with low ticket size.

Affordable Housing Finance was the

first business to return to normalcy. It

gained momentum in FY 2020-21 after

being in set-up mode for the last 2 years.

Supported by various subsidy schemes,

the demand for affordable housing

was further bolstered by people looking

for owned houses in a COVID induced

‘social distancing’ world. By the end of

Q4 FY21, our monthly disbursement was

~`150 crore.

Given our prior experience of

establishing and successfully growing

a Housing Finance Company, growth

in this business is a natural progression

achieved with our deep understanding

of customer behaviour, the business

model and various local nuances

including the relationship with the

market participant. We currently offer

this product only at 135 locations

while our existing presence is at ~600

locations.

AU BANK:

Letter of gratitude was sent to

the family member of AUites who

fulfilled their duties of essential

operations during the lockdown

and stood in solidarity with the

nation and the organisation.

Regular calls were made to check

on the well-being and provide

support to the employees who are

COVID infected. During these times,

the leadership team of the Bank

maintained regular connect with

on ground staff to ensure that all

employees remain safe, happy and

motivated.

Employee benefits

Each day we strive hard to build

and enable an environment where

everyone is motivated to take up

new challenges and grow with us.

To give a strong sense of ownership

within the Bank, benefits like staff

loan, home loan, car loan, medical

insurance, personal accident and

life insurance covers are provided

to employees to ensure that all

needs of employees are taken care

of. The Bank also has a well-defined

ESOP schemes for its employees

helping them to grow with the Bank.

Digitising of our HR function

With ‘Digitisation’ and ‘Automation’

as the Bank’s key focus area across

segments, we are moving all our

HR functionality to online mode

to offer a seamless experience

to our employees. This year we

implemented Oracle Recruitment

Cloud, based on Fusion HCM

platform for automating our entire

onboarding process. Further, our

HCM Mobile Application also went

live this year enabling employees

to access most of the HR related

functions on their mobile devices.

Some of the key features includes

leave and attendance, online

learning modules, Employee

directory, Pay slips and tax

statements/Form 16, Approvals on

phone etc.

All these digital initiatives enhanced

the employee experience for our

existing and new recruits and

reduced manual intervention to a

large extent.

Solutions focused

HR Sahayak – an online portal for employees was launched to track

all queries on real time basis. This portal replaced the existing HR

Helpdesk system manual email and phone call-based process)

which used to cater to employee queries and grievances earlier. This

Portal was developed by the internal IT team and has very interesting

features to provide an enhanced experience to employees.

Avoiding pitfalls

As an NBFC, AU intentionally

avoided entering into few

product segments in a major

way i.e. unsecured loans, MFI,

loan against shares, short-term

personal loan, etc. since these

were not necessarily linked to

building of economic activity and

establishment of end-use was

difficult.

Maintaining pristine asset quality

We believe that our asset quality

performance across cycles in our

25+ year journey has been the

ultimate proof of our business model

and execution, and this has helped

us expand in a stable manner. This

has been the result of our business

model and consistent execution.

Customer grievance redressal

We follow a comprehensive

policy on Customer Grievance

Redressal which governs the

redressal procedure for handling

customer complaints. The policy is

well-designed in adherence with

applicable regulatory obligations,

which ensures set roles and

responsibilities of stakeholders and

applies to all employees of the

organisation, regardless of location

or business unit. We have a further

4-tiered governance framework

that ensures prompt and responsive

complaint resolution and ensures

confidentiality of complainants’

information.

• Branch Level Customer Service

Committee conducts monthly

meetings with customers to study

customer grievances, cases of

delay, and other difficulties faced

by the customers

• Standing Committee on

Customer Service is chaired by

the Executive Director comprising

of Senior Management Team

• Customer Service Committee

of the Board is chaired by the

designated Independent Director

of the Board comprising the

Heads of various departments

• Nodal Department/Official

for Customer Service in the

Head Office/Regional Office/

Corporate Office, is responsible

for the implementation of

customer grievance redressal

mechanism and complaint

handling. This official also

acts as a connector between

the Bank and RBI/Banking

Ombudsman

Transparency and

compliance for tax

We at AU, consider ‘taxation

strategy and tax compliance’

a Core part of corporate and

social responsibility, and strive

to be ethically unerring. Our

approach towards tax aims to

align with the interests of our

various stakeholders - including

the Government, shareholders,

business partners, and the entire

community where we operate

and source our products.

Tax contributions

We contribute towards

Government revenues by way

of corporate income taxes and

indirect taxes such as GST. We

also collect other taxes such as

withholding tax (TDS), employees’

tax (TDS on salary), equalisation

levy, and tax collection at source

on behalf of revenue authorities

and assist tax authorities with tax

administration. We have been

an honest taxpayer wherein all

the taxes are deposited within

the regulatory timelines without

any delay. We are very proud

of our tax contributions which

are increasing on yearly basis at

an average rate of 30% leading

to the economic growth of our

country.

Whistleblowing and vigilance

mechanism

We believe in the philosophy ‘If

you see anything wrong, oppose it

and expose it’. The Whistle Blower

Policy has helped us enable

a vigil mechanism aimed at

spotting aberrations promptly and

subsequently deal with them at

the earliest. We are committed to

adhering to the highest standards

of ethical, moral, and legal conduct

of business operations.

To maintain these standards, our

Whistle Blower Policy formulated as

a part of corporate governance

norms and transparency promotes

clean business transactions,

professionalism, productivity,

promptness, transparent practices

and ensures putting in place

systems and procedures to curb

opportunities for corruption.

In line with the policy, a Vigilance

Mechanism has been adopted

for the protection of employees

from reprisals or victimisation, for

whistleblowing in good faith as

the Bank strictly follows the No

Retaliation Policy. The Vigilance

team working under the Chief

Vigilance Officer ensures integrity,

transparency, and accountability

in our day-to-day working while

practicing all three types of

vigilance, i.e., Preventive, Detective,

and Punitive.

Positive externalities

Principle 10 | UN Global Compact:

Businesses should work against

corruption in all its forms, including

extortion and bribery

We have incorporated policies

around anti-corruption, anti-bribery,

and anti-money laundering. This has

enabled us to maintain a zero-non-

compliance environment.

A total of 7 incidents of corruption

and bribery were recorded in the

last three years i.e., from FY 2018-19

to FY 2020-21.

We have an Anti-bribery and Anti-

Corruption Policy laying down the

principles for carrying out banking

business honestly and ethically.

Anti-bribery and corruption

Our policy on Anti-bribery and

anti-corruption policy and KYC

and Anti Money Laundering policy

applies to all employees at all levels

and grades, including directors,

and everyone directly associated

with us. Under this policy, we ensure

that a culture of transparency

and the highest ethical standards

are followed while transacting

and dealing with all the external

stakeholders including vendors and

suppliers.

Employees under their employment

contract are foretold of their

obligations regarding prevention

of corruption and prohibition on

bribery, in addition to compulsory

training, to make them aware of

their responsibilities under this policy

and relevant legislation to conduct

business as per the Bank’s values

and code of conduct.

We create positive externalities

for the environment, society, and

governance through our actions.

Trust in the financial system is crucial

for channelising public savings into

private and public investments.

People trust AU Bank with their

hard-earned money and by

ensuring customer protection and

building a reliable digital banking

channel we are committed to

building a relationship based on

trust. Hence, by sound corporate

governance practices, we

contribute to the idea of banking

being a public good.

Keeping good governance

at core of every operation we

ensure commitment towards

Sustainable Development Goals

(SGDs) designed to ensure strong

institutional values.

Committed to ensuring zero-non-

compliance to combat financial

crimes we are trying to leverage

technology and automating the

process to ensure there is limited

manual intervention. These activities

include completely automated

AML process and Debit and Credit

Card fraud monitoring which, in

turn, leaves very limited room for

any fraudulent activity.

Despite the pandemic, our business banking portfolio

has shown resilience and the slippages continue to

remain low. The business follows a model of Relationship

Management where the collection is taken care of by

the sourcing team itself resulting in developing a 360

degree insights about the customers and fostering

a deep connect with the customers on how they go

about their business. This coupled with stringent credit

monitoring exercise across various parameters, gives

insights about the business of the customer and helps in

taking corrective actions.

During the year under review, there was a periodic

assessment by the business and credit teams of the

business and operating environment . This resulted in the

crafting of a dynamic sourcing strategy during different

phases of unlocking which directed attention on right

segments at the right time. This led to strong credit with

100% of the book sourced in FY 2020-21 being at nil

delinquency.

With our robust underwriting models, business intelligence,

and relationship management, we are poised to be

significant contributors in MSME financial inclusion and

coverage.

After two decades of functioning as an NBFC, we

understand the need for constant stream of funds for

NBFCs, which include Asset Finance Companies (AFCs),

Housing Financial Companies (HFCs), and Micro Finance

Institutions (MFIs). We have seen multiple cycles in this

segment and our key advantage is our ‘ears-to-the-

ground’ approach and infrastructure in areas where

these NBFCs are active. With our customer-centric

approach, we are well prepared to serve these financial

institutions at various stages in their business life cycles.

Our loan book in this segment is well diversified across 9+

states spread across 125+ NBFCs.

A key differentiator for our NBFC business is that it is entirely

self-funded. The business team also looks at growing

liability and transaction banking relationship with the

financial institutions and aims to deepen the relationship

with clients by extending multiple banking products

like transaction banking, CMS, CA/SA, ACH/ NACHs,

corporate salary accounts etc. We also extended credit

during the first wave by participating in the TLTRO 2.0

scheme and provided liquidity support to smaller NBFCs

as per the laid down criteria.

USP of our NBFC lending Book

• Seasoning of more than 7 years. Navigated well

through various macro-events like NBFC crisis, Bank

Moratoriums, demonetisation, GST and ongoing

COVID-19 Pandemic etc. The book has been resilient

across these events

• Low Concentration Risk. Portfolio is well diversified

across asset classes and geographies

• End borrower profile largely secured ~85% on-lending

to asset customers with collaterals including CV, 2W,

MSME, HFC, Gold, etc. The Loss Given Defaults in these

cases are much lower

• Selectivity curated book with clients having Low

Leverage and demonstrated track record of raising

timely debt and equity. Comfortable Leverage levels

with Median at 1.62X and average leverage at 2.1X

while for top 50 clients the average leverage was at

2.26X (as of December 2020)

• Our exposure remains largely to small and mid size

customers with limited or no dependence on short

term capital market instruments

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial

Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance

about whether the financial statements as a whole

are free from material misstatement, whether due

to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that

includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high

level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit

conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a

material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can

arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,

individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably

be expected to influence the economic decisions of

users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise

professional judgment and maintain professional

skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of

the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,

design and perform audit procedures responsive to

those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient

and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The

risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting

from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,

as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional

omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of

internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant

to the audit in order to design audit procedures

that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under

section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible

for expressing our opinion on whether the Bank has

adequate internal financial controls with reference

to financial statements in place and the operating

effectiveness of such controls.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies

used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates

and related disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s

use of the going concern basis of accounting and,

based on the audit evidence obtained, whether

a material uncertainty exists related to events or

conditions that may cast significant doubt on the

Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we

conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are

required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the

related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such

disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our

conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained

up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future

events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to

continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and

content of the financial statements, including the

disclosures, and whether the financial statements

represent the underlying transactions and events in a

manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance

regarding, among other matters, the planned scope

and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,

including any significant deficiencies in internal control

that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with

a statement that we have complied with relevant

ethical requirements regarding independence, and

to communicate with them all relationships and other

matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on

our independence, and where applicable, related

safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged

with governance, we determine those matters that

were of most significance in the audit of the financial

statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2021

and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe

these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or

regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter

or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine

that a matter should not be communicated in our report

because the adverse consequences of doing so would

reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest

benefits of such communication.

Tax expenses comprises of current income tax and

deferred tax.

Income tax

Current income-tax is measured at the amount

expected to be paid to the tax authorities in

accordance with the Income-tax Act, 1961

enacted in India. The tax rates and tax laws used to

compute the amount are those that are enacted

or substantively enacted, at the reporting date.

Current income tax relating to items recognised

directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in

Profit and Loss Account.

Schedules

forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2021

fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from

this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the

present value of available refunds and reductions in

future contributions to the schemes.

Short term Employee benefits

The undiscounted amount of short-term employee

benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the

services rendered by employees are recognised

during the year when the employees render the

service. These benefits include performance

incentive and compensated absences which are

expected to occur within twelve months after the

end of the period in which the employee renders

the related service. The cost of such compensated

absences is accounted as under:

(a) in case of accumulated compensated

absences, when employees render the

services that increase their entitlement of future

compensated absences; and

(b) in case of non-accumulating compensated

absences, when the absences occur.

Long term Employee benefits

The Bank accrues the liability for compensated

absences based on actuarial valuation as at the

Balance Sheet date conducted by an independent

actuary which includes assumptions about

demographics, early retirement, salary increases,

interest rates and leave utilisation. The net present

value of the Banks’ obligation is determined using

the Projected Unit Credit Method as at the Balance

Sheet date. Actuarial gains/losses are recognised

in the Profit and Loss Account in the year in which

they arise.

Share based payments

The Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOSs) of

the Bank are in accordance with Securities and

Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee

Benefits) Regulations, 2014. The Schemes provide for

grant of options on equity shares to employees of

the Bank to acquire the equity shares of the Bank

that vest in a cliff vesting or in a graded manner and

that are to be exercised within a specified period.

In accordance with the Securities and Exchange

Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits)

Regulations, 2014 and the Guidance Note on

Accounting for Employee Share-based Payments,

issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants

of India, the cost of equity-settled transactions

is measured using the intrinsic value method. The

intrinsic value being the excess, if any, of the fair

market price of the share under ESOSs over the

exercise price of the option is recognised as deferred

employee compensation with a credit to Employee’s

Stock Option (Grant) Outstanding account. The

deferred employee compensation cost is amortised

on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of

the option. The cumulative expense recognized for

equity-settled transactions at each reporting date

until the vesting date reflects the extent to which

the vesting period has expired and the number of

equity instruments that are outstanding. The fair

market price is the latest available closing price

preceding the date of grant of the option, on the

stock exchange on which the shares of the Bank

are listed.

The options that do not vest because of failure to

satisfy vesting condition are reversed by a credit

to employee compensation expense, equal to the

amortised portion of value of lapsed portion. In

respect of the options which expire unexercised the

balance standing to the credit of Employee’s Stock

Option (Grant) Outstanding accounts is transferred

to Profit & Loss Account.

F.

Revenue recognition

i)

Interest Income is recognized on a time

proportion accrual basis taking into account

the amount outstanding and the interest rate

implicit in the underlying agreements. Income

or any other charges on non-performing assets

or on assets taken in custody for recovery of

loan through disposal of such assets during the

period are recognized only when realized as

per the IRAC norms of RBI. Any such income

recognized and remaining unrealized, before

the asset became non-performing or before

disposal of assets in custody of the company,

is reversed. Overdue interest is recognized on

realization basis. Overdue interest is treated to

accrue on realisation, due to the uncertainty of

their realisation other than on running accounts

where it is recognised when due.

ii)

Service charges, fees and commission income

are recognised when due except for guarantee

commission and: letter of credit which is
