DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

FY 2020-21 saw severe stress test

on the entire financial ecosystem

across the world in the wake of

the pandemic. The global financial

system has so far largely withstood

the impact, even as the incidence

and sheer scale of human misery

and loss is enormous. Governments,

central banks and financial

regulators have mounted an

extraordinary defence to mitigate

the impact of the pandemic.

Overall, these policy responses

have contained the severity of the

pandemic’s toll on financial markets

and institutions and cushioned the

shock to economic activity. After

an unprecedented 24% contraction

in the Q1 of the year, the country’s

GDP (aided by the fiscal and

monetary support measures of

the Government of India and the

RBI) gradually moved into positive

territory, recording 1.6% growth

in the Q4 FY21.

In the midst of such a huge

humanitarian crisis, we at Ujjivan

Small Finance Bank remained

resilient, anchored by our core

mission of serving our customers,

and continued to ensure the welfare

of our teams and business partners.

Our business saw a rebound from

the initial setback in the business

observed in H1 FY21 due to

COVID-19 lockdown and delivered a

record high business volume in the

Q4 FY21. With the gradual opening

up of markets from the Q2 FY21,

volumes picked up across asset

and deposit businesses, reaching

pre-COVID-19 level by end of the

Q3 FY21. The Bank closed FY 2020-

21 on a very encouraging note,

with Q4 FY21 seeing good growth

across businesses.

In the first half of the year, the Bank

took a cautious approach towards

microfinance lending in select

pockets and sharpened focus on

collections efficiency as lockdown

measures were gradually eased in

our core markets. After a muted first

half, our assets business grew across

product categories in the second

half of the reporting year.

After appropriate due diligence of

the external environment, we took

a conservative approach towards

Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs)

lending in certain stressed segments

and shifted our focus towards

lending to semi-formal and formal

segments for a greater balance in

the portfolio. During the year, the

Emergency Credit Line Guarantee

Scheme (ECLGS) helped the MSE

business ramp up their volumes

after a disappointing Q1 FY21. In our

institutional lending business, we

focused on higher rated entities to

avoid any adverse impact on our net

interest margin.

In the Personal Loans segment we

focused on low-cost acquisition

channels, leveraging our diverse

branch network and encouraging

cross sell across our business

verticals and limited our sourcing

through fintech partnerships,

DSA and digital acquisitions until Q4

FY21. Business volumes under the

Housing vertical saw a steady ramp

up with improved approval rates,

despite restricted segments and

stringent credit policy. The Bank’s

Assets Under Management (AUM)

registered a 7% y-o-y growth in

FY 2020-21 over the previous year.

Despite a slowdown in business

activity in the first half on account of

the pandemic, the Bank witnessed

significant y-o-y growth in Housing

(35%) and MSE (31%) portfolios,

while the microfinance book stayed

relatively flat. The new businesses

of Personal Loan and Vehicle loans

gradually scaled up in the year under

review and now constitute 1.4% of

the Bank’s portfolio compared to

0.64% a year ago.

We continued our focus on building

a granular and stable deposit base.

During FY 2020-21, we focused on

improved sales productivity through

better lead generation-conversion

and also quality of acquisition. In FY

2020-21, our deposit book recorded

22% y-o-y growth driven by new

retail customers. A total of 6.6

Lakhs new retail deposit customers

were on-boarded during the fiscal.

We launched a few products with

enhanced value proposition,

further fortifying our product mix.

Our cost of deposits continues to

trend lower at 7.1% in FY 2020-21,

compared to 7.9% in FY 2019-20 led

by significant CASA growth.

In the midst of such a huge

humanitarian crisis, we at Ujjivan

Small Finance Bank remained

resilient, anchored by our core

mission of serving our customers,

and continued to ensure the welfare

of our teams and business partners.

Our business saw a rebound from

the initial setback in the business

observed in H1 FY21 due to

COVID-19 lockdown and delivered

a record high business volume

in the Q4 FY21.

withdrawal or lending of money are provided for a minimum of 4 hours per day for at least five days a week. It carries uniform signage with name of the

bank and authorisation from it, contact details of the controlling authorities and complaint escalation mechanism. The bank should have a regular off-

site and on-site monitoring of the ‘Banking Outlet’ to ensure proper supervision, ‘uninterrupted service’ except temporary interruptions due to telecom

connectivity, etc. and timely addressing of customer grievances. The working hours/days need to be displayed prominently.

Dear Stakeholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Ujjivan

Small Finance Bank Limited (the “Bank or Ujjivan”), it is our

immense pleasure to present the 5th Annual Report of

the Bank along with the Audited Financial Statements and

Auditor’s Report thereon for the FY 2020-21.

OVERVIEW AND STATE OF AFFAIRS OF THE

BANK

During the FY 2020-21, the Bank rebound from the initial

setback in the business observed in the 1st quarter due to

COVID-19 lockdown and delivered a record high business

volume in the 4th quarter. With the opening up of markets

gradually from the 2nd quarter, volumes picked up across

asset and deposit businesses reaching pre-COVID level by

end of the 3rd quarter of FY 2020-21. The Bank closed the

FY 2020-21 on a high note, with the last quarter showing

tremendous growth across businesses. In the first half

of the FY 2020-21, the Bank took a cautious approach

towards microfinance lending in select pockets and

increased focus on collections post lockdown. The Bank

also took a measured approach towards its Micro and Small

Enterprises (“MSEs”) lending in certain stressed segments

and shifted its focus towards lending to semi-formal and

formal segments for better portfolio quality. During

the FY 2020-21, the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee

Scheme (“ECLGS”) helped the MSE business ramp up

after a muted 1st Quarter. The Bank maintained a cautious

stance in its Institutional lending business, lending to

“AA” rated entities without having any adverse impact

on the vertical level Net Interest Margin. The Personal

Loans lending business volumes had increased on account

of good traction coming from branches and saw limited

traction in lending through fin-tech partnerships, DSA and

digital acquisitions until the 4th quarter of FY 2020-21.

Business volumes under the Housing vertical saw a steady

ramp up with improved approval rates, despite restricted

segments and stringent credit policy. Bank’s Assets Under

Management (“AUM”) registered a 7% y-o-y growth in FY

2020-21 over the previous year. Despite a slowdown in

business momentum in the first half on account of the

pandemic, the Bank witnessed significant y-o-y growth in

Housing (35%) and MSE (31%) while the microfinance book

stayed relatively flat. The new businesses of Personal Loan

and Vehicle loans gradually scaled up in the year under

review and now constitute 1.4% of the Bank’s portfolio

compared to 0.64% a year ago.

During FY 2020-21, Bank’s deposit book recorded 22%

y-o-y growth driven by new retail customers. 6.6 Lakhs

new retail deposit customers were on-boarded during the

FY 2020-21. CASA grew by 85% y-o-y, closing at 21% of the

total deposit book as of March 31, 2021, against 14% on

March 31, 2020.

The Bank offered a moratorium commencing from March,

2020 to August, 2020 and also undertook restructuring

as per the RBI guidelines for eligible customers in Micro

Banking, MSE and Housing segments. The focus remained

on portfolio management and collections with the

strengthening of collection efforts with additional staff,

tele-calling, adoption of digital and alternate collection

channels like Airtel Payment points, PayTm, Instamojo,

Setu and CC Avenue. There has been a continuous

improvement in the collection efficiency post moratorium

with the overall collection efficiency improving from

69% in August, 2020 to 94% in March, 2021. The Bank

implemented restructuring for 3.7 Lakhs accounts worth

`852 Crores in the Micro Banking segment, 121 accounts

worth `14 Crores in Housing and 76 accounts worth

`13 Crores in the MSE segment. The restructured book

witnessed improved collection efficiency of 74% against

49% witnessed pre-restructuring. The Bank took a call

to maintain prudential provisioning on its portfolio, with

total provisions covering 6.3% of the overall portfolio

against 1.6% in the previous year.

In a bid to diversify its product suite, the Bank launched

several new products and services attuned to the need

of the customers. The Bank launched Gold Loans, PM

SVANIDHI (street vendor loans) and scaled up the Kisan

Pragati Card product for the Micro Banking customers.

The Bank had launched Navnirman Loans (ECLGS) to

support its MSE customers in an effort to help them

rebuild their livelihoods and recover from the pandemic

impact, Loan Against Rent Receivables product was also

introduced for the Landlords of the Bank's branches and

the Bank also ventured into the Supply Chain Finance

segment through its first Fintech partnership. Micro &

Mini Commercial Cargo Vehicle product was launched to

leverage the growing demand for vehicles in this segment.

The Bank also launched the “Garima Savings Account” a

Savings Bank Account catering to the financial needs of

the women segment. To ease the mechanism of repayment

in times of the pandemic, the Bank launched various

modes of cashless EMI payment. Bank had partnered with

Airtel Payments Bank, PayNearBy, and API based digital

repayment via Bharat Bill Payment System. During the 4th

quarter of FY 2020-21, 11% of the customers had paid their

EMI via cashless modes. Cashless collections continue to

remain stable contributing to an average 18% of Micro

Banking and Rural Banking for FY 2020-21.

The Bank operated its premises with the strictest safety

standards in line with the State Level Bankers' Committee

and local guidelines, limiting staff turnout and offering

work from home for backend staff. The Bank constituted

a Quick Response Team (QRT) to monitor the situation on

the ground and provide guidelines during the pandemic

to all the employees of the Bank. Bank has continued to

maintain a strong connection with its customers and staff,

especially during the pandemic.
