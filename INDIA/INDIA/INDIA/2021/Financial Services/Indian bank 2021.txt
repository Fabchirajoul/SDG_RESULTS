Shri Sanjeev Kaushik

Government Nominee Director:

Dear Shareholders,

On my personal behalf and on behalf of Board of Directors, it is

my privilege to place the highlights of your Bank's performance

for FY21. The Annual Report for the Financial Year ended 31

st

March 2021 details the progress made and initiatives taken by

your Bank during the year.

At the outset, I sincerely pay my homage to those employees

who have lost their lives to the Covid pandemic while serving

the Bank. I would also like to thank all the employees for their

relentless efforts and all stakeholders for their unstinted

support during these testing times.

Before I proceed to present the performance highlights of your

Bank, let me briefly dwell upon the macro-economic scenario.

ECONOMIC OVERVIEW

Global Economy:



Global economic growth suffered a setback during last

year due to the pandemic disrupting business activities

for a longer than expected duration. With the surge in

vaccination, economies are opening up and growth is

likely to be visible in the second half of the year and gain

momentum gradually. However, the new variants of the

virus causing recurring waves in few countries raise

concerns to be managed promptly and efficiently.



Global growth is expected to be 6.0% in the year 2021.

The

emerging

market

economies

and

developing

countries are most affected due to the pandemic

requiring support from other countries in getting their

population vaccinated.

Letter

DOS.ARG.No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020 (as amended) (the “RBI communication”)

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Indian Bank as of March 31, 2021 in conjunction with our audit

of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date which includes internal financial controls over

financial reporting of the Bank's branches.

Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Bank's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over

financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note

on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These

responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating

effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Bank's policies, the safeguarding of

its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely

preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Banking RegulationAct, 1949 and the circulars and guidelines issued

by the Reserve Bank of India.

Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank's internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We

conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the

“Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of CharteredAccountants of India (the “ICAI”) and the Standards onAuditing (SAs) issued by the

ICAI, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply

with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial

controls over financial reporting were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over financial

reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an

understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and

evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal financial controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected

depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standard Financial

Statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors, in terms of their reports

referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Bank's

internal financial controls over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A Bank's internal financial controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with

generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank's internal financial controls over financial reporting includes those policies and

procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit

preparation of Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and

expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and Board of Directors of the Bank; and

(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank's

assets that could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper

management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any

evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial

controls over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the

policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Director's Report of the Bank, including annexures in annual report, if any, thereon, if we conclude that there

is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance

Responsibility of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

8.

The Bank's Board of Directors is responsible with respect to the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements that

give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows

of the Group and its Associates in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the

Accounting Standards issued by ICAI, and provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and circulars and

guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') from time to time. This responsibility also includes maintenance of

adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Bank and for

preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making

judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal

financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,

relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, respective Board of Directors of the Group Entities and Associates is

responsible for assessing the respective Entity's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters

related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the

Group Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors of the Group Entities and Associates are also responsible for overseeing the respective Entity's

financial reporting process.

Auditor's Responsibilities for theAudit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

9.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will

always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material

if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the

basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism

throughout the audit. We also:



Identify and assess the risk of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or

error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risk, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and

appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher

than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the

override of internal control.



Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in

the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the CompaniesAct, 2013, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion

on whether the Bank has adequate internal financial control system in place and the operating effectiveness of such

controls in the report on standalone financial statements.

417:

letter no. DOS.ARG.No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020(as amended), we report that:

a)

The provisions of Section 164(2) of the CompaniesAct, 2013 pertaining to disqualification of directors are not applicable

to the Bank. On the basis of the Reports of the StatutoryAuditors of Subsidiaries, none of the directors of the subsidiaries

are disqualified as on March 31, 2021 from being appointed as a director of the subsidiaries in terms of sub-section (2) of

Section 164 of the CompaniesAct, 2013.

b)

There are no observations or comments on financial transactions or matters which have any adverse effect on the

functioning of the Bank.

c)

There are no qualifications, reservations or adverse remarks relating to the maintenance of accounts and other matters

connected therewith.

d)

As per para 1.14 of the Technical Guide on Audit of Internal Financial Controls in Case of Public Sector Banks issued by

ICAI, the reporting requirement as introduced by RBI regarding Internal Financial Control over Financial Reporting will

apply only to standalone financial statements of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and not to consolidated Financial

Statements of PSBs. Accordingly, reporting is not done on the Group's Internal Financial Control over Financial

Reporting with reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at March 31, 2021.

16.

We further report that:

a)

In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Bank so far as it appears from our

examination of those books and proper returns adequate for the purposes of our audit have been received from

branches not visited by us.

b)

The Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account and the Consolidated Statement of Cash

Flows dealt with by this report are in agreement with the books of account and with the returns received from the

branches not visited by us.

c)

The reports on the accounts of the branch offices audited by branch auditors of the Bank under section 29 of the Banking

RegulationAct, 1949 have been sent to us and have been properly dealt with by us in preparing this report; and

d)

In our opinion, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss Account and the

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows comply with the applicable accounting standards, to the extent they are not

inconsistent with the accounting policies prescribed by RBI.
