Message from the Chairman: Dear Shareholders,

As I write this, we continue to be in the

middle of the COVID-19 pandemic – the

biggest crisis we have seen in our lifetime.

The pandemic and the resultant lockdowns

led to unprecedented socio-economic

disruption and loss of human life. And just

when the exit path in the form of a vaccine

became visible, the second wave hit India,

which resulted in another bumpy ride for the

Indian economy.

Having said that, I reiterate that we, at LIC

Housing Finance Limited, have undergone

adverse economic circumstances earlier too.

And each time, we have bounced back with

even greater strength and vigour. Hence, like

the earlier crises, we are confident we will

bounce back from the Covid crisis as a stronger

and more valuable LICHFL, having mastered

the new normal with the unleashing of a fresh

wave of energy.

We successfully triggered

our business continuity plans

and enabled work from

home for more than 90%

of our employees. We are

proud to share with you that

a change of this scale was

executed smoothly.

Message from the Chairman:

Message from the Chairman:

Dear Shareholders,

FY2021 can be described as a unique year.

The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19

pandemic altered broader outlook,

witnessed global economies facing

slowdown fears and India’s GDp growth

slowing down, with challenges emanating

from a strict lockdown regime.

although the first wave of COVID-19 was contained and

economic activities resumed around the third quarter of

FY2021, the resurgence of the virus in the second wave

was far more devastating. Lockdowns were again imposed

across the country. The outlook still continues to be

uncertain in terms of its impact on economic recovery.

The housing finance sector too initially grappled with

liquidity and demand, but in the second half of the fiscal

year, consumption demand gradually increased across

segments. While initially, growth was restricted to the

affordable housing finance sector only, later the mid,

upper and premium segments also grew. At LICHFL,

we had a satisfying year with a rising loan book, even

as we maintained our profitability, asset quality and

solvency, and took collaborated efforts to overcome the

difficult circumstances.

The Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took

steps and granted a moratorium twice which ended in

August 2020. At LICHFL, we too offered moratorium to our

customers to soften the COVID-19 blow. and I’d like to share

that most of the borrowers paid back their EMIs. After the

moratorium, we have witnessed more than 96% of the

collection happening.

How we performed

During FY2021, Income stood at ` 19,848 crore as compared

to ` 19,670 crore in the previous year, while profit after Tax

rose 13.8% at ` 2,734 crore, against ` 2,401 crore earlier.

Our Outstanding Loan Portfolio was up 10% at ` 2,32,003

crore, in comparison with ` 2,10,578 crore. Individual Loan

Portfolio also increased 10% to ` 2,16,047 crore. A dividend of

425% was recommended for FY2021 by the Board.

Despite a challenging environment, there was a healthy

growth in disbursement, especially in the individual home

loan segment. Total disbursement was ` 55,223 crore vis-à-vis

` 46,936 crore a year ago. Individual home loan disbursement

was up 125%, from ` 37,539 crore to ` 46,926.99 crore.

Strong business traction with good disbursement led to

growth in our assets under management and the outstanding

portfolio. With retail disbursements rising, net interest income

remained stagnant. Our Net Interest Margin was 2.37% vis-à-vis

2.38% in the previous year.

Operational performance

FY2021 has probably been one of our best years in terms of

operations in the past decade. We witnessed good customer

retention, with a reduction in cost of funds. Improvement in

products in the past year led to a sustained market share.

In terms of disbursement, we had the best 3rd and 4th quarters

in the fiscal year, which can be well attributed to our market

outreach, product innovation and distribution network.

Making adequate provisioning

Gross NPA rose to 4.12% in March 2021 vis-à-vis 2.86% in

March 2020. The NPA levels are being monitored stringently

and continue to be a matter of high priority. The good news is

that we also made recoveries in some big accounts during the

year. We set aside a provision of ` 984.8 crore. Provisions were

high due to NPA recognition from the moratorium book.

Beefing up the provisioning has been comforting for asset

quality, as we continue to build protection against the

anticipated stress.

KeY estIMAtes And JudGeMents:

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity

with Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) requires

the management to make estimates, judgements

and assumptions. These estimates, judgements and

assumptions affect the application of accounting policies

and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,

the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at

the date of the financial statements and the reported

amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.

Accounting estimates could change from period to

period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised

prospectively. The Management believes that the

estimates used in preparation of the financial statements

are prudent and reasonable. Future results could differ

due to these estimates and the differences between the

actual results and the estimates are recognised in the

periods in which the results are known / materialise.

3.1 determination of expected Credit Loss (“eCL”)

The measurement of impairment losses (ECL) across

all categories of financial assets requires judgement,

in particular, the estimation of the amount and timing

of future cash flows based on Company’s historical

experience and collateral values when determining

impairment losses along with the assessment of a

significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are

driven by a number of factors, changes in which can result

in different levels of allowances.

Elements of the ECL models that are considered

accounting judgements and estimates include:

Bifurcation of the financial assets into different

portfolios when ECL is assessed on collective basis.

Company’s criteria for assessing if there has been a

significant increase in credit risk.:
