Dear shareholders,

Overview

Each year my communication to

shareholders focuses on the strategic

direction of the company to enhance

stakeholder value.

This year I intend to focus on how we

intend to protect stakeholders’ interest

in the medium-term with the objective

to enhance value across the future.

At Aavas Financiers, we believe that to

finish first, one must first finish.

This statement has acquired a deeper

connotation in today’s environment

marked by the sweeping resurgence of

the second pandemic wave in India.

Any discussion about our business

must begin and end with what needs

to be done to protect our most

precious capital – our people.

These are challenging times for

people-intensive and knowledge-driven

businesses; there is a premium on the

ability to protect talent from the effects

of the pandemic.

In view of this, no achievement can be

considered more important than the

fact that we ended FY 2020-21 with

most of our talent capital safe and most

of their family members protected.

Responsive

As a responsive organization, Aavas

Financiers had foreseen the impending

lockdown in March 2020; immediately

following the imposition of the

lockdown, the company empowered

employees to work from their homes;

the company created an operating

architecture that could be shifted from

our offices to homes across cities.

This cautious and sensitive approach

helped the company protect most of its

talent capital from the risk of infection.

I must add here that we were not

completely successful; despite making

no compromises with safety, we lost

11 Aavas professionals to the pandemic

and I consider this to be our biggest

loss.

No financial number and no profit

margin that we reported last year can

compensate for this loss. On the other

hand, we are grateful that we finished

the year under review with most of our

talent and their family members safe.

We believe that this ‘internal customer’

focus will continue to empower our

company to address the needs of our

external customers.

Preparedness

At Aavas Financiers, we believe that

there has never been a moment when

our business model has been more

relevant than it is now.

During the last decade, the company

deepened its brand around ‘home

ownership’. The company positioned

itself as a home ownership facilitator

for individuals (generally from the

low income segment) seeking to

graduate from rented dwellings. We

believe that the pandemic has proved

to be a watershed moment for our

business. As individuals will seek to

stay safe and live well, there will be

a greater priority to buy or construct

their own homes. In view of this, we

believe that the size of our market has

widened considerably during the last

year; it is only a matter of time when

the need for customers to enhance

their home ownership becomes even

more pronounced, bringing housing

financing companies like ours into

sharper focus.

Aavas Financiers is attractively

placed to capitalize on the emerging

opportunity for another reason. Over

the years, the company overcame

a number of challenges, each time

emerging safer and stronger. Our

lenders patronize us because we

possess a multi-year domain expertise;

our customers turn to us because we

service their needs with speed and

sensitivity; our employees continue to

associate because we provide them

career growth and holistic protection.

By the virtue of protecting the interests

of all our stakeholders, we are

empowered to provide a clarity that we

will invest every resource in ensuring

that each one who associates with us

uses the word ‘safe’ to describe our

relationship.

In today’s unprecedented environment,

there can be no bigger achievement.
