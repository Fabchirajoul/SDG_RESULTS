The conclusion of our joint

venture with Axis Bank, the

third largest bank in India, in

April, this year, once again

long-standing partnerships

and business responsibilities

that pave the way for a

tactical and strategic edge

over our peers in a highly

competitive sector.

Max Life was ranked #1 in

customer loyalty (based

on the annual syndicated

Dear Shareholders,

Greetings !

Success is not an overnight

achievement, but a culmination of

well-considered and creative ideas

executed in the face of adversities and

tribulations with methodical dexterity

to accomplish something incredible.

the year gone by has been one-

of-a-kind for us at Max Financials,

replete with challenges arising from

the Covid-19 pandemic but also

accompanied with immense hope,

possibilities, and perseverance.

the conclusion of our joint venture

with Axis Bank, the third largest bank

in India, in April, this year, once again

proved our mettle in forging long-

standing partnerships and business

responsibilities that pave the way for

a tactical and strategic edge over our

peers in a highly competitive sector.

taking the decade-long relationship

forward, Axis Bank, along with its

subsidiaries Axis Capital limited and

Axis Securities limited, acquired a

12.99% stake in Max life to become

co-promoters at India’s fourth largest

private insurance firm. Axis entities can

further increase their stake by acquiring

another 7% in the times to come.

the idea behind the partnership –

solidifying our collaboration with Axis

Bank, providing long-term saving

and protection products to nearly

two million customers, permanently

addressing the uncertainty around Max

life’s distribution, and consolidating

our position among the peers – was

simple yet pivoted on our strong

fundamentals of “sevabhav”, credibility

and excellence.

Bringing a partner of as high a pedigree

as Axis Bank on board during such

uncertain times was one of the

standout achievements last year.

the team at Max Financials and Max

life, guided by the senior leadership,

worked tirelessly over the years to

carefully prune the intricacies of

the joint venture to unlock the vast

potential, evident from the valuation

re-rating of Max Financial by almost

2.5x and generation of a total premium

to the tune of over Rs. 40,000 crore

from this relationship since inception.

the Axis Bank joint venture is an

extension of Max Group’s rich tradition

and dynamic history of collaborating

with some of the finest and most

renowned names in the industry –

both international and domestic. our

focus on building trust and treating our

partners as equal counterparts is what

makes us one of the most preferred

business houses to collaborate with.

Whether it was our strategic

partnership with our founder joint

partners new York life (nYl), America’s

largest mutual and most-admired life

insurer, at the turn of the millennium

to develop an expertise in critical

functions such as underwriting,

creation of a gold standard agency

distribution network, etc., or that with

Japanese conglomerate such as Mitsui

Sumitomo, we take pride in our ability

to cultivate relations that transcend

the conventional metrics of profit and

economics and to that extent renewed

our partnership on bancassurance front

for another 5 years with YeS Bank.

our belief in our abilities to keep a

razor-sharp focus on deliverables amid

strenuous circumstances is in line with

our stellar corporate performance last

year.

the efforts to deliver superior

transition towards digitization – a move

that was in the offing but accelerated

by CoVID-19. the need to shift to

digital tools and our preparedness

to undertake the transition was

critical, which catalyzed our growth

and bolstered the revenues over the

last year. We believe the optimum

utilization of digital areas such as

artificial intelligence, machine learning,

chat bot integration, etc. is the future,

and the pace and nature of transition

to such tools will differentiate winners

from the rest.

Strong roots and investments in

digital assets enabled transition

Dear Shareholders,

the year under review posed

unfathomable hardships to mankind.

It brought the core foundation of

insurance industry, to protect people

against risks and uncertainties and

honour the trust placed by our

customers, at the forefront. never

before has our purpose been more

relevant and acute.

the Covid-19 outbreak affected the

global economy as well as trade

channels. Amidst crisis, businesses

continued to reassess strategies to

weather the storm. the Indian insurance

sector also suffered the brunt of such

rising uncertainties. In the wake of the

‘new normal’, key players are hedging

their bets, digitizing operations and

harmonizing business models to provide

seamless solutions to customers.

My heartfelt gratitude goes to all of our

Max life colleagues who responded to

the situation with care and unrelenting

commitment as we continued to

provide uninterrupted support to our

customers. our stellar performance

in the year was a testament to this

dedication. We came out of FY21 as a

stronger, more resilient company.

to remain relevant in changing

times, we deployed state-of-the-art

technology, launched several digital

assets, and incorporated intelligent

solutions across our operations. With

digital integrations on AI and Cloud,

faster product launches, efficient selling

procedures, and extending seamless

operations on digital platforms, Max

life Insurance has outperformed its

competitors during the pandemic. our

aim is to position Max life as a leader in

the use of technology, enabling greater

connectivity, scale and efficiency.

Deeper insights from data analytics

enable distinctive and personalised

customer experiences, that is highly

relevant of current times.

We believe that brand salience

is manifested through strategic

investments. therefore, we focus on

building cross-selling capabilities,

distribution partnerships across

traditional and non-traditional

ecosystems and continue to place

emphasis on new growth opportunities.

With Axis Bank becoming the co-

promoter of Max life with 12.99%

stake, our position will strengthen

manifold. the Bank plans to gradually

increase its share to 20% in the near

term, ushering a very promising future

for Max life. throughout our decade-

long business association, Axis Bank,

India’s third-largest private sector bank,

exhibited tremendous value across

customer insights and distribution

expertise. With its status now as our

parent organisation, the combination

of forces will put laser sharp focus

on other areas of growth including

the introduction of margin accretive

products, digitization of processes

and deeper access to the Bank’s vast

footprint across the country. this is a

monumental milestone in the history

of our company, one that will cement

Max life’s position as a top quartile

life insurer delivering sustainable and

profitable growth.

our long-standing relationships with

other prestigious banking institutions

have also held us in good stead.

our partnership with Yes Bank has

completed 16 years, and with the

renewal of our corporate agreement,

we have strengthened our position

in the bancassurance distribution

segment.

to enhance our reach, we aim to

design tailored solutions for customers

through our multi-channel distribution

architecture. While the proprietary

channels, including Agency and direct

Customer Advisory team, remain the

focal point, we further developed our

presence on modern e-Commerce

platforms and structured third-party

distribution systems. this enabled

Max life to pioneer new distribution

models including Insurance Marketing

Firms (IMF), Agency partner Channels,

Rakshak (Defence Channel), and many

more that help consistently channelize

growth.

even in trying times as such, our

financial performance has remained

strong and the year emerged as one

of our best performing business years

in our existence. We have secured our

position as the 4th largest organization

in the private insurance segment, with

highest ever individual new business

sum assured in FY21 and a decade-high

private market share of 10.8% in terms

of Individual adjusted FYp.

our consolidated new business

premium was recorded at Rs. 6,826

crores, reflecting a 22% year-on-

year increase. Furthermore, renewal

My heartfelt

gratitude goes

to all of our Max

Life colleagues

who responded

to the situation

with care and

unrelenting

commitment as

we continued

to provide

uninterrupted

support to our

customers.

Necessary adjustments are made against the option value in the books of account and balance is restated

at the end of each year.

43. The Board of Directors of the Company in its meeting held on March 3, 2020, had considered and

approved the issuance and allotment of up to 75,458,088 equity shares of the Company of face value

of Rs. 2 each, fully paid up, on a preferential basis to Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Company Limited (MSI)

for consideration other than cash, i.e. through swap of 394,775,831 equity shares of Rs. 10 each of Max

Life Insurance Company Limited (‘Max Life’)[“MSI Swap”], based on the valuation report obtained by the

Company in accordance with applicable laws. In addition, the Company through a call/put option has to

acquire the remaining shareholding held by MSI at Rs. 85 for every equity share of Rs. 10 each held by MSI

in Max Life (“MSI Put/Call Option”). The shareholders of the Company approved the said MSI Swap and MSI

Put/Call Option on May 27, 2020.

The Company had received approvals from all requisite regulatory authorities for MSI Swap as of November

27, 2020, namely Competition Commission of India, the stock exchanges, Department of Economic Affairs

(‘DEA’) and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (‘IRDAI’). Pursuant to receipt of all

the approvals, the Company has allotted 75,458,088 equity shares of face value of Rs. 2 each, fully paid

up at a price of Rs. 565.11 per share on a preferential basis to MSI for consideration other than cash,

i.e. through swap of 394,775,831 equity shares of Rs. 10 each of Max Life at a price of Rs. 108.02 on

December 8, 2020. Post the MSI Swap transaction, MSI holds 21.87% equity shares of the Company and

the Company’s investment in equity shares of Max Life has increased from 72.52% to 93.10%. Further,

Mr. Hideaki Nomura and Mr. Mitsuru Yasuda, nominees of MSI, were appointed as non- executive non-

independent additional directors of the Company.

In respect of MSI Put/Call Option, the Company had executed definitive agreement with the parties,

which is subject to receipt of requisite regulatory approvals. Subsequent to the year end, the Company

has filed an application for approval with IRDAI for acquisition of 99,136,573 equity shares of Max Life

held by MSI constituting 5.17% equity stake in Max Life under MSI Put/Call option. Pending receipt of

requisite approvals, the said transaction cannot be considered concluded at the current date and hence,

no adjustments have been made in the standalone financial statements.

44. On February 20, 2020, the Company and Axis Bank Limited (‘Axis Bank’) executed Confidentiality and

Exclusivity Agreement to explore a long-term strategic partnership. The Board of Directors of the Company

in its meeting held on April 27, 2020 approved entering into definitive agreements with Axis Bank for the

sale of 29% of the equity share capital of Max Life Insurance Company Limited (‘Max Life’), a material

subsidiary of the Company, to Axis Bank, subject to receipt of shareholders’ approval and other requisite

regulatory approval. The shareholders of the Company approved the transaction on June 16, 2020.:

letter dated February 24, 2021 granting

approval for transfer of 12.002% equity shares of Max Life held by the Company to Axis Entities, as

promoters. Pursuant to receipt of all the approvals, the Company has transferred 38,376,257 equity shares

of Rs. 10 each of Max Life to Axis Capital Limited and 19,188,128 equity shares of Rs. 10 each of Max Life to

Axis Securities Limited on March 26, 2021, fully paid up at a price of Rs. 31.51 per share for consideration

aggregating to Rs. 18,138.54 lakhs. The weighted average carrying value of such investments was Rs.

37.22 per share and hence, a loss on sale of investments of Rs. 3,289.17 lakhs has been recorded in the

current year.

On April 6, 2021, the Company has transferred 172,731,531 equity shares of Rs. 10 each of Max Life to

Axis Bank, fully paid up at a price of Rs. 32.12 per share for consideration aggregating to Rs. 55,481.37

lakhs. Consequently, the Company has accounted for an impairment loss of Rs. 8,816.05 lakhs in the value

of such investments in the current year, being the difference between weighted average carrying value of

such investments i.e. Rs. 37.22 per share and the transaction price.

The transaction price of Rs. 31.51 and Rs. 32.12 per share is computed based on the valuation of Max Life

conducted as per Rule 11 UA read with Rule 11 UAA of the Income-tax Rules, 1962 (herein referred to

as ‘Transaction Price’). The methodology of computation of transaction price was approved by 99.90%

shareholders through postal ballot and also stated in the definitive agreements entered with Axis Entities.

Post the Axis Bank stake sale transaction, Axis Entities hold 13% equity shares of Max Life and the

Company’s investment in equity shares of Max Life has decreased from 90.83% to 81.83%.

In respect of right of Axis entities to acquire 7% of equity share capital of Max Life, the Company had

executed definitive agreement with the parties, which is subject to receipt of requisite regulatory

approvals. Pending receipt of requisite approvals, the said transaction cannot be considered concluded at

the current date and hence, no adjustments have been made in the standalone financial statements.
