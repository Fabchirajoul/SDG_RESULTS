a) UPL Limited (UPL) a customer of erstwhile Gujarat Gas Company Limited(now known as Gujarat Gas Limited) had filed a

complaint before Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) against erstwhile GGCL alleging charging of tariff illegally

under the City Gas Network Distribution Agreement entered into between the Parties. The matter was decided against the Group by

PNGRB vide its Order dated 20.10.2014. The Group had preferred an appeal at Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) against

the afore mentioned PNGRB Order. The Group had submitted a bank guarantee of ₹ 4,000 Lacs in favor of UPL.

APTEL has delivered final judgement on 10.03.2021 in favor of the Group by setting aside the afore mentioned PNGRB Order, and

has recorded that invocation of HAPI tariff by PNGRB for the negotiated arrangement between the parties was not only against the: letter and spirit of regulations defining tariff zone but also tantamount to rewriting of contract.

Limited “GGL”) had signed Gas supply agreement with Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPCL) for purchase of Re-
