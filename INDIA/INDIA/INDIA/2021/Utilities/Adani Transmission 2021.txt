§: Managing

Dear stakeholders,

I am pleased to present my

strategic overview for your

consideration.

Permit me to commence with a

note of over-arching optimism

related to both businesses –

transmission and distribution

- where we are present. The

country’s transmission sector

is poised for attractive growth

through this decade. For a sector

as mature as that of India’s

transmission sector, the projected

growth indicates a structural shift

in the industry that is expected

to widen the sector on the one

hand and benefit the nimble and

prepared on the other.

The country’s distribution sector

is proceeding towards a similar

inflection point. The time is

coming when a number of urban

distribution networks will be

privatised with the objective

to infuse private capital and

enterprise into their turnarounds,

growth and modernisation.

I am pleased to communicate

that Adani Transmission enjoys

an early mover’s advantage in

capitalising on both opportunities.

The company has emerged

as an attractive proxy of

both businesses and we are

optimistic of enhancing growth

in a sustainable way for all our

stakeholders across the long-term.

The challenges of

FY 2020-21

The year FY 2020-21 was one

of the most momentous in our

experience.

Anil Sardana,: Managing

Managing Director and Chief

Executive Officer

since electricity first started being

generated more than a century

ago is expected to be more than

replicated in only a decade-and-a

half.

At the back of these compelling

realities is the reality that

India’s per capita consumption

of electricity is only around

1,149 kWh compared with the

corresponding global average

of more than three times this

number and consumption

of more than 12,000 kWh in

advanced countries like USA.

This indicates that as economic

growth accelerates, there is a

possibility of accelerated per

capita electricity consumption

that would warrant a substantial

addition in power transmission

and distribution infrastructure.

The country’s power transmission

sector is evolving from the

regulated form of transmission

projects allocation to tariff-

based competitive bidding, a

level playing field for the fittest

player to survive and for projects

to be awarded with complete

bidding transparency. Besides,

the Indian transmission sector is

poised to capitalise on the fact

that the world is rapidly moving

towards renewable energy forms,

warranting new transmission

lines and networks to evacuate

renewable energy.

Even as India’s transmission sector

is poised at an inflection point, its

distribution sector is at an early

stage of reform as well, marked by

a growing room for privatisation

leading to enhanced systemic

efficiency and overall sectorial

viability.

What gives me confidence is

that the Indian government

has secured the long-term

sustainability of the sector

through long-term policies that

have been timely, continuous

and irreversible, enhancing

the confidence of Indian and

international investors and

lenders.

Integrated Annual Report 2020-21

067:

Dear stakeholders,

At Adani Transmission, we

are committed to sustained

environmental stewardship,

social responsibility and business

outperformance.

In FY 2020-21, the company

delivered across demanding

economic, social and

environmental parameters

in pursuit of its vision of

transmission sector leadership.

Our performance reflected not

only on where we stood for the

moment, but also where we are

headed.

At the heart of our

competitiveness has been a

robust capital management

programme. This programme has

consistently focused on interest

reduction, extended debt maturity

and an optimised capital structure

for a business that is capital-

intensive and where the asset

remains relevant for decades.

The effectiveness of this multi-

dimensional focus resulted in the

highest growth-adjusted RoCE

among global peers in FY 2020-

21. The Company completed its

capital management plan for

operational assets following

the issue of long-term bonds

mobilised from the international

debt market and the onboarding

of strategic partner in Qatar

Investment Authority. By the

close of the financial year under

review, the company’s financial

structure had secured growth

initiatives with a large and

competitive pipeline of funds.

We believe that these initiatives

de-risked the company on the

one hand and provided available

growth resources to capitalise

on sectorial opportunities on the

other.

Dear stakeholders,

At ATL, we believe that responsible and transparent governance is vital to creating

long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders while consistently achieving our

strategic objectives.

Our governance commitment

extends beyond our compliance

with the requirements of

Securities and Exchange Board

of India and the Companies Act,

2013.

Adani Transmission formalised an

ATL-ESG Strategy and Steering

Framework with the goal ‘To

be in the top companies of the

world in ESG benchmarking of

electric utilities by FY 2022-23’.

This framework aligns the focus

of the management team with

the strategic vision of the Board

of Directors. It integrates ESG

into the way we do business and

decision making.

Based on prioritised material

issues in our business, the ATL-

ESG framework rests on three

strategic pillars of ‘Commitment

Towards Global Climate Actions’,

‘Corporate Citizenship Enabling

Social Transformation’ and

‘Responsible Business Practices’.

Each material issue warranted

actions for improvement and key

performance indicators (KPIs).

Besides other mandatory

committees of the Board as

per applicable regulations

in the country, the company

created a Sustainability and CSR

Committee, a sub-committee

of the Board of Directors. The

ATL Board Committee charter

is publicly visible on the ATL

website. By a resolution of the

Board of Directors, responsibilities

of regular monitoring, reporting

and public disclosures of ESG

performance are delegated to

the chair of the management,

the policy on the company’s

employee portal. Further, to

ensure compliance, all employees

are trained on the Anti-Corruption

and Anti-Bribery policy as well as

the Code of Conduct at the time

of their induction and annually

thereafter. ATL’s annual online

mandatory training on the zero-

tolerance policy ensures that

employees are able to recognise,

avoid, raise concerns and report

any potential instances of bribery

or corruption. The managers at all

levels are responsible for training

employees in the Anti-Corruption

and Bribery Policy.

To ensure that business partners

practice the same ethical

standards as ATL, the Anti-

Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy

is communicated to contractors,

suppliers and other third parties

through ATL’s supplier Code of

Conduct and vendor agreements.

According to the Supplier Code
