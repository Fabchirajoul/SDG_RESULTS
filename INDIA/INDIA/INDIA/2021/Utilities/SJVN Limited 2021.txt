LETTER TO THE

SHAREHOLDERS:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you to the 33rd Annual General Meeting and to present the Annual Report of your Company for the financial year

2020-21.

The Audited Financial Statements of the Company along with the Reports of the Auditors and Directors for the year 2020-21 are presented for your approval

and I take this opportunity to share your Company’s performance, position and prospects with you.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR 2020-21

Dear Friends,

Financial Year 2020-21 has marked its place in the history as a year of adversities. COVID-19 pandemic unleashed an unprecedented humanitarian, social and

economic crisis on a global scale. We as a Nation grappled with the two massive waves of COVID-19, which wreaked havoc on the entire humanity. It was a

year in which most of us faced physical, emotional, mental and financial challenges on personal and official fronts. It was also a year when the less privileged

were disproportionately hurt by unemployment and poverty. But above all, it was a time when companies discovered what they really were and sometimes,

what they might become. Entire humanity has stood up to these difficult times and learned to come out of it stronger.

As head of Team SJVN, my heart is filled with pride, to share with you all that, with the collective and relentless efforts of your Management supported by a

formidable team of employees, SJVN has demonstrated its resilience in this phase of adversity and has come up in flying colors.

It was a year in which a flurry of challenges were unleashed upon the Company on all fronts. Turbulent times put us through the biggest of tests. As if

Global pandemic was not enough, our Operational Hydro projects faced one of the toughest years in terms of hydrological conditions. Similarly our under-

construction Projects were confronted with impediments such as workforce migration and irregular supply of material at project sites induced by recurrent

waves of global pandemic.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE: Dear Shareholders,

Braving all the challenges in our path, we have managed to maintain the outstanding operational performance and generated 9224 million units of

electricity from our five Power Stations against Design Energy of 8700 Million Units during FY 2020-21, achieving significant milestones and shattering many

records on the way.

In July 2020, Rampur Hydro Power Station (RHPS) recorded highest ever Monthly Power Generation of 333.695 MU as compared to its earlier record of

327.027 MU of July 2019. In another proud moment, Nathpa Jhakri Hydro Power Station (NJHPS) achieved highest ever Single Day Power Generation

of 39.373 MU on 21st August 2020 surpassing its own record of 39.363 MU achieved on 3rd Sept 2015. NJHPS also achieved highest ever monthly power

generation of 1213.101 MU in the month of July 2020 exceeding the earlier record of 1191.217 MU of July 2014.

CHAIRMAN’S LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

Dear Shareholders,

Presently, the Project Portfolio of the Company comprises of a total of 26 Projects totaling 8930.5 MW out of which 6 Projects (2016.5 MW) are Operational,

7 Projects (3226 MW) are under Construction, 3 Projects (501 MW) are under Investment approval/ pre-construction and 10 Project (3187 MW) are in Survey

and Investigation Stage. In addition, 1 Transmission Line project of 86 km is operational and another 2 Transmission Line Projects totaling 257 km are under

Construction. Thus, the Project Development activities have also scaled to a Record High during the previous year.

The detailed status and progress of Operational Plants and other Projects under development has been amply covered in the Directors’ Report. Hence,

I would only like to highlight some noteworthy accomplishments during the year. Investment approvals for construction of 66 MW Dhaulasidh HEP and

210 MW Luhri Stage-1 HEP and for pre-construction activities of Jangi Thopan Powari HEP were obtained from Government of India. EPC Packages for

Dhaulasidh HEP and Luhri Stage-1 HEP were also awarded during the year.

Financial Closure of Buxar Thermal Power Project was achieved. Consortium financing arrangements for Kholongchhu HEP and Buxar Thermal Power

Project were also finalized during the year.

Your Management was quick to recognize the need to take urgent action to cushion the consequences of pandemic and set the stage for speedy recovery

of progress of projects under implementation to bring them back on track. Instead of sitting with hand on hand and hiding behind the excuse adverse

circumstances, your Management took bold and proactive decision to formulate and implement Acceleration Plan in 900 MW Arun-3 HEP to recover the

time and cost setbacks after carefully weighing the costs and benefits of such action. Such courageous decision making and proactive actions are rare in

Public Sector Companies.

BUSINESS EXPANSION: Dear Shareholders,

The spree of good news for our investors continues on business expansion front too. During FY 2020-21 and first Quarter of 2021-22, another 1325 MW of

Capacity has been added to Company’s Portfolio. This cannot be considered as an insignificant achievement by any standard, considering the all-round

economic recession during the period.

Government of Himachal Pradesh allotted Three Hydro Electric Projects namely, 104 MW Tandi, 130 MW Rashil and 267 MW Sach Khas Hydro Electric

Projects on the Chenab Basin in Himachal Pradesh to SJVN.

The Investment Board of Nepal allotted 679 MW Lower Arun Hydro Electric Project located in Sankhuwasabha and Bhojpur Districts of Nepal to SJVN. We

have obtained the Project through International Competitive Bidding, after competing with various international companies.

In addition, SJVN also bagged 70 MW in Gujarat under Gujarat Solar PV Project- Phase XII and 75 MW Grid-Connected Solar Power Project at Parasan,

Uttar Pradesh through competitive bidding process. By increasing its footprints in the Solar sector, SJVN shall be contributing in realization of Hon’ble

Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi’s vision of providing 175 GW of power through renewable sources by 2022 and contribute to the growth story of the

nation.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS

Dear Shareholders,

SJVN joined International Solar Alliance (ISA) as Corporate Member. This prestigious membership will provide SJVN a global platform to garner cooperation

amongst member countries to enhance the use of Solar Energy in a safe, convenient, affordable, equitable and sustainable manner.

SJVN signed MoU with Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA) for providing its services to SJVN for Green Energy projects. IREDA

will undertake Techno-Financial due diligence of Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency & Conservation Projects for SJVN.

I again feel delighted to share that the Dalal Street Investment Journal has recognized SJVN as the “Most Efficient and Profitable Mini Ratna of the Year”

in the PSU Award of the Year 2020.

To sum it all, it would not be an overstatement to state that SJVN has managed to excel and perform on all fronts and has proved its mettle amidst times

of adversity. Living upto the faith posed by our stakeholders, we have laid the foundation for long term growth and prosperity of this organization.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR 2021-22

Dear Friends,

We have embarked on a new financial year with lots of promises, aspirations and dreams to take SJVN to next level. In the first quarter of the Financial

Year 2021-22, 2436 MU of power has already been generated. Out of this, NJHPS generated 1867 MU, RHPS generated 523 MU, Renewable Power Projects

have generated a total of 46 MU till 30th June 2021.

Both NJHPS and RHPS once again exceeded the Monthly Generation Record in the month of July 2021 by generating 1216.565 MU and 335.905 MU of

Dear Shareholders,

The world is gradually recovering from the COVID Pandemic. However, the period of trouble is far from over. It would take significant time for Nations and

businesses to recoup the losses suffered in the last 2 years and walk back on the course of full recovery. The experts are predicting a sharp rebound in

economic activity once the threat of COVID-19 is brought down to a manageable level. According to the World Bank, the global economy is expected to

grow 5.6% in 2021-22. This is the fastest post-recession pace in the last 80 years. We continue to remain cautiously optimistic in the short to medium term.

On Government Policy front, some key developments and reform initiatives have taken place which are likely to have a bearing upon our business and

financials.

In a significant development, the CERC has amended regulation 59 of CERC (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) Regulations, 2019 whereby, it has been

prescribed that the charges payable by a beneficiary or long term customer shall be first adjusted towards Late Payment Surcharge on the outstanding

charges and thereafter, towards monthly charges levied by the generating company or the transmission licensee, as the case may be, starting from the

longest overdue bill. This reform initiative has a direct bearing on the outstanding bill position of the company and the results have already started reflecting

in the financials of the Company. An amount of ₹476.87 crore has been recovered on account of Late Payment Surcharge from the beneficiaries during FY

2020-21. The position of Outstanding Bills has also shown a significant improvement.

Hon’ble Finance Minister, Govt. of India on 13th May 2020, decided to infuse liquidity of ₹90,000 Crores in the power sector through PFC Ltd. and REC Ltd.

to enable the sector to maintain power supplies and keep the lights on, as cash flows had plummeted during lockdown imposed to contain the spread

of COVID-19. Under this intervention, REC and PFC would extend special long term transition loans upto 10 years to Power Distribution Companies for

liquidating outstanding dues of Central Public Sector Undertaking-Generation & Transmission Companies, Independent Power Producers and Renewable

Energy generators as existing on 30.06.2020.

The guidelines for Hydro Purchase Obligations (HPO), Budgetary support for Flood Moderation and Enabling Infrastructure are under advance stage of

discussion and likely to be issued soon. The saleability issues facing hydropower would be addressed through HPO, tariff rationalisation measures and

budgetary support for flood moderation and enabling infrastructure like roads, bridges etc. Large Hydropower projects (>25 MW) would also become

eligible for green funding after being categorised as renewable energy source.

Government of India has been driving a vibrant renewable energy programme aimed at achieving energy security, energy access and reducing the carbon

footprints of the national economy. This is in line with India’s commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity

by 33 to 35 percent below 2005 levels and to achieve 40 percent of installed electric power capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030. With progressively

declining costs, improved efficiency and reliability, renewable energy is now an attractive option for meeting the energy needs across different sectors of

the economy. However, renewable energy technologies are still evolving in terms of technological maturity and cost competitiveness and face numerous

market related, economic and social barriers.

In order to promote generation from renewable sources of energy, Ministry of Power, Govt. of India has issued an Order on 5th August 2020 for extension of

waiver of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) charges and losses for transmission of the electricity generated from solar and wind projects commissioned

till 30th June 2023.

Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for procurement of power from Grid Connected Wind-Solar Hybrid Projects have been notified

under section 63 of Electricity Act, 2003. These Guidelines provide for standardization and uniformity of the procurement process and a risk-sharing framework

between various stakeholders, thereby encouraging investments, enhancing bankability of projects and improving profitability. The Guidelines also facilitate

transparency and fairness in the procurement processes which have resulted in the drastic fall in solar and wind power prices over the past few years.

Foreign investors can now enter into joint venture with an Indian partner for financial and/or technical collaboration and for setting up of renewable energy-

based power generation projects. Upto 100 per cent foreign investment as equity qualifies for automatic approval. Foreign Direct Investments are likely to

rejuvenate the Renewable Energy Space by infusing smart Money, Technology, Management and Competitiveness.

For quality assurance, standards for deployment of solar photovoltaic systems/devices have been notified. Renewable energy projects have been given

priority sector lending status for loans up to a limit of ₹30 crore.

FUTURE PROSPECTS

My Dear Friends,

SJVN has already set foot on the path of becoming a transnational diversified world class power company. Going forward, our highest priority would be

to execute the projects in hand, with special focus on projects under construction, within the planned schedule. Wherever and whenever the situation

demands, we will not hesitate in taking extraordinary measures like implementation of Acceleration Plans to recoup the lost progress.

We foresee that, due to exponential growth in Solar & Wind capacities, there would be a huge demand for peaking power in the near future. By virtue of its

diversified portfolio, your company stands in a position of advantage in such a situation. Low Cost Power from the Solar and Wind Projects can be bundled

with peaking Power from Hydro Electric Projects which would help in averaging out the costs and bringing down the overall tariff of bundled power and

thereby enhancing its salability. This would be a win-win proposition for the Company as well as its beneficiaries.

Ever since the command of this Company was handed over to me, I took upon myself as my foremost challenge to change the notion that time and cost

overruns are inevitable in the projects executed by public sector companies. I soon discovered that this would not be possible without radically changing

the mind set and work culture of PSUs. Going forward, Government protection and patronage would not come to the rescue of PSUs. The Government

has clearly stated its policy that “Government has no business to be in business”. Disinvestment, Privatization, Foreign Direct Investments, Technological

Advancements etc. will throw in a new set of challenges from all directions. We have to face and fight an open competition in all spheres of our business

with some of the best competitors, not just confined to geographical limits of our country but on a Global Scale. My effort has been to Re-Invent, Re-

design, Re-adapt and Re-orient our Company to the ever changing business environment to make it fit for fighting this battle. We have engaged top rank:
