Dear Shareholders,

I have always started this: letter by sharing with you the operational and financial

achievements of RattanIndia Power during the year. The past year has been a challenging

one due to outbreak of COVID-19, which has caused irreparable damage to humanity as

well as caused economic disruption globally and in India. However, the Company has taken

proactive measures to ensure safety of its employees as well as support the community.

I write to you today with pride that, in spite of the continued impact of the pandemic

including the second wave of Covid-19 hitting the nation towards the end of the Financial

Year (2020-2021) and difficulties that businesses across the country/globe have faced, it

has been an exciting and extra-ordinary year for your Company.

I am happy to share that our efforts towards the resolution of the stress that your Company

had been facing in the past years through the ‘One Time Settlement’ Scheme (OTS) with

the original lenders (a group of 12 lenders with Power Finance Corporation Limited as Lead

Lender) to the Amravati Project concluded on 31 December 2019, has started bearing fruits.

You would appreciate that your Company has been successfully servicing its debt obligations

and paid ` 1,219 Crores towards debt servicing(including principal and interest) during the

previous 5 quarters (from January 2020 till March 2021), including pre-payment of ` 200 Crores. This has been a commendable

performance indeed, especially given the fact that the Company has not sought any financial or fiscal support from the schemes

announced by the Government to support industries and business during this pandemic, even though there was overall business

slowdown during these difficult and stressful times.

Industry Developments:

The Indian economy, which was gradually on the recovery path post the impact of the first wave of Covid-19 last year, had again

lost the pace of recovery due to this resurgence. However, India’s long term growth prospects continues to be positive, with the

World Bank continuing to be bullish about the growth of the Indian economy, projecting a growth of 7.5 percent in 2022-23. We

would be having a fully vaccinated and healthy work-force to address any concerns arising out of a slow-down and a resultant delay

in its economic recovery as the country has set a target to vaccinate its entire adult population by December 2021.

Despite all odds that the country has faced in general in the recent challenging times, India’s energy sector has witnessed

multifaceted growth, buoyed by policy interventions, reforms and investments. Various initiatives taken by the country in the

past, including the introduction of various key policies, like 100% electrification and electricity for all under the SAUBHAGYA

program and improvement in the transmission connectivity across various regions, would be the key drivers contributing to the

future increase in electricity demand in India. Growing out of the shadows of the pandemic, India’s demand for electricity continues

to grow with peak demand touching an all-time high of 200.57 GW on 7 July 2021.

India’s focus on electric mobility will also add significantly to the current demand. Currently, only 1% of the total vehicles sold in

the country are electric, which provides a huge market opportunity for growth in sale and adoption of electric vehicles. With the

country having set its target to move to a 100% electric eco-system by 2030, it is estimated to create an additional requirement

of 70 terawatt-hours of electricity.

India’s distribution sector continues to be the Achilles Heel for the growth and financial viability of the entire power sector. We

too, like other generating companies, continue to be inextricably linked to the viability of the Discoms. The Government of India

continues to focus on improving the efficiency of the distribution sector and has announced measures to reform the sector and

promote private participation in the distribution sector and providing choices to consumers. In this regard, the Union Finance

Minister, in her last budget speech, has announced a reforms-based and results-linked Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme with

a five-year outlay of ` 3.06 Trillion, tied to financial performance. Improvement in the health of the distribution segment augurs

well for the upstream business segments like generation and transmission. The expected competition in the distribution segment

would further bring in efficiency for the entire power sector.

The proposed introduction of the amendments to the Electricity Act 2003 through the Electricity Amendment Bill 2021 is also set to

bring about much required key changes in the functioning of the sector. Apart from offering greater choice to consumers by de-

licensing of the distribution business, it is also proposed to strengthen the regulatory commissions to expedite the process of

recovery of revenues, which have been otherwise locked up in long drawn litigations.

the Company which had an accumulated loss as on March 31, 2021 amounting to ` 7,176.42 crore resulting its ability

Letter of Intent (‘LOI’) by

Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (MSEDCL) in respect of LOI earlier issued by MSEDCL to enter into a power

purchase agreement with STPL and filing of petition before Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) by STPL,

as set forth in such note, indicate the existence of material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the STPL’s

ability to continue as a going concern. However, in view of the ongoing discussions relating to restructuring of its borrowings

and other debts with the lenders, better financial performance as a result of favourable business conditions expected in

future, entering into power purchase agreement with MSEDCL within reasonable time and other mitigating factors mentioned

in the aforesaid note, the management is of the view that going concern basis of accounting for STPL is appropriate and no

adjustments are necessary to the carrying value of the assets, including property plant and equipment of STPL as at 31

March 2021, as included in the accompanying Statement.

5)

We draw attention to Note 53 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to capital work-in-

progress (CWIP) aggregating to ` 43,773 lakhs, outstanding as at 31 March 2021, pertaining to construction of second

1350 MW power plant (Phase II) of STPL, which is currently suspended. Based on expected revival of the project and

other factors described in the aforesaid note, the management believes that no adjustment is required to the carrying

value of the aforesaid balances.

6)

We draw attention to Note 52 of the accompanying consolidated financial statement, which describes the uncertainties

due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and the Holding Company’s management’s evaluation of the same on the

consolidated financial results. In view of these uncertainties, the impact on the Group’s operations is significantly

dependent on future developments.

domestic coal linkages would be available to meet the fuel requirements. However, adequate coal supply was not

made available which adversely impacted cost as Company had to source fuel from alternate sources to meet the

shortfall of coal supplied under FSA with coal supplier. The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved

Standalone Notes Part of the Financial Statements (Contd.)

of RattanIndia Power Limited for the year ended 31 March 2021

(All amount in ` Lakhs, unless otherwise stated):

letter of intent (‘LOI’) to STPL for execution of PPA of 507 MW (net capacity). In order

to execute the PPA, STPL was required to furnish Contract Performance Guarantee (CPG) to MSEDCL in 3 months. Lenders of

STPL showed interest in starting the operations and in granting sanctions for required fund based working capital and non-

fund based facilities so as to execute aforementioned PPA with MSEDCL. However, due to COVID 19, Lenders of STPL could

not reach to any conclusion on sanctioning of required fund based working capital and non-fund based facilities and, thus

STPL was not able to furnish the requested CPG resulting in MSEDCL terminating the aforesaid LOI. Thereafter STPL has filed

a petition before Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) seeking directions to MSEDCL to withdraw its

termination notice; and secondly to execute the PPA with STPL as per the agreed terms and conditions, pursuant to the long

term Competitive Bidding Process. Also, refer note 58 on the effect of COVID 19. The management based upon legal analysis,

is of the view that the PPA would be restored in the favor of STPL.

In light of the aforesaid background, there is an uncertainty in execution of PPA between STPL and MSEDCL that may cast

significant doubt on STPL’s ability to continue as a going concern due to which STPL may not be able to realise its assets and

discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. However, given the recent initiatives taken by Lenders to operationalize

the plant in near future which includes exploring various options including divestment of part stake, the management is of

the view that STPL’s status as going concern for the purpose of accounting is appropriate. The Management has undertaken

assessment of recoverability of the financial assets and has created a necessary provision.

56

Revenue from operations on account of Change in Law events in terms of Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with MSEDCL

is accounted for by the Company based on the best management estimates including orders of Regulatory Authorities in

some cases, which may be subject to adjustments on account of final orders of Respective Authorities.
