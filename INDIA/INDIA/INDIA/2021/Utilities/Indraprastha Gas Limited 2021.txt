Letter of Intent(s) to facilitate waste

management and promote use of Bio-Gas. Your Company is

also working on opening of new avenues by setting up of its

own Compressed Biogas Plants under Gobardhan scheme &

Waste to Energy initiatives of the government.

The pilot project of running HCNG plant of IOCL in

collaboration with IGL & DTC has been completed at Rajghat

DTC depot, wherein 50 DIMTS buses were fuelled with HCNG.

The findings and data related to improvements in vehicular

emissions is being compiled by IOCL for submission to

Supreme Court. IGL is also exploring the possibilities of

putting up Green Hydrogen generation plant for blending

with natural gas for which detailed technical study shall be

conducted.

To promote inter-city public transport, IGL has successfully

showcased use of Type IV cylinder long-haul buses between

Delhi and Dehradun. To take it further, IGL is actively

exploring conversion of Long Haul Transport from pollutant

fuel (Diesel) to cleaner fuel (CNG) of various State Transport

Undertakings (STU’s) and Private Transporters towards

conversion of their vehicles on CNG.

As per diversification strategy, your Company is also looking

forward to setup Electric Vehicles (EV) charging facilities at

sub-judice in the Hon’ble Supreme court of India.

There are other growth drivers which shall contribute to the

sales volume in all segments of the Company’s business.

It is expected that the price differential of CNG and liquid fuel

will continue to drive the conversion of petrol-driven private

vehicles to CNG mode. DTC and DIMTS have plans to add

1000 and 400 new CNG buses respectively in their fleet which

would add to CNG sales of the Company. With the spread

of CNG in new geographical areas, car manufacturers are

coming out with new CNG variants cars.

In PNG domestic segment also, the Company is working

aggressively to meet the target. Also, thrust will be given on

bringing all services on a single digital platform for customers.

All types of customer request will be entertained via mobile

11) Specify the reason(s), if the company has failed to spend two per cent of the average net profit as per Section 135(5).

The financial year 2020-21 was marked by lockdowns and severe restrictions due to COVID-19 for a major part of the year. Many of

the well-established CSR projects/programmes, especially those related to education and skill development, either could not take

off or their pace of implementation was hampered due to the restrictions imposed by the administration from time to time. As a

result, many of the programmes related to schools including a few flagship programmes, could not be renewed due to physical

closure of the schools which has led to some unspent amount.

In compliance with the CSR Amendment Rules, unspent account against the ongoing CSR projects & programmes in FY 2020-21 has

been transferred to IGL Unspent CSR Account 2020-21 and the remaining amount is being transferred to a scheduled fund before

the scheduled date.
