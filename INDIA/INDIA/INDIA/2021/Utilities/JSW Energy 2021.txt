the Chairman and: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

2020 and 2021 have been amongst

the most challenging years in

decades. The unprecedented

health crisis, caused by the novel

coronavirus, took an immense human

as well as economic toll globally. At

JSW, we responded immediately with

a comprehensive covid-19 response

plan - putting in place health and

safety measures to protect our

employees; running our plant

operations smoothly to ensure supply

to our customers; and providing

essential support and assistance to

our local communities in need. Yet,

even in such critical circumstances,

our company reported a solid set

of financial results and fortified our

growth plans with new projects and

foray into renewable energy. This has

clearly demonstrated the strength

and resilience of our business

model. Today, we have a significantly

de-risked operating portfolio and a

robust balance sheet – one of the

strongest in the sector - enabling us

to pursue growth meaningfully.

The pandemic has accentuated the

need to build sustainable businesses

for navigating such headwinds in

the future, albeit those that could

emerge as a result of climate change

in the coming years. Climate change

and Sustainability is at the core of

JSW Energy’s growth agenda. We

have focused our growth strategies

towards transforming our generation

portfolio to ~70% renewable driven

by FY25. By embracing new-age

green energy as our foundation for

dynamic growth, we are transforming

ourselves to ensure that we become

a ‘net-zero’ contributor of greenhouse

gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 or

even earlier.

We aim to grow our portfolio to a

capacity of 10 GW by FY25 and

20 GW by FY30, solely through the

renewable energy segment. In line

with this, we have announced 2.5

GW of growth projects, that are

currently under-construction. We

have also taken various actions to

strengthen our ESG agenda, including

the adoption of comprehensive

sustainability policies, clearly laid

out targets and developing a 2030

sustainability roadmap.

Resilient Business, Consistent

Performance

In FY2021, even amidst a relatively

weaker macro-economic scenario,

peak power demand hit an all-time

high of 190 GW. The overall power

demand in the country, though

weaker in first half of the fiscal, saw

a sharp recovery in the second half,

and witnessed only a 1.2% decline

YoY. Out of the 12 GW total capacity

added in the country in FY2021, 8 GW

was contributed by renewable energy

sector, including hydro energy.

Despite the pandemic induced

challenges, JSW Energy delivered

a healthy performance, driven by

focused execution and financial

prudence. In-line with our strategic

intent to de-risk the business,

our long term PPA tie-up has now

increased to 86%, up from 81% at the

end of FY2020. Overall net generation

from long term portfolio increased by

3% YoY during the year supported by

a healthy offtake from our customers.

Our O&M cost per MW continued to

further decline YoY in FY21 and is a

benchmark in the industry across

various segments of thermal,

lignite and hydro. We optimized our

operational efficacy by accelerating

digitalization of operations,

increasing agility in working

remotely and adopting best industry

practices via TQM processes. Both,

increasing long term tie-ups as well

as optimizing O&M costs has helped

us to improve the quality of our

earnings resulting in a steady EBITDA

generation over the past few years,

thus insulating us from the volatile

sector dynamics.

Our financial risk profile continues to

remain strong aided by significant

deleveraging and efficient working

capital management. Over the last

3-4 years, we have optimized our

capital structure through proactive

repayments, prepayments and

refinancing. This effectively helped us

to improve our bottom line through a

meaningful reduction in finance cost.

Our leverage profile now enables us

to execute our growth plans, while

maintaining prudent debt metrics. On

the receivables front, when a large

section of the power generating

stations in the country are facing

elongated receivable days due to the

weak financial profile of the Discoms,

our stringent working capital

practices helped us in reducing the

receivables, which stood at a three-

year low at the end of fiscal 2021.

We achieved two key feats in our

hydro portfolio. First, our persistent

efforts materialized as the Central

Electricity Authority (CEA) approved

uprating of our Karcham Wangtoo

plant by 91 MW to 1091 MW, in

a phased manner. Second, we

issued our debut green bond of

USD 707 million to refinance the

term loan of the operating assets,

tapping the offshore bond market

amid a tough pandemic scenario.

The overwhelming response to

this maiden issue has been very

humbling and has enabled us to

diversify our funding sources and

develop strong relationships with

global investors, which bodes well for

our funding needs for the renewable

energy growth aspirations going

ahead.

Renewable Powered Growth

Rapid growth in urbanisation,

universal electrification, and a

renewable energy transition driven by

climate change, implies that India’s

incremental power needs will be

largely met by renewable energy. Our

business strategy is perfectly aligned

with this, offering us a material

Corporate Governance Report:

Director's Report, Management

Discussion and Analysis, Corporate Governance Report,

Business Responsibility Report, and other reports in the

Annual Report but does not include the consolidated

financial statements, standalone financial statements, and

our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does

not cover the other information and we do not express any

form of assurance conclusion thereon

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial

statements, our responsibility is to read the other

information and, in doing so, consider whether the other

information is materially inconsistent with the standalone

financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the

course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially

misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that

there is a material misstatement of this other information,

we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to

report in this regard.

Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone

Financial Statements

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the

matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to

the preparation of these standalone financial statements

that give a true and fair view of the financial position,

financial performance including other comprehensive

income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in

accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles

generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes

maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance

with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of

the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and

other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate

accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that

are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation

and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,

that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy

and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to

the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial

statement that give a true and fair view and are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements,

management is responsible for assessing the Company’s

ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as

applicable, matters related to going concern and using the

going concern basis of accounting unless management

either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease

operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing

the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone

Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about

whether the standalone financial statements as a whole

are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud

or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our

opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,

but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance

with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it

exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are

considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they

could reasonably be expected to influence the economic

decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone

financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise

professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism

throughout the audit. We also:

•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement

of the standalone financial statements, whether due

to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures

responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence

that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis

for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material

misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for

one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,

forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or

the override of internal control.

•

Obtain an understanding of internal financial control

relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures

that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under

section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for

expressing our opinion on whether the Company has

adequate internal financial controls system in place

and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies

used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates

and related disclosures made by the management.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s

use of the going concern basis of accounting and,

based on the audit evidence obtained, whether

a material uncertainty exists related to events or

conditions that may cast significant doubt on the

Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If

we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we

are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report

to the related disclosures in the standalone financial

statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to

modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the

audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s

report. However, future events or conditions may cause

the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content

of the standalone financial statements, including the

disclosures, and whether the standalone financial

statements represent the underlying transactions and

events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.:

financial statements, standalone financial statements and

our auditor’s reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does

not cover the other information and we do not express any

form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial

statements, our responsibility is to read the other

information, compare with the financial statements of the

subsidiaries audited by the other auditors, to the extent

it relates to these entities and, in doing so, place reliance

on the work of the other auditors and consider whether

the other information is materially inconsistent with

the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge

obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise

appears to be materially misstated. Other information so far

as it relates to the subsidiaries, is traced from their financial

statements audited by the other auditors.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that

there is a material misstatement of this other information,

we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to

report in this regard.

Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated

Financial Statements

The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the

matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements

that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial

position, consolidated financial performance including

other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and

consolidated changes in equity of the Group including its

Associate and a joint venture in accordance with the Ind

AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in

India. The respective Board of Directors of the companies

included in the Group and of its associate and a joint venture

are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting

records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for

safeguarding the assets of the Group and its associate

and its joint venture and for preventing and detecting

frauds and other irregularities; selection and application

of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and

estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design,

implementation and maintenance of adequate internal

financial controls, that were operating effectively for

ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting

records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the

financial statements that give a true and fair view and are

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or

error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation

of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of

the Parent, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the

respective Board of Directors of the companies included

in the Group and of its associate and a joint venture are

responsible for assessing the ability of the respective

entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as

applicable, matters related to going concern and using the

going concern basis of accounting unless the respective

Board of Directors either intends to liquidate their respective

entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative

but to do so.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included

in the Group and of its associate and a joint venture are also

responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process

of the Group and of its associate and a joint venture.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated

Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about

whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole

are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud

or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our

opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance

but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance

with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it

exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are

considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they

could reasonably be expected to influence the economic

decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated

financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise

professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism

throughout the audit. We also:

•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement

of the consolidated financial statements, whether due

to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures

responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence

that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis

for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material

misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for

one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,

forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or

the override of internal control.

•

Obtain an understanding of internal financial control

relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures

that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under

section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible

for expressing our opinion on whether the Parent has

adequate internal financial controls system in place

and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies

used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates

and related disclosures made by the management.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use

of the going concern basis of accounting and, based

on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material

uncertainty exists related to events or conditions

that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the

Group and its associate and a joint venture to continue

as a going concern. If we conclude that a material:
