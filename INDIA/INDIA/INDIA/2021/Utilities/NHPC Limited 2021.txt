LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS: Dear Shareholders,

Last one and half years have been extraordinarily

difficult by any measure. During this period we have

witnessed a global pandemic, a global recession and

unprecedented government actions like lockdowns.

Each one of us has faced difficult personal challenges,

and many of us lost loved ones. My heart goes out

to everyone who have lost their loved ones. I feel the

pain and sorrow of the family members as the NHPC

family too lost many of its wonderful members.

This tough period is not yet over but I am very hopeful

that the impact of pandemic will recede gradually in

near future, as more and more people get vaccinated.

I urge you all to get vaccinated, motivate others and

remain vigilant by adhering to COVID appropriate

behavior. I am confident that we shall soon overcome

this pandemic with discipline, focus and fortitude. We

are embracing the change to create more value for

our stakeholders with our incredibly talented team.

We view fiscal 2021 as turning a page - we are no

longer navigating a crisis - we are facing a new reality,

and we are ready.

COMBATING THE PANDEMIC

As the pandemic raged throughout the year, we

were keenly focused on what we, as a company,

could do to serve the society better. I am proud of

the response and what our company and our

thousands of employees achieved, collectively and

individually.

Your Company established COVID care centers with

oxygen support facilities and related amenities at its

various power stations/ projects across the country.

Through our hospitals/ dispensaries we have provided

24X7 OPD services to the local populace residing

near our locations. Your Company is also funding for

setting up of oxygen plants at various Govt. hospitals

besides providing support for purchase of oxygen

concentrators to augment the supply side logistics

related to availability of medical oxygen.

Vaccination is the most important armor we have

against the pandemic and it is going to play a

critical role in reining it. Your Company has actively

participated in the vaccination drive and nearly all

directed to schedule power to DISCOMs only after

intimation by Generating Companies (GENCOs) that

LCs for desired quantum of power has been opened

Risk management framework

The Company’s activities make it susceptible to various risks. The Company has taken adequate measures to address

such concerns by developing adequate systems and practices. Company has a well-defined risk management policy to

provide overall framework for the risk management in the Company. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility

for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk management framework.

The Company is exposed to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

i)

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer

contract, leading to a financial loss. The company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade

receivables/leased assets) and from its financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions.

ii)

Liquidity risk.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations

without incurring unacceptable losses.

iii)

Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes

in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk: currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other price

risks, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and

borrowings, deposits and investments. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a

financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the

fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The company operates in a regulated environment. Tariff of the company is fixed by the Central Electricity

Regulatory Commission (CERC) through Annual Fixed Charges (AFC) comprising the following five components:

1. Return on Equity (RoE), 2. Depreciation, 3. Interest on Loans, 4. Operation & Maintenance Expenses and 5. Interest on

Working Capital Loans. In addition to the above Foreign Currency Exchange variations and Taxes are also recoverable

from Beneficiaries in terms of the Tariff Regulations. Hence variation in interest rate, currency exchange rate variations

and other price risk variations are recoverable from tariff and do not impact the profitability of the company.

(B) Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing

activities, including deposits with banks and other financial instruments.:

letter dated 2nd August 2019 has raised demand on Teesta-V Power

Station for ` 35.80 Crore (Previous year ` 35.80 Crore) towards acquisition of land and compensation

for appurtenant houses and other structures on the said Land which were purportedly damaged by Dam

water during FY 2014. The claim has been refuted by the management on the grounds that the land is not

required by the Power station and also damages were not on account of construction activities which were

completed back in FY 2008. The damage has apparently happened due to existence of old slide zones in

the area. The notification for acquisition of land under the RFCTLARR Act, 2013 published in the Sikkim

Government Gazette on 06.03.2018 is unilateral and without the consent of the Power Station and as such

is legally not tenable. The matter is currently under discussion with the State Government and pending

further review and discussion/ agreement on the matter and considering that the demand pertains to the

Land which has not been requisitioned by the Company for Power Station and as such no cash outflow is

expected in this respect.

2.

Contingent Assets: Contingent assets in respect of the Company are on account of the following:

a)

Counter Claims lodged by the company on other entities:

The company has lodged counter claims aggregating to ` 971.12 Crore (Previous year ` 915.84 Crore)

against claims of other entities. These claims have been lodged on the basis of contractual provisions

and are being contested at arbitration tribunal/other forums/under examination with the counterparty.

It includes counter claims of ` 28.16 Crore (Previous year ` 28.16 Crore) towards arbitration awards

including updated interest thereon.

Based on Management assessment,a favourable outcome is probable in respect of the claims aggregating

` 841.22 Crore (Previous year ` 803.37 Crore) and for rest of the claims, the possibility of any inflow is

remote. Accordingly, these claims have not been recognised.

b)

Late Payment Surcharge:

CERC (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) Regulations 2014-19/2019-24 provide for levy of Late Payment

Surcharge by generating company in case of delay in payment by beneficiaries beyond specified days

from the date of presentation of bill. In view of significant uncertainties in the ultimate collection from the

beneficiaries, an amount of ` 60.94 Crore (previous year ` 239.48 Crore) as estimated by the management

has not been recognised.

c)

Revenue to the extent not recognised in respect of power stations:

Tarifforders for 2019-24 are pending in respect of all Power stations. Management has assessed that

additional revenue of ` 4.93 Crore (Previous year ` 545.31 Crore) is likely to accrue on account of tariff

revision which has not been recognised due to significant uncertainty for the approval thereof.

d)

Business Interruption Losses

Insurance Claims due to Business Interruption Losses in respect of Power Stations are recognised when no

significant uncertainty of ultimate collection exists. Management has assessed the claim of ` 417.57 Crore

(Previous Year ` 210.05 Crore) in this respect which has not been recognised. Power Station-wise details

of claims are given at Note 34(23) of the standalone Financial Statements.

e)

Other Cases

Claims on account of other miscellaneous matters estimated by Management to be ` 553.04 Crore

(Previous year ` 374.59 Crore) has not been recognised.
