approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.

(ii)

Erstwhile Gujarat Gas Company Limited and Erstwhile GSPC Gas Company Limited (Now collectively known as Gujarat Gas

Limited “GGL”) had signed Gas supply agreement with Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPCL) for purchase of

Re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG). As per the provision of said agreement, GGL has to pay interconnectivity charges to

GSPCL for the supply and purchase of RLNG at Delivery point which is charged to GSPCL by their supplier i.e.PLL Off takers

(GAIL India, BPCL, IOCL).

PGNRB had vide its orders dated 13.09.2011 of Chairman and dated 10.10.2011 of the majority members (three member panel

of Board) unanimously held that GAIL had adopted Restrictive Trade Practices by blocking off direct connectivity to GSPC and

further, directed Respondents to immediately give direct connectivity to GSPC at Dahej Terminal. The PLL Offtakers (GAIL) filed

appeals against the said PNGRB orders before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). On 23-February-2012 APTEL had

issued an interim order for shifting the Delivery Point from GAIL-GSPL Delivery Point to GSPL-PLL Delivery Point. On 18-

December-2013 APTEL issued its judgment and required GSPCL to pay the amount of the difference between ` . 8.74/MMBTU

(exclusive of Service Tax) – earlier connectivity charges and ` 19.83/MMBTU (Exclusive of Service Tax) – HVJ/DVPL Zone-1

tariff to GAIL for the period from 20th November 2008 to 29th February 2012.

GSPCL has filed an appeal against the APTEL’s above referred judgment before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (GSPCL vs. GAIL

& Others, Civil Appeal No. 2473-2476 of 2014) and the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India had passed the Interim Order on 28th

February 2014. The Court has stated that the ends of justice would be met if as a matter of interim arrangement, the appellant is

directed to pay interconnectivity charges at the rate of ` 12.00 per MMBTU (exclusive of Taxes). The Company has already

provided and paid interconnectivity charges at the rate of ` 12.00 per MMBTU (exclusive of Taxes).

GGL has not received any bill / demand note for the amount over and above ` 12.00 per MMBTU from supplier till date. As the

final liability would only be determined post the final order of the court, quantification of any amount as contingent liability in the

interim is inappropriate due to the uncertainty involved and hence the same is not mentioned / disclosed in the financial

statement.

(iii)

One of the gas suppliers of the Company has submitted a claim of ` 523.82 Crores (P. Y. ` 508.24 Crores), for use of allocated

gas for other than specified purpose, demand in earlier years related to FY 2013-14 to FY 2019-20 (H1) and no claim received

from supplier for FY 2019-20 (H2) and FY 2020-21. The company has refuted this erroneous claim contending that there is

gross error in actual domestic gas purchase and actual sales considered by supplier and also there is no contractual provisions

of the agreement executed with GGL that allow such claim. The management is of the firm view that the company is not liable

to pay any such claim. The company has already taken up the matter with concerned party/authorities to withdraw the claim.

(iv) The company has initiated an arbitration proceeding against one of the franchisee claiming compensation for loss of revenue

While replying to the claim, the said franchisee has also filed a counter claim of ` 177.14 Crores (P. Y. ` 177.14 Crores) against

the company claiming compensation for various losses. The company has filed necessary rejoinder to the counter claim

strongly refuting the same mainly on the grounds that the counter claims are wrong and without merits and as are not flowing

from the same agreement under which the arbitral tribunal has been constituted. Further, the tribunal does not have any

jurisdiction to adjudicate the counter claim filed by the franchisee.

(iii) One of the gas suppliers of the Company has submitted a claim of ` 523.82 Crores (P. Y. ` 508.24 Crores), for use of allocated

gas for other than specified purpose, demand in earlier years related to FY 2013-14 to FY 2019-20 (H1) and no claim received

from supplier for FY 2019-20 (H2) and FY 2020-21. The company has refuted this erroneous claim contending that there is

gross error in actual domestic gas purchase and actual sales considered by supplier and also there is no contractual provisions of

the agreement executed with GGL that allow such claim. The management is of the firm view that the company is not liable to

pay any such claim. The company has already taken up the matter with concerned party/authorities to withdraw the claim.

(iv) The company has initiated an arbitration proceeding against one of the franchisee claiming compensation for loss of revenue

While replying to the claim, the said franchisee has also filed a counter claim of ` 177.14 Crores (P. Y. ` 177.14 Crores) against

the company claiming compensation for various losses. The company has filed necessary rejoinder to the counter claim strongly

refuting the same mainly on the grounds that the counter claims are wrong and without merits and as are not flowing from the
