Covid-19 has ensured that 2020-21 will rank as the most devastating

year for the world economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

According to the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic

Outlook published in April 2021, the global economy declined by

3.3%, with advanced economies shrinking by 4.7% and emerging

markets and developing economies by 2.2%.

After a terrible first quarter of 2020-21, when virtually all activities

ceased and India’s real GDP collapsed by 24.4%, followed by the

second quarter that saw a decline of 7.4%, many believed that the

country was in for a truly catastrophic economic situation.

Thankfully,

India’s

innate

entrepreneurship

took

over

from the third quarter. And with 0.5% growth in the

third quarter followed by 1.6% in the fourth, India ended

2020-21 with a negative growth of 7.3%. In all fairness, this has

been a better performance in our annus horribilis than what most

economic commentators originally believed.

Your Company was not only affected by sharply falling power demand

on account of lockdowns but also a terrible natural calamity: Super

Cyclone Amphan, which occurred on 20 May 2020, right amidst the

nationwide lockdown during the first Covid-19 wave.

As I shared with you in considerable detail in my last year’s: letter,

with sustained wind speeds of over 120 kmph with gusts of over

190 kmph, Amphan was the strongest storm to hit South 24

Parganas, Kolkata and Howrah in over a decade. It toppled over

4,000 electric poles; triggered widespread flooding; and caused

damage estimated at around US$ 1 trillion.

I had then written that, despite shortage of staff on account of

Covid-19, “your Company worked around the clock on a war footing

to restore full power for 92% of its consumers within four days. And

for the rest in another couple of days. We were among the fastest

in the world in doing the restoration that we did.”

Amphan and the general shortage of power demand due to

Covid-19 induced lockdowns and slow start-up has seen a decline in

power usage. The peak power demand in 2020-21 was 1,865 MW,

versus 2,337 MW in 2019-20; and the energy requirement came

down by 11% from 11,018 million units (MU) in 2019-20 to 9,796

MU in 2020-21. About 91% of this requirement was met by CESC’s

own generation, including that of Haldia Energy Limited.

Consequently, on a standalone basis, total income (including other

income) of your Company in 2020-21 was Rs. 7101 crore, compared

to Rs.7,982 crore in 2019-20 — reflecting a decline of 11%, mostly

due to the Covid-induced lockdown in the first half of the year.

To combat this, your Company made strong efforts to control costs

on all fronts: operating expenses, employee costs and others.

Consequently, on a standalone basis, total expenses, including

depreciation and finance costs, was brought down by over 9% from

Rs. 7,395 crore in 2019-20 to Rs. 6,711 crore in 2020-21.

Even so, profit before taxes (PBT), after incorporating regulatory

income, was lower at Rs.847 crore in 2020-21, versus Rs.1,119 crore in

2019-20. Profit after taxes (PAT) for 2020-21 was Rs.814 crore,

compared to Rs.918 crore in the previous year.

On a consolidated basis, total income of CESC was Rs.11,874 crore

in 2020-21, which was 4% lower than the previous year. With

sustained cost control measures, total expenses were reduced by

over 6% to Rs.10,546 crore in 2020-21.

Consolidated PBT, after incorporating regulatory income, remained

stable at Rs.1,752 crore in 2020-21. And consolidated PAT grew by

4% to Rs.1,363 crore in 2020-21.

These are creditable results given the combined effects of two
