Managing Director

Manoj Jain:

Dear Shareholders,

I hope that all of you are safe and in good health. The year gone by

has been quite challenging for all of us due to the COVID-19

pandemic. It truly tested our mettle, wherein, we had to deal with a

very different world than the one we have known before. The

supple, yet firm and strong character of your Company built over

years, was put to strenuous test during these times and your

Company emerged out of it relatively unscathed. Here, I want to pay

our sincere gratitude to all frontline workers, who have been

working tirelessly, combating COVID-19 and its ill effects. With the

pandemic far from over, as we continue to face emerging threats

from new variants, we all must put our best efforts together to sail

through this uncharted territory. We are fully confident that with

concerted and collaborative efforts, we would successfully

overcome these challenges.

It is an honor and satisfaction for me to address you again to share

the performance highlights and achievements of your Company

during the FY 2020-21 and its future outlook. Despite the initial

contraction, our business has recovered and recorded a steady year

of performance in FY 2020-21. This year we have embarked upon

the Integrated Reporting journey, which talks about your

Company's performance across the six capitals, which I have

mentioned later in this message, contributing to the growth and

sustained value creation.

Balancing growth and returns for

long-term value creation

Your Company puts its focus on the present, but always with an eye

on the future. We have always strived to create sustainable value for

all our stakeholders. Our shareholders have been provided with

steady long-term returns on their investments through a consistent

dividend distribution. FY 2020-21 was a challenging year for the

entire sector due to the COVID-19 pandemic's first and subsequent

second wave. Despite the sluggish business environment, your

Company has paid dividend at ` 5 per share, representing a healthy

payout ratio of 45.8%. In FY 2020-21, your Company also rewarded

the investors through a maiden share buy-back, amounting to

` 1,274 crore, providing handsome returns to the investors. Despite

the challenging times, the market capitalization of the Company has

st

grown from ` 34,480 crore as of 31 March, 2020 to ` 60,189 crore

st

as on 31 March, 2021 reflecting strong investor confidence in your

Company.

Performance track record remains intact

You will be happy to know that your Company has performed

consistently and improved its robust fundamentals despite growing

complexities in the industry and the continued uncertainty

surrounding global economies. During the year under review, the

Petrochemical business has exhibited exemplary performance with

more than 100% capacity utilization. Your Company has also

achieved its highest-ever annual sales of Petrochemicals this year

with combined sales of over 1.18 MTPA for GAIL Pata and BCPL.

Your Company also successfully maintained uninterrupted and safe

operations of its pipeline systems and plants despite the pandemic

situation, ensuring continuous availability of Natural Gas and LPG to

the critical sectors in the country. Although your Company has

witnessed some decline in gas demand during the initial months of

the pandemic, the recovery in gas demand post-September has

brought our Gas Markeing and Transportation business back on

track to pre-covid levels. We have maintained our strong Capex

program and despite various COVID-19 induced constraints, your

Company has made a CAPEX of ~ ` 6,982 crore.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020-21

Managing Director

focus is on having Polypropylene (PP) production capacity through

setting up two polypropylene units (Propane Dehydrogenation

Polypropylene Plant – PDHPP in Usar, Maharasthra and PP Plant at

Pata, Uttar Pradesh) and assessing opportunities in certain speciality

chemicals in India. Your Company has successfully completed the

Licensors selection process for both the PDHPP and PP units during

the year. With the forthcoming capacity additions, your Company

will have a more balanced and diversified polymer portfolio of over

1.6 MTPA consisting of both Polyethylene (PE) and Polypropylene (PP).

Your Company is also promoting India's first-ever coal gasification-

based ammonia-urea project at Talcher through JV mode and has

concluded the financial closure of M/s Talcher Fertilizers Ltd. (TFL) in

June, 2021.

Your Company will be selectively investing in the Renewable

Energy (RE) domain given the future growth potential and is also

supporting GoI's initiatives towards meeting India's INDC (Intended

Nationally Determined Contributions) commitments on climate

change. Your Company has been scouting for opportunities to scale

up the RE portfolio from the current 130 MW through bidding and

other inorganic routes such as mergers and acquisitions. In addition,

your Company is also foraying into Ethanol and Hydrogen

generation. To promote new technologies, your Company has

invested in startups that focus on Electric Vehicles, digitization, etc.

Under SATAT initiative, a pilot project of 5 TPD Compressed Bio Gas

(CBG) plant at Ranchi, Jharkhand is being implemented in sync with

Government's vision of pursuing low carbon pathways and will

benefit environment, boost India's “Urja Atmanirbharta” and also

further economic growth by revitalizing rural economies. Thus, your

Company is continuously exploring new business opportunities that

can offer substantial growth along with portfolio diversification.

Acknowledgement

Before I conclude, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I wish to convey

our sincere regards and deep gratitude to our valued stakeholders for

continued support and trust. You always have been the motivational

force that has facilitated us to move ahead and achieve targets

despite the numerous challenges. I also put my heartfelt appreciation

for all GAIL employees who took on a courageous responsibility with a

commitment to ensure energy and feedstock supplies even during the

worst COVID-19 situation. They are the backbone of this Company

and they have put their best efforts day after day to transform your

Company and to make it more competitive.

I would like to conclude by saying that your Company is not only

resilient enough to go through this tough time but also to shape the

energy future. We will keep working to make a difference in your

life and to enhance the quality of your life through clean energy and

beyond.

Thank you,

Digital Strategy

Digital strategy is one of the critical pillars of "Strategy 2030", the

business strategy of GAIL. Your Company has made significant

investments in digital assets and new technologies, intending to

address the Company's future needs and to improve the overall

efficiency. Your Company has taken various digital initiatives like the

introduction of the digital worker for its robotic process automation,

digitization of contactor payment processing, digitization of

employee's payments etc., to give a boost to the Digital Yatra, which

your Company has embarked upon to manage its operations/

activities even during the pandemic digitally. Natural gas trading and

transportation invoice generation through BOT have been

successfully tested, and E-invoicing has been implemented under

GST. Bharat Bill Pay System (BBPS) has been implemented in CGD

business to enable customers to pay online through mobile.

Implementation of suitable digital solutions has helped your

Company to place orders/contracts worth ` 6,193 crore despite

COVID-19 challenges without any complications and within the rigid

timeline.

Integrated Reporting

Your Company has always been progressive in implementing

leading practices. We are pleased to present our first-ever

Integrated Report for FY 2020-21, following the International

Framework of Integrated Reporting. This next generation annual

report aims to provide an insight into your Company's resources and

relationships that are known as the capitals and how the Company

interacts with the external environment and the capitals to create

value. The integrated report highlights our value creation journey by

focusing on our performance on the six capitals (i.e. financial

capital, intellectual capital, natural capital, manufactured capital,

social & relationship capital, human capital), risk management,

governance, outlook and strategy as well as adherence to a

sustainable future.

Way Forward

The global energy sector is witnessing a paradigm shift in recent

years as the world is transitioning to a sustainable energy future. To

accomplish a cleaner primary energy mix for India, the Indian

Government is emphasizing the expansion of India's Natural Gas

sector and is also laying a roadmap for achieving a gas-based

economy along with growth in renewables. To boost the gas-based

economy, the Government has announced various reforms in the

gas sector, giving the much-needed thrust to the industry.

As a leading integrated energy major, your Company has aligned

itself with the Government's vision to play a vital role in the fast-

growing energy sector in the country. We are already making

confident strides towards making vision of 'gas-based economy' a

reality. The development of the Indian gas market is a key focus

area of your Company. Maintaining the leadership position in the

core businesses, including gas transportation, marketing, and LNG,

remains a key focus area. Your Company has the largest and most

diverse LNG portfolio in India that can offer both stable prices and

reliable supply to consumers. Your Company shall be pushing for

higher gas usage in the industrial segment, transport segment using

CNG & LNG, Trigeneration, cold storage,etc. Further, your Company

is looking for avenues to supply gas in the new segments like LNG

trucking, i.e., LNG for long haul transportation.

Your Company is looking to expand its presence in petrochemicals

and also diversifying into high-margin downstream businesses. The:

8. Innovation, Research and Development

As a bridging fuel, Natural gas is playing a vital role in achieving

sustainable economic growth. Natural gas demand in India is growing at

a steady phase owing to its larger availability at reasonable prices, its

attribute of being a cleaner fuel, and due to enhanced supply and

distribution infrastructure over the years. Considering its social, economic

and environmental impact, the Government of India has already set a

vision to make India a gas-based economy with the aim to increase the

share of gas in the energy mix from the current 6 per cent to 15 per cent in

2030. Innovation driven by Research and development in the energy

sector is an essential pathway that guarantee that these energy resources

are employed in a safe, efficient and cost-effective manner to meet this

ambitious target.

In this direction, your Company is carrying out various collaborative R&D

projects in association with reputed research institutes in key focus areas

of Pipeline Asset Monitoring and Integrity Management; Natural gas

Utilization/Value addition, CO and Waste Valorisation(s) etc. Your

2

Company consistently earmarks adequate R&D budget for carrying out

these collaborative research and developmental activities involving

Technology up-gradation and Modernization works, at various GAIL's

facilities. Some of the Major collaborative research initiatives under taken

during this year are captured below.

Research works under “Pipeline Asset Monitoring and Integrity

Management” are emphasised on enhancing the reliability, safety, and

operational efficiency of natural gas infrastructure. Under this initiative,

your organisation in collaboration with IIT-Kanpur is developing a

Prototype of “Adoptive Intelligent Pipe Health Monitoring Robot”

for Gas pipeline networks. Currently, optimization and validation of three

different sensors and its performance, long range communication

development, integration of speed control system and development of

Machine Learning based defect classification are being carried out with

the prototype. Further, for aerial monitoring of pipeline ROU (Right of

Use) for early identification and prevention of encroachments, your

Company is also developing a “Low Altitude Long Endurance (LALE)

Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) for Surveillance, Reconnaissance

and Asset Monitoring (SRAM)" in association with IIT-Kanpur. The

salient features of this UAS include vertical take-off and landing, auto-

pilot, beyond visual range of flight, electrical propulsion, gas leak

detection, low weight (11kg) etc. Short-range trial run has been

successfully completed with the prototype mounted with HD camera(s)

and presently long-range flight tests along with high-resolution gas

sensing cameras and HD video cameras are in progress.

In corrosion mitigation research works, the Quantification of AC induced

corrosion rate in buried Pipeline is being studied at IIT-Madras through

physical measurement and process model. Moreover, your Company has

also pursued a project with CSIR-CECRI, for Survey and characterization of

Microbial Communities in Gas Pipelines, Heat Exchanger and Fire

Protection System for mitigation of Microbial Induced Corrosion (MIC).

Under the thrust areas of “Natural Gas utilization/ Value addition”,

your Company is carrying out the collaborative research works involving

development of a 'Membrane Reformer' for the production of fuel cell grade

ultra-pure hydrogen through natural gas reforming with IIT-BHU. In addition, a

novel heterogeneous catalyst is being developed with CSIR-IIP, Dehradun for

direct conversion of methane to olefin through oxidative coupling. GAIL is also

pursuing research work in association with IIT - Bombay, to investigate the

combustion and emission phenomenon of dual fuel (CNG & Diesel)

Compression Ignition engine for improving the fuel efficiency and

minimization of NO , Particulate Matter (PM) and CO emissions.

x

Besides, the above initiatives, research efforts are also directed towards

“Waste valorisation” aspects with a focus on zero waste discharge. In

this direction, your Company is pursuing research project on “Waste

Water Purification and Recycle using as Hydrate Process” with IIT-

Madras. It is expected that development of optimized hydrate-based

process which is supposed to be more energy efficient as compared to

RO-based waste water purification.

In addition, under the clean energy initiative, your Company is exploring

various potential alternatives for energy generation. One option is the use of

bio-organic waste feedstock for the production of biogas through anaerobic

digestion. Food waste, for instance, due to its relatively high starch and

protein contents and high biodegradable nature, is a suitable organic source

for bio-methanation. In this direction, your Company, in collaboration with

CSIR-IICT, Hyderabad, is developing a high rate bio - methanation process

for the generation of methane enriched biogas (more than 90%) from food

waste. The main emphasis of the project is on development of an anaerobic

digester system for generation of enriched Methane.

Moreover, your Company has continued the highly successful Central

Suggestion Scheme for identifying and nurturing home-grown innovative

and novel business ideas for its implementation in our operational activities.

Your Company has joined hands with other Oil & Gas PSUs to create a

Centre of Excellence in Oil, Gas and Energy (CoE-OGE) at IIT-Bombay to

carry out Industry relevant R&D works in the area Gas Hydrates, Pipeline

management, Wealth from Agricultural residue, Water and wastewater

management, etc. in the seed and mission mode.

letter dated August 27, 2020 and

October 05, 2020, have communicated that trade discount

revision was not undertaken by OMC pending De Novo study,

which OMC had entrusted to a third party. Post completion of a

such study, OMCs have communicated in the revised trade

discount they wish to make applicable to various geographies

(Metro and other class of cities) as per the recommendation of the

aforesaid study, without sharing the details of the report.

Subsequently de novo study report has been shared on 24

November 2020. As per: letter number L-16019/2/2019-GP-I dated

July 31, 2019 issued by Ministry of Petroleum & Natural gas

(MOPNG) addressed to OMCs and GAIL, a construction process

was to be undertaken with City Gas Distribution (CGD) companies

to finalise trade discount after completing de novo study.

However, no consultation was held with the Company during or

after De Novo Study.

The Company had replied to OMC wide letters dated September

04, 2020 and October 26, 2020, that any unilaterally determined

high trade discount is not acceptable. In January 2021 Ministry of

Petroleum & Natural Gas was appraised by many CGD companies

in a joint virtual meeting. Pending consultation/negotiation, any

additional liability cannot be quantified and continues to be

considered as contingent liability.

b) As per authorisation terms and conditions of PNGRB for Raigad

Geographical Area, the Company is required to meet Minimum

Work Plan (MWP) targets by March 2020 (with reference to

connections and pipeline inch kilo Metres) and the Company had

submitted Performance Bank Guarantee of ` 10,520.00 Lakhs

IV) ONGC Petro additions Limited

a) Company bas set up Petrochemical Complex in Special Economic

Zone (SEZ), situated at Dahej, State of Gujarat. The perspective of

the Company at the inception was to export the products.

However, over the period, due to excess capacities in global

markets, the netbacks in exports were lower to the realizations in

domestic market and hence sale of its products in the domestic

market became a necessity. The existing duty structure is relevant

for reviewing the decision. On the basis of preliminary assessment

made, if the Company exit from SEZ, there can be a significant

improvement in margins based on direct savings on Basic custom

duty; which would benefit the Company consistently for years.

Further, netbacks of Company in domestic markets are better than

exports. Therefore, Board of directors bas accorded exploratory

approval to exit from the SEZ. The amount of liability as preliminary

worked out may vary based on the terms of approval. The gross

liability according to current estimate is ` 23,510 Million.
