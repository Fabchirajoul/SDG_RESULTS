Managing Director: Dear stakeholders,

Since March 2020, humanity has

been braving a challenge that

could not have been fathomed

by most, in their imagination. The

global and Indian economies have

passed through prolonged and

repetitive lockdowns, brought

about by fresh bouts of the

COVID-19 contagion, some of

which has proved pugnacious and

unprecedented in every way.

However, across the world

and much more so in India,

the collective resilience of the

people, coupled with initiatives

by governments, helped counter

these attacks, although the

pandemic was not completely

vanquished. Human ingenuity

presented in the form of rapid

development of advanced

vaccines; their quick rollout to

vulnerable populations, however

the same may yet not be an

immediate cure to the challenges.

The impact of the pandemic

has been devastating for those

affected directly and it has

become incumbent upon us, as a

society, to provide succour to all

those needing the same.

Your Company is a leading power

generator, which contributes

considerably to India’s economic

engine. During the COVID-19

lockdown, your Company

honoured all its commitments

duly, ensuring maximum power

generation availability so that

power supply to consumers

remained uninterrupted. We

were able to achieve this while

following all safety guidelines,

strict social distancing and

minimising our workforce in

Adani Power Limited

Managing Director

I am happy to state that your Company improved

its Corporate Sustainability Assessment score for

2020 to 62 (out of 100) compared to 59 in 2019

in an exercise conducted by DJSI-S&P Global.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

The Company derecognises financial liabilities

when, and only when, the Company’s obligations

are discharged, cancelled or have expired. An

exchange with a lender of debt instruments with

substantially different terms is accounted for as

an extinguishment of the original financial liability

and the recognition of a new financial liability.

Similarly, a substantial modification of the terms

of an existing financial liability is accounted for as

an extinguishment of the original financial liability

and the recognition of a new financial liability.

The difference between the carrying amount

of the financial liability derecognised and the

consideration paid and payable is recognised in

profit or loss.

Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts issued by the

Company are those contracts that require a

payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a

loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to

make a payment when due in accordance with the

terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee

contracts are recognised initially as a liability

at fair value through profit or loss, adjusted for

transaction costs that are directly attributable to

the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the

liability is measured at the higher of the amount

of loss allowance determined as per impairment

requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount

recognised less cumulative amortisation.

g

Derivative financial instruments

The Company enters into a variety of derivative

financial instruments to manage its exposure to

interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including

foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate

swaps, cross currency swaps, principal only swap

and coupon only swap. Further details of derivatives

financial instruments are disclosed in note 43.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at

the date the derivative contracts are entered into

and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value

at the end of each reporting period. The resulting

gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit

or loss immediately.

Embedded derivatives

Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host

contracts that are not financial assets within the

scope of Ind AS 109 - “Financial Instruments” are

treated as separate derivatives when their risks and

characteristics are not closely related to those of

the host contracts and the host contracts are not
