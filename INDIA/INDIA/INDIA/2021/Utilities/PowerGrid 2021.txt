LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS: Dear Shareholders,

My greetings and best wishes for the good health and safety of

you and your loved ones.

Last year and half have been like no other before, truly testing

us on many fronts and I am happy to share that your company’s

performance has been exemplary even in these trying times.

Performance under challenging conditions

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on all our

stakeholders. We lost several colleagues and their family members

owing to COVID-19. My heartfelt condolences to all the bereaved

families. We have introduced several measures and revised the

benefits under existing schemes to provide for the economic and

other rehabilitation support to the dependent family members of

our deceased employees.

In the beginning of the fiscal, as the whole country went into COVID-19 lockdowns, challenges mounted due to restricted movement

and disrupted supply chains. We proactively adopted measures to combat the adverse impacts across our business functions.

We have provided assistance to the contract labor at our worksites as well as to the needy people around our sub-stations/

work places. Vaccination drives were launched across all our establishments to achieve 100% vaccination of our employees and

contract workers.

The indefatigable commitment of the POWERGRID family has helped the organization overcome the challenges in FY 20-21. We

have been able to close the FY 20-21 with exemplary performance which I am delighted to share with you.

Your Company added 7,403 circuit km (ckm) of transmission lines, 27,624 Mega Volt Ampere (MVA) transformation capacity and

13 new substations at the group level. At the end of FY 20-21, the total transmission assets of POWERGRID and its subsidiaries

stood at 1,70,685 ckm of transmission lines, 261 substations and 4,37,523 MVA of transformation capacity. On the operational

front, your Company has maintained 99.78% system availability with number of tripping per line for the year contained at 0.36

which was lowest in five years. This is even more commendable in view of various constraints arising due to the prevalent pandemic

situation.

On financial front, Total Income for the year grew by 6% from ` 38,671 crore to ` 40,824 crore and Profit after Tax (PAT) grew by 9%

from ` 11,059 crore to ` 12,036 crore for the group. Your company achieved Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) of ` 11,284 crore and

capitalized assets worth ` 21,467 crore on consolidated basis. In line with our policy to balance dividend payouts and retained

earnings for new investments, dividend of ` 9.75 per share (adjusted for bonus) was declared for FY 20-21 comprising Interim

dividend of ` 6.75 per share paid and proposed final dividend of ` 3 per share which shall be paid upon your approval. The total

dividend and dividend distribution tax for the year amounts to ` 6,801 crore which would be about 57% of the Profit after Tax as

compared to 54% for the previous year.

Your Company emerged successful in 5 Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) projects under TBCB with an aggregate annual

levelized tariff of ` 515.84 crore which will facilitate the evacuation of renewable energy.

Committed to the welfare of the communities in which it operates, your company spent ` 240.48 crore against a CSR budget of

to be listed for hearing.
