Social distancing has become a norm, and

reduced following multiple lockdowns. In

India and Indonesia, modern trade stores

were directly impacted due to a drop in

footfalls. Simultaneously, volatility was

observed in the assortment mix, with

consumer preferences shifting towards

hygiene and essential products and larger

value packs.

In Africa, consumers also shifted to multi-

category store formats from exclusive

beauty stores. Women reduced their

dependence on salons and shifted to more

do-it-yourself and maintenance products

across hair categories, like braids and

twists, and maintenance hair care products.

While the demand for hygiene products

spiked, it was more for multi-purpose

products. Consumers opted for smaller

The shortage of manpower on ground was

one of the biggest challenges. In India,

from salespeople to delivery personnel, the

feet on street reduced everywhere due to

reverse migration from cities to villages.

From a low of 60 per cent manpower in

April 2020, we recovered close to 90 per

cent in June.

towards e-commerce and multi-category

retail, and beauty-focused retail declined

sharply. Shopper behaviour saw a shift to

fewer shopping trips and consolidated

buying. Women also switched more to

do-it-yourself or at-home options for

personal and hair care products.

While some of these shifts began easing

during the latter part of the year, they will

remain relevant given the continuing impact

of the pandemic.:

did we go completely digital but we also

made it a week-long activity that could

be completed at home and while socially

around sustainable living, through which we

encouraged our team members across the

could be done from anywhere and at any

time.

We offered 56 volunteering tasks and

hosted them on the Aimeo App. Over

1,320 Godrejites volunteered and posted

their updates on the app. On an average,
