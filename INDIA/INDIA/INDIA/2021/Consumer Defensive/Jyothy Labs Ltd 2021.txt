Message from the Chairman Emeritus

15: Message from the

Message from the Chairman Emeritus

I would like to reiterate to our esteemed shareholders

that the success of Jyothy Labs is not only in the

business figures. Our success is in the relationships

we have built over the decades that translate to those

figures. In all our long years of operation, we have

listened closely to everyone with whom our enterprise

connects with including the consumers, raw material

suppliers, vendors, transporters, dealers, community

members, and more. Jyothy Labs is the family of its

employees which take care of their smallest needs.

The Jyothy Labs team led by M. R. Jyothy, has looked

closely at the evolving needs of consumers – disinfection

has been the prime need during the pandemic, which

has continued well into the next fiscal and has created

products that stand out and make homes safer

and healthier, Besides, every effort has been taken

to evolve the system, adapting to new challenges

to reach every product to the needy in this COVID

lockdown environment.

Over the decades, Jyothy Labs have put so much earnest

and well-considered effort into strengthening the body

of the organisation, earned such goodwill for our ethics,

integrity and quality, that have always been above

the challenges. In many cases, those challenges are

transformed into opportunities.

Jyothy Labs thrives by taking everyone along in the

journey to a better life. That has, and always will, remain

the guiding principle of Jyothy Labs.

I thank all our valued stakeholders for being with us

in our journey and look forward to our continued

association as our Company grows with India.

Warm regards,

M. P. Ramachandran

I experience a deep sense of pride as I address you

through this year’s Annual Report. In this unprecedented

year of challenges, Jyothy Labs has proved itself all over

again in so many ways. As the founder of the Company,

I feel extremely content at seeing that the next

generation of leadership has been able to stand with our

consumers and all other stakeholders at all times, and

that they have fully reassured our commitment.

Our journey, which began in 1983 with the aim of

serving the country through unique products, brought

us to an uncharted territory when the lockdown

was imposed, and we have crossed that stretch

of uncertainty with confident steps. My daughter

M. R. Jyothy, who took over as: Managing Director from

April 1, 2020, and

Message from the Chairman

The Indian consumer is value-conscious, and as a

country (that in 2020, overtook the United Kingdom and

France to become the world’s 5th largest economy in

terms of nominal GDP). Indians will continue to demand

better quality products while keeping a keen eye on

price points. Jyothy Labs stands to win because quality

and pricing are our strong points, complementing the

world-class innovation built into our brands.

As an Independent Director since 2012, I have always

admired Jyothy Labs commitment to value creation for

all stakeholders and its minute attention to design detail,

ease of use, and efficacy when coming up with new

products. In a more active role since April 2020,

I have worked closely with the Company’s

next-generation leaders and am delighted to share that

they are carrying forward the legacy of the Company

founder, who wanted to infuse confidence, happiness,

and good health into the daily lives of the people

of this country.

Everything this Company does and every decision it

takes, is based on a blend of the good old human touch

and new-age data analytics and predictive models.

We strike a balance between tradition and innovation,

and the rewards have been consistent.

In the year under review, we have seen the encouraging

revival of rural demand, as farm incomes have stabilised

in many regions due to the Indian Government’s support

and state government schemes. Indeed, during the

lockdown months, growth in rural demand for FMCG

outstripped urban demand as general trade stores

remained open when modern trade outlets had to close

down. We responded by making our products even

more accessible for the rural and semi-urban consumer

through smaller, extremely affordable pack sizes.

We are well-positioned to be a core part of the India

growth story, whose chapters will continue to be written,

despite the setbacks of the second wave of COVID-19.

Allow me to thank our valued shareholders and extend

our heartfelt gratitude to our Chairman Emeritus,

Shri M. P. Ramachandran Sir, for this outstanding

organisation that he has built and nurtured.

Stay safe. Stay strong. Let us stay together.

Warm regards,

R. Lakshminarayanan

The fiscal year in which I took over as the Chairman of

Jyothy Labs can be described as one of the greatest

learning experiences of my career, as it has been for

the whole world. As I look back upon the year, and try

to grasp the implications of the second wave of the

pandemic, it makes me very proud of what we have

achieved together, even as I pray for the lives lost and

their loved ones.

Our performance has been the result of the careful

planning and seamless execution born out of decades

of committed team work, and success.

The relevance of the fast-moving consumer goods

(FMCG) sector will increase in people’s lives, especially

as the Indian economy continues to grow. We believe

in the Indian Government’s goal of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’

and becoming a USD 5 trillion economy within this

decade. As a highly trusted and completely homegrown

household goods manufacturer, we are always ‘vocal for

local’, and will continue to use our “ear-to-the-ground”

insights to lead the market in innovation, technology,

and above all, in offering products designed with utmost

empathy for the Indian consumer.

One of the hallmarks of Jyothy Labs is that we think

not only about the Company’s profits, but also the

consumer’s monetary values. With our focus on

operational excellence and cost optimisation, we try and

deliver superior value to our consumers and help every

rupee they have stretched as far as possible.: Dear Shareholders,

Managing Director

Jyothy Labs had started out with the mission of

helping the country’s people fulfil their aspirations.

Indians wanted to take pride in their appearance, to live

a healthier life, to have a sparkling home; we understood

this quest and brought them best-in-class solutions at

prices sensitive to their needs. Our reputation, the trust

that we have earned from consumers drove our business

growth in a difficult year with the pandemic affecting the

country adversely.

During the year, we not only retained our market share

in every category and grew the overall business, but we

also launched timely new products that enhanced the

value proposition of our portfolio and helped us address

the heightened consumer concerns about hygiene.

The overnight imposition of the lockdown across the

country required us to demonstrate a greater degree

of organisational agility to ensure our products reach

retail stores. We were able to navigate uncertainties,

forge new partnerships with stakeholders, and serve

our consumers everywhere, from big city centres to

the remote rural areas.

We have gathered insights and acquired knowledge

during this unprecedented year; these are rich

resources that can greatly help us to plan the next

phase of growth.: Dear Shareholders,

This year under review has validated the decades of

innovation that Jyothy Labs has put into every detail of each

of its products; the Company’s philosophy that its employees

are family members; the care with which stakeholder

relationships have been built and nurtured; the efforts put

into digitalisation, especially in sales and supply chain – all

of that came together, the pieces fit in perfectly to give us

a year where every quarter rewarded our dedication to the

Indian consumers.

that as per the circular issued by NSDL and CDSL,

the Company is obliged to print on the dividend

Pursuant to the provisions of the Investor Education

and Protection Fund Authority (Accounting, Audit,

Transfer and Refund) Rules, 2016 (IEPF Rules), the

Company has uploaded the details of unpaid and

financial years 2012-13 to 2018-19 lying with the

Company as on March 31, 2020 on the website

of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in e-Form

IEFP-2 and also on the website of the Company

(www.jyothylabs.com).

In terms of Section 124 of the Act, Final dividend

declared for the financial year 2013-14 will be due

for transfer to the Investor Education and Protection

Fund (IEPF) (established by the Central Government)

in September, 2021, as the same would remain

unpaid for a period of seven years from the due date

of payment. Members are requested to en-cash their

Dividend Warrants promptly. It may be noted that

once the unclaimed dividend is transferred to the

IEPF as above, no claim shall lie with the Company in

respect of such amount.

17. Attention of Members is invited to the provisions of

Section 124(6) of the Act read with IEPF Rules, as

the Company to transfer the equity shares in respect

of which the dividend has remained unpaid or

unclaimed for a continuous period of seven years,

by the Investor Education and Protection Fund

Authority (‘IEPF Authority’). The said shares, once

transferred to the said Demat account of the IEPF

Authority can be claimed only after following due

procedure prescribed under the said IEPF Rules.

Therefore, members are requested to claim their

unpaid dividend pertaining to the financial year

2013-14 to 2019-20 as soon as possible, so that

shares in respect of which the dividend is pending

are not transferred to the Demat Account of IEPF

authority at appropriate date.
