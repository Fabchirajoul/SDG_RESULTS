Dear Shareholders,

Let me begin by wishing all of you good health and

safety in these challenging times The second wave of

COVID has affected us all in some way or the other.

My heart goes out to the families and friends of all

those who have lost their loved ones or are struggling

with health issues due to this pandemic. I would also

like to place on record my appreciation of the entire

Dabur family who have risen to meet the challenges

which this pandemic threw up over the year. On

behalf of the Board of Directors of Dabur India Ltd, I

thank them for taking their dedication to new heights

this past year as they worked towards meeting

and overcoming the challenges and ensured

uninterrupted supply of our products to millions

of consumers when they needed them the most.

I would also like to take this opportunity to express

my immense gratitude to all our frontline heroes

- police personnel, doctors, health workers and

sanitation workers - for their efforts in keeping

all of us safe during these uncertain times.

Despite facing multiple headwinds Dabur

India Ltd delivered a robust performance in

2020-21 with 10% growth in Consolidated

Revenue from Operations, touching `9,562

letter to you last year, I had laid out our

longstanding commitment to ESG initiatives. Despite

the challenges brought about by the COVID pandemic

and the resultant nationwide lockdown, I am happy

to report that we have moved forward on these

commitments. We implemented a series of measures

both within and outside our gates to reduce the impact

of our business on the environment and also support

sustainable development of communities. We moved

ahead with our Plastic Waste Management initiative,

collecting and processing/recycling over 11,413 MT of

post-consumer plastic waste during the year. Special

initiatives were also rolled out to clean our oceans and

our cities, details of which have been shared in the

Natural Capitals section of this report.

COVID presented significant challenges for our people and our business.

To succeed in this uncertain and highly dynamic environment, we needed to

be agile and seize opportunities in a very short timeframe. We quickly adapted

our business approach, mobilised our teams to put in a strong effort despite

lockdown restrictions, besides leveraging technology and innovation to address

the changing environment and the emerging needs of our consumers.
