letter, the world is still going through an unprecedented health crisis but showing signs of a sustainable recovery from

the global pandemic. The environment of volatility and uncertainty continues to impact our day-to-day lives and the way we conduct

business. Our top priority during these times was the safety of our workforce and to achieve that we have implemented various safety

guidelines and protocols to ensure their well-being.

The fiscal year 2020-21 started on a subdued note with the outbreak of Covid-19 around the world and its subsequent impact on the

global economy. Most nations had implemented strict lockdown measures and as a result, world economic output contracted by 3.3 %

in 2020 as compared to growth of 2.8% in the previous year. However, governments and central banks of the major economies worked

in tandem to ensure both stability and sustainability of their economies by introducing accommodating fiscal and monetary policies.

The central banks started lowering interest rates to ease monetary policies ensuring liquidity in the markets. These policy measures had

a positive impact on global economies, and along with the subsequent relaxation in lockdown restrictions, resulted in consumer demand

and spending continuing to increase steadily.

India too was impacted by this health crisis and the first nationwide lockdown was announced in March 2020 in an attempt to curb

its further outbreak. Business activities were completely halted and this once in a century like an event resulted in a sharp decline in

demand for all types of goods and services, except for essential goods and services. In such economic conditions, overall GDP unsur-

prisingly contracted by 8.0 % in 2020 compared to growth of 4.0% in 2019. The swift actions on the part of the Government of India

and the RBI ensured an appropriate economic response.

The tobacco industry too faced pressure as farmers were left with high stockpiles of tobacco leaf due to sudden cancellation of auctions

and the unavailability of buyers. In addition, the shift in consumer demand towards essential products and the operating restrictions of

pandemic together contributed to weaker demand for tobacco products. The recovery in consumer demand post easing of lockdowns

provided the industry and farmers an opportunity to resume their business operations. We are cautiously optimistic of a gradual

recovery in tobacco related products demand in the near term.

In these market conditions, I am satisfied with the Company’s stable performance during the year. The financial performance was

most impacted in first half of the year, as factories were temporarily closed and demand also declined with the restriction on public

movement. With the gradual reopening of the economy in the second half of the year, the Company was able to recover its sales and

post resilient results in the subsequent quarters. Domestic cigarette volume declined by 19.8% during the year. While our international

business remained flat as compared to last year, although exports of unmanufactured tobacco and cut tobacco picked up from Q2

onwards. Our 24Seven convenience stores declined 13.5% in gross sales due to closure of stores and lower footfall in the first half of the

year, contributing 9.6% to total net sales. As a part of our core strategy, we remained focused and committed to enhancing operational

efficiency at the store level to deliver strong growth and an increasing financial contribution to the Company. The total number of stores

was 93 at the end of March 2021. In summary, 24Seven closed the year on a stronger note and on a promising growth trajectory.

As an organization, we continue to remain fully committed in complying with the regulatory requirements, ensuring quality products,

best processes and practices, and undertaking various CSR initiatives to ensure the welfare of tobacco farmers and their communities.

We are a people-oriented Company and therefore, I am proud of the recognition that Godfrey Phillips has been accorded as one of

“India’s Best Companies to Work For”, third year in a row. In conclusion, I would like to thank all our employees for their dedication and

commitment in maintaining business continuity during the most challenging of times, the senior management for their strategic vision

and unwavering leadership during a challenging year, and to all our customers, channel partners, the tobacco farming community,

distributors and shareholders for their continuous support and confidence in our company.

With best wishes and warm regards,

R. A. Shah

Dear Shareholders,

The financial year 2020-21 was one of the most challenging years with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in the

widespread shutdown of economic and community activities around the world and the subsequent waves of the coronavirus continue to

have a devastating impact on the society. However, on a positive note, the ongoing vaccination drive and stricter adherence to Covid-19

protocols have enabled a steady economic recovery in several countries including India.

For the Company through the year, the top priority was to ensure the wellbeing of our employees. It is our belief that a high performing

organisation is defined by empathetic management of people and talent. It is this unwavering commitment to the ‘People First’

philosophy and this value at the core of all our business strategy, which has helped Company to overcome the two waves of pandemic.

The leadership remained committed to this employee centric vision even during pandemic; the validation of this humanistic way of

managing business has come with the recognition of your Company as ‘India’s Best Companies to Work For’, for third consecutive year.

This fundamental value has also inspired business resilience. Despite the challenging economic environment your Company delivered

Gross Sales of Rs. 6,408 Crore in the fiscal year 2020-21, a decline of 10.3%. Of this the International Business Gross Sales were Rs

597 Crore, which remained flat as compared to last year. Several measures taken by the Company to optimize the cost with a view to

offset the effect of decline in top-line, resulted in a Net Profit of Rs. 357 Crore, a decline of 8.0% over the last year. Overall, the business

was clearly impacted by Covid-19 induced lockdowns and restrictions during the year, but we continue to remain fully committed to

creating long term value for our shareholders. The Board of Directors was pleased to recommend the dividend of Rs. 24 per share for

the financial year which is same as paid for the last financial year.

The tobacco industry was one of the most impacted industries given the complete and partial lockdown of factories, disruptions in

supply chains, restrictions on public movement and the priority for essential products during the year. In line with the cigarette industry,

Godfrey Phillips registered a decline of 19.8% in domestic cigarette volumes. However, the Company has been able to deliver year on

year growth in its major operating segment of Regular Sized Filter Tipped (RSFT) cigarettes.

Our chewing and confectionary business Gross Sales also declined to Rs. 121 Crore largely due to supply chain disruptions caused by

the restrictions put in place by State authorities. The strategy of Godfrey Phillips in this business area remains clear and consistent with

a focus on the premium pan masala segment. In line with this, the Company also launched an innovative pan masala during the year

marketed as “Pan Vilas Flavour Blast”. We remain committed to enhance the profitability of this business segment.

Godfrey Phillips operates the 24Seven convenience store chain with 93 stores in northern part of India. During the year, Gross Sales

declined by 13.5% to Rs. 355 Crore due to lower footfall, reduced operating days and hours amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. I am

pleased that the stores serviced the consumers during the lockdown by providing all types of essential products and we ensured

minimum personal contact at the point of sale to enhance consumer and employee confidence. Our store expansion plans are currently

on hold and we continue to implement a cost rationalization program to further improve store level profitability in near term.

The Company has swiftly adapted to the new operating environment with limited disruptions and the business has continued its long-

term growth trajectory, while supporting the local communities in which we operate. Our dedicated CSR team have provided aid

with dry ration and distribution of safety kits in partnership with local bodies, in addition to the long-term comprehensive community

development programs we have undertaken for marginalised tobacco farmers over the years.

Godfrey Phillips will continue to strengthen its core business of tobacco by launching products in accordance with changing consumer

preferences and expanding its product portfolio. The Company further aims to penetrate deeper into key geographies and expanding its

distribution footprint through increased digitalization. The Company’s 24Seven retail business will continue to focus on meeting customer

needs while delivering greater convenience, value and quality.

Finally, I am very proud of how the Godfrey Phillips leadership team has stayed focused on the business and together delivered a

relatively stable financial and operational performance this year. I would like to again acknowledge the efforts of each and every one of

our team members for their adaptability, resilience and contribution during an exceptionally difficult year. Lastly, I would like to thank all

our consumers, business partners, distributors and shareholders for their continued support. With our clear strategic direction, Godfrey

Phillips is well positioned to drive profitable growth in the coming years.

Warm regards,

Bina Modi
