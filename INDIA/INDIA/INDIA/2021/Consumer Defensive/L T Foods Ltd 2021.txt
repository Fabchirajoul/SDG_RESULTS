Annual Report 2020-21:

Managing Director

& CEO

Being in essential food

category, each member

of LT Foods family

stepped up to ensure the

availability of our food

products to a growing

consumer base without

any disruptions.”

LT Foods once again

exhibited a good year-on-

year performance with a

3 Year CAGR Revenue

growth of 9%, and PAT

growth of 45%.”: Dear Stakeholders,

As we report our Company’s

performance for the fiscal under review,

we hope you and your loved ones are

safe. The year 2020 suffered an intense

economic slowdown, with global

GDP contracting by 3.3%, mostly

on account of the severe disruptions

caused by Covid-19. The loss of lives

overshadowed the negative impact

on global trade, lockdowns and

subsequent slowdown in businesses.

Amidst a dismal economic scenario, we

achieved a solid all-round performance

through operational excellence and

adoption of right strategies. We are

proud of our team’s ability to respond

to challenges and their agility and

resilience is evident in our continued

success. Being in essential food

category, each member of the LT

Foods family stepped up to ensure the

availability of our food products to a

growing customer base without any

disruptions.

As a Global Consumer Food Company

which deals in Basmati and Other

Specialty Rice, Organic Food and

Ingredient business and Health and

Convenience segment, we strive to

deliver the finest quality food to our

consumers around the world. We

realise the value of food for every family

and understand the crucial role it plays

in bringing families together. Often, the

simple joys of life are shared through

food and as a consumer-centric

Company we are constantly broadening

our offerings by adding healthy and

convenient choices in our portfolio for

our consumers.

Overcoming Covid-19

Proactive investments in our state-of-

the-art facilities for automation and

technology advancement in the last

few years enabled us to weather the

challenges posed by Covid-19. All

our plants remained operational since

the beginning of the lockdown and

automated operations ensured higher

efficiency and productivity. We strictly

adhered to social distancing protocols

at all our manufacturing facilities and at

distribution centres around

the globe.

Growing Globally

The India market is led by Daawat

and other regional brands which have

a strong brand recall amongst the

consumers. Despite the pandemic,

our brands continued to hold their fort

as a market leader in the category.

Amongst the business segments,

consumer business performed

quite well and small packs business

increased by 10% on year. While the

Company’s investments in building

a strong and resilient distribution

channel helped steer past the covid19

related obstacles, e-commerce

channel recorded a strong growth in

the distribution mix for the Company.

While e-commerce enabled us to

communicate more about the product

to the customers, digital platforms

overall helped us establish a deeper

engagement with the consumers. Our

sales and marketing campaigns struck

the right chords with themes around

festivals, experiential cooking and

many more initiatives to deepen the

engagement with consumers. In the

Ready to Eat segment, we launched

Daawat Cuppa rice and it was widely

accepted by the consumers. We are

planning to expand the product mix in

ready to eat segment which is gaining

prominence in households due to the

convenience it offers in consuming

tasty and healthy food. We also

witnessed huge traction in the organic

food health concerns continue to shape

consumers’ decision making. Daawat

Sehat, a fortified rice product, has also

gained significant positive response

from the consumers and we believe,

it will continue to complement the

Nation’s fight against malnutrition.

In the global arena, we registered

a 21% growth during the year. Our

Global Supply Chain Hubs and our

efforts to boost brand preference

through dedicated consumer marketing

initiatives helped to increase the

availability of products. Besides, a

strong distribution network in existing

and new geographies allowed us to

deepen our reach globally.

The Royal Ready-to-Heat (RTH) range,

introduced in the United States last

year, performed well and demand

for convenience food also saw good

growth, we leveraged our strong

brand equity and drove omni channel

campaigns to market the Royal brand

in North American markets.

We strengthened our foray in European

markets with specific marketing

campaigns that promoted our brands in

the region. We also widened our brand

visibility and outreach by making our

products available at leading stores.

Our latest product, Daawat ‘boil in bag’

variant was highly appreciated by our

consumers as the innovative product

aligned to their convenience, health and

nutrition expectations.

We reworked our strategy in the Middle

East, channelising our products and

supply towards the retail and branded

business, due to the slowdown

experienced by the HoReCa segment.

Hence, we aligned our product

strategy along with evolving consumer

Vision is to be a leading Indian origin

Global Consumer Food Company that

creates sustainable business growth,

has a positive impact on society and

creates value for its internal as well as

external stakeholders.”
