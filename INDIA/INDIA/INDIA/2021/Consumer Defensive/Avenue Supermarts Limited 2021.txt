Managing Director, is responsible for

proactively managing risks with appropriate mitigation measures

and ensuring their implementation thereof.

Below are some of the key risks and concerns in our business:

The outbreak of COVID-19 could materially and adversely

affect our business, financial condition, and results of

operations

If we are unable to continue to offer daily low prices pursuant

to our EDLC/EDLP pricing strategy, we risk losing our distinct

advantage and a substantial portion of our customers, which

will adversely affect our business, financial condition, and

results of operations

Availability of commercially viable real estate properties at

suitable locations for our new stores, timely execution of sale

deeds/leave and license registrations and getting regulatory

approvals for these properties

Our ability to attract, hire, train and retain skilled employees

Our inability to maintain an optimal level of inventory in our

stores may impact our operations adversely

Our continued understanding and prediction of consumers’

changing needs and preferences and timely customising of

our offerings

Effective management of our store expansion and operations

in newer locations/cities/states

Impact of COVID-19

During the last quarter of FY 2019-20, COVID-19 spread globally

and in India, and impacted business operations of the Company.

Some normalcy was restored as infections reduced and therefore

lockdown restrictions were lifted in the country during the second

half of the year.

However, towards the end of FY 2020-21, a much stronger

second wave of the pandemic with significantly higher infections

has been witnessed across the country. The enforcements from

authorities at local levels this time are much stricter. Enforcements
