*Ceased to be a Director w.e.f closure of business hours on 2nd August 2021:

Dear shareholders,

The year 2020-21 was the worst of

times and the best of years.

The first quarter was unprecedented

for its uncertainty and hopelessness.

It was the kind of quarter that tested

the best of us.

We are pleased to communicate that

in these trying times, the restless

Emami spirit validated itself.

Even as some business transformation

initiatives had commenced well

before the outbreak of the pandemic,

something remarkable manifested

at Emami during that critical first

quarter of 2020-21.

While Emami’s pan-India offices

remained unattended, the Company

now had a over thousand Emami

‘offices’ at work across the country;

every single Emami employee,

plugged into her/his laptop from

home, represented a virtual Emami

office.

Each Emami-ite was now driven

by the need to do better when the

general consensus was ‘Status quo

will be good enough.’

The result of this passionate ferment

was that Emami didn’t just hold on;

it accelerated.

Emami didn’t just benchmark with

the best of the past; it raised the bar.

If there is a big message that needs

to be communicated, it would just be

three sentences.

The first quarter of the last financial

year represented an unprecedented

challenge.

A number of initiatives of the recent

past resulted in success, enabling

Emami to strengthen its agility.

The Company is positioned to forge

ahead with vigour.

Editor’s note:

Dear shareholders,

Founders’ statement

The greater the

challenge, the more

spirited is our response

One of the most heartening

years in the four decades of

Emami’s existence

Reported record revenues

and profits

Might appear to have been easy

but the reverse is true

Leap of faith and courage

We fired on all cylinders; every

segment of the Company

contributed to our profits

We trusted our conviction against

conventional challenges
