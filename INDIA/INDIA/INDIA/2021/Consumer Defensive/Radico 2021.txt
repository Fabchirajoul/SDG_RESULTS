SHAREHOLDERS

Despite the uncertainties ahead, I continue to remain

bullish about the economy and our business model...

We have emerged stronger post the ﬁrst two waves

and this resilience will help us in the future as well.

I am conﬁdent of our people and our capability to

deliver the best premium products to our customers.

We are ready to take on any challenges.:

Dear Shareholders,

These

are

extremely

difcult,

uncertain times. In such times, I pray

for the safety of all our shareholder

members and their families. After

two waves of COVID-19, we are

living in an extremely challenging

environment. I hope that you and

your family members are taking all

necessary precautions, adhering

to the Government’s guidelines

and have taken the vaccination

as these are the only ways we

can protect ourselves against the

Coronavirus.

We

faced

a

tough

Financial

Year 2020-21, the year of the

‘new

normal’

which

brought

in

disruption

for

individuals,

communities, organizations and

countries. During a large part of

the year, we have been impacted

by the uncertainties induced by the

lockdowns, forcing each one of us

to ﬁnd new ways of working. This

severely impacted the economy

in the ﬁrst quarter of the ﬁscal

year, posing challenges to our

industry as well. As you are aware,

we too felt the impact in our ﬁrst

quarter as we saw our volumes go

down by 43.5% and Net Revenue

from Operations fall by 34.4%, as

compared to the previous year.

I believe that such challenges

also bring in its wake unseen

opportunities. We have been on a

Premiumisation journey to shore up

our proﬁtability margins and these

abnormal times saw us navigating

through this tough situation and

also preparing to be future ready.

We focussed on investing behind

our brands even as we optimized

cost structure to sustain our

margins. It is with satisfaction that

I note that these not only helped

strengthen our ﬁnancial position

but also enhanced our market

share. While we managed to close

FY2021 at the same level as the

previous ﬁscal’s Net Revenues

from Operations at `2,418 crore,

we expanded our EBITDA margins

by nearly 170 basis point to close

the year with `408 crore, up 11%,

as compared to the previous year.

During the whole year, employee

health, safety and wellness was

our top priority. In the pandemic,

where we saw pay cuts and job

loss across industries, it is with

pride to mention that not a

single member of our employee

community was asked to leave nor

did we undertake any salaries cuts.

Despite the uncertainties ahead, I

continue to remain bullish about

the economy and our business

model

as

we

experienced

improving

trends

during

the

second half of the year and have

seen the economy and industry

normalise.

We

have

emerged

stronger post the ﬁrst two waves

and this resilience will help us in

the future as well. I am conﬁdent

of our people and our capability to

deliver the best premium products

to our customers. We are ready to

take on any challenges.

I take this opportunity to thank

each one of you for continuing to

believe in our vision and execution

as we step into the next phase

of our strategic growth journey. I

would also like to acknowledge

the contribution of our partners

and customers for reposing faith

in Radico Khaitan and actively

working for our combined success.

Warm regards,

Lalit Khaitan

Chairman &: Managing

MANAGING DIRECTOR

How would you describe FY2021

and what were the actions that

you took to emerge stronger?

We will all remember FY2021 as

the year of pandemic, lockdowns,

disruption and chaos. It hit the

economy, it impacted our industry

and it had repercussion on the

company and our employees. We

were quick to realize the gravity

of the situation and immediately

actioned multiple measures to

navigate through the challenging

times. Our ﬁrst and foremost

priority remained, and remains,

our employees and all eforts were

made to ensure their safety.

In such tough times, conserving

cash and generating cash are the

imperatives to succeed and that

is what we focussed on during

the ﬁscal. We reviewed each and

every cost line items, putting in

place very strong credit controls.

Yet we continued to invest in our

A&SP spends which enabled us to

continue the growth momentum.

All these have helped us to

not only come out through the

pandemic but emerge stronger

with

increased

market

share.

Importantly, we have been on a

journey of debt reduction since

April 2016 and it is noteworthy

that since 2016, we have reduced

our debt by ` 750 crores which is

a testimony to our business model

and the cash ﬂow generation.

How do you see the success of

your Premiumisation and brand

journey?

Since 2006, we took a decision that

we need to have a strong premium

brand portfolio which will help us

not only to maintain high margins

but make us less susceptible to

the market vagaries and help drive

sustainable growth. Understanding

the customers need, and driven by

our R&D team, we have launched

multiple premium brands which

have

become

market

leaders.

Product innovation catering to

the consumer aspirations and

identifying the gaps in the market

has been the key to our success.

Our brands like Magic Moments

Vodka, Morpheus Brandy, 8PM

family of whiskies, Contessa Rum,

etc. are market leaders in their own

rights. We are possibly the rare

Indian company in the industry

which also has products (Rampur

Indian Single Malt Whisky and

Jaisalmer Indian Craft Gin) in

the super-luxury space, a space

occupied by international alcohol

companies. It is with pride that I

say, that our products are available

across

the

world

and

being

admired and recommended by

top experts. Our focus on product

quality and consumer satisfaction

has won various awards and

accolades internationally.:
