(Inside Back Cover):

Dear Shareholders,

The year under review commenced with the

unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic that

gripped the world, leading to disruption

and changing the way we live and work.

In India, just when we thought the worst

was over, the deadly second wave of the

pandemic struck, claiming innumerable

lives, causing unimaginable agony and grief.

On behalf of the USL Board, we offer our

deepest condolences to those who have lost

their loved ones. While the vaccine rollout

has provided optimism in controlling the

surge of infections, accelerating the pace

of vaccination will be crucial, especially as

lockdowns are lifted across the country.

The COVID-19 outbreak impacted

economies across the world. Like many other

countries, India too endured an erosion

of growth in FY21. The Gross Domestic

Product (GDP) contracted by 7.3% during

the year as consumer spending, private

investments and exports plummeted

sharply. Notwithstanding the Government’s

economic stimulus measures to support

demand recovery, the lockdown-like curbs

in wake of the second wave of the pandemic

have cast a dark shadow over India’s ongoing

economic revival.

Our Company’s performance has been

remarkably resilient, thanks to the solidarity

and commitment of our people. While

revenues and operating margins were

significantly impacted in the first quarter of

FY21 during which the alcoholic beverages

sector faced a complete shutdown for

six weeks, we made a steady sequential

recovery to deliver commendable

full-year results. Our focus on strengthening

brands, fostering close connections with

business partners, and maintaining an agile

response to the fluid situation enabled us to

bounce back faster.

During this health crisis, our Company has

stood up as a responsible corporate citizen.

Early in 2020, when the country was staring

at a huge shortage of sanitisers, we were

amongst the first companies to publicly

commit a donation of 300,000 litres of

bulk hand sanitisers and 150,000 masks

to frontline workers across public health

departments, police, and the army. The

restaurant industry, the third-largest in the

services sector in India has been severely

impacted by the pandemic. In 2020, we

committed ₹ 75 crore to ‘Raising the Bar’,

an initiative that will run over two years to

support bars, pubs, and restaurants serving

alcohol. This programme provides strong

on-ground support to qualifying outlets,

with physical equipment and ‘hygiene kits’,

and helps to establish partnerships with

online reservations and cashless systems.

And very recently, Diageo pledged ₹ 45 crore

to augment public healthcare infrastructure

in One District in each State and Union

Territory of India by setting up Pressure

Swing Adsorption (PSA) Oxygen Plants, fully-

equipped prefabricated 16-bed mini-hospital

units, and donating medical equipment.

With mixed feelings, we bid adieu to

our: Managing Director & CEO, Anand

Kripalu, who has stepped down effective

June 30, 2021, after leading this organisation

for seven years. Anand was responsible

for spearheading USL’s integration with

Diageo India and transforming USL into

a future-ready enterprise. He played an

outstanding role in aligning the culture

and values of the organisation with that of

Diageo by being a role model for probity and

ethical conduct and cascading it through

the entire Company as a non-negotiable

aspect of conducting business. His focus on

strengthening and accelerating core brands

and driving productivity across every aspect

of the business has created a solid runway

for the future. Anand tirelessly championed

responsible drinking and shaped USL’s

trusted relationships through community

endeavours and partnerships. I extend

the Board’s sincere appreciation for his

invaluable contribution and wish him luck in

his future endeavours.

We welcomed our next phase of leadership

with Hina Nagarajan joining the Company on

April 1, 2021 as CEO-Designate. Post Anand’s

departure, she took over as Managing

Director and CEO of USL. Hina has delivered

outstanding outcomes as the Managing

Director of Diageo’s Africa Regional

Markets (ARM). She is an accomplished

senior leader with a proven track record in

business transformation and development

in complex emerging markets across several

consumer sectors (food & beverage, health

& hygiene, nutrition, beauty, home décor),

with more than 30 years of experience. The

Board is confident that USL will continue

to go from strength to strength under her

able leadership.

Hina’s joining is also a strong commitment

to our inclusion and diversity agenda and

I am delighted to share that women now

constitute 50% of the USL executive team.

Despite the unprecedented economic

disruption, USL has emerged stronger

and is well-positioned to harness the

long-term growth opportunity in India.

Rapid urbanisation, favourable

demographics, rising disposable income,

growing acceptance of drinking, changing

social norms, and increasing inclination

towards premium products will drive market

growth. Backed by the global experience of

our parent company and our local strengths,

we are confident of unlocking these

unfolding opportunities.

I would like to thank you, our shareholders,

for your trust and support in these

challenging times. USL will continue to

work together with all stakeholders in

pursuit of our goal to be one of the best

performing and trusted consumer products

companies in India.

Stay safe. Stay well.

Managing Director CEO’s Message: Dear Shareholders,

I write to you during unprecedented times. The second wave of

the COVID-19 pandemic in India has been even more devastating.

Our frontline medical staff as well as countless essential and

emergency workers stood strong and ensured that so many of us

could stay safe and secure.

They say that every storm leaves you stronger. Our business too

has emerged stronger by weathering this rough storm, while

providing valuable lessons on sailing through rough seas. During

this difficult phase, it was only the single-minded commitment

of everyone at United Spirits that enabled us to deliver a solid

performance. I am incredibly proud of our team’s efforts.

The pandemic has probably inflicted the largest economic shock

the world has experienced in decades. In India, private final

consumption expenditure, a key metric to assess household

spending in the country, fell by 54.3% in the first quarter of

FY21, compared to a 56.4% growth in the same period in the

previous fiscal. While the third and fourth quarter data gave rise to

optimism about an economic revival in FY22, the second wave of

COVID-19 is likely to affect this rebound.

Sequential recovery during the year

For the alcoholic beverages sector, the first quarter was very

challenging, as operations were shut for several weeks. In the

first half of the financial year, the on-premise channel remained

closed and subsequently re-opened at a much lower capacity

due to social distancing measures. Some territories in India saw a

decline in demand due to high COVID-led taxes. All of these had a

cascading effect by causing a 13.2% drop in our reported net sales

in FY21 and a 7.2% decline in Prestige & Above (P&A) net sales.

Nonetheless, I am pleased to report that we delivered sequential

improvement in performance quarter-on-quarter, demonstrating

the resilience and agility of our business. Our strategy of

premiumisation has served us well, as reflected in the increase of

our Scotch sales.

Underpinning our performance is our strong financial framework.

We continue to deliver consistently solid cash flows with net cash

from operating activities at ₹ 1,728 crore. The internal accruals

have been utilised towards debt reduction. At the end of FY21,

our debt stood at ₹ 556 crore, a reduction of ₹ 1,517 crore over the

previous fiscal year, thus further strengthening our balance sheet.

We enter the new financial year with renewed optimism.

Strengthening our brands

With the uncertain economic environment exacerbated by the

pandemic and the on-going restrictions, we decided to focus only

on two areas that fell within our ‘circle of control’ – protecting

our business and doing what was right for our people, customers,

suppliers and communities.

Innovation is at the heart of our culture, which enhances

consumer appeal and experience. Our two flagship brands - Royal

Challenge and McDowell’s No. 1 - were renovated and rolled

out nationally during the year. These renovations were strongly

supported by our Jalwa lighthouse stores on-ground, resulting in

strong sales owing to their high impact and visibility.

Even in this unprecedented year, our impact and scale of

execution has been par excellence and we have seen this

consistently across the country. Driving our market-winning

performance was the agility and flexibility demonstrated by our

employees. Our supply chain readiness also played a big role

in our performance. Implementation of industry-leading safety

protocols, complemented by production ramp-up helped deliver

market share growth.

Our people make us who we

are; caring for our employees

by supporting and connecting

with them as they worked

through a difficult year has

been integral to our approach

to navigate the crisis.

Critical estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of

accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal

the actual result. This note provides an overview of the areas

that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity,

and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted

due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different

than those originally assessed. Detailed information about

each of these estimates and judgements is included in

relevant notes together with information about the basis

of calculation for each affected line item in the financial

statements.

The areas involving critical estimates and judgements are:

• Estimation of provisions recognised and contingent

liabilities disclosed in respect of tax matters– Notes 8, 17

and 49

• Impairment of trade receivables – Note 31

• Impairment of loans to subsidiaries – Notes 5, 31 and 36

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated.

They are based on historical experience and other factors,

including expectations of future events that may have a

financial impact on the Company and that are believed to be

reasonable under the circumstances.:

Note:

The Group holds perpetual franchise right for the Bangalore

team of IPL. The limited over version of the game which was first

introduced in 1970s is continuing even now after 50 years and

an even shorter version (20 overs) introduced in 2000s is more

popular than the 50 overs format. Although the Management

regards the useful life as indefinite, as a measure of prudence a

useful life of 50 years/ IPL seasons is considered as appropriate

and the rights are amortized over 50 years/IPL seasons having

regard to the following factors:

i. The game of cricket has been in existence for over 100

years and there is no indication of interest in the game and

the commercial prospects waning;

ii. The shorter version of the game is increasingly popular;

iii. The commercial exploitation of the shorter version is on an

increasing scale and is expected to reach the scale which

other games like soccer have reached;

iv. IPL and its teams have acquired brand status and teams

are not identified with countries or geographies but with

brand names; and

v. The franchisees have the intent and ability to provide the

necessary financial and other resources required to obtain

the expected future economic benefits from this for at

least 50 years.

The carrying value of the capitalized rights would be assessed

for impairment at every balance sheet date.

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are

based on historical experience and other factors, including

expectations of future events that may have a financial impact

on the Group and that are believed to be reasonable under the

circumstances.:

existing loans/deposits/advances/accrued interest that were due to the Company and its subsidiaries from UBHL and its subsidiaries

aggregating to ` 13,374 million and that were consolidated into, and recorded as, an unsecured loan through an agreement entered

into between the Company and UBHL on July 3, 2013 (‘Loan Agreement’). The Company has already made provision in prior financial

years for the entire principal amount due, of ` 13,374 million, and for the accrued interest of ` 846 million up to March 31, 2014. The

Company has not recognised interest income on said loan after March 31, 2014 which cumulatively amounts to ` 8,719 million up

to March 31, 2021. The Company has offset payable to UBHL under the trademark agreement amounting to ` 303 million for the

year ended March 31, 2021, and consequently, the corresponding provision for loan has been reversed to ‘Loss allowance on trade

receivables and other financial assets (net)’. The cumulative offset up to March 31, 2021 amounted to ` 1,987 million.

Since UBHL had defaulted on its obligations under the Loan Agreement, the Company sought redressal of disputes and claims through

arbitration under the terms of the Loan Agreement. On April 8, 2018, the arbitral tribunal passed a final award against the Company. The

reasons for this adverse award were disputed by the Company, and the Company had obtained leave from the High Court of Karnataka

to file a challenge against this arbitral award. The Company has on July 6, 2018 filed the petition challenging the said award before the

Jurisdictional Court in Bangalore (the “Court”). The Court has issued notice pursuant thereto on the Official Liquidator and the hearing

has commenced. Notwithstanding the arbitration award, based on management assessment supported by an external legal opinion,

the Company continues to offset payable to UBHL under the trademark agreement against the balance of loan receivable from UBHL.

During the year ended March 31, 2021, The Official Liquidator and the Company exchanged correspondences.

secured by certain property, plant and equipment and brands of the Company as well as by a pledge of certain shares of the Company

held by the USL Benefit Trust (of which the Company is the sole beneficiary). The Company deposited a sum of ` 6,280 million, including

prepayment penalty of ` 40 million, with the bank and instructed the bank to debit the amount from its cash credit account towards

settlement of the loan and release the assets and shares pledged by the Company. The bank, however, disputed the prepayment,

following which the Company filed a writ petition (“WP”) in November 2013 before the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka challenging

the actions of the bank.

In February 2016, following the original maturity date of the loan, the Company received a notice from the bank seeking to recall the

loan and demanding a sum of ` 459 million on account of outstanding principal, accrued interest and other amounts as also further

interest till the date of settlement. This notice was challenged by the Company by way of a separate application filed in the pending writ

proceedings. The Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka, by an order passed in the said application, directed that, subject to the Company

depositing ` 459 million with the bank in a suspense account, the bank should not deal with any of the secured assets including the

shares until disposal of the writ petition. The Company deposited the full amount, and the bank was restrained from dealing with any

of the secured assets.:

letter was received. Based on legal advice

the Company believes that it has no further liability towards the customer and that the trade receivable from the customer is good and

fully recoverable and the Company has responded to the customer accordingly. The Company is in consultation with the customer and

discussions are ongoing as at the date of approval of these financial statements.
