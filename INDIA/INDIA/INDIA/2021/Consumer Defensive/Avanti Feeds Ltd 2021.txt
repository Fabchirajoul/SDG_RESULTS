Foreign currency translation

i) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of the Company are measured using the

currency of its primary economic environment in which the Company operates (‘the

functional currency’). The financial statements are presented in Indian rupees (INR),

which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.

ii) Transactions and translations

Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into

the relevant functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet

date. The gains or losses resulting from such translations are included in net profit in

the Statement of Profit and Loss. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities

denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at

the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-

monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and

measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date

of the transaction.

Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign currency transactions

are included in determining net profit for the period in which the transaction is

settled. Revenue, expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies are

translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on

the date of the transaction

c.

Revenue recognition

The Company earns revenue primarily from sale of Shrimp Feed. Revenue is recognized

upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount

that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those

products or services. To recognize revenues, we apply the following five step approach:

(1) identify the contract with a customer,

(2) identify the performance obligations in the contract,

(3) determine the transaction price,

(4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and

(5) recognize revenues when a performance obligation is satisfied.:

of Section 206AB of IT Act (effective from July 1, 2021) which introduces special provisions

required to be deducted at higher of following rates in case of payments to specified persons:

-

at twice the rate specified in the relevant provision of the IT Act; or

previous years.

of a specified person.

While your Company is awaiting the guidelines from the Government prescribing the

mechanism to determine who fulfils the conditions of being a ‘specified person’. Therefore, in

order to comply with the provisions of the Act, and unless any mechanism is prescribed by the

authorities in this regard, Company will proceed on the assumption that all shareholders are

in compliance with the provisions of Section 206AB of the IT Act. However, we request you

to inform us well in advance and before record date if you are covered under the definition of

‘specified person’ as provided in Section 206AB of the IT Act. The Company reserves its right

to recover any demand raised subsequently on the Company for not informing the Company

or providing wrong information about applicability of Section 206AB in your case.

To enable us to determine the appropriate TDS / withholding tax rate applicable, we request

you to provide the above details and documents not later than Saturday, 7th August, 2021.
