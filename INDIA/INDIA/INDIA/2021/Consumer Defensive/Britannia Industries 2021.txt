i.e. the latest available closing price, prior to the date of the meeting of the Board of Directors or Remuneration /

Compensation Committee in which options were granted, on the stock exchange having higher trading volume.

Exercise prices as stated above were adjusted downwards by ` 170/- per share for options granted on 29 October 2008

and 27 May 2009, being the face value of bonus debentures issued pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement approved

by the Honourable Calcutta High Court on 11 February 2010.

The number of options have been appropriately adjusted, consequent upon the sub-division of the equity shares [Refer

note (e) below].

Contingent liabilities disclosed above represent possible obligations where possibility of cash outflow

to settle the obligations is not remote.

(ii)

The above does not include non-quantifiable industrial disputes and other legal disputes pending

before various judicial authorities [Also refer note 40 and 53].

(iii) The Supreme court of India in the month of February 2019 had passed a judgement relating to

definition of wages under the Provident Fund Act, 1952. Considering that there are numerous

interpretative issues relating to this judgement and in the absence of reliable measurement of the

provision for the earlier periods, the Company had made a suitable provision for provident fund

contribution during the Financial Year 2018-19. The Company will evaluate its position and update

its provision, if required, on receiving further clarity on the subject. The Company does not expect

any material impact of the same.
