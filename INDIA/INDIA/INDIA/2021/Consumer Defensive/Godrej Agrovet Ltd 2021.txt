BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Dr. Ashok Gulati

(Independent Director):

Dear Shareholders,

I hope you and your families are safe and healthy.

Financial Year 2020-21 was one of the toughest years due to the COVID-19 pandemic and has led to

many challenges for the corporate sector. It forced companies to run differently along with testing the

resilience of the business to the unprecedented disruptions. However, your Company swiftly adapted to

changing situations and executed operations ensuring limited interruptions.

The COVID-induced lockdown is expected to result in a 7.3% contraction in India’s Gross Domestic

Product for the Financial Year 2020-21. The agriculture sector was the only silver lining and is expected

to grow at 3.6%. Agricultural goods and services were categorised as essential in nature, which makes

the sector relatively resilient vis-à-vis others. Further, macro indicators for the sector were also positive

with the second consecutive year of normal monsoon, sufficient water reservoir levels, good soil moisture

and remunerative crop prices.

For Godrej Agrovet, it was an outstanding year in terms of profitability, as consolidated profit before tax

(excluding non-recurring and exceptional items) grew by 59.7% year-on-year. Growth was led by strong

performances in our Animal Feed business segment, our subsidiaries - Astec LifeSciences Limited,

Godrej Tyson Foods Limited and our joint venture - ACI Godrej Agrovet Private Limited, Bangladesh. The

Company was able to achieve stellar profit growth because of the relentless efforts of our employees and
