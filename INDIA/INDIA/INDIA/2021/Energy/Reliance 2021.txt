Managing Director’s Statement

I have always started this: letter by

sharing with you the operational and

financial achievements of Reliance

during the year. But the past year has

been a particularly challenging one for

India and its people. The COVID-19

pandemic disrupted several lives and

dealt a severe blow to the economic

health of the nation. It has also put

tremendous burden on the healthcare

infrastructure of the nation which is

crucial for saving lives and reducing

the impact of the pandemic. In these

challenging times, the most remarkable

and satisfying achievement of the

company has been its humanitarian

efforts in strengthening the nation’s

fight against the pandemic.

Right from day one, Reliance has

adopted a multi-pronged prevention,

mitigation, adaptation and ongoing

support strategy to fight the pandemic.

Last year, as soon as the first few cases

of COVID-19 were reported in India,

Reliance Foundation (RF) set up India’s

first dedicated COVID-19 hospital in

Mumbai in just two weeks. This year,

in response to the sudden surge in

COVID-19 cases in the city, RF rapidly

scaled up its COVID operations to create

875-bed facilities dedicated to COVID

care. It is the largest contribution by a

philanthropic organisation to COVID

care in Mumbai. RF has also set up

fully equipped 1,000-bed COVID

care facilities in Jamnagar. Overall,

Reliance is supporting the set-up and

management of over 2,300 beds across

various locations.

Last year, Reliance established a

manufacturing unit in Silvassa to mass

produce high quality PPE kits for the

frontline warriors. It became the largest

producer of high-quality PPEs in India.

This year, in response to the urgent

need for medical oxygen across the

nation, Reliance repurposed its plants

in Jamnagar to produce medical-grade

oxygen, soon becoming the largest

producer of medical-grade oxygen

from a single location in India. Since the

beginning of the pandemic, Reliance

has supplied over 55,000 MT of medical

grade liquid oxygen across the country.

It has also taken several steps to boost

India’s capacity to swiftly and safely

transport this life-saving resource.

The Foundation also launched Mission

Anna Seva, a programme to provide

free meals to marginalised communities

and frontline warriors across the nation.

So far, RF has provided over 5.5 crore

nutritious meals through ration kits,

food coupons and cooked meals across

18 states and one Union Territory. This

is the single largest meal distribution

programme undertaken in the world by

a corporate foundation.

In order to safeguard the health and

well-being of our employees and

their family members, we have set up

several initiatives such as a nationwide

emergency response infrastructure that

is available 24x7. We have also created

the JioHealthHub app for free virtual

video consultations with our doctors.

Using the COVID-19 symptom checker,

we are tracking the health of our

employees and their family members.

REFERS, our emergency response

service, is constantly monitoring the

symptom tracker and reaching out to

those showing the risk of being COVID-

positive. In addition to this, our teams of

medical experts are helping employees

preserve mental health and emotional

well-being through yoga and wellness

sessions and psychological guidance.

A key initiative to safeguard employees

from the pandemic is R-Surakshaa,

Reliance’s own vaccination programme.

Under R-Surakshaa, Reliance has

initiated a tech-enabled, multi-location

vaccination drive to vaccinate all

employees, partners, associates,

affiliates and their eligible family

members for free. The vaccination drive

is fully compliant with government rules

and regulations.

Also, Reliance has put in place a liberal

leave policy for employees affected

by COVID-19. It is providing financial

assistance of up to 3 months’ pay as

interest-free salary advance in case

of an exigency. In case of unfortunate

demise of an employee, Reliance is

providing financial support to the

family and committing to shoulder the

educational expenses of the children.

While the war against COVID is far

from over, we, the Reliance Family

are confident that in the end we will

prevail. We care for each one of our

stakeholders including employees,

shareholders, vendors, customers and

local communities.

I will now update you on your company’s

operating and financial performance.

Despite unprecedented challenges,

we continued to execute on our

growth plans across businesses. In

our Retail business, we expanded

Executing growth engines

In an unpredictable

environment, agility

and innovation are key

successful.

Shri Mukesh D. Ambani

Managing Director’s Statement

Oil and Gas E&P

Despite extraordinary

constraints during the

period, Reliance successfully

commissioned R Cluster field

in KG D6 Block.

PG 112

Located at a water depth of greater

than 2,000 meters, R Cluster is

Asia’s deepest and India’s first ultra-

deepwater gas field.

This was followed by commissioning of

Satellite Fields in April 2021, which was

done ahead of schedule. It showcases

your company’s commitment towards

India’s transition into a cleaner and

greener gas-based economy.

These complex deepwater projects

have been executed in over 34

countries and at peak more than 4,000

people have been working offshore and

onshore. Additionally, the pandemic

constrained movement of people and

material across the globe. Despite these

odds, the projects had flawless and

safe commissioning.

R Cluster and Satellite Fields are two

of the three new developments in the

KG D6 block, the other being MJ fields

which together are expected to meet

~15% of India’s gas demand by 2023

and account for ~25% of domestic

production. Peak gas production from

the three fields is expected to be ~1 bcf/

day by 2023. It will help reduce India’s

dependence on imported gas.

Sustainability

Our philosophy of inclusive

growth is depicted in the way

we conduct our businesses.

Growth and development are

often defined conventionally in

terms of net profit, revenue, and

other financial performance.

While we realise that all these

are important, our mission

remains to continue growing as

a responsible organisation that

believes in enriching lives.

PG 136

We continue undertaking social

initiatives in the areas of Education,

Healthcare, Community Infrastructure,

Skill Enhancement and Social Security.

The growing demand for energy

is causing an imbalance in limited

resources, especially in developing and

emerging countries like India. We are

committed to develop and grow in a

responsible manner while meeting the

expectations of all our stakeholders.

We believe that business priorities

co-exist with social commitments and

our activities support inclusive growth.

While we work towards achieving our

goals, we see the need to meet the

society’s evolving expectations. And

therein lies the need to form enriching

partnerships that will help us create a

sustainable future.

The world is now closing ranks for a

strong global action on Climate Change.

This gives Reliance the right opportunity

to accelerate our own ambitious New

Energy and New Materials business

wedded to the vision of clean and

green development. To combat climate

change, Reliance has set itself a target

to become Net Carbon Zero by 2035.

This is part of a wider ambition to

achieve best-in-class standards across

environmental, social and governance

Retail

The business delivered a healthy

performance with record

profit delivery in an operating

environment that continued to

remain challenging. During the

year, the business was impacted

by restrictions with 80% stores

operational and lower footfalls

which were at 65% of last year.

PG 50

Reliance Retail fulfilled its commitment

to serve customers at scale by providing

grocery and essential supplies to

millions of Indians at their doorstep,

overcoming enormous constraints

during the lockdown.

Reliance Retail opened 1,456 new

stores taking the total store count to

over 12,700 stores across the country.

Our Retail business operations ensured

support for the entire retail ecosystem

including consumers, farmers,

merchants, small and medium-scale

manufacturers and supply-chain service

providers. The business generated

>65,000 new jobs providing vital

support to the community.

Reliance Retail’s New Commerce

initiative, JioMart, continues to grow

in scale with more traffic, active users

and orders. Rapid scale-up of digital

commerce solutions, including JioMart,

compensated for curtailed store

operations and lower footfalls. Digital

commerce channel Ajio.com witnessed

3x increase in business on higher

orders and improvement across all key

operating metrics.

parameters under the oversight of

our Board. Our vibrant Board consists

of independent thought leaders with

requisite skill sets and domain expertise

to guide our businesses on their

future growth path.

Conclusion

As we passionately strive for a

better future, we continue to set

new paradigms every single day. In

an unpredictable and challenging

environment, agility and innovation are

key to staying consistently successful.

As technology becomes a driving force

in all businesses and facets of life, the

future belongs to organisations that can

lead and leverage the digital revolution.

I would like to place on record my

sincere appreciation to the Board of

Directors for their guidance. I would also

like to express my gratitude to all our

stakeholders for their unwavering faith

in Reliance. And I would like to thank the

entire team at Reliance for their untiring

efforts and unflinching commitment

to achieve the lofty goals we have set

ourselves for our Golden Decade.

I also want to express my deepest

gratitude to scientists, doctors, nurses,

police, volunteers and many others who

are waging the battle against COVID-19.

We all owe a great deal to them. I am

confident that we are going to ultimately

win the fight against COVID-19.

Because each one of us is engaged in

this fight and the human spirit to fight

and survive is greater than any disease

or pandemic. With our collective effort,

India will eventually triumph over the

crisis and emerge stronger, bigger and

better than ever.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,

OVERVIEW

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

letter of comfort given

by the Company. Subsequent to its

acquisition, the Company refinanced a

portion of debt aggregating US$2,455

million, most of which was maturing

during FY 2020-21 in compliance with

the provisions of the Foreign Exchange

Management (Cross Border Merger)

Regulations, 2018. This refinancing was

achieved at the lowest pricing in over a

decade for the applicable tenor.

In order to shore up its liquidity buffer

and to insure the Company against

risks of volatile business cashflow,

Reliance raised `24,955 crore

through rupee debentures for up to

5 years tenor, during the lockdown

period in 1Q FY 2021.

Highlights

During the year, Reliance successfully

raised equity in (i) Jio Platforms

Limited from global strategic investors,

including Facebook and Google and

marquee financial investors totaling

US$21 billion for ~33% stake, (ii)

Reliance Retail Ventures Limited from

marquee financial investors totaling

~US$6 billion for ~10% stake; (iii) fuel

retailing business by entering into

a partnership with bp; (iv) Reliance

Industries Ltd by way of Rights Issue.

The equity capital thus raised allowed

Reliance to significantly deleverage its

balance sheet and deliver on its promise

of attaining zero net debt status.

Financial markets were extremely

choppy and volatile during the year.

The first half of the year saw large-scale

destruction of demand in the economy,

significant fall in interest rates and

weakening of the rupee and the second

half of the year witnessed a bounce

back in growth, recovery of crude

oil price, strengthening of the rupee

and an upward movement in interest

rates. The Company was successfully

able to navigate all such dislocations

in the market, maintain adequate

liquidity on its balance sheet, manage

its financial market risks and deliver

a consistent return on its investment

portfolio by staying invested in low risk,

liquid instruments. Reliance Treasury

continued to stay focused on providing

liquidity to the businesses at the

optimal risk adjusted cost by accessing

financing from different markets

and using appropriate instruments

and currencies.

Reliance continues to enjoy a strong

credit rating and continues to be

rated two notches above sovereign

by S&P and is rated one notch above

sovereign by Moody’s.

Ratings Definitions

S&P BBB+: An obligation rated BBB+ exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse

economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the

obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.

Moody’s Baa2: Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit

risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.

CRISIL AAA: Instruments with this rating are considered to have the highest degree of safety

regarding timely servicing of financial obligations. Such instruments carry the lowest credit risk.

CARE AAA: Instruments with this rating are considered to have the highest degree of safety

regarding timely servicing of financial obligations. Such instruments carry the lowest credit risk.

ICRA AAA: Instruments with this rating are considered to have the highest degree of safety regarding

timely servicing of financial obligations. Such instruments carry the lowest credit risk.

Treasury Management

Reliance maintains a strong focus on

liquidity to ensure that the Group always

has adequate cover to face any potential

short-term market disruptions. Reliance

maintained a strong liquidity position

in its balance sheet in the form of cash

operating activities continued to remain

strong. The slowdown in hydrocarbons

was compensated by the strong growth

FY 2020-21 has been a year of unprecedented volatility

the largest ever such prepayment programme undertaken by any corporate entity in

India. The Company remains firmly committed to efficient financing of its working capital,

letter from the management on the

assessment of these matters.

Key audit matters

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Due to complexity involved in these litigation matters,

management’s judgement regarding recognition and measurement

of provisions for these legal proceedings is inherently uncertain

and might change over time as the outcomes of the legal cases

are determined.

Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.

D. Fair Valuation of Investments

As at March 31, 2021, the Company has investments of ` 78,234

crore in the Equity and Preference Shares of Jio Digital Fiber Private

Limited (‘JDFPL’) and Summit Digitel Infrastructure Private Limited

(“SDIPL’) (Formerly Reliance Jio Infratel Private Limited) which are

measured at fair value as per Ind AS 109 read with Ind AS 113.

These investments are Level 3 investments as per the fair value

hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly determination of fair value

is based on a high degree of judgement and input from data that

is not directly observable in the market. Further, the fair value is

significantly influenced by the expected pattern of future benefits of

the tangible assets of JDFPL (fiber assets) and SDIPL (tower assets).

Refer Note 2 and Note 37A in the financial statements.

Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the following:

• Reviewed the fair valuation reports provided by the management

by involvement of internal specialist / external valuation experts.

• We assessed the assumptions around the cash flow forecasts

including discount rates, expected growth rates and its effect on

business and terminal growth rates used through involvement of

the internal experts.

• We also involved internal experts to assess the Company’s

valuation methodology and assumptions, applied in determining

the fair value.

• We discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared to

previous year / actual performance with management to evaluate

the inputs and assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts.

• Assessed the objectivity and competence of our internal

expert and Company’s internal / external specialists involved

in the process.

• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the

financial statements.

E. Impairment of Investment in shale gas entities and recognition of deferred tax assets

(a)

Based on the assessment of the internal and external sources

of information, management has identified indicators of

impairment in respect of its investments in shale gas entities

engaged in the business of exploration and production of oil

and gas. In the current year, management has performed an

impairment assessment by comparing the carrying value of

these investments to their recoverable amount and accordingly

recognised an impairment loss of ` 15,686 crore. For the

purpose of the above impairment testing, realisable value

has been determined by the management by considering

estimates such as discount rates, reserves and volumes,

future oil and gas natural prices etc, along with consideration

of other macro-economic, business and financing factors

including divestment agreement entered into for certain

upstream assets.

(b)

The Company has also recognised Deferred Tax Assets of

` 15,570 crore in respect of the difference between the book

base and tax base of the investment in shale gas entities

engaged in the business of exploration and production of

oil and gas, in accordance with Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes.

Recognition of the aforesaid deferred tax asset involves

management judgement and estimates to determine whether

there is a reasonable certainty to utilise the deferred tax assets

against future capital gains.

Both the above items have been disclosed as exceptional items in

the financial statements (Refer Note 31(c)).

Accordingly, the above matters have been considered as a

key audit matter.

(a)

Our audit procedures to address impairment of investment

included and were not limited to the following:

• Obtained and assessed the impairment triggers identified by

the management.

• Read the note in relation to impairment of assets in

consolidated financial statement of the shale gas entities.

• Discussed the aforesaid matter with the component auditor

in accordance with Standard of Auditing 600 – Using the

work of Another Auditor.

• Read the agreement in reference to divestment of interest

in certain upstream assets operated by EQT Corporation to

Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

• Obtained the realisable value assessment made by the

management and assessed the methodology and the

assumptions applied in determining the realisable value by

engaging our internal valuation specialists.

• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the

financial statements.

(b)

Our audit procedures to address recognition of deferred tax

asset included and were not limited to the following:

• Assessed the basis of recognition of deferred tax assets in

accordance with Ind AS.

• Obtained and assessed the management assumptions /

judgements and mathematical accuracy for calculating the

difference between the book base and tax base.

• Evaluated the management assessment on future

transactions including capital gain projections used in

assessing the recoverability.

• Evaluated the management assessment of tax credit

recognition including calculation of tax base as per the

Income Tax Act, 1961 by engaging internal tax specialist. In

making this assessment, we evaluated the competence and

objectivity of our internal experts.

• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the

financial statements.

E. Impairment of assets of shale gas entities and recognition of deferred tax assets

(a)

The auditors in the Combined Financial Statements of Shale

Gas Entities (USA) of Reliance Industries Limited have reported

a key audit matter on impairment of assets. Based on the

adverse changes in market environment, reduction in activity

by operator and recent operational performance, the shale

gas entities have impaired its assets in accordance with the

requirements of Ind AS 36 – “Impairment of Assets”, as the

carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.

The shale gas entities have also evaluated certain

contracts involving unavoidable costs based on

contractual commitments.

The total impact in the consolidated statement of profit and

loss is ` 15,691 crore and the same has been disclosed as an

exceptional item in the consolidated statement of profit and

loss (Note 29(b)).

(a)

In respect of the key audit matter reported by the auditors

in the Combined Financial Statements of Shale Gas Entities

(USA) of Reliance Industries Limited, we performed inquiry

of the audit procedures performed by them to address the

key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary auditor, the

following procedures have been performed by them: -

• Tested the reasonableness of the assumptions used in

calculating the future net income for impairment calculation

and obligations towards onerous contracts.

• Verified the reasonableness of hydrocarbon rates

used by the Company for calculating the future net

income, by comparing it with the forecast provided by

independent brokers.

• Verified the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations.

• Evaluated the reasonableness of the basis for recognition

of Impairment and obligations under certain contracts

involving unavoidable costs.

• Verified the underlying data used for calculation of

Impairment with the reserve report issued by the

external experts.

• Verified the underlying data used for calculation

of obligation towards onerous contracts with the

respective contracts.

• Evaluated the reasonableness of the reversal of deferred tax

assets, which is the resultant impact of the charge towards

Impairment and obligation towards onerous contracts.
