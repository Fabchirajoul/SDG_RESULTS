Message from: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

The continued onslaught of COVID-19 made 2021 a uniquely

challenging year. India was hit hard by the second wave

of the pandemic in March 2021, which also affected your

Company’s 2Q performance. Overall, the year was marked by

rising inputs costs and supply chain bottlenecks, which put

pressure on our margins.

Despite these challenges, the Castrol India team demonstrated

remarkable resilience and delivered its highest-ever revenue till

date of Rs. 4,192 Crores in 2021, marking a growth of 40% over

2020. Further, we delivered strong volumes in 2021 bringing

back our market share to 2019 pre-pandemic levels.

What did your Company do differently in 2021? We leveraged

multiple growth opportunities through the expansion of

independent workshops, launch of premium branded products,

and introduction of new formats such as the Castrol Auto

Service centers and Castrol Express Oil Change outlets. We

not only invested in our brands, but we also strengthened our

service & maintenance offerings to customers and scaled up

adjacencies in the automotive aftermarket.

In 2021, we implemented the single biggest change to our B2C

sales model in over twenty years by introducing a new route-

to-market approach. This was aimed at bringing in higher sales

force efficiency, enhancing productivity and digitalizing our

business processes to make our operations more agile.

As industry leaders in the lubricants space, Castrol India

is continuously evolving to be future-ready. In 2021, your

Company was one of the first players in India to launch new

products with BS-VI ready technology for both passenger

cars and commercial vehicles. To cater to the rapidly growing

electric vehicle (EV) segment, we are exploring options with

two-wheeler EV manufacturers for developing EV fluids. At

the same time, we continue to supply EV fluids to two leading

passenger car OEMs in India. We are also supporting India’s

growing EV eco-system by collaborating with existing and new

partners.

2021 saw your Company get external recognition for safety,

quality, regulatory compliance, consistent delivery, and

performance. Castrol India was conferred with the ‘Ramp Up

Agility’ award by a leading OEM for enabling supply continuity

for its ICE & Electric Car manufacturing operations. Further, the

Castrol plant at Paharpur was awarded by the Indian Chamber

of Commerce with its prestigious National Occupational Health

& Safety Awards for 2021.

Advancing our sustainability agenda in India, we introduced

targeted interventions in our operations, packaging, and

distribution, with a focus on saving waste, reducing carbon, and

improving people’s lives. On the social front, our engagement

with truck drivers and independent auto mechanics over

the years, including our recent efforts to bring COVID-19

awareness, and community vaccination drives, helped us forge

an even stronger bond with them. Your Company’s efforts

were acknowledged by the British Business Group, Delhi, who

awarded us with the 2021 'Excellence in CSR award' for our

programmes: Castrol Eklavya and Castrol Sarathi Mitra.

All these achievements reflect the power and salience of the

Castrol brand and the relentless hard work of the Castrol

India team. We delivered these results while looking after

our people, enabling vaccination for our employees &

contractors, and ensuring that everyone was safe and well

during testing times. With vaccination rates going up in India

and the economic environment moving towards normalcy,

we remain confident of the long-term growth opportunities

for Castrol India.

I sincerely thank all our employees, shareholders, distributors,

customers, and wider stakeholders for their continued trust

and support. We will continue to strengthen our business by

exploring avenues for future growth and offering sustained

value and returns to our shareholders and the wider society.
