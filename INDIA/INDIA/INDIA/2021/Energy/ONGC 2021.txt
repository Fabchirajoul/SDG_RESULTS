Dear Shareholders,

A year back when this message went out, the world

was just months into a terrain that was entirely

unfamiliar – the COVID-19 pandemic was at the

front and centre of our collective consciousness as

its emergence and global spread which disrupted

all economies, humanity and pushed the ‘extremes’.

Now, after more than a year, the pandemic which is

still around has already completely redefined what

new normal is and, however difficult it is, we will have

to learn to live with it.

More than anything else, we realize there is just no

going back to as things were – and, although all of

us have suffered during this painful period, for some,

this pandemic has been a period of acute agony and

deep personal loss. Our feelings go out to all those

who have lost someone close to them. Within our

organization we also lost some of our beloved fellow

colleagues who succumbed to the deadly virus. We

salute each of our brave energy soldiers for their

supreme sacrifice.

India, a major lynchpin of the global economy and

an energy powerhouse, unfortunately had to pass

through unprecedented sufferings especially during

the ‘second wave’ of the pandemic. Although, general

threat perception today is a shade lower on account

of substantially lower case-counts and steadily

expanding vaccine coverage, we must remain ever

vigilant to combat the virus and to avert another brutal

surge of the infections. Virus is still lurking around and

may raise its ugly head with similar virulence if we

lower our guard.

As the country’s premier energy explorer, ONGC is

steadfastly committed to its overarching objective of

contributing to country’s energy security. Although

providing energy is our raison d’etre, these are truly

exceptional times, so we cannot but be more humane

and reasonable in the manner we choose to carry on

our operations. Our COVID-Response was premised

on preserving ‘Men, Material and Resources’.

Resource optimization was carefully planned for all

business-critical activities, while ensuring strong

adherence to COVID-related SOPs. Our massive crew

change operation at both our offshore and onshore

sites best exemplified that balanced approach.

Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) is fundamental

to the conduct of our business and ONGC attaches

highest priority to occupational health, safety

and protection of environment in and around its

operational areas. The recent incident during cyclone

Tauktae in western offshore was a very unfortunate

one. While we deeply mourn the loss of lives, it

has further strengthened our resolve and made

us revisit our internal Safety Management System

comprehensively. Several actions have been initiated

in this regard including revisiting our emergency

response plans and strengthening our marine

operations to handle such unprecedented cyclonic

situations. Your Company is also in the process

of benchmarking its safety standards to the best

practices in the E&P industry.

Beyond delivering consistently in its business, what

further marks out ONGC is its worthwhile contributions

beyond its business mandate, specifically in times

of crisis and national emergencies. In the last one

year, when the pandemic ravaged major parts of our

country, your Company, in addition to providing those

vital volumes of oil and gas that supported domestic

economy recovery efforts, also doubled down on its

CSR efforts, focusing largely on Healthcare. Specific to

COVID-19, your Company contributed a sum of `3000

Million to the PM Cares Fund and undertook CSR

projects worth almost `300 Million thereby benefitting

over 44 lakh people across the country during FY’21.

During the current fiscal i.e. FY’22, as the country was

in the grip of debilitating second wave, ONGC picked

up an exclusive gauntlet of responsibility to support

the communities to tide over the oxygen crisis. ONGC

is setting up 15 medical grade oxygen generation

plants at various parts of the country to strengthen

medical oxygen infrastructure. ONGC is also:

dear Shareholders, the Company is grateful

to you for your continued support and confidence in

our endeavours. Our lasting association has endured

the test of times and has proved to be an invaluable

asset. Fuelled by this mutual trust, your Company

is now more deeply committed to work towards the

energy independence of the country while continuing

to generate more and more value for its shareholders

in coming days through several verticals of energy.

I hope all of you take good care of yourself and stay

safe, as collectively we put together the building

blocks of a new energy era for the country.

Jai Hind!

Chairman &: Managing

Managing Director

Shri Subhash Kumar, Director (Finance), ONGC has assumed the

additional charge of Chairman &: Managing Director (CMD) of Oil and

Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) w.e.f. 01-04-2021.

Shri Subhash Kumar is also the

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to present, on behalf

of the Board of Directors of your Company, the

28th Annual Report on business and operations

of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited and its

Audited Statements of Accounts for the financial year

ended March 31, 2021 (FY’21), together with the

Auditors’ Report and Comments on the Accounts by

the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India.

Currently, COVID-19 overshadows business activity

and the energy industry is inevitably affected.

COVID-19 is a definitive black swan event exacting

enormous human and material loss on the world.

Once we overcome this mammoth challenge – which

we certainly will, we shall only become stronger to

face similar challenges in the future.

Energy is central to the modern society, the economy

and energy landscape is changing – so is the narrative

around it.

Many factors have come into play that have brought

us to this fork in the road – climate change concerns,

sustainability, safety, low commodity prices, efficiency,

the emergence of the conscientious and aware

consumer – and now COVID-19, that has brought in a

whole new way of working and doing business – the

‘new’ normal.

All along, our primary goals have been to keep up the

healthy pace of project execution, sustain our base

production, optimize operating costs and improve

the value proposition for stakeholders while doing

business safely and reliably. Despite attending to

unprecedented challenges of the business and its

surrounding environment, your Company along with

its group companies has registered yet another year

of sustained performance and made substantial

progress on most of these priority areas.

Despite the challenges posed by pandemic, your

Company’s production (including JV production)

during the year was 45.350 Million Metric Tonnes of

oil and oil equivalent gas (MMTOE) (against FY’20

production of 48.248 MMTOE).

• Crude oil production including JV production was

22.533 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT) during FY’21

against 23.353 MMT during the previous year.

• Natural gas production including JV production

was 22.816 Billion Cubic (BCM) against 24.896

BCM during FY’20.

Value Added Products (VAP) production was 3.120

MMT against 3.548 MMT during FY’20.

Backed by an intensive and continuous exploration

programme, your Company declared ten (10) oil and

gas discoveries (three - on-land and seven - offshore)

during the year 2020-21 in its operated acreages.

Out of these, six are prospects (one -on-land and five

- offshore) and four are pools (two - on-land, two -

offshore).

During the year 2020-21, accretion of In-place volume

and EUR (Estimated Ultimate Reserves) in 2P reserves

category from ONGC operated areas in India was

92.37 MMTOE and 50.31 MMTOE respectively.

Reserve Replacement Ratio (RRR – 2P EUR) from

domestic fields was 1.19 with respect to 2P reserves.

With this, your Company maintained Reserve

Replacement Ratio (2P) of more than 1 for the

15th consecutive year.

Your Company has four direct subsidiaries, namely

ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), Mangalore Refinery

and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL), Hindustan

Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) and Petronet

MHB Limited (PMHBL).

Your Company also has nine Associates/ Joint

Ventures, namely ONGC Petro additions Limited

(OPaL), ONGC Tripura Power Company Limited

(OTPC), ONGC TERI Biotech Limited (OTBL), Dahej

SEZ Limited (DSL), Mangalore SEZ Limited (MSEZL),

letter dated July 4, 2011, had directed

the Company not to participate in the Arbitration

initiated by the JV Partners (BGEPIL & RIL).

MoP&NG has also stated that the Arbitral Award

would be applicable to the Company also as a

constituent of the Contractors for both the PSCs.

Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH),

vide: letter dated May 25, 2017 had informed

the Company that on October 12, 2016, a Final

Partial Award (FPA) was pronounced by the

Tribunal in the said arbitrations. As informed by

BGEPIL, additionally Audit Award on January

11, 2018, Agreement Case Award on October 1,

2018 and Jurisdictional Award on March 12, 2019

were wherein the issues relate to the aforesaid

disputes. However, the details of proceedings

of the FPA and other Orders are not available

with the Company. DGH, vide their letters dated

May 25, 2017 and June 4, 2018, marked to

the Contractors, had directed the payment of

differential Government of India share of Profit

Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be payable

by

Contractors

pursuant

to

Governments

interpretation of the FPA (40% share of the

Company amounting to US$ 1,624.05 million,

including interest up to November 30, 2016)

equivalent to `119,351.43 million (March 31, 2020:

`122,583.29 million). In response to the letters of

DGH, the JV partners (with a copy marked to all

Joint Venture Partners) had stated that demand

of DGH was premature as the FPA did not make

any money award in favour of Government of

India, since quantification of liabilities were to

be determined during the final proceedings of

the arbitration. Further the award had also been

challenged before the English Commercial Court

(London High Court). Based on the above facts,

the Company had also responded to the letters of

DGH stating that pending finality of the order, the

amount due and payable by the Company was

not quantifiable. In view of the Company, if any

changes are approved for increase in the Cost

Recovery Limit (CRL) by the Arbitral Tribunal as per

the terms of the PSCs the liability to Government

of India (GOI) would potentially reduce.

The English Court has delivered its final verdict on

May 2, 2018 following which the Arbitral Tribunal

re-considered some of its earlier findings from

the 2016 FPA (Revised Award). The Government

of India and JV Partners have challenged parts

of the Revised Award before English Court. On

February 12, 2020, the English Court passed

a verdict favouring the challenges made by

BGEPIL and RIL and also remitted the matter

in the Revised Award back to Arbitral Tribunal

for reconsideration. Based on the information

shared by BGEPIL in January 2021, the Tribunal

issued a verdict favouring BGEPIL/RIL on the

remitted matter, which has been challenged by

the GOI before the English Court. The Challenge

hearings have been delayed due to COVID-19

and are expected to be heard in the latter half of

FY 2021-22.

Based on the information shared by BGEIPL,

The GOI has also filed an execution petition

before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court seeking

enforcement and execution of the October 12,

2016 FPA. BGEIPL / RIL contend that GOI’s

execution petition is not maintainable and have

opposed the reliefs sought by the GOI under the

said petition. The matter is pending before the

Hon’ble Delhi High Court and no final orders on

the reliefs sought by the GOI have been passed

so far.

In January 2018, the Company along with the

JV partners has filed an application with MC

for increase in CRL in terms of the PSCs. The

application has been rejected by MC. Pursuant

to the rejection, the JV partners have filed a claim

with Arbitral Tribunal. The CRL increase hearings

before the Arbitral Tribunal planned in FY 2020-

21 have also been rescheduled to FY 2021-22

due to COVID-19.

DGH vide letter dated January 14, 2019 has

advised to the contractors to re-cast the accounts

for Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti Fields

for the year 2017-18. Pending finalization of the

decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, the JV partners

and the Company had indicated in their letters to

DGH that the final recasting of the accounts was

premature and thus the issues raised by DGH

may be kept in abeyance.

letter dated

December, 31, 2014, that royalty should not be

taken as a basis for fixation of Stamp Duty to the

mining leases granted under the ORD Act read

with PNG Rules.

The Solicitor General of India, through his opinion

dated May 05, 2007, had also opined that the

distinction between royalty and rent is well settled.

Rent would be payable regardless of whether

the property is worked upon or not. On the other

hand, royalty is a variable figure. It would depend

upon the quantity of mineral obtained. If the mine

is not worked upon, rent would nevertheless

be payable. Hence, he opined that inclusion of

royalty for the purpose of calculation of stamp

duty is unjustified and not tenable. In absence of

clarity on the issue the amount of firm liability or

contingent liability is unascertainable.

48.1.2 A contingent asset is a possible asset that

arises from past events and whose existence

will be confirmed only by the occurrence or

non-occurrence of one or more uncertain

future events not wholly within the control

of the entity. During the normal course of

business, several unresolved claims are

currently outstanding. The inflow of economic

benefits, in respect of such claims cannot be

measured due to uncertainties that surround

the related events and circumstances.

letter dated August 8,

2006 from the contractor / JV for an amount

of US$ 166 million as short paid on account of

cost recovery of Development cost in excess

of Base Development Cost.

In August 2008 three JV partners excluding

ONGC

had

invoked

arbitration

against

Government of India (GoI) on the issue. The

contention of claim as operator was that it

should be allowed 100% Cost recovery of the

Base Development cost. The issue was argued

at various levels including court of Appeals

and Malaysian Federal Court. The decision of

court was in favour of JV partners. After Federal

court of Malaysia decision, the case was filed

with Delhi High court for enforcement of award

in India. Delhi High Court vide order dated

February 19, 2020 allowed enforcement of the

Arbitration Award including declaratory relief.

GoI had filed an SLP in Honorable Supreme

Court of India against the said order and

the judgment dated September 16.2020 was

in favour JV partner.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas

(MoPNG), GoI vide: letter dated October 10,

2018 issued a recovery notice to Oil Marketing

companies (OMCs) for US$ 52 million plus

applicable interest towards short payment

of Government share of Profit Petroleum on

account of dispute of Cost recovery of Base

Development cost from the payments made

to the Company towards the sales proceeds

of Crude Oil and Natural Gas. During the

year OMCs deducted and deposited the

sales proceeds of Crude Oil and Natural Gas

to MoPNG and the entire amount of US$ 83

million ($ 52 million along with interest of $31

million) (equivalent `6,099.67 million) has

been recovered. In view of the Supreme Court

Judgment for enforcement arbitration award

in India, an amount of USD 33.94 million has

been adjusted from profit petroleum payable

to GoI during the year 2020-21 against the US$

83 million receivable from GoI. Balance amount

of US$ 49.06 million (equivalent to `3,605.30

million) is considered good.

19.4 In case of subsidiary OVL,

19.4.1 ONGC Videsh has entered into options

contract covering Euro 52.5 million (in previous

year covering Euro 52.5 million) out of the

principal amount of 2.75% Euro 525 million

letter dated July 4, 2011, had directed the

Company not to participate in the Arbitration

initiated by the JV Partners (BGEPIL & RIL).

MoP&NG has also stated that the Arbitral

Award would be applicable to the Company

also as a constituent of the Contractors for

both the PSCs.

Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH),

vide: letter dated May 25, 2017 had informed

the Company that on October 12, 2016, a

Final Partial Award (FPA) was pronounced

by the Tribunal in the said arbitrations. As

informed by BGEPIL, additionally Audit

Award on January 11, 2018, Agreement Case

Award on October 1, 2018 and Jurisdictional

Award on March 12, 2019 were wherein

the issues relate to the aforesaid disputes.

However, the details of proceedings of the

FPA and other Orders are not available with

the Company. DGH, vide their letters dated

May 25, 2017 and June 4, 2018, marked to

the Contractors, had directed the payment of

differential Government of India share of Profit

Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be payable

by Contractors pursuant to Governments

interpretation of the FPA (40% share of

the Company amounting to US$ 1,624.05

million, including interest up to November

30, 2016) equivalent to `119,351.43 million

(March 31, 2020: `122,583.29 million).

In response to the letters of DGH, the JV

partners (with a copy marked to all Joint

Venture Partners) had stated that demand of

DGH was premature as the FPA did not make

any money award in favour of Government of

India, since quantification of liabilities were to

be determined during the final proceedings

of the arbitration. Further the award had

also been challenged before the English

Commercial Court (London High Court).

Based on the above facts, the Company had

also responded to the letters of DGH stating

that pending finality of the order, the amount

due and payable by the Company was not

quantifiable. In view of the Company, if any

changes are approved for increase in the

Cost Recovery Limit (CRL) by the Arbitral

Tribunal as per the terms of the PSCs the

liability to Government of India (GOI) would

potentially reduce.

The English Court has delivered its final

verdict on May 2, 2018 following which the

Arbitral Tribunal re-considered some of its

earlier findings from the 2016 FPA (Revised

Award).The Government of India and JV

Partners have challenged parts of the

Revised Award before English Court. On

February 12, 2020, the English Court passed

a verdict favouring the challenges made by

BGEPIL and RIL and also remitted the matter

in the Revised Award back to Arbitral Tribunal

for reconsideration. Based on the information

shared by BGEPIL in January 2021, the

Tribunal issued a verdict favouring BGEPIL/

RIL on the remitted matter, which has been

challenged by the GOI before the English

Court. The Challenge hearings have been

delayed due to COVID-19 and are expected

to be heard in the latter half of FY 2021-22.

Based on the information shared by BGEIPL,

The GOI has also filed an execution petition

before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court seeking

enforcement and execution of the October

12, 2016 FPA. BGEIPL / RIL contend that

GOI’s execution petition is not maintainable

and have opposed the reliefs sought by the

GOI under the said petition. The matter is

pending before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court

and no final orders on the reliefs sought by

the GOI have been passed so far.

In January 2018, the Company along with

the JV partners has filed an application with

MC for increase in CRL in terms of the PSCs.

The application has been rejected by MC.

Pursuant to the rejection, the JV partners

have filed a claim with Arbitral Tribunal. The

letter dated January 14, 2019

has advised to the contractors to re-cast

the accounts for Panna-Mukta and Mid and

South Tapti Fields for the year 2017-18.

Pending finalization of the decision of the

Arbitral Tribunal, the JV partners and the

Company had indicated in their letters to

DGH that the final recasting of the accounts

was premature and thus the issues raised by

DGH may be kept in abeyance.

During the financial year 2010-11, the Oil

Marketing Companies, nominees of the GoI

recovered US$ 80.18 million [Share of the

Company US$ 32.07 million (equivalent to

`2,356.82 million)] as per directives of GoI

in respect of Joint Operation - Panna Mukta

and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts (refer

Note No. 19.1). The recovery is towards

certain observations raised by auditors

appointed by DGH under the two PSCs for

the period 2002-03 to 2005-06 in respect of

cost and profit petroleum share payable to

GOI.

Pending finality by Arbitration Tribunal on

various issues raised above, re-casting of the

financial statements and final quantification

of liabilities, no provision has been accounted

in the financial statements. The demand

raised by DGH, amounting to US$ 1,624.05

million equivalent to `119,351.43 million

(March 31, 2020: `122,583.29 million)

has

been

considered

as

contingent

liability. The Company’s share of US$

32.07 Million (`2,356.82 Million) (March

31, 2020: `2,426.64 Million) recovered by

Government of India has been disclosed at

Note No. 19.1.

58.1.5 The Company is operating Petroleum

Mining Leases (PML) granted by the State

Government (s) after initial clearance from

the Government of India (GoI). The grant of

oil mining lease is regulated and governed

by the provisions of the Oilfields [Regulation

and Development] Act 1948 (ORD Act). Once

the lease order is granted, the lessee has

to execute lease deeds with the respective

State Government. The stamp duty on the

executed lease deed is payable as per the

Stamp Act of the respective States. Certain

State Governments are of the view to include

the amount of Royalty apart from other

payments like Security Deposit, surface

rent and dead rent etc. for the purpose of

calculation of stamp duty under the Stamp

Duty Act (s) applicable for such States.

However, the company is of the view that

the royalty payable by the Company is not

a rent to the State Government(s) but is

payable under Rule 14 of the Petroleum and

Natural Gas Rules, 1959 (PNG Rules). There

is a distinction between the concept of rent

and royalty. The word “royalty” signifies in

mining lease that part of reddendum which

is variable and depends upon the quantity

of minerals gotten or the mineral worked out

within a specified period. Whereas rent is the

amount payable for use and occupation of

land. Hence, it could be reasonably assumed

that for the purpose of calculation of stamp

duty, amount of royalty would not form part

of the consideration value of lease deeds

to be executed for PML granted. Ministry of

Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of

India communicated to the State Government

of Tamil Nadu vide: letter dated December, 31,

2014, that royalty should not be taken as a

basis for fixation of Stamp Duty to the mining

leases granted under the ORD Act read with

PNG Rules.

The Solicitor General of India, through his

opinion dated May 05, 2007, had also opined

that the distinction between royalty and

rent is well settled. Rent would be payable

regardless of whether the property is worked

upon or not. On the other hand, royalty is a

variable figure. It would depend upon the

quantity of mineral obtained. If the mine is

not worked upon, rent would nevertheless

be payable. Hence, he opined that inclusion

of royalty for the purpose of calculation of

stamp duty is unjustified and not tenable. In

letter dated 15th October 2013

and has imposed liquidated damages of

US$ 9.143 Million vide: letter dated 6th Feb

2015 as per Article 5.6 of PSC. Company

has kept ABG on notice that it is their

responsibility to pay the entire quantum of

liquidated damages, including the share

of Company, if Company is compelled to

pay its share of liquidated damages by

the GOI, and if such payment is made,

then company will have to claim this

money from ABG.

Company had invoked arbitration against

ABG in the matter on 10th October 2016.

After appointment of arbitrator on behalf

of ABG by Delhi High Court Order dated

22nd September 2017, three-member

tribunal has been constituted. The first

preliminary sitting of the Arbitral Tribunal

was held at New Delhi on 06.04.2018. On

30.10.2019 Arbitral Tribunal has passed

award for an amount of US$ 1.801 Million

with interest in favor of PPCL along with

costs of proceedings subject to the

condition that on receipt of the amount

by PPCL from ABG, the said amount

shall be passed on by PPCL to GOI

within a period of three months from the

date of receipt of the amount.

d) In respect of HBL, EPCC Vendors – NCLT

case: In the month of Oct 2018, one of the

EPCC vendor has filed petition against

HBL in NCLT, Kolkata Bench under IBC

Code 2016 in which party has raised a

claim of `199.00 million in lieu of unpaid

operational debt, interest on alleged debt

and legal expenses. On 12.02.2020,

order against HBL was passed by NCLT,

Kolkata accepting application/ petition of

our Vendor and thereby NCLT appointed

Insolvency resolution Professional (IRP).

However, being aggrieved, against the

NCLT Kolkata Order, Group sought stay

against execution of NCLT Kolkata order

and Hon’ble Supreme court granted

interim stay against the impugned order

on 06.03.2020. The matter was heard on

26.02.2021 in Hon’ble Supreme Court

and the court has allowed our appeal

and remanded the matter to NCLAT, to

decide the issue on merit.

58.1.9 In respect of subsidiary PMHBL,

In the following cases of claims against the

company, no reliable estimate could be

made of the liability:

a) 11 Writ Petition case filed by land owners

against PMHBL at Hon’ble High Court of
