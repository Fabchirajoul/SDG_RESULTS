Dear Shareowners,

Hope this fi nds you and your loved ones safe and healthy!

The year 2020-21 will perhaps be forever etched in our

memory as a very diffi cult year for the havoc it wreaked on

lives and livelihood. However, as with all types of crises,

the period also saw some exceptional performances and

will be remembered for the strengths and resilience it

brought out in us.

It is with immense pleasure and pride that I share with you

the stupendous fi nancial performance of your Company

during the year. Your Company created history, recording

the highest ever Profi t Before Tax of `22,618 crores and

Profi t After Tax of `19,042 crores on a standalone basis,

as against `2,671 crores and `2,683 crores respectively,

in the previous year. Even after excluding the one-time

gain on the sale of stake in Numaligarh Refi nery Limited

and other Exceptional Items, the Profi t Before Tax is

the highest at `16,169 crores. The strong refi ning and

marketing margins and inventory gains have contributed

to this stellar performance. As regards physical

performance, the pandemic related demand disruptions

resulted in a decline in refi nery throughput to 26.40 MMT

and market sales to 38.74 MMT, lower by 17% and 10%

respectively, as compared to last year, which was in line

with the Industry. In the backdrop of such exceptional

fi nancial performance, the Company has rewarded its

shareholders with the highest ever dividend of `79 per

share (including a one-time special dividend of `35 per

share in fi nal dividend).

More than a year into the pandemic, the world continues

to face its subsequent waves, affecting lives as newer

mutants of the virus emerge. The uncertainty surrounding

the pandemic is far from over, even though the

development of vaccines and medicines have given a ray

of hope. However, the extent and effi cacy of vaccination

and the reform initiatives by the governments hold the

key to successfully emerge out of the crisis and to get

back on to the path of a sustainable economic growth.

It is in these diffi cult times that lies the test of one’s

strength and tenacity. Your company stood strong in

the adversity and navigated successfully through the

challenges posed by the crisis. A true Corporate Citizen,

BPCL has been at the forefront of service to the society,

ensuring uninterrupted supply of petroleum products

at all times and contributed immensely towards nation

building and fi ght against the disease, including support

to Government initiatives like supply of oxygen from

refi neries and PSA oxygen plants to hospitals. The

Company continued its operations with utmost safety

at all touch points and deployed all possible means to

minimize the impact of disruption on its performance

– physical and fi nancial. The Company extensively

focused on improving effi ciencies, optimizing costs, re-

calibrating resource allocation, strengthening systems

and processes and fortifying risk management besides

exploring profi table growth opportunities in the changing

business and energy landscape.

Undeterred by the impediments caused by the pandemic,

your Company concentrated on project execution and

achieved completion/commissioning of many projects.

The fl agship Propylene Derivative Petrochemical Project

at Kochi Refi nery started commercial production.

Augmenting its marketing strength, BPCL commissioned

2,444 new Retail Outlets (ROs) during the year 2020-21 in

the target areas – the highest in a year in the history of the

Company. Completion of the Haldia LPG Import Terminal

and Pune Haveli POL Terminal has further bolstered our

marketing infrastructure.

During the year 2020-21, your Company took some

landmark decisions in the direction of consolidating its

interests in Subsidiary companies. Towards augmenting

its refi ning portfolio and drawing logistics and operational

synergies, your Company engaged with the Joint

Venture partner O.Q.S.A.O.C.(“OQ”, formerly known as

Oman Oil Company S.A.O.C.) for acquiring its 36.62%

shareholding in Bharat Oman Refi neries Limited, paving

the way for making it a 100% subsidiary from the

existing 63.38% stake, which was completed in June

2021. Further, streamlining the corporate structure and

facilitating effi cient utilization of capital and resources

for swifter scale-up of gas business, your Company has

decided to merge the wholly owned gas subsidiary –

Bharat Gas Resources Limited with itself and taken steps

in this regard. These transactions are expected to create

greater synergistic value in due course of time.

Digitalization has always been a strategic imperative

and a key focus area for BPCL. I am happy to inform you

that your Company has taken a major leap in extensive

proliferation of digitalization through its Project Anubhav

initiative, which aims to fortify BPCL’s marketing prowess,

provide support in terms of further customer engagement

and add to business process effi ciencies. Through various

digital solutions, the Company is redefi ning customer:

iii) Discovered Small Field Blocks

BPRL was awarded 5 Contract Areas (2 offshore and 3

onshore) through the Discovered Small Field (DSF) bid

rounds of 2016. The two offshore blocks (B15 and

B127E) are in the Mumbai Offshore basin, two in

Rajasthan (Bakhri Tibba and Sadewala) and one in

Cauvery Basin, Tamil Nadu (Karaikal). Petroleum Mining

Lease (PML) for Karaikal is yet to be received. The

Reports of non-commerciality of the contract areas of

B15, B127E, Bakhri Tibba and Sadewala were submitted

to DGH and requested for relinquishment of these

contract areas. DGH has approved the relinquishment of

Bakhri Tibba and Sadewala Contract areas. MoP&NG has

also issued notices of deemed termination for B15 and

B127E contract areas. BPRL also requested DGH for

relinquishment of Karaikal DSF Block due to PML not

issued by Govt. of Tamil Nadu.

B. Non-Operated Blocks

i) NELP VII Block (RJ-ONN-2005/1, Rajasthan Basin)

RJ-ONN-2005/1, an On-land block, was awarded by the

Government of India on 22 December 2008, to a

Consortium consisting of Hindustan Oil Exploration

Corporation (HOEC), BPRL, IMC Limited and Jindal

Petroleum Limited (JPL). HOEC is the Lead Operator and

BPRL is the Joint Operator of this block. The Petroleum

Exploration License (PEL) for the block was granted by

the Government of Rajasthan on 13 July 2009. On award,

all the consortium partners had an equal participating

interest of 25% each, in this block. BPRL’s PI was

increased to 33.33% subsequent to JPL’s exit from the

block.

All the minimum work program commitments except

drilling of six wells have been completed in the block. The

drilling of exploratory wells was delayed because of

inordinate delay in obtaining clearance from Ministry of

Defence and Environmental clearance. The Lead

Operator HOEC submitted proposal to Directorate

General of Hydrocarbon (DGH) to exit the block and

waiver of Liquidated Damages (LD) in 2015 due to more

than two years delay in obtaining Environment clearance

in line with Govt. policy dated 10.11.2014. However, the

same was turned down by DGH. DGH has recently

declined BPRL’s proposal for recommencement of

exploration activities in the block and accordingly, BPRL

is in the process of relinquishing the block.

ii) NELP IX Blocks

a) CB-ONN-2010/11 (Cambay Basin)

CB-ONN-2010/11, an On-land block was awarded by

BPCL, added another feather to its cap with the

announcement of its entry into the Electric Vehicle

space. With the launch of its “e-Drive” initiative - an

innovative electric vehicle mobility model based on

battery swapping, initially being rolled out in Kochi (3

ROs) and Lucknow (4 Ros). This is a new and unique

model for Electric Vehicle (EV) mobility, the first of its

kind in the country, ahead of its competition. BPCL in

collaboration with Pune-based Kinetic Green Energy

& Power Solutions and IIT-Madras will enable this EV

mobility system based on battery-swapping model

for electric three-wheelers. BPCL, with the

technology support for mobile app, battery

management system and other systems from IIT-

Madras, will provide the lithium-ion batteries for the

vehicles.

Additionally, BPCL has also initiated the

opportunities in the EV Charging Station (EVCS)

business space. It has adopted online charging

models and pilot runs are being undertaken at about

29 charging stations across cities to understand the

customer behaviour, technicalities and business

opportunity.

3. Does the Company have procedures in place for

sustainable sourcing (including transportation)?

If yes, what percentage of your inputs was sourced

sustainably? Also, provide details thereof, in about

50 words or so.

Yes, BPCL strives for sustainable procurement

across its value chain, right from the sourcing of raw

materials i.e. Crude Oil to product transportation.

Cross-country pipelines are globally recognized as

the safest, cost-effective, energy-efficient and

environment-friendly mode for transportation of

crude oil and petroleum products. BPCL is

extensively using its pipeline network for the

transportation and distribution of its products. It has

pipeline network of 2,241 kms that has transported

14.86 MMT of Petroleum Products in FY 2020-21 as

compared to 16.99 MMT in the last year. All BPCL

pipelines are compliant to T4S standards. BPCL is

focused on increasing the share of product/crude

transportation through pipelines however, the

decrease in pipeline throughput for FY 2020-21 is

mainly attributable to the subdued demand due to

COVID-19 pandemic.:

letter dated 7.9.2020 directed BPCL to deposit

a sum of ` 67.5 Cr in a ring-fenced account. BPCL

had challenged the said order before the Supreme

Court. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has issued stay

order to the order of NGT dated 13.08.2020.

• Vipin Nath AV & Sinu C Jacob vs BPCL and others.

Application has been filed before NGT, Chennai to

direct BPCL to develop and maintain proper green

belt and buffer zone around the boundary of

Propylene Derivative Petrochemical Project

(PDPP) at BPCL KR unit under the Integrated

Refinery Expansion Project (IREP). Hearing is

scheduled in the month of June 21.

• Shri Sant Dasganu Maharaj Shetkari Sangh,

representing 24 families who are residing and

based at Akolner village, filed application before

National Green Tribunal alleging that ground water

pollution caused by leakage of petroleum storage

tank installed at village Akolner, District –

Ahmednagar by BPCL and other oil company. NGT

partly allowed application and directed interalia for

remedial measure to be taken by Collector

Ahmednagar and cost of such remedial measure

be borne by BPCL and other oil company. Against

said order, BPCL filed Civil Appeal before Supreme

Court of India. Supreme Court subsequently

directed Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to

conduct an inspection to find out status of

Petroleum Product contamination at the Akolner

Village and pursuant to said order MPCB has since

submitted its report.
