Dear Stakeholders,

Taking into consideration our competence in Fluorine

Chemistry and vertical integration of natural minerals

into Fluoropolymers, we are presently amongst the

leading producers of Fluoropolymers, Fluorospecialities,

Refrigerants, and Chemicals used in diverse segments. We

are focused on ensuring complete customer satisfaction

through consistency in product quality, on-time delivery, and

effective communication.

With rising cases of Covid-19 in India, our business was

somewhat affected. Prices dropped due to a direct

consequence of demand slowdown. Besides, lack of

manpower resulted in insufficient capacity utilization. As

lockdowns started to be lifted, we resumed operations and

revenues started to flow in. Resting on our intellectual capital

and manufactured capital, we aspire to keep on developing

a range of Fluoro Specialty Chemicals that can be used in

agricultural and pharmaceutical applications. We have also

developed new grades of Fluoropolymers to enhance its

unforeseen challenges.

in FY21. We are also working to reduce

our debt and our debt-equity ratio for the

year remained 0.33 times, and interest

coverage ratio showed an impressive

growth of 5.28 times.

We expect to keep the momentum of

our financial performance intact, aided

by larger operational cash flows and

working capital efficiency.

We endeavour to create sustainable

value through our business. We,

therefore, pledge to promote ‘Value
