Dear stakeholders,

It gives me pleasure to introduce

our second Integrated Report

2020-21.

Our business has been structured

around the increasing reality that

clean, affordable and abundant

power is a basic ingredient for the

economic progress of a city, state

or country.

Based on this recognition,

our focus is to build trusted

and enduring relationships

with our entire stakeholder

family, strengthening our long-

term relevance and business

sustainability.

There is a growing bottom-up

movement emerging from across

India and the world, marked

by an increasing preference

for renewable energy from

consumers. Best of all, these

consumers are willing to pay more

for responsibly derived energy,

ensuring that this transformation

is not fleeting and remains a

long-term measure catalysed

by market-place economics and

dynamics.

Catalyst

At Adani Green Energy, we intend

to capitalise on this long-term

direction by building large

renewable energy assets that do

not just feed existing markets but

grow them.

We commit to safeguard the

environment not merely through

the provision of renewable energy

but also minimal ecological and

societal displacement in the

commissioning of our projects.

More than that, we intend to

set progressively higher project

development benchmarks; we

intend to invest in cutting-edge,

eco-friendly technologies and

energy management processes

that make it possible to generate

more green energy, utilising

minimal resources which is the

basis of all sustainability.

At Adani Green Energy, we

We are proactively

and Governance

(ESG) priorities to

make all our growth

sustainable. These

priorities play a

pivotal role in all our

decisions.

Dear stakeholders,

India is the world’s third-largest

energy consuming country.

The country is expected to

consume a larger quantum of

energy on account of growing

population, rising incomes,

widening aspirations and

improving lifestyle standards.

Interestingly, even as India’s

energy use has doubled since

2000, 80% of the country’s

energy appetite continues to

be addressed by coal, oil and

solid biomass. This is where

the scenario gets interesting

and thought-provoking. On a

per capita basis, India’s energy

use and emissions are less than

half the global average, as are

other key indicators like vehicle

ownership, steel and cement

consumption. If fossil fuels

were to continue driving India’s

prospective energy consumption,

the result would affect India’s

need to moderate carbon

emissions intensity and carbon

footprint. As a result, renewable

energy is not incidental to India’s

growth story; it is integral to it.

As India recovered from a Covid-

induced slump in 2020, it re-

entered a dynamic phase of its

energy development journey. India

has encountered extraordinary

success in its recent energy

development; the country

extended electricity connections

to hundreds of millions of its

citizens. Besides, I am proud to

communicate that the Indian

government announced a

disproportionately large national

investment target in renewable

energy capacity creation. Over

time, this investment will help

shift the national needle from

conventional energy sources to

modern renewable equivalents.

Responsible catalyst

I am pleased to communicate

that Adani Green Energy Limited

(AGEL) is not just an opportunity-

driven participant in this national

In line with our goal to be counted

in this respect, AGEL embarked

on the journey to become free of

single-use plastic. All operating

actions to achieve this aspiration.

AGEL’s 648 MW solar plant in

Kamuthi was awarded SUP-Free

certification by CII following

rigorous monitoring as per a

customised protocol. By becoming

single-use plastic-free, we are in line

with the Sustainable Development

Goal #12 which mandates ‘Ensure

sustainable consumption and

production patterns’. Besides,

AGEL’s Kamuthi operations also

achieved the coveted water-positive

status during the reporting year.

At AGEL, ESG aspects and Risk

Management have been deepened

through the Enterprise Risk

Management (ERM), which is

guided by the Chief Risk Officer.

ERM has been implemented across

the Company to enable employees

and associates to articulate the

identification of risks to the

next level. The risk management

framework comprises a provision

to evaluate, prioritise and escalate

risks to the highest body within the

organisation.

More ESG initiatives have been

covered in the Integrated Report
