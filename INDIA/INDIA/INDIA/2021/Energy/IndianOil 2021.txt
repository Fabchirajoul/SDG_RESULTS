Dear Shareholders,

Chairman’s Message

I hope you are keeping well and safe.

It’s my privilege to present the Integrated

Annual Report 2020-21 which provides an

insight into IndianOil’s performance during

the last financial year and its ever-expanding

horizon of aspirations. Your Company was

one of the early adopters of the Integrated

Reporting Format in India, and we continue

to refine it to create and communicate

better value for the stakeholders through

multi-capital reporting.

This report chronicles IndianOil’s journey

during a turbulent year marked by the

raging Covid-19 pandemic and elaborates

on how your Company navigated through

uncharted waters, overcoming all odds

and turning challenges into robust growth

opportunities. This report also underscores

the indomitable spirit of IOCians who, with

their commitment, resilience, and a strong

sense of purpose, kept the Company going

as the ‘Energy of India’.

Tiding over challenges, Always

The last year has been an unprecedented

and extraordinary year that has altered the

course of our lives and livelihoods. Our

plans, objectives and even perceptions have

undergone a paradigm shift, while the long-

term impact of this disruption on various

sectors still remains uncertain. However, the

course of human evolution teaches us that

challenges open up new horizons of growth

besides underlining the primacy of specific

skill sets and traits for surviving in a post-

pandemic world. IndianOil teams leveraged

opportunities amidst these difficult times to

catalyse future growth. Putting the country

before business remains an intrinsic part of

IndianOil’s DNA. So, when the pandemic

struck, IndianOil teams rose to the occasion

swiftly and selflessly, serving the customers

and stakeholders, despite disruptions in the

demand and supply dynamics. Displaying

extraordinary zeal, Team IndianOil kept

the fuel supply lines going and delivered

a record 33.11 Lakhs Indane LPG cylinders

on a single day, on 30th April 2020, braving

the pandemic and a stringent lockdown.

The last financial year has been

a perfect guide in demonstrating

the importance of team-resolve

in tiding over challenges...

...Your Company not only

surmounted the pandemic crisis,

but it also rose to the occasion

to thwart major threats and chart

new paths of excellence.

14:

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors of IndianOil, it is my

privilege to present the 62nd Annual Report and the Fourth

Integrated Annual Report of the Company for the financial

year ended March 31, 2021, along with the Audited Standalone

and Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report

thereon.

The year stood testimony to the grit and perseverance of

IOCians who scripted success stories despite the challenges

unleashed by the Covid-19 pandemic. It was the ‘never-say-die’

spirit and the indomitable courage of the Company’s frontline

warriors across the entire supply chain that kept India as well

as IndianOil on the move during this unprecedented crisis in

modern human history. The Company not only maintained

the supply of petroleum products across the country, but also

exceeded the tough capital expenditure target for expanding

its infrastructure and strengthening its business goals by

launching innovative products and services in the retail space.

As the country faced challenges posed by Covid-19, IndianOil

stood firm by its philosophy of ‘Pehle Indian, Phir Oil’. When

the world came to a standstill, IndianOil stopped at nothing.

In addition to its ‘business as usual’ approach, IndianOil stood

at the forefront of the pandemic and with a humanitarian

approach leveraged it’s resources of money, material and

workforce. When the entire country was reeling under the

second wave of Covid-19 infections, the Company continued

to serve silently, taking several initiatives towards Covid-19

management and Liquid Oxygen (LOx) arrangement.

IndianOil - constantly innovating to bring the best to you

Going further on the path towards alternative energy, your

Company has tied up with 22 plants through EOIs for supplying

biodiesel produced from Used Cooking Oil (UCO) with an

load of UCO-based biodiesel blended HSD was flagged off

by the Hon’ble Minister of PNG and Steel from the Tirkri Kalan

Terminal in West Delhi.

The Company is taking initiatives in a variety of ‘waste to

energy’ options and has signed an MoU with the North Delhi

Municipal Corporation on January 19, 2021, in this regard.

Recently, your Company has signed an MoU with the NTPC

and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) for setting

up 50 TPD ‘waste to energy’ demo projects at SDMC’s Okhla

landfill site.

To support the Government of India’s e-mobility initiative,

your Company acquired equity stake in Phinergy Limited

(an Israeli company specialised in Aluminium-Air Battery

technology) and formed a joint venture, namely ‘IOC Phinergy

Private Limited’ (IOP) in February 2021 to commercialise the

Aluminium-Air Battery technology in India. Your Company is

also exploring the prospects of green hydrogen and is working

towards exploring possible collaboration in the area of ‘waste

to hydrogen’ technology. Discussions are also ongoing with

an electrolyser technology company towards utilisation of

electricity generated from renewable energy plants to produce

green hydrogen.

IndianOil is committed to integrate its sustainability initiatives into business strategy to grow as a responsible organisation
