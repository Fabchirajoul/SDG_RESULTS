Dear Shareholders,

I am delighted to welcome you all to 47th Annual General Meeting of your company, Coal India Limited. The Directors' Report and Financial

Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2021 together with the report of Statutory Auditors and report and review of Comptroller & Auditor

General of India are already with you. I am sure you are fully aware of physical & financial health of your company.

Importance of Coal and Coal India Limited

1.1

Coal

¾

Coal, as primary commercial energy fuel, has been sustaining the country's energy requirements for decades now and would continue to

retain its relevance for the few more decades as well. With around 55% share, coal occupies the major space in India's energy basket.

¾

The country's planners are alternatively laying impetus on greener and renewable energy forms in a bid to migrate from largely fossil

driven energy economy to one that is powered by cleaner sources. From an environmental perspective, this is a welcome move.

¾

The entry of renewable energy sources, however, would not destabilize coal in immediate future. It would continue its lead role in India's

electricity generation as indicated by the consumption pattern.

¾

Of the country's total power generation of 1378.525 Billion Units (BU) during 2020-21, including renewable energy sources, coal based

generation was 950.751 BU which is around 69% highlighting coal's importance.

¾

Additionally, coal continues to stoke many non-power industries as well viz. cement, fertilizers, sponge iron, aluminium and a host of

other industries.

¾

The world over many countries are moving away from coal but the Indian context is different. In India, what makes coal a preferred energy

fuel is its abundance, availability and affordability. Till alternative energy sources start making significant contribution, there is no

replacement for coal as the country's irreplaceable prime energy source.

1.2

Coal India Limited

¾

With coal commanding such prominence in the Indian energy sector, CIL is at the forefront of the nation's coal production. CIL alone

produces around 83% of country's entire coal output. Your company is committed to increase its production and supplies to the

mandated levels.

¾

In a country where 69% of the total electricity generation is coal based, your company virtually empowers the nation's power sector.

Around 80% of CIL's total supplies are catered to power sector.

¾

CIL is also one of the largest contributors to the government ex-chequer - both Central and State - and also plays a crucial role in country's

social fabric touching the lives of the countrymen in more ways than one.

2.

2020-21: A Challenging Year

Financial Year 2020-21 posed a never-witnessed-before challenge in the form of Covid-19 pandemic. It was a difficult situation to cope up not

only for your company but for the country as well. In fact, it was a global phenomenon of unprecedented daunting proportions.

But, your company never ceased its operations even for a day, continuing excavation, production and off-take even in the face of such hardship.

The courage and resilience exhibited by your company's energy soldiers was exemplary. Notwithstanding the adversity, employees at all levels

kept up their spirit in the service of the country braving the odds. What was important was to keep up the morale of the officers and the staff. So,

officials at all hierarchy levels right from CMDs of CIL's subsidiary companies down to GMs, Area Managers have donned leadership role in

keeping the spirit up in continuing the mining activities resolutely.

Health and well-being of the employees was immediate uncompromising priority. Setting up of beds has been stepped up as a frontline medical

support. Health infrastructure facilities have been created on war footing under CSR banner. Extending curative care was not limited to the

employees and their dependants but was also extended to community within the proximity of command areas. Containing the spread of the

pandemic in the mining areas was taken up with all seriousness it deserved.

With the lockdown in place, the resultant reduced coal demand was a big challenge to increase off-take. To step up coal supplies your company

has proactively rolled out a set of consumer friendly measures which have yielded positive results.

Over Burden Removal (OBR) was consistently high throughout the year with large strips of OB excavated, despite Covid posed slowdown.

Even under hardships your company had achieved new highs and accomplishments during 2020-21.

3.

Production & Off-take

¾

CIL's production at 596.22 Million Tonnes (MTs) was 90.34% achievement of the MoU target.

¾

Despite lukewarm demand for coal, your company could supply 574.48 MTs which is 87.04% of the target achievement during the year.:

Director's

Report. As stipulated by SEBI, your company had also conducted Secretarial Audit by a peer reviewed practising Company Secretary for

compliance of SEBI Regulations and circulars/guidelines during 2020-21 and received an 'Unqualified Report' except for those observations

mentioned in Secretarial Audit Report 2020-21.

18.

Vision

Your company's vision is to ensure that there is no shortage of coal in the country and to make the country self-reliant in coal. Coal India envisions

to be a commercially viable company and endeavours to move ahead as a contemporary, professional, consumer friendly and successful

corporate entity committed to national developmental goals. The vision also extends to dedicate itself to the service of the countrymen in

providing the primary commercial energy in an affordable and environmentally friendly manner. Your company aims to be not only a valued

company but a company with values.

19.

Acknowledgement

On behalf of your Company's Board of Directors, I wish to convey my deep gratitude to you, our valued shareholders, for your continued

support and trust. This motivates us to excel in all our pursuits and constantly create value for you as well as for the nation.

I appreciate the unstinted support and valuable guidance received from the Ministry of Coal, Government of India. I also express my sincere

thanks to other Central Government Ministries and Departments, State Governments, all employees, Trade Unions, Auditors, Consumers,

Suppliers and all other stakeholders for their continuous co-operation.

Observation of Secretarial Auditor & Management Explanation

Sl.

OBSERVATION

MANAGEMENT EXPLANATION

1.

The Board did not comprise of atleast fifty percent

of the Directors as independent directors and an

independent woman director.

The constitution of Audit committee, Nomination

and Remuneration Committee, Corporate Social

Responsibility Committee & Stakeholder

Relationship Committee was not in accordance with

SEBI LODR, 2015 from 6th Sept' 2020 and the

business required to be transacted at these committee

meetings are subject to compliances of the

regulations 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 33 read with

Schedule II of SEBI LODR 2015.

The changes in the composition of the Board of

Directors that took place during the period under

review were carried out without complying the

aforesaid provisions.

5 Independent Directors (including 1 Woman Independent Director) who were

appointed on 17th Nov.'2015 ceased to be the Directors on 16th Nov.'19 and

no replacement has been appointed till 31st Mar' 2021. Further 2 more

Independent Directors ceased to be the Directors on 5th Sep'2020 and no

replacement has been appointed till 31st March'2021. As such, CIL Board did

not have the optimum combination of Executive & Non-Executive Directors as

per LODR Regulation 17 from that date. Further all these committees required

Independent Director as Chairman/Member, these committees were not re-

constituted after cessation of Independent Directors. Hence composition of

these Committees are not in consonance with the requirements of SEBI (LODR)

Regulations, 2015.

Coal India being a Maharatna company and CPSE, the power to appoint Director

vests with Govt. of India. CIL has taken up the matter with Ministry of Coal, the

Administrative Ministry even before the vacancy arose as well as subsequent to

the vacancy for appointment of 7 Independent Directors including a Woman

Independent Director as required under LODR.

2.

The BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of

India Limited have levied penalties on the Company

for Mar'20, June '20, Sept'20 and Dec'20 quarters

with respect to above regulations

The Company has made representation that as per its Articles of Association, The

President of India appoints Director/s on the Board of the company. The Company

has intimated the Ministry of Coal who is the Appointing Authority about the

receipt of mail from BSE & NSE levying penalty for non-compliance of LODR

provision as well as other actions that could be taken by the Stock Exchanges in

case of continued non-compliance. The company is not responsible for

appointment of directors and hence requested for a waiver from the fine levied

by the Stock exchange. BSE Limited has vide its email dated 19.04.2021, waived

the fine levied for the quarters September 2020 and December 2020. Company

has taken up the matter with BSE to waive the fine for the quarters ended

March'20 & June'20. Company has also taken up with NSE to waive the fine

levied in line with BSE.:
