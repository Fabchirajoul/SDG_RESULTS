Chairman's Message

For the Global Energy Industry, Oil was by far the hardest hit. Restrictions

on mobility, containment measures and economic disruptions related

to the COVID-19 outbreak led to sharpest oil demand contraction in

calendar year 2020 in decades. Indian economy was equally impacted

by the unprecedented crisis. The lockdown measures imposed to

contain the pandemic, affected the economic activities resulting in

contraction of the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 7.3% in

2020-21. In addition, the pandemic posed new challenges related to

business continuity, supply chain management and concerns related

to health and safety of the workforce.

Consequent to the several proactive, preventive and mitigating measures

taken by Government, the rebound from the COVID-19 induced slump

has been sharp in the third quarter as real GDP growth turned positive

and further strengthened in the fourth quarter. The country’s fuel

demand which has contracted to almost 50% in April 2020 rebounded

sharply with gradual relaxation of lockdown restrictions to end the year

with almost 91% of the 2019-20 full year demand.

Crude oil prices varied in a wide range during 2020-21, falling

significantly in the beginning of the year largely driven by demand

contraction due to COVID-19 lockdown. Crude oil prices rebounded

Dear Shareholder,

It gives me immense pleasure to present the 69th Annual Report

on the performance of your Company for the year 2020-21. The

year was very challenging for the nation and its people due to

the pandemic. At this hour of crisis, your Company salutes the

tireless efforts and incredible courage of all the frontline workers fighting

COVID-19 pandemic with complete dedication. My heart goes out to

everyone out there who has suffered the loss of their loved ones. Given

the scientific progress achieved, I am confident that the continuous

efforts and strict discipline will eventually make us win over the crisis.

During the year, the most satisfying achievement of the Company is

its proactive efforts in helping the nation fight against the pandemic.

During the lockdown period, your Company made every effort to serve

the nation by ensuring uninterrupted supplies of essential commodities

like cooking gas and transport fuels across the length and breadth

of the country while ensuring safety of its workforce. Significant

technology solutions were implemented to ensure that employees

can work seamlessly from remote locations / home to ensure product

availability. The Company undertook various relief measures for needy

and less privileged people including migrant labour and strengthening

the health infrastructure.

Navigating through a

challenging environment,

your Company has

delivered its highest ever

Profit After Tax (PAT) of

` 10,664 Crore during the

Financial Year 2020-21,
