Dear Shareholders,

It is that time of the year that I

cherish. Through this statement

I get to communicate my mind

on what has transpired and what

could play out over the near term.

It is with a great deal of

satisfaction and pride that I look

back at the year gone by.

At the start of FY21, we had

estimated and communicated,

that the Company would aim

to achieve a 15-20% growth in

its topline. Through the year, we

continued to do what we do best,

deliver projects and products

to our customers and drive the

performance of your Company,

while ensuring a focus on

sustainability. We ended the year

with a 20% topline growth. Our

revenue from operations crossed

the B1,000 crore mark for the first

time in our 32 years journey. And

this was despite the pandemic-led

disruptions.

In the face of rising costs, we

delivered healthy profitability –

our EBITDA margin was 40%-

plus and our Net margin was

35%-plus. In sustaining this

level of profitability, we have

demonstrated our resilience

and strength to withstand a

difficult economic environment.

I can say with pride that Suven

Pharma would be the only Indian

pharmaceutical company to

report, on a consistent basis (for

the last five years) and EBITDA

margin in excess of 40%.

Going forward, we expect to

deliver 10-15% growth on the

expanded topline, subject to the

occurrence and intensity of a third

wave of the pandemic.

Assuming that the wave would

be of reduced intensity owing to

the aggressive inoculation drive

in India, and across the world,

I feel that focus on research by

global innovators would intensify.

This augurs well for our Pharma

CRAMS operations, which is and

will remain our key growth driver.

While, our specialty chemicals

business should remain at the

previous year levels, I am positive

about our progress in our recent

fledgling – the formulations piece.

What is particularly pleasing is

that our new formulations vertical

has registered a healthy growth.

We increased our commercial

formulations basket in FY21 and

have a pipeline of 6 ANDAs that

are pending approval. I expect

these filings to receive the stamp

of approval in the current year.

Additionally, we hope to file

another 6 ANDAs during FY22,

enhancing our growth levers.

Having said that, I must add

caution, that this is a very small

vertical currently, by design. For

we have cherry picked very small

volume, niche products which

are bereft of competition owing

to the brand market size (US$2-

5 million per product). Despite

sustained addition to the product

basket, the overall size of the

formulation piece, will remain

relatively small when compared to

other verticals.

The Small Giant

Suven Pharma, true to its

nature of being a proactive

organisation, is embarking on

a B600 crore investment, our

largest since inception. We have

received the Board’s approval

for the same. This has raised

considerable speculation in the

investor community, so I take this

opportunity to clear the dust on

our capex plan.

Rationale: We are a 30-plus year

company. Considering customer

requirements, increasingly

stringent regulatory requirements,

we need to upgrade our

equipment, technology and

capabilities. This is not just

modernising, but it will be a

block-by-block overhaul and

upgradation. In doing so, we

will introduce sophisticated

equipment and absorb cutting-

edge technology which will

enhance productivity and

improve resource utilisation. If

this investment is not done now,

Suven Pharma, over the next

few years, will not be able to

meet customers, regulatory and

technological requirements. In a

nutshell, we are not investing for

returns, we are investing for our

sustainability.

managing director has

been identified as being the Chief Operating Decision

Maker. Refer note 30 for the segment information

presented.

d) Foreign currency translation

(i) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the standalone financial statements

are measured using the currency of the primary

economic environment in which the entity operates

('the functional currency'). The financial statements

are presented in Indian rupee (INR), which is

Company's functional and presentation currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into

the functional currency using the exchange rates

at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange

gains and losses resulting from the settlement

of such transactions and from the translation of

monetary assets and liabilities denominated in

foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are

generally recognised in profit or loss. They are

deferred in equity if they relate to qualifying cash

flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges

or are attributable to part of the net investment

in a foreign operation. A monetary item for which

settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in

the foreseeable future is considered as a part of the

entity's net investment in that foreign operation.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair

value in a foreign currency are translated using the

exchange rates at the date when the fair value was

determined. Translation differences on assets and

liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of

the fair value gain or loss. For example, translation

differences on non- monetary assets and liabilities

such as equity instruments held at fair value

through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss

as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation

differences on non-monetary assets such as equity

investments classified as FVOCI are recognised in

other comprehensive income.

e) Fair value measurement

The Company measures financial instruments, such as,

derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an

asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction

between market participants at the measurement date.

The fair value measurement is based on the presumption

that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the

liability takes place either:

•

In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

•

In the absence of a principal market, in the most

advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must be

accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using

the assumptions that market participants would use

when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market

participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes

into account a market participant’s ability to generate

economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and

best use or by selling it to another market participant

that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are

appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient

data are available to measure fair value, maximising the

use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use

of unobservable inputs.:
