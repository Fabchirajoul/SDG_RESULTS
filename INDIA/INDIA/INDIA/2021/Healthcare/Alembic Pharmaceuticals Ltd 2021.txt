Dear Stakeholders,

We hope that you have been safe

and healthy through this singular

and unprecedented challenge that

humanity is faced with today. Although

the demand for pharmaceuticals is

the least disrupted relative to other

industries, the operational challenges

remain enormous. Last financial

year was indeed the demonstration

of our resilient business model.

As we overcame the challenges, we

continued to achieve growth across all

our geographies and segments.

In 2020-21, our overall revenue

grew by 17% to `5,393 Crores.

We saw growth across all our

business divisions and in particular

the International Formulations

business (Ex-USA) and API business

demonstrated solid double-digit

growth. This performance was

possible due to our commitment

to delivering quality products,

maintaining the highest levels of

compliance, promoting manufacturing

excellence and improving our

supply chain.

Amid the pandemic and challenges

thrown open by it, the global

pharmaceutical industry responded

with agility. Since March 2020, the

industry has been hit with debilitating

restrictions and impediments in

reaching customers and supplying

drugs to India and the world. However,

the pharmaceutical industry has

surpassed expectations in response

to this global crisis, supplying drugs to

over 150 countries besides meeting all

domestic demands.
