SPEAkS ON HOW CAPLIN HAS ENHANCED

SHAREHOLDER vALuE

Caplin has created a

validated value-accretive

model: profitable growth,

sustained reinvestment,

growing scale, each

subsequent project more

profitable than the other and

attractively short payback

tenures

Caplin Point entered Latin America

to address the under-penetration of

affordable,

accessible

and

available

pharmaceutical products. We continue to

stick true to this philosophy by creating

and capturing value at the bottom of the

pyramid. Even today, much of Caplin’s

growth comes from the smaller markets

of Latin America, while we gradually

move to larger markets such as Mexico,

Chile, Colombia and Brazil, as part of our

contiguous expansion in the region.

Our business today is de-risked because

of our presence in multiple countries

and having a wide array of customers.

We reach over 14,000 Points Of Sale in

Latin America on a daily basis. Why we call

this de-risked is because we don’t have

a handful of customers that we’re over-

reliant on, and we’re also not over-reliant

on a single market giving us majority of the

revenues.

We’re actively working on establishing and

promoting QueTenX, which is our healthcare

portal that automates Pharmacies and

Distributors in the countries of our

presence. We’re glad to say that we have

over 1000 unique customers on our

portal generating over 6700 sale orders

regularly. We hope to expand QueTenX to

all countries of operation within the next

couple of years.

Our sales breakup is around 60% to

Wholesalers and smaller distributors, 20%

to Pharmacies and 20% to Institutions,

the latter going up marginally in the last

year due to Covid-related emergency

procurements from all countries. We’re

still at around 75/25 breakup when it

comes to Generics vs Branded Generics.

We expect this trend to continue for the

short to mid-term.

Some of the key areas we’re focusing on

to further augment profitable growth in the

current and newer markets of entry are:

-

Hospital Injectables

-

Psychotropic and Psychiatric products

-

Oncology products

-

Branded Pharmaceutical Softgels

-

Recently off patent niche Oral Solid

Dosages.

The R&D works for all the above are under

progress and we expect to make significant

inroads into these segments in the next 24

months.

“You are changing the definition of you.”

When I read this in a book, I learnt the

importance of change. When you change

the definition of your life, you are overriding

your genetic programming with all its

years of ingrained habit. This very thought

helped me understand the culture in Latin

America. Success came in bits and pieces

initially, however, the focus has always

been catering to the underprivileged,

which created the privilege of being the

No.1 Indian company in Central America.

It introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees.

Comapny as a Lessee (Operating Leases)

Effective April 01,2019 the company had adopted Ind AS 116 “Leases” and applied the same to the lease contracts existing on April 01,2019 using the

modified retrospective approach. This has resulted in recognizing Right of Use Assets and Lease Liability as on 1st April, 2019 to the extent of Rs. 1.10

Crs each. The adoption of this Standard does not have any material impact on the financial results for the year and there is no impact on the opening

retained earnings on adopting this approach. The Company has used a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. Operating

leases are mainly in the nature of lease of office premises with no restrictions and are renewable / cancellable at the option of either of the parties.

There are no sub-leases. There are no restrictions imposed by the lease arrangements.

The Company recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The

cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease

payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred, if any. The right-of-use

assets is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use

assets is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.

The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily

determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease by lease basis,

may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease liability

is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease

payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications. The Company has elected not to apply the

requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying

asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.:
