The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has

thrown up several challenges

for businesses globally. For the

pharmaceutical sector, these

challenges turned out to be volatile

and with unprecedented levels of

disruption. Companies went the extra

mile to ensure that manufacturing and

distribution of medicines continued

uninterrupted, despite an uncertain and

unpredictable operating environment.

Rising to the occasion, we swiftly

devised an agile roadmap and a

response framework that enabled

us to deliver on our purpose even

through the most challenging phases

of the crisis. We stood as committed

as ever to ensure that patients’ access

to healthcare not only remained

continuous and sustained, but was

accelerated further, lending us an

opportunity to provide hope to them as

they continue to trust us during their

most difficult times.

Accelerating

Access.

Delivering

Hope.:

Dear Shareholders,

2020 was an extraordinary and challenging year for all of us.

Despite the challenges, your Company remained resilient and

focussed on our strategic priorities. Our endeavour was to

improve the quality of human life by helping people do more,

feel better and live longer.

Over the course of the year, our learnings and investments

in people and technology gave us an opportunity to enhance

access to our focus brands and prepare us for future

product launches. Our business continuity measures ensured

consistent growth of our focus brands, with Augmentin,

Betnovate, Calpol, Ceftum, and Synflorix featuring among the

top brands in the Indian Pharmaceuticals Market (IPM).

Your Company also continued to lead the private market in

the vaccines segment with its diversified portfolio to protect

children, adolescents and adults. Despite the headwinds

caused by COVID-19, the vaccines business bounced

back to pre-COVID performance in the last quarter of

2020. Your Company launched the tetravalent influenza

Northern Hemisphere vaccine (Fluarix Tetra NH 2020-21)

in September 2020 and garnered 35% volume share within

three months of launch, taking the second position in a market

occupied by four brands.

Equally, innovation for healthcare impact is at the heart of what

we do in India, exemplified by the recent launch of biologic

for Severe Eosinophilic Asthma – Nucala. To further enable

treatment continuity owing to restrictions and challenges faced

by patients due to the pandemic, your Company launched

“Nucala home administration programme”. This initiative has

been a huge saviour for patients during these times.

While your Company’s patient-centric approach remained

unshakeable as ever, we also prioritised those who make the

realisation of our purpose possible – our employees – as we

continued to support them with various initiatives focussing on

their health and wellbeing. During the lockdown, your Company

focussed on skill enhancement of employees – particularly

the field-force – to give them a competitive edge in the ‘new

normal’ business context.

The pandemic has revealed opportunities to partner with

governments and help support the national health goals of

India. Your Company’s parent organisation, GSK plc, has

entered into an in-principle global partnership with Novavax

to produce up to 60 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

It is also working with Sanofi and Medicago to harness the

adjuvant technology in developing COVID-19 vaccines while

also collaborating with CureVac to develop mRNA vaccines

which have the potential to address multiple COVID-19

variants that are emerging across the world.

Your Company has shown remarkable agility and resilience

throughout the year in unprecedented circumstances. This

has included hundreds of colleagues who have continued

to work in the Nashik manufacturing site throughout the

pandemic to ensure that vital medicines continued to be

manufactured so as to reach patients.

I want to thank our remarkable workforce and our partners, for

without them we would have not succeeded.

Mumbai, May 18, 2021:

Managing Director of the Company has been identified as CODM and

he is responsible for allocating the resources, assess the financial performance and position of the Company and

makes strategic decisions.

The Company has identified one reportable segment “Pharmaceuticals” based on the information reviewed by the

CODM. Refer note 50 for segment information presented.

t)

Provision and contingent liabilities

A provision is recognised if as a result of a past event, the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive)

that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle

the obligation. Provisions are recognised at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present

obligation at the balance sheet date. If the effect of time value of money is material, provisions are discounted

using a current pre tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the

provision due to passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.

A contingent liability exists when there is a possible but not probable obligation, or a present obligation that

may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources, or a present obligation whose amount cannot be

estimated reliably. Contingent liabilities do not warrant provisions but are disclosed unless the possibility of outflow

of resources is remote.

Standards issued but not yet effective

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards. There is no

such notification which would have been applicable to the Company from April 1, 2021.:

letter dated May 4, 2011 called upon the Company

to discharge the entire liability, including upto date interest calculated at 15% p.a., and has vide: letter dated October 10, 2011,

raised a demand on the Company for the interest amount amounting to ` 247,44 lakhs. Without prejudice to the position that

interest is not payable, the Company has recognized a provision of ` 247,44 lakhs in respect of the Government’s claim for

interest in 2011. The Company has filed a writ petition at Delhi High Court against the above demand which has been admitted.

The Company also filed stay applications which have been dismissed and has filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the

Supreme Court for stay of the interest demand until final determination of the writ petition filed in the Delhi High Court. The

Supreme Court on hearing the above SLP, passed an order on April 3, 2012. The said order stayed the Demand Notice dated

October 10, 2011 during the pendency of the writ petition at the Delhi High Court subject to the Company depositing ` 136,82

lakhs in three equal installments within six month’s time from the date of order. All three instalments have been deposited with

the Government as of date. The Supreme Court, vide its order dated October 5, 2012, directed the Delhi High Court to dispose

of the writ petition as expeditiously as possible. The Company’s counsel has been routinely appearing in the matter and urging

the Delhi High Court to hear the matter expeditiously considering it is at final hearing stage and has been pending for a long

time. The counsel has also cited the significant sums involved; however, the Court is not inclined to take this matter out of turn

and is currently hearing urgent matters only due to the ongoing Covid 19 situation. Next date of the matter is July 15, 2021.

NOTE 42 : MATTERS IN RESPECT OF ERSTWHILE BURROUGHS WELLCOME (INDIA) LIMITED (BWIL):

(i)

The Government of India, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers, New Delhi, passed a final order on July 21, 1993,

directing erstwhile BWIL to pay an amount of ` 1,91.15 lakhs along with interest due thereon from the date of default into

the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account (DPEA) in respect of a bulk drug procured by erstwhile BWIL during the period

April 1981 to April 1983.

Erstwhile BWIL filed a writ petition in August 1993 which was admitted by the Bombay High Court. After hearing both

the parties, the High Court granted an interim injunction restraining the Government of India from taking any action in

furtherance of and/or implementation of the order dated July 21, 1993 or from in any manner seeking to compel erstwhile

BWIL to deposit any amount into the DPEA, pending the hearing and final disposal of the petition on the condition that

erstwhile BWIL furnishes a bank guarantee for ` 2,00 lakhs from a nationalised bank and undertakes to pay the amount

demanded with interest at the rate of 20% per annum in case the petition fails.

Erstwhile BWIL had accordingly furnished the required bank guarantee. If calculated on the basis of correct data, taking

into account set offs claimable for earlier years for which data has been provided by erstwhile BWIL, no amount will be

payable by the Company and accordingly no provision in that respect is considered necessary. The Company’s stand

Managing Director and three whole time Directors amounting to ` 10.93 lakhs for

the year ended August 31, 1986, which was in accordance with the minimum remuneration provided in the agreements

entered into with them prior to erstwhile BWIL becoming public, which required such Government of India’s sanction.

The approval is still awaited.

NOTE 43 : MATTERS IN RESPECT OF ERSTWHILE SMITHKLINE BEECHAM (INDIA) LIMITED:

(i)

` 1,44.44 lakhs received from Beckman Instruments International S.A. on account of disputed alleged additional

commission has been included under non-current provisions and Income tax paid thereon aggregating ` 64.77 lakhs has

been included under other non-current assets. The Company is contesting the matter with the concerned authorities.

(ii)

Refund of surtax ` 96.81 lakhs, and interest thereon amounting to ` 48.52 lakhs, received during 1994, have not been

adjusted against the provision for tax in the books of accounts and recognised as income respectively, since the Income

tax department had filed a reference application against the income tax tribunal’s order which was pending before the

High Court of Karnataka. The Company has received an order dated April 18, 2007 from the High Court of Karnataka

which is partially in the Company’s favour. On the basis of the aforesaid order, Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT),

Bangalore will pass an order giving directions. On receipt of the ITAT order, the Company will take appropriate steps in

the matter.

Mumbai, May 18, 2021:

letter dated 20th/24th August, 1998 from

the Central Government demanding an amount of ` 4,40,79,918

comprising ` 1,42,74,110 in respect of prices relating to Salbutamol

formulations during the period April, 1979 to December, 1983 with

interest thereon amounting to ` 2,98,05,808 upto 31st July, 1998. The

Company had been legally advised that the demand of ` 1,42,74,110

is not sustainable and it, therefore follows that the interest demand

also cannot be sustained. The total demand has been challenged

by the Company in a Writ Petition filed in the Bombay High Court.

The Bombay High Court has granted an interim stay of the demand,

subject to the Company depositing 50% of the principal amount.

Accordingly, the Company has deposited an amount of ` 71,50,000

with the Government on 3rd May, 1999. This is a normal interim order

passed by the High court in such matters and does not in any way

reflect upon the merits or otherwise of the case. The amount will be

refunded if the Company succeeds at the final hearing of the matter.

The Government’s application in the Supreme Court praying that this

writ petition be transferred to the Supreme Court from the Bombay

High Court was not allowed and the Company’s writ petition will now be

heard by the Bombay High Court.
