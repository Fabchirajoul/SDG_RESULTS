Managing Director's Statement

Doing The Right Thing,

The Right Way!

Dear Shareholder,

I hope that you and your family are in good health.

The pandemic has severely impacted the economy in more

than 216 countries including India. In light of this global

challenge, the pharmaceutical industry has expanded its

research into COVID-19 at an unprecedented pace.

AstraZeneca’s core values focus on following the science,

putting patients first and doing the right thing. When

AstraZeneca PLC, UK partnered with the University of Oxford

in the landmark journey, these values were in focus. This

helped stitch together the partnership in record time as its

values matched, and they committed to ensuring that they

would access as many patients across the world as possible.

The company* was clear from the start that this was not for

profit and was for equitable access. A number of alliances

also worked for this – Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness,

GAVI, etc. and were supported by foundations like Gates

Foundation. These partnerships ensure that the delivery of

the vaccine started across the world, especially in low-income

regions like West Africa. Partnerships with Serum Institute

in India and similar ones in Korea, Brazil, Russia, and others

were established to ensure that there are enough vaccines.

Thus trials, partnerships with producers, agreements with

governments all took place simultaneously. The company

quickly supplied vaccines to 130 countries and 400 million

doses had been administered by early June. This was the most

by any vaccine producer.

We achieved remarkable pipeline and regulatory performances

in 2020, with 10 approvals of new medicines or life-cycle

management indications in major markets. Despite the

occasional setback, considering the situation, we were able

to secure 3 major approvals with Dapa-HF and Dapa CKD in

CVRM, FASENRA in Severe Asthma, Tagrisso ADAURA (for

adjuvant treatment after complete tumour resection in patients

with NSCLC whose tumours have EGFR mutations) and

Calquence for CLL. With this, we created the next wave of our

innovative pipeline, ensuring the sustainable delivery of new

products. We have been able to get 17 clinical trial application

approvals in India; thereby, bringing in novel therapeutic

options in a clinical setting for patients with an unmet need.

At such a time, digital technologies play an important role.

We were successful in identifying the gap in patient-healthcare

professional (HCP) connect and developed tangible solutions.

Activation of Virtual Patient Care Management Services as

part of beyond-the-pill solution supported with EMR and

Telemedicine Services enabled better connect between HCPs

and patients during the period of restricted access to physical

clinics. We also initiated patient education campaigns via our

e-Pharma partners across social media channels. We invested

in a stronger digital ecosystem that enabled virtual connects

between our representatives and HCPs, online consultations

for patients and timely delivery of life-saving drugs at the

patient’s doorstep.

"The consistent achievements in the

pipeline, accelerating performance of our

business, the extraordinary commitment

of our people and continued supply of

our medicines played an important role

in fuelling our overarching objective

of ‘No patients left behind’. We are the

fastest growing company in Oncology

at 150% and 3rd biggest Oncology

brand in India".

Annual Report 2020-21

Corporate Overview

Statutory Reports

Financial Statements:

letter dated March 1,

2014, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals AB, the promoter of the

Company had proposed a voluntary delisting of the Company’s

equity shares from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the

Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Such proposed delisting was

subject to an on-going inquiry with Securities Exchange Board

of India (SEBI). During the year, SEBI completed the inquiry and

issued an order dated June 5, 2020. The Company has filed

a: letter with the NSE and BSE on June 8, 2020 clarifying that

the Company is not a noticee in the aforesaid order and being

a target company in the delisting process, has no stake in the

delisting proposal other than to comply with the mandatory

requirements under Delisting Regulations and the procedures

prescribed thereunder and the applicable provisions of the

Companies Act, 2013.

44 Grant of Exclusive Distribution Rights

The Company had entered into a distribution agreement

(the 'agreement') with a customer for specified products

(“Products”). Pursuant to this agreement, during the current

year ended March 31, 2021 an upfront fee of ` 50.0 (2020:

` NIL) was received from the customer towards marketing

and promotion already carried out by the Company in order

to create market presence for the products. Management

determined that such marketing and promotion was a distinct

service provided to the customer. The said upfront fee met the

point in time recognition criteria as per Ind AS 115 and was

recognised separately from the sale of products envisaged in

the agreement.

The Company has an agreement with an overseas group

company to receive reimbursement of certain costs incurred

for the marketing and promotion for launch of new products,

net of any upfront fee received by the Company from its

customers. During the current year ended March 31, 2021,

the Company incurred an aggregate expense of ` 40.1 (2020:

` NIL) towards marketing and promotion of new products

and accounted such expense under appropriate headings in

the Statement of Profit and Loss. The aforesaid upfront fees

received from the customer exceeds the aggregate expense

incurred towards marketing and promotion of new products

during the year and hence such expenses were not billed to the

group Company.

45 Provident Fund - Supreme Court Judgement

The Company has evaluated the impact of Supreme Court

(“SC”) judgement dated February 28, 2019 in the case of

Regional Provident Fund Commissioner (II) West Bengal v/s

Vivekananda Vidyamandir and Others, in relation to exclusion

of certain allowances from the definition of “basic wages”

of the relevant employees for the purposes of determining

contribution to Provident Fund (“PF”) under the Employees’

Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. There

are interpretation issues relating to the said SC judgement.

Based on such evaluation, management has concluded that

affect of the aforesaid judgement on the Company is not

material and accordingly, no provision has been made in the

financial statements.

46 Impact of COVID-19 pandemic
