Our Annual Report cover is a creative representation. Sun Pharma strictly follows all Covid-19 protocols and strongly

recommends that everyone wears a mask during the pandemic.

Managing Director’s Message: Dear Shareholders,

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted economies across the

world and the pharmaceutical industry is at the forefront in

the fight against the global pandemic. The industry has quickly

adapted itself to the changed dynamics and has ensured

continuity of supply so that patients continue to get access

to their medications. The industry has also stepped in to

supply medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 symptoms

and other associated ailments. Some of the pharmaceutical

companies have developed COVID-19 vaccines in record time.

The pandemic is accelerating a significant change across the

healthcare ecosystem in various countries and forcing public

and private health systems to adapt and innovate at a pace like

never before.

Governments across the world have increased spending on

healthcare to counter the pandemic. There is also an increasing

realisation in middle and low income economies that healthcare

related investments need to be increased, which will lead to

better/earlier diagnosis and appropriate treatment for patients.

Another area of focus is making the supply chain resilient. This

will require striking a pragmatic balance between outsourcing

and self-sufficiency. Recognising the important role of the

pharmaceutical industry and to strengthen its competitiveness,

the Government of India has floated Production-Linked

Incentive (PLI) Schemes. The objective of these schemes is

to enhance India’s manufacturing capabilities to meet global

scale apart from encouraging higher investment in R&D for

the development of innovative and complex products that will

enable the Indian pharmaceutical industry to meet the global

demand of pharmaceutical products.

Managing Director’s Message

and elective surgeries were postponed in many cases. Online

medical consultation could only partly compensate for face-to-

face interactions. This led to lower demand for pharmaceutical

products in the first half of the year and a gradual recovery was

witnessed only in the second half, as governments lifted the

lockdown restrictions.

It is against this backdrop that we reported a 2.5% growth in

our overall revenues which stood at ₹331 Billion for FY21. Last

year’s sales included a one-time special business in the US and

hence, while the US business showed a decline, all our other

businesses have recorded growth for the full year despite the

challenges related to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Our EBITDA for the year grew by 25.5% driven by better

product mix, efficiency initiatives and reduced marketing, selling

and distribution and travelling expenses across markets. Some

of these cost savings can be termed as temporary in nature and

are mainly related to the pandemic restrictions and may reverse

over a period of time as the COVID-19 situation normalises.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE

For FY21, India formulation sales stood at ₹103 Billion, up 6.5%

and accounted for about 31% of overall revenues. Our India

business has outperformed the average industry growth, driven

by our leading presence in chronic segments coupled with our

strong brand equity with doctors. As per AIOCD AWACS March

2021 data, we have witnessed an increase in our market share to

8.2% on MAT basis compared to 8.1% in the previous year.

As per SMSRC data for February 2021, Sun Pharma is ranked

No. 1 by prescriptions with 10 different classes of doctors.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued our new

launches momentum with 96 new introductions in India.

The field force expansion undertaken in Q4 of last year, was

completed during the year and the new medical representatives

have commenced their field work. Our field force strength now

stands at 10,900+.

Revenues in the US declined by about 4% to ₹101 Billion and

accounted for approximately 30% of our consolidated revenues

for FY21. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, we witnessed

a ramp-up in sales of our specialty products for the year. The

generics business continued to face price erosion, driven by

the competitive intensity amongst manufacturers, buying

consortium pressures and a higher pace of generic approvals

from the USFDA. Our subsidiary, Taro, recorded about 15%

decline in overall revenues to US$549 Million for the year.

We grew by 5% in Emerging Markets (EM) for the year.

The Y-o-Y depreciation of some EM currencies has reduced

our reported growth. The constant currency growth for EM

revenues was about 6.4% for the year.

Our sales in the rest of world (RoW) markets grew by 6.6%

for the year, driven by some key Western European markets,

Canada and Australia.

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (R&D)

Our R&D investments for the year were approximately ₹21

Billion at 6.5% of overall sales. During the year, we continued

our R&D efforts to develop complex generics and innovative

specialty products. Some of the clinical trials for our specialty

products witnessed a delay of a few months during the year

due to the pandemic, and have gained momentum after the

lockdowns were lifted gradually. Investments for developing the

long-term specialty pipeline are expected to continue.

We continue to invest in R&D related to our global generic

business, for developing and filing products across markets.

At Sun Pharma, we have multiple R&D centres and a strong

R&D team to cater to these requirements. We continue to be

disciplined in identifying future R&D projects for the US generics

market, with the focus being on developing complex products,

which may attract less competition.

SPECIALTY BUSINESS PERFORMANCE

We are enthused by the momentum of our global specialty

business which grew by 11% to US$475 Million during the

year despite the various challenges resulting from the global

pandemic. Global Ilumya sales grew by 51% over last year to

touch US$143 Million in FY21.

The first half of FY21 witnessed temporary closure of doctor

clinics in the US because of the lockdown restrictions (to

counter the pandemic), resulting in reduction in patient footfalls

and postponement of certain treatments. This impacted our

specialty sales in the first half, including sales of Ilumya, Cequa

and Levulan. It also impacted the ramp-up of Absorica LD, which

we had launched in February 2020. The lockdown restrictions

were gradually lifted in the second half, resulting in a recovery

in our specialty sales. Post the close of the year, a generic for

Absorica entered the market in April 2021.

PROGRESS ON SPECIALTY INITIATIVES

Key initiatives during the year for the specialty business include:

1.

Presented positive results from the ILUMYA® five-year

study, which demonstrated that patients with moderate-to-

severe plaque psoriasis who continued to receive ILUMYA®

through five years of continuous treatment, maintained

consistent and extensive skin clearance with no new safety

issues, regardless of baseline level of skin disease, age or

background illnesses.

2.

Launched ILUMYA® in Japan

3.

Expanding market presence for ILUMYA – During the

year, Sun Pharma entered into an exclusive licensing and

distribution agreement for ILUMYA™ with Hikma for the

Middle East & North Africa (MENA) region.

4.

Presented clinical data analysis for ODOMZO and

LEVULAN KERASTICK – Long-term analyses of the

ODOMZO clinical study confirmed that treatment with

ODOMZO provided clinically meaningful outcomes

to patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma

(laBCC) who were taking common concomitant medicines,

such as medicines for cardiovascular, inflammatory and

auto-immune diseases. For LEVULAN KERASTICK +

BLU-U, a post hoc analysis of the Phase 3 trial showed

significantly greater clearance of lesions and a significantly

larger percent of cumulative disease area cleared with no

clinically significant adverse events.

Note 1: The Bonus of previous year was paid in the current year and the same was reflected in his current year’s Form 16. However, no such

component was there in the Form 16 for FY 20 as in the year previous to FY 20 (i.e. FY 19), Mr. Dilip Shanghvi was paid only `1/- towards

remuneration. Accordingly, on comparison of remuneration as per Form 16 of FY 20 and FY 21, the increase comes to 37.20%, however the

actual increase in Mr. Dilip Shanghvi’s total remuneration (basis CTC) for FY 21 was 7%.

Note 2: The Bonus of previous year was paid in the current year and the same was reflected in his current year’s Form 16. Hence, on

comparison of remuneration as per Form 16 of FY 20 and FY 21, the increase comes to 12.59%, however the actual increase in Mr. Sailesh T.

Note 3: In the FY 20, the remuneration of Mr. Kalyanasundaram Subramanian was for part of the year w.e.f. July 04, 2019 and in FY 21, he

has received remuneration for the full year. Further, Bonus and Leave Encashment of previous year paid in the current year and the same

was reflected in his current year’s Form 16. Hence, on comparison of remuneration as per Form 16 of FY 20 and FY 21, the increase comes

to 46.30%, however the actual increase in Mr. Kalyanasundaram Subramanian’s total remuneration (basis CTC) for the FY 21 was 4.48%.

Note 4: Mr. Sudhir Valia had stepped down from the position of Whole-time Director of the Company with effect from May 29, 2019 and

he became a Non-Executive Non-Independent Director of the Company thereafter. The amounts paid to him in the FY20 and FY21 are not

comparable as in FY 20, he was paid a remuneration for part of the year including an amount towards full and final settlement and sitting

fees for the meetings he attended during the FY 20, as Non-Executive Director as against in FY 21, he was paid only the sitting fees.

Note 5: The percentage increase as mentioned above in the remuneration of Mr. C.S. Muralidharan and Mr. Sunil Ajmera are calculated

on the basis of their respective Form 16 for FY 20 as compared to FY 21 and is due to Bonus of the previous year paid in the current year,

however the actual increase in their total remuneration (basis CTC) for the FY 21 was 5.20% and 5.80% respectively.

ANNEXURE ‘A’ TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

DECLARATION OF COMPLAINCE WITH CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2021

I, Dilip S. Shanghvi,: Managing

Message from the Director’s Desk

We are living in times where unpredictability is the

new normal. From disruptive virus strains to political

uncertainties, extreme climate conditions to fast

technological changes, the future seems unforeseeable.

What we can see very clearly though is the importance of

health - human, economic as well as environmental health.

Sustainability of every resource will be the key to survive

and thrive in the midst of volatility.

While in the middle of the second wave of the Covid-19

pandemic, the healthcare industry including the

pharmaceutical companies and the medical fraternity are

trying their best to flatten the curve of rising infection

cases, accelerate vaccination and test more innovative

drugs and solutions to counter the newer Covid-19 variants.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS

Sun Pharma has focussed on a multi-pronged approach to

overcome the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic which

includes (i) Maintaining manufacturing continuity to ensure

regular supply of medicines to customers/patients across

the world, (ii) Supporting the Government of India in its

fight against the pandemic by donating COVID-19 specific

medicines, hand sanitisers, masks and PPE Kits, (iii) Focus

on safety and well-being of our employees across all our

offices, R&D centres and manufacturing units. In addition,

our products like Remdesivir, Itolizumab, Favipiravir,

Liposomal Amphotericin B, etc. are used in treating

COVID-19 and associated ailments.

We also thank all the frontline warriors for their invaluable

contribution in the fight against pandemic, our employees

for their selfless and tireless efforts to serve the community

and ensuring continued production of all medicines during

this challenging period.

With healthcare going to remain the lynchpin,

pharmaceutical companies would continue to play a

key role. As the world’s 4th largest speciality generic

pharmaceutical company, the onus is to make more and

more high-quality medicines affordable and accessible.

Making these twin purposes possible will be innovation

and expanding our footprint, coupled with increasing

our community outreach and reducing our environment

footprint. This holistic outlook would surely lead us to a

more sustainable future.

This extends to a triple bottom line approach where we

extend the philosophy of enhancing the quality of life by

focussing on Employee Wellness, Community Wellness and

Environment Wellness.

EMPLOYEE WELLNESS

Our multi-cultural team is our most valuable asset. Diverse

cultural perspectives inspire creativity and drive innovation.

With a total strength of 37,000+ employees at consolidated

level, we invest our energy in engaging, nurturing and

motivating them to grow. Our comprehensive Human

Resources (HR) Policy covers the whole gamut of employee

management, from recruitment to retention.

We continue to invest in their professional growth and

to inculcate the value of responsible growth in them.

So, they understand that their progress is linked with

providing innovative solutions to address patient’s needs,

community’s upliftment and environment’s protection.

FY21 saw the safety and skill up-gradation training of

approximately 92% of our total employees, including 31% of

permanent women employees.

COMMUNITY WELLNESS

While making medicines more accessible and affordable is

our purpose, we push the envelope further by enhancing

our efforts to mainstream the socially marginalised.

Healthcare, education, infrastructure & rural development,

safe drinking water & sanitation, environment conservation

and disaster relief are some of our key priorities enunciated

in our comprehensive Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

Policy.

We continue to undertake various local level community

programmes based on the needs of the society, while also

contributing to national interests. During the Covid-19

outbreak, we committed monetary, medical and material

support to contribute in India’s pandemic response. In FY21,

we invested `269.5 Million for the implementation of CSR

projects.

ENVIRONMENT WELLNESS

At Sun Pharma, we are fully committed to achieve

excellence in Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) and

conduct our activities in the most responsible manner. The

importance of EHS is continually stressed and extensively

promoted as a part of our corporate culture. A robust EHS

policy enunciates our commitment to create a safe and

healthy workplace, and a clean environment for employees

and the community at large.

The USFDA, on January 23, 2014, had prohibited using API manufactured at Toansa facility for manufacture of

finished drug products intended for distribution in the U.S. market. Consequentially, the Toansa manufacturing facility

was subject to certain provisions of the consent decree of permanent injunction entered in January 2012 by erstwhile

Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd (which was merged with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd in March 2015). In addition, the

Department of Justice of the USA (‘US DOJ’), United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey had also

issued an administrative subpoena dated March 13, 2014 seeking information. The Company continues to fully co-

operate and provide requisite information to the US DOJ.

In December 2019, the USFDA inspected the Halol facility and issued Form 483 with 8 observations. Post the

submission of the company’s response in January 2020, the USFDA classified the inspection status as Official Action

Indicated (OAI). The company was in continuous communication with the USFDA to resolve the outstanding issues

and is awaiting a re-inspection by USFDA to resolve the OAI status. However, due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic

and travel restrictions, the re-inspection is delayed. The Company continues to manufacture and distribute products

to the U.S from this facility. However, the OAI status normally implies that the USFDA may put all new approvals from

the Halol facility on hold till the OAI status is changed.

In September 2013, the USFDA had put the Mohali facility under import alert and was also subjected to certain

provisions of the consent decree of permanent injunction entered in January 2012 by erstwhile Ranbaxy Laboratories

Ltd (which was merged with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd in March 2015). In March 2017, the USFDA lifted the

import alert and indicated that the facility was in compliance with the requirements of cGMP provisions mentioned
