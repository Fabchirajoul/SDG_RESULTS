Dear Shareholders,

The last year saw India and the rest of the world

begin to recover from the substantial disruptions

caused by COVID-19 but with the repeating waves of

the pandemic and the recent geo-political tensions,

it is likely that the business environment will remain

volatile for some more time. Despite this, it is indeed

encouraging to note that in the long-term, India

continues to raise expectations of being amongst

the fastest growing economies in the world. The

pandemic highlighted the shortcomings in India’s

healthcare infrastructure and the government has

already increased the outlay to build capabilities

for the future. All this augers well for the Indian

pharmaceutical industry.

Through all the uncertainties, it was heartening to see

organisations with a clear purpose and responsible

leadership continue to rapidly reinvent themselves

and stay future relevant.: Dear Shareholders,

At Sanofi, our determination to find answers for patients

motivates us to develop breakthrough solutions that

make life better for patients, partners, communities,

and our own people. We believe that cutting-edge

science and manufacturing, fuelled by data and digital

technologies, have the potential to transform the

practice of medicine, turning the impossible into possible

for millions of people around the world. This quest is

captured in our new, unifying brand purpose, ‘We chase

the miracles of science to improve people’s lives’.

Through the pandemic, we have evolved and adjusted

our business models, introduced new medicines and

built future capabilities, while remaining obsessed about

our 3S priorities – Safety of employees and partners,

uninterrupted Supply of essential medicines and

continuously developing new ways to Serve our patients,

customers, partners and employees.

Our commitment in helping Diabetes patients was

reinforced with the successful launch of Toujeo® in

affordable cartridges and the breakthrough TouStar pen.

The expansion of our portfolio was supported by Saath7

(our flagship diabetes patient support programme),

whose milestone achievements, we have shared with you

in earlier annual reports. We continued to extend our

global brand Allegra with the launch Allegra® Nasal Duo.

Our long-term commitment to society and our

communities was further augmented through our

CSR programmes implemented during the year.

We expanded our initiatives in the area of Non-

Communicable diseases, while stepping up specific

support needed for pandemic related relief efforts.

During the year, your Company has successfully

implemented a variety of transformational initiatives

to deliver market-beating growth in key therapies,

thereby, significantly improving its overall financials.

During these challenging times, all its employees

have worked tirelessly to help patients manage

their disease effectively ensuring that there were

no major disruptions to the supplies or service to

its stakeholders.

Your Company has also pioneered several corporate

social responsibility initiatives to improve the

management of non-communicable diseases through

capacity building and education of stakeholders

and communities. As is well-known, your Company

transparently follows global ethical practices and

strictly adheres to the highest standards of corporate

governance. You will find more details of your

company’s activities in this report.

On behalf of all the Board members, I would like

to thank all the employees for their extraordinary

perseverance and commitment and all the other

stakeholders and shareholders for their trust in all

our endeavours.

Look forward to your continued support and best

wishes for your well-being.

Name

Mr. Rajaram Narayanan

Designation: Managing

Managing Director. The Directors and

senior management members affirm compliance with the Code of Ethics on annual basis.

The Company publishes the Business Responsibility Report in its Annual Report.

The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee of the Company is responsible for formulating,

implementing and monitoring the CSR Policy of the Company under the guidance of the Board. Managing

Director is a member of this Committee. The Committee meets at least twice a year to review progress on

hyperlink for viewing this report? How frequently it is published?

This Business Responsibility Report is a part of the Annual Report and can be accessed on the website of the

Company – www.sanofiindialtd.com.

SECTION E – PRINCIPLE-WISE PERFORMANCE

Principle 1: Businesses should conduct and

govern themselves with Ethics, Transparency

and Accountability

Sanofi’s Code of Ethics (http://www.codeofethics.

sanofi/) lays out the defining principles that guide each

employee of the Company on conducting business in

line with the highest ethical standards. The employees

of the Company are trained to use the Code of Ethics

as a part of their day-to-day functional responsibilities.

Key principles of Code of Ethics include:

A.

Respect & protection of people and

environment for a stimulating, creative & safe

working environment.

B.

Integrity in managing Company’s information

to protect and preserve competitiveness, image

& reputation.

C. Integrity in business practices to maintain trust in

relationships with the Company’s stakeholders —

patients, customers, shareholders, suppliers and

other business partners, and members of the civil

society — in which the Company operates.

Code of Ethics guides and inspires employees to make

the right decisions even when situations they are

facing are not governed by explicit rules, policies and

procedures of the Company. The Ethics & Business

Integrity Department, led by the Head of Ethics &

Business Integrity, is dedicated to raising awareness

on ethical conduct and to develop a range of resources

– including the Code of Ethics and ensure everyone

receives good training, to embed corporate ethics

and strive for excellence. Towards this end in 2021, a

handbook on ‘Leading with Integrity’ was developed

and issued to senior leaders in the organisation helping

them with information and practical tips on behaviours

to be exhibited to demonstrate their commitment to

Ethics and to lead their teams with integrity.

During the year, two special initiatives were undertaken

to increase awareness, capability and empowerment

amongst the employees and to keep the Company and

all its stakeholders protected from unmanaged risks,

thereby facilitating sustainable business operations.

1.

Leveraging on Sanofi Global’s push to encourage

employees in showing ethical behaviours, during

the year 2021, initiatives were rolled out in the

Company to provide detailed education to the

employees on risks that apply to pharmaceutical

companies, measures within the Company to

combat those risks, providing them with the tools

and resources to do risk assessment of their

initiatives, projects and campaigns, and created

a single point cross functional forum for guidance

and support.

2.

Company’s Legal and Ethics & Business Integrity

department came together to conduct awareness

sessions to help senior leaders of the Company

understand and adopt the Thoughtful Risk-Taking

approach in performance of their duties, so as to

ensure that due amount of consideration is given

to conscious and thoughtful risk management

and right stakeholders are consulted to enable

optimum risk taking with right amount of risk

mitigating actions in various initiatives undertaken.

Besides training the employees in demonstrating right

behaviours and considering the existence, nature

and impact of risks in their area of operations, the

employees are also trained through various online and

offline means and encouraged to help the Company to

identify areas and issues which may be exposing the

Company to legal, reputational or sustainability risks.

If an employee believes that a law, regulation or

one of the principles laid down in this Code of Ethics

has been or is about to be violated, he or she is

expected to inform his or her superior or the Ethics &

Business Integrity Department or e-mail to Chairman.

SILauditcommittee@sanofi.com of his or her concerns

regarding possible illegal practices or ethical violations.

To support this the Company also has established

a 24x7 Compliance Helpline which can be accessed

through Toll Free Number 0008004401286, or through

webpage: https://wrs.expolink.co.uk/ (access code:

sanofi) where employees can report incidents with

complete anonymity. Ethics & Business Integrity

Department also investigates the allegations reported,

with support from other functions, where necessary.

Any report that reveals fraud, a significant compliance

breach or a significant internal control weakness is

addressed by corrective action and/or disciplinary

action and/or legal proceedings.

Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods

and services that are safe and contribute to

sustainability throughout their life cycle

Sanofi aims to empower life of people by creating

awareness and supporting people facing health

challenges, so they can live life to its full potential.

Through a wide range of products and services, Sanofi

touches the lives of millions of patients every day.

Quality and Safety have been implemented across the

entire value chain of the Company, from raw materials

supplies to product delivery.

Cost-competitive processes, along with quality are

Sanofi’s primary goals. A significant proportion of

raw material, packaging material and excipients are

sourced locally from third party manufacturers. Many

of these have become suppliers who fully comply to the

framework of Sanofi’s standards which are often higher

than those dictated by regulatory bodies.

Since counterfeit products present a risk to patient

safety, the authenticity of the products is maintained

by using suitable security seals on the packaging along

with unique serialisation and QR Code. Over a period of

time these security measures will be implemented on

the whole portfolio of the Company.

During COVID-19 Pandemic, the Company faced minor

interruptions in the procurement of raw material:

Managing Director. The Company

organised various webinars on COVID-19 awareness

and precautionary measure for employees, family

members, hospitals teams and doctors. The Company

extended moral and financial support to employees

and family members who suffered from COVID-19 and

helped employees with critical COVID-19 infections

with hospital management across India. The Company

provided 3-ply surgical masks, sanitisers to its

employees, and emphasised on social distancing.

Principle 7: Businesses, when engaged in

influencing public and regulatory policy, should

do so in a responsible manner

The pharmaceutical sector is a highly-regulated

industry where government and administrative

authorities determine the rules governing research,

protection of intellectual property and reimbursement

policies, as well as procedures to obtain marketing

authorisation. Through its advocacy activities, Sanofi

takes part in policy debates affecting the regulatory

landscape and its business.

Sanofi engages in sustainable interactions with

governments and other stakeholders to work towards

the shared goal of improving access for the greatest

number of patients to the best medicines and

healthcare products; such interactions also contribute

to health information while preserving incentives for

research and innovation. It is transparent about its

lobbying activities, conducted in compliance with the

Sanofi Code of Ethics and Responsible Lobbying Policy.

The Company is member of the following

trade associations:

a)

Organisation of Pharmaceuticals Producers of India

(OPPI)

b)

Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and

Industry (FICCI)

c)

Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)

d)

Indo French Chamber of Commerce and Industry

(IFCCI)

e)

The Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry

of India (ASSOCHAM)

f)

g)

Sanofi works through the Trade Associations

for matters related to public good. Some broad

areas where it has worked include advocacy for

improving access to affordable healthcare through

sustainable business practices, predictable pricing

policy, development of an eco-system that supports

innovation & ethics.

Principle 8: Businesses should support inclusive

growth and equitable development

Sanofi India’s social impact strategy aims to build a

healthier, more resilient country by ensuring access to

quality healthcare for India’s underserved population.

Sanofi India is committed to improve access to

prevention, care, and treatment of Non- Communicable

Diseases (NCDs). By leveraging its core competencies

and resources, it is building capacity and capability

of sustainable healthcare systems to empower

communities to lead better quality lives.

Sanofi has implemented a detailed CSR Policy which

covers the three aspects:

a)

Access to healthcare

b)

Capacity building & awareness

c)

Employee volunteering

The key initiatives under CSR programme were:

1.

Public Private Partnership with the Health

Dept., Goa:

As per survey conducted with 14,957 students in

the 5-15 age group screened in Haryana, Goa,

Gujarat and Manipur, two in every 10 school

children suffer from hypertension (https://

timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/2-in-

every-10-schoolkids-suffer-from hypertension/

articleshow/67507403.cms) indicating that the risk

factors for Non- Communicable Disease (NCDs)

are high.

In February 2019, Sanofi signed a 3-year

partnership with the Government of Goa to build

awareness of Diabetes and its management, for

a better quality of life. Through this Corporate

Social Responsibility (CSR) collaboration, Sanofi’s

team of medical experts and diabetologists

educate and upskill the State department’s

healthcare personnel serving the Rashtriya Bal

Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) department, and

the Medical Officers of the Health and Wellness

centers. Alongside, Directorate of Health Services

also partnered Sanofi to run its international

programme KiDS (Kids and Diabetes in Schools),

to raise awareness of Diabetes amongst

school children.

The Public-Private Partnership between the State

of Goa and Sanofi follows a two-pronged approach.

One, where training on Diabetes management is

conducted for the staff (doctors, counselors and

Auxiliary Nurse Midwifes) at the RBSK cell and

the Medical Officers of the Health and Wellness

centres as a part of Ayushman Bharat. The other,

where education and engagement about Diabetes

amongst school children (10-15 years old),

teachers and parents, will help curtail the overall

disease burden on the State.

In 2021, programmes – Sakhar Free Shukrawar

and STEP were implemented to enable

behaviour change.

2.

Type 1 Diabetes programme:

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is also on increase

like type 2 diabetes, even though not in the same

proportion, but still with a trend of 3–5% increase/

year.

These patients (most often children) and their

families need a lifetime of intensive diabetes

education, multiple daily insulin injections, daily:
