Dear Shareholders,

The year 2020-21 has seen the

emergence of a health crisis caused

by the Covid-19 pandemic and has

been immensely challenging for

each one of us. The loss of lives

and livelihoods has left a lasting

pain, which is sure to leave an

indelible mark on us. My heart goes

out to everyone out there who has

suffered the loss of their loved one.

In responding to these challenges,

we were guided by our core

principles and we remained true

to our purpose of maintaining

sustainable operations. Being at

the forefront of the pharmaceutical

industry, Divi’s as a company in its

capacity has been contributing to

fight the pandemic since Day 1

and we continue to do our part in

helping communities around our

manufacturing units.

Over the course of the past 30

years, your Company has kept

its focus on the principle of

‘Sustained Growth’ making sure

that the leaps we take, contribute

positively to the continued rigor

of our operations. Our long-term

plan is founded on this purpose of

maintaining sustainability, which

has helped us scale our operations

over time. This has improved our

overall reach and has generated

greater value for our brand, as we

now head into a new decade as

one of the leaders in this industry.

The Year in Perspective – A

bird’s eye view

On

the

business

front,

your

Company has shown incredible

resilience

and

momentum

in response to the Covid-19

pandemic. It has been a year of

challenges and uncertainty and

we are proud of the relentless

commitment

and

dedication

of the entire Divi’s family. Our

agility, adaptability, resilience and

responsiveness to our customer

needs, earned us tremendous

goodwill

and

has

enhanced

our standing in the market. We

faced

operational

challenges

due to restricted movement and

disrupted supply lines during the

first few months of the pandemic,

in 2020. As the second wave

of the pandemic unfolded with

predictions of a third wave in the

near future, our focus continues

to be on our people’s health and

safety,

ensuring

uninterrupted

supplies of APIs to our customers.

Our

business

performance

in

the year is also a reflection of

the innate adaptability within the

company. The early months of the

pandemic brought disruption and

uncertainty to our business and

to all our customers, colleagues,

suppliers and shareholders. When

the worldwide lockdown disturbed

economic activity across virtually

all sectors, Divi’s responded with

speed and agility, embracing a

new operating model due to the

kind of expansion programmes we

undertook over the years. Despite

the intensity of the second wave of

Covid-19, we believe that we are in

a far better place as we complete

FY2021.

The Road Ahead - Purpose,

People, Planet

We are entering FY2022 powered

by strong sustainable strategies

and are more determined to keep

formulating robust strategies and

means to combat the challenges

thrown at us by the pandemic.

Our focus remains steadfast on

operating our assets and facilities

at full capacity, putting in place

our expansion plans and keeping

the safety of our employees at the

forefront.

I take immense pride in the way

our employees have demonstrated

strength, conviction and courage

during these difficult times and I

am indebted to each one of them

for having stood solidly behind the

company. Most importantly, I would

like to thank our shareholders, for

the overwhelming trust, support,

and confidence in Divi’s. Our

commitment to being a reliable

supplier, delivering quality APIs -

remains unchanged.

Managing Director

of the Company has been identified as being the

Chief Operating Decision Maker. Refer Note 36 for the

segment information presented.

2.3 Foreign currency translation:

(i)

Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of the

Company are measured using the currency of the

primary economic environment in which the entity

operates ('the functional currency'). The financial

statements are presented in Indian rupee (INR),

which is Divi's (the Company’s) functional and

presentation currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into

the functional currency using the exchange rates

at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange

gains and losses resulting from the settlement

of such transactions and from the translation of

monetary assets and liabilities denominated in

foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are

generally recognised in statement of profit and

loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair

value in a foreign currency are translated using the

exchange rates at the date when the fair value was

determined. Translation differences on assets and

liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of

the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on

non-monetary assets and liabilities such as equity

instruments held at fair value through profit or loss

are recognised in statement of profit and loss as

part of the fair value gain or loss and translation

differences on non-monetary assets such as equity

investments classified as FVOCI are recognised in

other comprehensive income.

2.4 Revenue recognition:

Revenue is measured at the transaction price

determined under IND AS 115- Revenue from contracts

with customers. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net

of returns, trade allowances, rebates, Goods & Service

Tax (GST) collections and amounts collected on behalf

of third parties.

(i)

Revenue from Sale of Goods:

Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when

the customer obtains control of the Company’s

product, which occurs at a point in time, usually

upon shipment, with payment terms typically in the

range of 60 to 180 days after invoicing depending

on product and geographic region. Taxes collected

from customers relating to product sales and

remitted to government authorities are excluded

from revenues.

The Company does not expect to have any

contracts where the period between the transfer

of the promised goods or services to the customer

and payment by the customer exceeds one year.

As a consequence, the company does not adjust

any of the transaction prices for the time value of

money.

For

contracts

with

multiple

performance

obligations, the Company allocates the transaction

price to each performance obligation based on the

relative standalone selling price. The Standalone

selling price of each performance obligation is

estimated using expected costs of satisfying such

performance obligation and then an appropriate

margin is added for such goods or services.

(ii) Revenue from Sale of Services:

Revenue from Sale of services is recognised as per

the terms of the contracts with customers when

the related services are performed, or the agreed

milestones are achieved.

(iii) Dividend Income:

Dividends are received from financial assets at

fair value through profit or loss. Dividends are

recognised as other income in profit or loss when

the right to receive payment is established. This

applies even if they are paid out of pre-acquisition

profits unless the dividend clearly represents a

recovery of part of the cost of the investment.:

Managing Director has been identified as Chief Operating Decision Maker(CODM). Operating segments are defined as components

of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available. This is evaluated regularly by the CODM, in deciding how to

allocate resources and assessing the Company’s performance. The company is engaged in the manufacture of Active Pharmaceutical

Ingredients (API’s), Intermediates and Nutraceutical Ingredients and operates in a single operating segment.

The reportable segments have been provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and therefore no separate

disclosure on segment information is given in this standalone financial statements.

Refer note 38 for the segment information presented.

2.3 Foreign currency translation:

(i)

Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the consolidated financial

statements of each of the group's entities are

measured using the currency of the primary

economic environment in which the entity operates

('the functional currency'). The consolidated

financial statements are presented in Indian rupee

(H), which is Divi's ( the Company’s) functional and

presentation currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into

the functional currency using the exchange rates

at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange

gains and losses resulting from the settlement

of such transactions and from the translation of

monetary assets and liabilities denominated in

foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are

generally recognised in statement of profit and loss.

A monetary item for which settlement is neither

planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future

is considered as a part of the entity’s net investment

in that foreign operation.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair

value in a foreign currency are translated using the

exchange rates at the date when the fair value was

determined. Translation differences on assets and

liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of

the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on

non- monetary assets and liabilities such as equity

instruments held at fair value through profit or loss

are recognised in statement of profit and loss as

part of the fair value gain or loss and translation

differences on non-monetary assets such as equity

investments classified as FVOCI are recognised in

other comprehensive income.

(iii) Group Companies

The results and financial position of foreign

operations (none of which has the currency of a

hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional

currency different from the presentation currency

are translated into the presentation currency as

follows:

•

assets and liabilities are translated at the closing

rate at the date of that balance sheet

•

income and expenses are translated at average

exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable

approximation of the cumulative effect of

the rates prevailing on the transaction dates,

in which case income and expenses are

translated at the dates of the transactions),

and

•

All

resulting

exchange differences are recognised in other

comprehensive income.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising

from the translation of any net investment in foreign

entities are recognised in other comprehensive

income. When a foreign operation is sold, the

associated exchange differences are reclassified to

profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale.

2.4 Revenue recognition:

Revenue is measured at the transaction price

determined under IND AS 115- Revenue from contracts

with customers. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net

of returns, trade allowances, rebates, Goods & Service

Tax (GST) collections and amounts collected on behalf

of third parties.

Revenue from Sale of Goods:

Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when

the customer obtains control of the Group’s

product, which occurs at a point in time, usually

upon shipment, with payment terms typically in the

range of 60 to 180 days after invoicing depending

on product and geographic region. Taxes collected

from customers relating to product sales and

remitted to government authorities are excluded

from revenues.

The Group does not expect to have any contracts

where the period between the transfer of the

promised goods or services to the customer and

payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a

consequence, the company does not adjust any of

the transaction prices for the time value of money.

price to each performance obligation based on the

relative standalone selling price. The Standalone

selling price of each performance obligation is

estimated using expected costs of satisfying such

performance obligation and then an appropriate

margin is added for such goods or services.

(ii) Revenue from Sale of Services:

Revenue from Sale of services is recognised as per

the terms of the contracts with customers when

the related services are performed, or the agreed

milestones are achieved.

(iii) Export incentives

Export incentives comprise of Duty draw back and

MEIS (Merchandise Exports Incentive scheme) scrips.

Duty drawback is recognised as income when

the right to receive credit as per the terms of the

scheme is established in respect of the exports

entitled for this benefit made and where there is

no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate

collection of the relevant export proceeds.

MEIS scrips are freely transferable and can be

utilised for the payment of customs duty. MEIS

scrips are recognised either on transfer/sale of

such scrips or when it is reasonably certain that

such scrips can be utilised against import duties.

(iv) Dividend Income:

Dividends are received from financial assets at

fair value through profit or loss. Dividends are

recognised as other income in profit or loss when

the right to receive payment is established. This

applies even if they are paid out of pre-acquisition

profits unless the dividend clearly represents a

recovery of part of the cost of the investment.

(v) Interest Income:

Interest income from financial assets at fair value

through profit or loss is disclosed as interest income

within other income. Interest income on financial

assets at amortised cost and financial assets at

FVOCI is calculated using the effective interest
