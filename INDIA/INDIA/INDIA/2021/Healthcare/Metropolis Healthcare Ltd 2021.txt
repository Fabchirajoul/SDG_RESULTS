letter froM MD’s Desk

MD’s Communique: Dear Shareholders,

India continues to battle a virulent second wave of the

COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare infrastructure is

straining to cope with the load of new cases. Aiding them

in this strenuous task, right from the beginning, are

medical laboratories which have undertaken the job of

responsible testing and diagnosis. We were one of the first

few labs to be commissioned for COVID-19 testing, and we

are proud to be at the forefront of this health crisis battle.

The COVID-19 pandemic bought along a fight never

witnessed by humanity. For Metropolis, we were able

to quickly fill with COVID facilities and fill the gap that

came with the disruption in the healthcare services. We

remained strong and unshaken, we found strategies for

doing business and I am sure we have now become more

confident and are ready to grow with strong determination

in future.

At Metropolis, resilience is in our DNA

and the entire Metropolis family is

working together with a deep sense

of urgency, passion, and commitment

to surf through this storm. The only

goal for our experienced team of

doctors and scientific team is to help

patients and doctors get a reliable

diagnosis as quickly as possible.

Most of the unorganised diagnostic sectors were

negatively affected this year as regular patients resisted

going to doctors and therefore diagnostic labs were

affected. Since these labs did not qualify to the COVID

testing, they were less visible and experienced by patients

during this time.

OUR FINANCIAl PERFORMANCE

Besides a being successful year for us in terms of taking

care of patients, I’m happy to announce it was also a year

of business for us as a Company. We recorded highest

ever yearly revenue, EBITDA and PAT in 2021. For FY21

revenue stood at ` 998 Crores as compared to ` 856

Crores in FY20, up by 17% YoY. Non-COVID revenue

contributed 77% of this revenue while COVID contributed

the rest 23% of the revenue in FY21. EBIDTA before CSR

and ESOP in FY21 stood at ` 301.1 Crores as compared

to ` 233.4 Crores in FY20, up by 29% YoY. EBITDA margin

before CSR and ESOP for FY21 expanded by 290 basis

points YoY to 30.2%. Margin expansion was attributable to

operating leverage benefits playing out due to increased

scale of business, better text mix and cost optimisation

initiative undertaken during FY21.

Our COVID-19 business via the B2C channel in focus and

seeding cities contributed 63%, while the revenue share of

non-COVID increased from 56% to 58% in FY21. We see a

big opportunity going into the next few years. The revenue

contribution of specialty test for non-COVID increased

from 37% a year before to 42% in FY21, increasing revenue

per test and making us even more relevant to patients’

treatment.

During the year, there was an expansion of home care

services owing to pandemic related lockdowns. This

resulted in revenue from non-COVID home care to

increase by 22% YoY to ` 80 Crores in FY21. When we

include COVID in the equation, our revenue from home

testing more than doubles to over ` 136 Crores.

When it comes to our customers, we have always believed

in servicing with sheer dedication. And to improve

customer experience, we revamped our app, website,

digital presence optimisation, and marketing efforts. As

a result, we saw 15x increase in website traffic, a 10x

increase in call volume, and faster growth and revenue

from home visits. For FY21, we reported patient visits of

9.8 Million, which was a down growth by 2% on YoY basis.

About 8 Lakh new customers experienced the service of

Metropolis for the first time to COVID tests. Out of which,

about 10% have already come back to Metropolis for

non-COVID tests. Our home visit business also helped us

move towards our increased B2C KPI and enjoy the better

market profile enhancing the overall profitability of the

Company.

We were the first private lab in the country to start testing

for COVID-19. With the best turn around time, continuous

medical engagement with doctors and government

authorities, strong branding and customer equity, we were

successful in churning out COVID-19 related tests. During

the year, our NACO contract was extended, a prestigious

PPP contract for us that enforces our confidence in our

scientific and on-ground execution capability.

Further, as a part of the inorganic growth strategy, we at

Metropolis try to acquire the unorganized players in the

market. However, sometimes we face issues with respect

to certain areas such as Due diligence, Compliance, etc. of

the entity being proposed to be acquired which forces us

to abandon such plans.

However, as a Company, we have had maximum

experience in inorganic growth and integration of

acquisitions and shall continue to make thoughtful

decisions of what entity to acquire and at what terms,

without any pressure to acquire for the sake of it.

OUR NETWORK ExPANSION STRATEgY

In the event of network expansion, we would do so in two

ways, one, in states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat,

where we have a strong brand and believe we can expand

into tier-2 or tier-3 towns.

Secondly, in states where we have generated some

revenue through franchising and now want to expand

our presence with our own labs. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar

Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Telangana, and Andhra

Pradesh would be among these states. This expansion

strategy is expected to reduce the EBITDA margin by 75

to 100 basis points in the first year. However, as a result,

various cost-cutting measures have already been taken

and we expect to be neutral on overall consolidated

margins as a result of this expansion.

Thirdly, the increase in volume and revenue contributions

from a profitable specialised work and lastly reducing

overhead costs as a result of digital integration, resulting in

increased productivity and efficiency.

gROWTH DRIvERS FOR FY22 AND BEYOND

Metropolis is increasing the number of collection

centres from 300 in 2016 to 2500 by 2021. In addition,

we have announced plans to establish a new research

and development centre in with a focus on hygiene and

productivity.

Over the next three years, we plan to add 90 more stat

labs and about 1,800 service collection centres. The

expected CAPEX investment would be approximately

` 30 Crores to ` 35 Crores over a three-year period. We

are looking at 100 to 150 more cities in India.

In our view, the way forward for COvID-19 is

expected to be as follows:

Safety and hygiene will become very important,

and so we will use this as an opportunity to use our

professional services to gain market share

More point of care testing will emerge for testing at

home - and we are evaluating how we can participate

in this opportunity

People may want more home visits rather than walk

into centers. We are scaling this up and expect this to

be an opportunity for organised and trusted brands to

gain more market share. It will also allow rationalisation

of front-end network and cost savings.

I would like to conclude by saying that we at Metropolis

remain very optimistic about the business and believe

that the journey of market share shift to organised

players will accelerate in the short to medium term. We

continue to look for interesting and organic opportunities

that align with our strategic vision. I am grateful to the

4,500-member Metropolis family, our shareholders,

and our board of directors, you all have helped to make

Metropolis what it is today, thanking you for all your

support. We are here to only serve humanity and also

strengthen the Metropolis front.

Yours truly,
