Dear Shareholders,

I write this: letter to you as the second wave of the

global pandemic has unfolded and we still remain

uncertain about when the pandemic will be behind us.

These are difficult times for all of us over the world. I

hope all of you are safe and I pray that very soon we

will overcome this pandemic.

The past year posed several challenges for all of us

owing to disruptions in the macro-economic situations,

procurement, logistics and closure of activities owing

to state-wise or country-wise lockdown situations.

Despite these challenges, I am pleased to announce

“The

company’s

focus

for

launched products will continue

to be on capturing a reasonable

size of the market and maintain

the same for a sustained

period. You will be happy to

note that the initial strategy of

the company is falling in place.”

Revenue

i.

Sale of goods

over the promised goods to the customer. Control is

usually transferred upon shipment, delivery to, upon

receipt of goods by the customer, in accordance with

the delivery and acceptance terms agreed with the

customers. The amount of revenue to be recognised

is based on the consideration expected to be received

in exchange for goods, excluding trade discounts,

volume discounts, sales returns and any taxes or

duties collected on behalf of the government which

are levied on sales such as GST where applicable. Any

additional amounts based on terms of agreement

entered into with customers, is recognised in the

period when the collectability becomes probable

and a reliable measure of the same is available.

ii.

Sales return allowances

The Group accounts for sales return by recording

an allowance for sales return concurrent with the

recognition of revenue at the time of a product

sale. The allowance is based on Group’s estimate of

expected sales returns. The estimate of sales return

is determined primarily by the Group’s historical

experience in the markets in which the Group operates.

iii. Export incentives

Export incentives are recognised as income when the

right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme

is established in respect of the exports made and

where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the

ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

iv. Interest income or expense

Interest income or expense is recognised using the

effective interest method on time proportion method.

v.

Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s

right to receive dividend is established, which is

generally when shareholders approve the dividend.

l.

Leases

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a

contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract

conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset

for a period of time in exchange for consideration.:
