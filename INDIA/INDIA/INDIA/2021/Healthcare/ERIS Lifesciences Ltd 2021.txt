LETTER

to Shareholders

12

Dear Shareholders,

One more year has gone by, and I am glad for the

opportunity to write to you again. It continues to

be a matter of great concern that the world, and

India in particular, continues to experience the

devastating e!ects of the Covid pandemic,

which has destroyed lives and livelihoods. At Eris,

this period has made us a lot more conscious of

our role as enablers of better healthcare for the

country. Accordingly, we have taken numerous

measures to ensure the safety and wellness of all

our stakeholders, including our employees,

medical professionals, channel partners and

society at large.

FY21 has been a game changer for us during

which we have registered robust improvement

across all business and nancial metrics. In my last: letter to you, I had shared that we have

reorganised our business around our core therapy

franchises. I had also spoken about our 4

fundamental business pillars that have kept us

resilient through di.cult times – leadership

brands in chronic super-specialty, a strong

cashEow generating business model, a debt-free

balance sheet, and our consistent focus on

operational excellence. I am glad to report that

we were able to harness the power of these pillars

to successfully navigate what has been one of the

most challenging environments ever.

D u r i n g t h e ye a r, w e h a ve i nve s t e d i n

strengthening our executive management team

and our corporate governance. We now have an

Managing Director:

letter to you as the

Chief Operating O.cer and an Executive

Director of Eris. I have been associated with Eris as

a consultant since its formative years. Back then,

Eris was a young company trying to make its mark

in an extremely competitive and pro-incumbent

industry, by taking the road less travelled. While

most new entrants elect to start o! with regional

business models in acute therapies pivoted

around local general physicians, Eris chose to

build a pan-India cardio-metabolic business

pivoted around super-specialists. The team’s

experience enabled them to execute successfully

along this strategy, and secure the distinction of

Eris being the youngest company in the IPM Top-25.

Eris is now ranked 22n d

in the domestic

pharmaceutical industry and is the only publicly

listed Indian pharmaceutical company with a

pure-play domestic branded formulations

business model. Revenues have grown 6x in the

last 10 years (since FY11) and 2x in the last 5 years

(since FY16). Net prots have grown ~ 17x in the

last 10 years and 2.6x in the last 5 years. The

company has maintained an ROIC in excess of ~

30% over the last 12 years. Fourteen years into the

business, the company retains its fundamental

strengths in terms of a chronic-focused portfolio

(91% of sales) with low (7%) NLEM exposure, high

mind-share and prescription ranks with super-

specialists (#3 among Diabetologists and #4

among Cardiologists), strong cash generation

(free cashEow of 81% of FY21 EBIDTA) and a debt-

free balance sheet. Eris has a pan-India, fully-

integrated operation with 74% of the products

sold having been manufactured at our Guwahati

facility.:

2. The percentage increase in the median remuneration of employees in the financial year: 28.30%

3. The number of permanent employees on the rolls of company: 3246

4. Average percentile increase already made in the salaries of employees other than the managerial personnel in the last financial year and its comparison with the

percentile increase in the managerial remuneration and justification thereof and point out if there are any exceptional circumstances for increase in the managerial

remuneration:

The percentile increase in the managerial remuneration has been 19.76 % which is higher than the change in the remuneration of employees other than constituting

managerial remuneration which register an increase of 5.01%. The change in the remuneration of field staff is made as per their sales performance as per a

documented increment structure uniformly applied to the field staff. The managerial function is concerned with more critical issues which influence and determine

the survival, continued growth, and the business direction for the company. The managerial talent is scarce and hence its retention is even more important.

Managerial personnel form executive management and remain accountable to all the stakeholders of the company for business performance as well as corporate

governance and therefore need to demonstrate balance of judgement and mature decision making in the backdrop of fast changing and increasingly complex

industry landscape. These reasons justify the higher increase in the managerial remuneration.

5. Remuneration of Directors, KMP and other employees is in accordance with the Company’s Remuneration Policy.
