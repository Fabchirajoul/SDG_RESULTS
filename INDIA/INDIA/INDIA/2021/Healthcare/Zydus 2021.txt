letter

issued to Moraiya formulations facility. Submitted the

final update to the USFDA in the month of

November, 2020.

•

Successfully site transferred two injectable products

viz. Succinylcholine Chloride injection and Doxycycline

injection from Moraiya to Liva site and re-introduced

them in the market.

•

In order to build the additional capacities, commenced

commercial manufacturing from two more areas of Oral

Solid Dosage formulations manufacturing facility located

in Ahmedabad SEZ.

•

Set-up a new manufacturing facility to produce DNA

based vaccine ZyCov-D in a fight against the novel

coronavirus. The facility, once operational, will have the

capacity to produce up to 1 Crore doses per month.:

letter which was issued to Moraiya formulations facility in November, 2019.

Final update was submitted to the USFDA in the month of November, 2020.

The Company has already initiated site transfer of injectable products from Moraiya formulations facility

to the injectable formulations facility of Liva near Baroda. During the year, the Company successfully site

transferred 2 injectable products viz. Succinylcholine Chloride injection and Doxycycline injection from

Moraiya to Liva site and re-introduced them in the market.

Alidac injectable formulations facility located in Ahmedabad

SEZ successfully completed WHO GMP audit while the injectable

formulations facility at Liva, Baroda successfully completed the

joint inspection by FDCA and CDSCO for WHO-GMP certification

for Remdesivir injection. Unit I of Sikkim formulations

manufacturing facility successfully completed ‘ISO 14001:2015’

surveillance audit and upgrade ‘OHSAS 18001’ to ‘ISO

45001:2018’ while Unit II of Daman formulations manufacturing

facility successfully completed WHO GMP certification audit.

Vatva injectable facility successfully ramped up the production

of Remdesivir injection by fast track execution in a record time

of 1 month to meet the increased demand amidst sudden surge

in COVID-19 cases during the second wave. On the API front,

production of HCQ was maximized at Dabhasa during the first

quarter with additional facility creation, debottlenecking and

cycle time reduction along with process improvement to supply

the HCQS tablets to the Government during the initial days of

the pandemic.

The Company constantly evaluates the potential demand of

its products in different markets and based on the demand

scenario, it takes a call to build the additional capacities for the

future. During the year, the Company commenced commercial

manufacturing from 2 more areas of Oral Solid Dosage

formulations manufacturing facility located in Ahmedabad

SEZ. The Company improved the capacity of Goa formulations

facility by 25% by de-bottlenecking granulation area through

improvement in cycle time of key products. The Company has

set up a new manufacturing facility to produce its DNA based

vaccine ZyCov-D to fight against COVID-19 virus. The facility, once

operational, will have the capacity to produce up to 1 Crore doses

per month.

SPEND RATIONALIZATION

The Company has been running an organization wide

program PRISM since last several years with an aim to

optimize the spends across several categories through

multiple levers and in turn, build the operational

efficiencies. During the year, multiple ideas were

generated and implemented across different spend

categories which led to a sizeable rationalization

of costs. New categories with significant savings

potential were also identified during the year which

will lead to optimization of spend in those categories

going forward.

The Company also runs an organization

wide program SLIM (Strategic Lean

Integrated

Manufacturing)

which

aims at improving the product yields

and

increasing

efficiency

in

the

manufacturing processes. During the

year, various initiatives such as yield

improvement through increase in batch

size were undertaken to optimize the

costs. The company has also started a

project in the name of ZEST to rationalise

the costs on the principles of zero based

approach.:

letter of credit or through advance payments.

RISK OF COMPETITION, PRICE PRESSURE

AND GOVERNMENT CONTROLS ON PRICES

The Company is a global pharmaceutical player which sells

generic medications to its customers across the globe. Generic

industry is characterized by a presence of large number of

players who compete with each-other to grab the market

share, which in turn, leads to the reduction in prices of the

products. Government of different countries encourage generic

competition as it enables them to provide the patients high

quality medicines at the affordable prices and in turn, bring the

overall healthcare costs down. In addition to this, Governments

of some countries, by law, regulate the prices of medicines and

periodically revise them downwards to make them affordable

to the patients. Such practices put the pressure on the prices

which the generic players charge to the customers. The

Company tries to mitigate the impact of such price reduction by

expanding the volumes of existing products and launching high

value added new products. The Company also continuously

strives to improve operational efficiencies to rationalize costs

and thereby minimize the impact of price erosions in the

finished products.

RISK OF REGULATORY ACTIONS DUE TO NON-

COMPLIANCE OF QUALITY STANDARDS

Pharmaceutical industry is one of the most dynamic industries

across the globe. Changes in regulations by leading regulatory

bodies to ensure the quality of the products have compelled

the pharmaceutical companies across the globe to modify

their quality assurance systems and compliance practices. The

Company must comply with all applicable quality standards

prescribed by regulatory authorities of countries where it

either supplies products or intends to do the same. Applicable

regulations are increasingly becoming stringent and the

cost for non-compliance can be severe as it can lead to the

revocation or suspension of licenses, imposition of fines and

criminal sanctions. Any violation of regulatory methods or

non-compliance of standards can also tarnish a Company’s

reputation and thereby, risk its future.

The Company continuously evaluates the quality of its products,

their manufacturing and supply chain processes to ensure that

all the applicable regulations are complied with at all times by

focusing on building a robust quality culture among its employees,

simplifying and improving the existing processes and investing the

resources towards newer technologies and automation initiatives.

The Company also keeps a constant vigil on the regulatory actions

initiated by regulatory agencies on other pharmaceutical companies

across the world and takes pro-active measures to improve its

systems and processes.

RISK OF LITIGATION RELATED TO QUALITY OF

PRODUCTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES AND

OTHER LITIGATIONS

Pharmaceutical products manufactured by the Company must

comply with the regulatory and quality standards prescribed by the

regulatory authorities of the countries where the products will be

supplied. If the quality of the products doesn’t match the standards

laid down by the regulatory authorities, it can lead to penal actions

from the regulatory authorities. Such a non-compliance can also

lead to the litigations from the customers as well. To mitigate the risk

of litigation which may arise due to product quality, the Company

takes ‘Global Product Liability Insurance’ as a safeguard against the

potential claims regarding quality of the products.

Innovator companies can also take a legal action against the generic

companies if the products manufactured by generic companies

infringe the patents granted to the innovator companies. To mitigate

this risk, the Company has put in place a review mechanism to check

for possible infringement of intellectual property rights of patent

holders before developing and filing product dossiers for global

markets.

RISK OF DELAYS IN APPROVAL OF NEW PRODUCT

REGISTRATIONS IN VARIOUS MARKETS

In the generic pharmaceutical space, a large number of players

manufacture and supply identical products at a price which is

substantially lower than that of an innovator. Presence of a large

number of players put severe pressure on the price as they compete

with each other to gain the volume by reducing the prices of the

products. Generic companies try to compensate the loss on account

of reduction in prices of existing products by launching the new

products in the market which are characterized by relatively less

competition. Non-receipt/ significant delay in receipt of approvals

for new products from the regulatory authorities can severely affect

the growth of the business of the companies.

The Company has established a stringent mechanism to review the

new product dossiers submitted with the regulatory authorities to

ensure quality of such dossiers. The Company has also established

a system of providing speedy response to the queries raised by the

regulatory authorities on the product dossiers so as to expedite the

approvals.:
