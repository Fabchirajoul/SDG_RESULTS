Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

The year 2020-21 has been nothing short of a roller coaster

ride for each of us. At one moment, we are spiraling

towards the ground at uncontrollable speed owing to the

challenges posed by the pandemic, and soon after, we are

making a steady climb upwards, propelled by our resilience

to never back down in the face of adversity. Over the past

year, with every incumbent wave, we have outmaneuvered

the pandemic. We have progressed on making India

safe on the back of the robust healthcare interventions

put in place by the Government, private institutions,

pharmaceutical companies, healthcare professionals

and other frontline warriors. I urge you all to join me in

applauding my peers in the Industry, Government officials,

healthcare practitioners, trade partners, Municipal

authorities and frontline warriors for their unparalleled

commitment to saving lives and gearing our country

towards a healthier and happier future.

With at least 13 different vaccines being administered

globally1 against COVID-19 what better time than now

to realize the importance of SCIENCE. Undoubtedly,

developing and delivering the world’s first COVID-19

vaccine is one of Pfizer’s biggest stories today, but we

have a history of breakthroughs that have impacted lives

of millions and billions of people world over. Today, we

celebrate each of those breakthroughs!

More recently, while the world grappled with the

repercussions of the pandemic, we continued to work

towards accomplishing our purpose—Breakthroughs

that Change Patients’ Lives and implemented various

innovations to make sure that despite lockdowns and

travel restrictions, our medicines and vaccines reached

over 240 million patients across India. We accelerated

launches of life-saving products, initiated our digital

transformation journey, and contributed to India’s

COVID-19 relief efforts. However, as has been our belief

since day one 71 years ago, our journey to impact

patients’ lives has only just begun and there’s much

more that we wish to achieve to make a difference in

the lives of patients and communities alike.

On the business front, while the industry grew at

4.3%, your Company delivered 6.4% growth for the

year (IQVIA MAT Mar 21). Our flagship brands, such

as Becosules, Mucaine, Corex, Gelusil, Eliquis, and

Zavicefta, showed strong performance throughout

the year. To further accelerate our growth, we have

proactively taken several steps towards our product

portfolio, resource allocation and go-to-market

strategies that are expected to yield positive results in

the coming years.

A new, innovative Pfizer

As we turned the leaf to 2021, Pfizer Inc. launched a new

corporate brand identity. This transformation was our

way of expressing Pfizer’s renewed focus on science and

patients, a charter that is the blueprint of our growth in

the future. Our dynamic new logo, birthed from the new

identity, is a symbol of scientific innovation. To craft this

new logo, we unlocked the pill form to reveal the core

of what we do - the DNA helix – the code and engine of

human potential.

Every successful emblem captures its company’s DNA –

embracing its history while leaning into its future. Pfizer’s

new corporate brand identity is a digital-first expression of

its commitment to the transformative power of science. It’s

a dynamic reflection of our purpose. And it’s a clear signal

that the new Pfizer is about daring more courageously,

inquiring more deeply, and advocating more passionately

to make what was once unimaginable – reality.

Tackling the COVID crisis

2020-21 seemed to be the year of COVID-19, but we made

it a year of excellence and empathy. Our manufacturing

units continued to churn essential medicines, and our

colleagues at these locations braved all odds to fulfill their

commitment to protecting people’s lives. Our Supply Chain

colleagues collaborated with equally dedicated partners

from within the industry and beyond to ensure that our

medicines reached hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Our

actions were driven by the belief embedded in our hearts

and minds that everyone has the right to good health.

Our organisation is centered around people and their

health needs. Hence, caring for the community has been

an integral part of our way of doing business. Since the

first wave hit our shores, we have rolled up our sleeves

and supported the Government in shouldering the

responsibility of making India safe again. From donating

masks, ventilators, medical equipment, essential drugs,

RT-PCR test kits and much more to those in need, to

helping make 400 beds operational equipped with Oxygen

cylinders for COVID patients being treated at the Yamuna

COVID Centre in Delhi. Our Global counterparts too

extended a helping hand to pull India out of suffering

through one of the most enormous humanitarian relief

efforts amassed by our organisation ever, in any country.

I have always been mesmerised by the capabilities that

humankind possesses - our ability to come together

behind a cause and see to it that it achieves success.

The pandemic reminded me of this ability of ours again.

While it showed us the worst of nature, we witnessed the

best of humanity.

Building our human capital

While there is a circle of life that exists - one that hangs in

a delicate balance to ensure that all living beings thrive,

there’s a similar harmony that orchestrates between

organisations and colleagues. To maintain this harmony,

provide a brighter future for Pfizer and an excellent quality

of life for our colleagues, we have always focused on

attracting the right talent and equipping them with the

right tools to succeed. Over the past year, we have focused

on making your Company as diverse as the patients

and communities we serve. To this end, in addition to

onboarding talent from diverse backgrounds, we have

relooked at our policies to ensure an outstanding work-

life balance, provide adequate support to colleagues, and

make moments that matter to them more memorable.

All this and more has led to Pfizer being certified as a

Great Place to Work® by the Great Place to work Institute.

This certification is the ‘Gold Standard’ that organisations

around the globe aspire to achieve, to enhance and

endorse their employer brand. It reflects our High Trust,

High-Performance Culture that each of our colleague has

been instrumental in building.

Leveraging digital

Our field colleagues mastered digital platforms to continue

their relationships with healthcare professionals; we

launched innovative platforms and engagement activities

to meet patients’ needs. We also transformed many of

our internal systems to make them agile and go hand-

in-glove with the requirements of our trade partners and

meet the demands of the digital age. Today, and in the

years to come, our commitment to science and patients

will be fulfilled by the coming together of the genius of our

colleagues and the brilliance of the latest developments

in technology.

We, at Pfizer, have always loved a challenge, especially

if it results in a better life for our patients. The year

2020-21 has witnessed our efforts to achieve just that

and make the impossible, possible. Continuing with the

same momentum on our journey, we wish to make more

therapies accessible to patients and physicians across

India. While we play our parts to the best of our abilities, to

all pharma industry members, I request you to rally behind

our collective aim and make a difference in people’s lives.

Let us all collaborate, discuss innovative ideas, and make

India stand out with its achievements in healthcare. To our

shareholders, I thank you for your belief in Pfizer and what

it stands for.
