Reasons

of

loss

or

inadequate profits

For the Financial Year ended 31st March 2021:

•

Business got significantly impacted due to the nation-wide lockdown and accompanying

severe restrictions on mobility (intra and inter-state as well as international) resulting in sharp

dip in patients’ footfalls across facilities.

•

International medical tourism business which used to contribute ~11% to Company’s India

business also got severely impacted due to travel restrictions.

•

In line with the directives of the various state governments, the Company reserved a certain

portion of the beds for COVID-19 treatment which also deterred the non-COVID patients to visit

the centres fearing the spread of infection.

•

Adoption of precautionary measures such as increased use of PPE kits, masks and other

COVID-19 related protocols had a bearing on costs, thus putting pressure on overall profitability.

(2)

Steps taken or proposed to

be taken for improvement

•

Employees related expense - Hiring freeze, salary cuts were implemented to contain cost.

•

Overheads - Rationalisation of spends on advertisement & marketing, business promotion

activities and repair & maintenance exercise.

•

Increased penetration in tier 2 regions is driving business for Company’s hinterland centres and

thus aiding in overall profitability.

•

Certain elements of cost which were earlier predominantly fixed in nature are now variable

which will help the Company improve profitability during turbulent times.

•

Variable portion of doctors’ compensation increased to align the doctors’ salaries with revenues.

(3)

Expected

increase

in

productivity and profits in

measurable terms

•

Once the vaccination program picks up pace and unlocking exercise gathers steam as the

second wave of the virus has peaked out, Company expects a recovery as patients would

want to get their surgeries/procedures done which were put on hold due to the second wave

of the infection notwithstanding further COVID related disruptions till the time majority of the

population is vaccinated.

•

Normalcy in international medical tourism business will help improve profitability significantly.

Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty was appointed as Whole-time Director

effective from 29th August, 2018 by the Board of Directors and was

subsequently approved by the members at the 18th AGM held on

3rd August, 2018.

The members at the 19th AGM held on 10th August, 2019 approved

maximum remuneration of H 6,58,24,000/- (Rupees Six Crore Fifty-

Eight Lakh Twenty-Four Thousand only) payable to Dr. Devi Prasad

Shetty in his capacity as Whole time Director.

The Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Nomination

and Remuneration Committee, at their meeting held on

31st May 2021, approved increase in the remuneration payable to

Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty, as Whole-time Director of the Company as

proposed in the resolution in Item No. 5 of the Notice, and hereby

recommend it for your approval.

The proposed remuneration is based on Industry Standards and

the role and responsibilities of Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty as Whole-

time Director of the Company.

Accordingly, approval of the Members is sought pursuant to the

provisions of Sections 196, 197, 198, 200, 203 read with Schedule

V and other applicable provisions, if any, of the Act, the Companies

(Appointment and Remuneration of Managerial Personnel)

Rules, 2014, Regulation 17 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and

Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and Article 52 of the

Articles of Association of the Company.:

Dear Shareholders,

I hope you are keeping yourself and your loved ones safe during

this pandemic. I understand not all of you will be able to work

from home and some of you will need to travel or be exposed to

groups of people. If you must go out, please wear a well-fitted

N-95 mask, do not remove it when speaking to people, and

eat food by yourself or in an outdoor location away from other

people. Take any vaccine that is available to you as soon as you

are eligible to receive it. Please ignore whatsapp messages from

so-called experts casting doubt over vaccines. All the vaccines

have gone through extensive clinical trials and the risk of vaccine

complication is much less than the risk you face every day driving

on Indian roads. Vaccine will protect you from severe symptoms

and make you less likely to spread Covid to your family.

This pandemic has changed our world forever. The struggles of the

health sector have become part of media debates for over a year.

Policymakers across the world realised that modern healthcare is

accessible to only a small percentage of the world’s population.

This system was acceptable as long as-poor people were dying of

cancer or heart attacks in their own homes far away from the elites.

When a global pandemic like COVID-19 attacked everyone at the

same time, then rich people realised that, with all their money and

connections, they also have to struggle to find a bed. Healthcare

is everyone’s problem and if all of us are not safe, then none of

us are safe.

The Indian healthcare system was struggling long before Covid.

We are blessed to be living in a country where cost of healthcare is

the lowest in the world. I left England in 1989 and the first patient I

did the bypass grafting in Calcutta paid 1.5 lakh rupees. 30 years

later, we are doing the same operation under the government

scheme for less than one lakh rupees. That is ok because for all

these years, hospitals used to subsidise the cost of operating

on poor farmers by charging extra for rich people. Unfortunately,

every organized payor is trying to lower the amount they pay for

healthcare. Central Government Health Scheme, which covers

government employees who drive cars and stay in independent

houses, pays hospitals lower rates than what poor people pay out

of pocket. Even private insurance companies are trying to bring

their prices closer to what the government pays. If nobody pays

what it costs for delivering high quality healthcare, then hospitals

will have no money to invest in latest equipment or pay good

salaries for highly skilled doctors. In the last five years, barely

any new hospital has come up in India especially in tier two cities

where it is desperately needed. Hospitals will thrive when people

pay for the true cost of healthcare. This will encourage many new

hospitals to come up, then competition will drive down the price

of healthcare.

I believe that a new system of delivering healthcare for all requires

a new system of paying for healthcare. India needs to have multiple

financial intermediaries to pay for the healthcare of all sections of

the society, rich and poor. Even today, nearly 60% of our patients

pay for healthcare from their pocket. This must change. Working

class people can’t all of a sudden produce a large sum of money

to pay for surgery. But they can pay small amounts of money to

We are blessed to be living in a

country where cost of healthcare

is the lowest in the world.:

Dear Shareholders,

It’s a matter of pride for me to present the performance of

your Company for the year gone by. Fiscal year 2021 posed a

challenging operating environment not just for India but also for

the global economy. Nation-wide lockdown followed by supply-

chain disruptions amidst COVID-19 virus spreading at an alarming

rate brought the businesses to a grinding halt. The recovery has

been gradual and spread over the course of several months with

operations demonstrating resilience and agility after an almost

washout in the first quarter period of 2020-21. As a leading

healthcare service provider, we dedicated a significant portion

of our beds and other resources towards treating the patients

infected with COVID-19. Our clinical talent worked round the clock

to ensure the highest degree of medical care to our patients in these

testing times and this gives us a lot of satisfaction that we stayed

united as a family confronting the pandemic spread worldwide.

COVID-19 Induced Hardships

Healthcare industry, unlike other sectors, faced multitude of

problems as we fought battles on multiple fronts during the last year

ranging from dearth of medical professionals for treating COVID-19

patients to shortage of medical consumables to keep the hospitals

running. Our non-COVID business in the form of high-end tertiary

elective procedures and surgeries got severely impacted as both

domestic and international patients stopped visiting the hospitals

fearing the spread of infection and travel restrictions imposed

by the government. A sharp decline in footfalls had a significant

bearing on our business with consolidated revenues coming in at

INR 25,823 mn for the fiscal year 2021, registering a de-growth of

17.4% on YoY basis. A distorted speciality mix gravitated towards

low-yielding procedures and price-capped COVID-19 treatment,

coupled with a significant erosion in international patient mix as

well as high-end cardiac sciences based elective work resulted

into a significant hit on our profitability with consolidated EBITDA

plunging by 52.9% on YoY basis thus closing the year at INR 2,103

mn with the dip in profitability accentuated mainly by a significant

operating loss of INR 492 mn in the first half of the fiscal. However,

building upon the slow but steady recovery through the course of

the year, we are pleased to have closed the year on a strong note

with quarterly consolidated EBITDA of INR 1,499 mn (YoY growth

of 45.9%) translating into EBITDA margin of 17.9%.

On operational parameters, our consistent efforts over the years

to drive efficiencies through high-end medical technology and

cutting-edge clinical research to bring down Average Length

of Stay (ALOS) and subsequently improve throughput and

Average Revenue per Occupied Bed (ARPOB) were temporarily

disrupted as patients’ volumes across high-end specialities

such as cardiac sciences, renal sciences, etc got significantly

impacted with Average Length & Stay (ALOS) moving up due to

long-stay, low realisation centric COVID-19 business.

We are pleased by the Central

Government’s emphasis on health

and well-being as reflected in the

increased allocation towards the

sector in the Union Budget 2021

with total proposed outlay of INR

2.23 lakh Crs (over USD 30 billion

dollars), an increase of 137% over

the budget spending last year.:

letter dated January 19, 2011, the timelines committed by NHPL are as follows:

39 (Contd..)

The Company commenced operations in its Ahmedabad unit on May 3, 2012. As of March 31, 2021, the Group is yet to achieve the

above timelines. The Group based on its past projects with government and other authorities believes that the terms/ conditions of grant

of leasehold land at concessional rate would be renegotiated and no liability or adjustment to recorded assets is required as at March 31,

2021.

40 NHPL had entered into a lease agreement and obtained a 5 acre land from Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority in February

2009 for construction of a hospital for a consideration of H 25 Millions disclosed as prepaid rent under other current and non-current

assets. As per the lease agreement, NHPL was required to complete the construction of the hospital by August 2009. However, no

construction has been completed till date. During the financial year 2019-20, the company has written off the prepaid rent of H 22.20

Millions.

41 In the year 2008-09, NHPL was allotted 35 acres of land by Jaipur Development Authority (‘JDA’) for establishing a medical college

at Bagrana Grama, Jaipur “Bagrana”. Subsequently, NHPL has surrendered 25 acres of land to JDA and retained 10 acres of land.

However, in the year 2013-14 JDA intimated NHPL that 6,000 sq. meters of land out of the 10 acres land retained will be utilised for

the completion of ring road project. Subsequently, JDA gave another proposal of land allotment at Govind Pura Ropada, in lieu of 10

acres at Bagrana, NHPL gave its consent on the same through: letter dated April 24, 2015.

Since this land is given in lieu of land allotted at Bagrana, NHPL has requested JDA that the land at Govind Pura Ropada to be valued

the same as it was during the time of allotment of land in Bagrana in March 2008.

As at March 31, 2021, NHPL has paid H 54.44 million (March 31, 2020 : H 54.44 million) to JDA and accrued the balance payable of

H 47.45 million (March 31, 2020 : H 41.52 million). NHPL would capitalize this amount along with any other payment once NHPL gets

the land registered in its name. NHPL believes that this advance towards land is recoverable from the JDA and hence provision for

doubtful advance is not required as at March 31, 2021

42 Prepaid expenses

Expense prepaid as on March 31, 2019 amounting to H 275.48 million representing rent paid to Asia Heart Foundation and Modern

Medical Institute have as at April 1, 2019 been considered as ROU assets for the remaining lease term and presented appropriately as at

March 31, 2021

43 Share based payment expense

During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company introduced the NH ESOP 2015 (“NH ESOP”) for the benefit of the employees of the

Company, its subsidiaries and associates, as approved by the Board of
