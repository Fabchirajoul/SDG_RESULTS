10-year Financial Highlights

18: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose

significant challenges, straining healthcare

infrastructure, and leaving behind significant

adverse economic and social impact. At the same

time, we are witnessing the indomitable spirit of

the medical fraternity and other frontline workers

in the face of unprecedented adversity. The

pandemic has taken a heavy toll on human life,

and our heart goes out to those families who lost

their near and dear ones.

We firmly believe that crisis breeds new

opportunities to redefine the conventional

template and set in motion ideas and innovation

for building a better future. We are confident that

with a concerted vaccination drive and other non-

pharmaceutical interventions such as masking

and social distancing, the nation will overcome

this crisis soon.

Despite an extremely challenging operating

environment, Abbott India continued its growth

trajectory, outperforming the market and the

industry. Our Revenue from Operations grew by

5.3% and Profit Before Tax by 15.4%. This robust

performance not only demonstrates the resilience

of our business model, but also our ability to

quickly adapt to the rapidly evolving realities.

The Board recommended a dividend of `275

Since the onset of the pandemic, we have been

working closely with our people and partners

to support communities with resources and

technologies to tide over the crisis. We managed

to ensure business continuity with virtually no

disruption in manufacturing and supply chain.

We did all this, while protecting the health of our

employees and rigorously following the safety

guidelines.

ENSURING BUSINESS EXCELLENCE

At Abbott, we believe that health is critical to

enriching the world around us. We remain

steadfast in our commitment to delivering

sustainable healthcare solutions that takes care of

people and the planet. We pivoted our engagement

models, leveraged our digital capabilities, and

kept pushing the boundaries of innovation. As

a result, we witnessed the endurance of our

people by a series of innovative product launches

and new initiatives. These redefined ways of

working helped further strengthen our key brands

and maintained our leadership in the Indian

Pharmaceutical Market (IPM). We launched

15 new products and line extensions in FY 2020-21

and will focus on ensuring their success.

We also continued to focus on capability

building of our field force. We paved the way for

greater collaboration amongst our employees

and encouraged them to think out of the box.

We improvised on ways of engagement with

our customers, specifically the healthcare

professionals. Flagship scientific models were

created, including the digital masterclass.

Strategic tie-ups and partnerships with various

societies, associations and thought leaders

enabled us to deepen our academic engagements.

Overall, we have conducted over 3,500 medical

education programs with doctors. Our marketing

teams conducted several awareness initiatives on

digital platforms, especially for Vitamin D and

influenza as these two therapies have been talked

about a lot in recent times.

One of our key takeaways from the year is that for

businesses around the world, purpose should take

precedence over profitability. Our unwavering

focus on integrity and culture of compliance have

helped us to thrive in a difficult environment.

We uphold the highest ethical standards in our

business conduct and live by our values, while

operating with honesty and fairness.

EMPATHY AND COMMITMENT

As part of our social initiatives, we established

health clinics for various therapeutic areas,

which enabled access to essential health

services and credible information with the help

of qualified doctors. Through Self-Employed

Women's Association (SEWA), we continue to

create new models to improve access of quality

healthcare to the low-income population. We also

remain committed to engage in activities that

complement government's COVID relief efforts.

It is also a matter of pride that we won several

awards and recognitions during the year.

In India, Abbott was recognized by Business

Today as one of - Top 25 “Coolest Places to Work”

and was included in the list of “2020 Working

Mother and Best Companies for Women in India”

by Avtar, a pioneering Diversity & Inclusion

Consulting firm.

Healthcare access, availability and equity in

utilisation of healthcare services in the country

are the pressing needs of the hour. We have put

in place the building blocks for this, and we look

forward to delivering on our promise.

I extend my sincerest gratitude to our employees

and partners for their passion and commitment,

and to our shareholders for their continued trust

and support.

Regards,

MUNIR SHAIKH

MANAGING DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE

OUR ENDURING FAITH IN OUR ABILITIES: Dear Shareholders,

The year 2020 was one of the most challenging

years we have known. While the second wave of this

pandemic continues to present challenges for us in

India as well as some of the other countries, we are

confident that we will overcome these challenges and

evolve to be even stronger from having had to deal with

“I feel proud to lead an organization that continues to play pivotal role

in promoting health and helping people live their best lives. This year

we have remained focused on our long-term goals while reshaping and

pivoting our business model to adapt to the challenges that we were

presented with. The steps we have taken to redefine our ways of working

reflect both our endurance as well as our agility in these dynamic times,

which have helped us to achieve this performance.”

this experience. We salute the frontline workers who

have been relentlessly striving to support all of us in

these critical times.

At Abbott India, what has really emerged for us during

this pandemic is the endurance of our employees. We

have worked tirelessly through last year to ensure

that there is minimum disruption in the supply of

medicines that are so important to millions of people

in the country. Across business functions, at our

manufacturing and supply units, and through the efforts

of all our employees, we have remained committed to

provide solutions for patients and doctors. We have

never felt closer to our purpose of helping as many

people as possible lead fuller lives.

THE YEAR IN FOCUS

I feel proud to lead an organization that continues

to play pivotal role in promoting health and helping

people live their best lives. This year we have remained

focused on our long-term goals while reshaping and

pivoting our business model to adapt to the challenges

that we were presented with. The steps we have

taken to redefine our ways of working reflect both our

endurance as well as our agility in these dynamic times,

which have helped us to achieve this performance.

Our annual Sales stood at `4,249 Crore, registering a

growth of 4.8%, compared to the preceding year, while

our Net Profit grew by 16.5%.

I am happy that we have retained our position as the

leading pharmaceutical company in 90% of therapies*

that we are present in involving women’s health,

gastroenterology, metabolics, pain management, central

nervous system, and vaccines. Currently, nine of our top

10 brands lead their individual markets.*

During the year, we built on our strengths and

leveraged our competitive advantage to scale our

business significantly. We expanded the breadth of our

key portfolios and introduced 15 new products this

year. While we advance our established brands and

increase our efforts towards vertically integrating our

portfolio, we remain committed to create value for our

stakeholder groups.

Our consumer health portfolio, led by Digene,

witnessed an impressive turnaround. To ensure direct

targeted relief, we launched a topical pain relief spray,

Brufen Power spray. Our heritage Cremaffin portfolio,

with its enhanced packing features, is gaining healthy

returns in the market. Our vaccine division, led by

Influvac, has provided a stellar performance this year.

To protect our frontline workers we also engaged in a

nation-wide flu vaccination drive during the lockdown.

Our gastro portfolio led by some established brands

have maintained their growth trajectory. Digeraft, our

new product in this portfolio, has seen a tremendous

demand and is one of our most successful recent

launches. Our Gutfit program keeps evolving, and we

launched an App this year to enable virtual connect

between patients and doctors.

We also took a big step for patients with epilepsy

in India with the launch of Brivetoin and Lacoxa.

Understanding the evolving needs of present-day

patients, we launched the first-ever comprehensive

patient support program for Women’s Health – Tender,

Love & Care, that will hand hold to-be parents through

their unique journey.

To gain higher leverage from untapped markets, we

launched a team to specifically focus on coverage in

the Tier 2 markets. This will open new avenues and

also provide a larger population, access to our quality

medicines.

GOING BEYOND TREATMENT

We continued addressing our patient needs in a tailored

approach to transform the way they use medicines,

and all these efforts have provided tailwinds to

achieve our purpose. To provide patients with credible

information and fulfil the need gap for understanding

the correlation between Vitamin D deficiency and

immunity, we launched the ‘D Strong Active Life’

campaign. We ran a 360-degree multi-specialty digital

campaign ‘Liver Care Beyond Compare’ to increase

awareness on liver disorders amongst healthcare

professionals. For improving the diagnosis of complex

issues such as vertigo, we launched Vertigo clinics

this year.

We have and continue to pioneer new ways of

engagement with our healthcare professionals; our

multi-channel engagement model helped us deliver

targeted and personalized communications to our

healthcare professionals. More than 90% of our sales

force is equipped with e-detailing solutions that help

them connect with doctors easily in these remote

working conditions. As a scientifically driven Company,

we continue conducting knowledge enhancement

programs for our healthcare professionals.

The pandemic demanded new forms of engagement

and learning for our employees, and we connected

with them remotely through various wellness and

capability building initiatives. Our virtual exercise

programs are run almost every day to ensure that our

people can manage to lead a healthy life despite the

lockdown. Several leadership development programs

such as In-stride, Global Citizen Development Program,

Emerging Leaders Program, New Leaders Program, and

more were virtually conducted during the year.

Our Diversity & Inclusion agenda has received a

major push this year with several interventions being

launched, thus helping us in our endeavor to be a

gender-diverse and balanced company.
