FOR HEALTH. FOR LIFE.

Connecting science, technology and innovation

This year's annual report is a reǈection of our eǄort to bring science, technology and

innovation together to Ǉnd solutions to challenges posed by the pandemic, and to do our

best for all our stakeholders as a responsible member of the pharmaceutical industry.

‘For Health. For Life' - because Good Health Can't Wait.

In the last year and a half, the focus of the world has been on our collective health.

The current pandemic has reminded us of the paramount importance of our physical and

mental well-being. At the same time, it has prompted us to reǈect on how our actions as

individuals have a bearing on us as a community and the entire planet.

LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

AND CO-CHAIRMAN

K SATISH REDDY

Chairman

G V PRASAD

Co-Chairman and: Managing Director

Ÿ In September 2020, when the Ǉrst phase

of the pandemic was still raging in India,

Dr. Reddy’s signed up with the Russian

Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) — Russia’s

sovereign wealth fund — to cooperate on

clinical trials and distribution of Sputnik V

vaccine in India. Upon regulatory

approval in India, RDIF committed to

supply 100 million doses of the vaccine to

Dr. Reddy’s.

Ÿ Dedicated separate COVID-19 care

facilities were launched for employees

and dependents in three locations to

provide pre-hospitalization care.

Ÿ Thereafter, we created a partnership with

the Biotechnology Industry Research

Assistance Council (BIRAC) of the

Department of Biotechnology,

Government of India, for advisory

support and to use some of BIRAC’s

clinical trial centers for clinical trials of

Sputnik V vaccine.

Your company’s core dictum is ‘Good Health

Can’t Wait’.

Ÿ For employees working on-site, stringent

social distancing and safety measures

were deployed in work locations,

transport facilities and cafeterias. Other

measures included multiple stages of

disinfection, provision of personal

protective equipment, automating

actions that require manual contact.

Moreover, we provided a daily hardship

allowance.

Never before in the history of Dr. Reddy’s

has this maxim been more important than

now. In the context of this horriǇc

pandemic, let us brieǈy share with you what

your company has done to address the

situation.

Ÿ A well-being and support plan that

comprised tele-consulting, helplines,

24x7 access to clinical psychologists

through an online platform and a home

isolation program.

Ÿ We contracted for additional insurance

coverage for COVID-19 which covered

hospitalization and home quarantine

expenses. This was extended to our

employees and their dependents in India.

Employees were also provided additional

COVID-19 leave.

At the same time, Dr. Reddy’s acted quickly

to bring various preventive and curative

medicines to deal with COVID-19, including

a vaccine. Let us start with our vaccine

journey.

There has never been a year such as this.

We pray that there never will be any more

in our lifetime as well as of our children and

grandchildren.

Sputnik V vaccine

As on May 14, 2021, the virus has infected

over 160 million and has claimed the lives of

3.4 million people worldwide. India, the

second worst infected country in the world,

has witnessed over 25 million cases and

more than 270,000 deaths.

With the pandemic ǈaring for the Ǉrst time

in April 2020, the primary objective was to

ensure health and safety of our employees

and their families while continuing to supply

medicines across the world. Some of the

interventions that we quickly put in place

were:

Ÿ From December 2020, we commenced

clinical trials of Sputnik V. Based on

satisfactory data from Phase II trials, we

received approval from the Drugs

Controller General of India (DCGI) to

conduct Phase III clinical trial on 1,500

subjects as part of a randomized, double-

blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled

study in India.

SG&A expenses increased by 9% to

attributable to increase in logistics costs

primarily due to COVID-19 situation;

increase in personnel costs primarily on

account of increased head count and annual

increments; and increases pertaining to

legal and professional charges. The increase

was o΀set by lower marketing and travel

expenses with restricted activities due to

COVID-19. SG&A accounted for 28.8% of

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

managing director of the company for a

further period of Ǉve years with eǄect from

January 30, 2021.

Section 152 of the Act, states that one-

third of the board members, other than

independent directors, who are subject

to retire by rotation, shall do so every

year and be eligible for reappointment, if

approved by the members. Accordingly,

Mr. G V Prasad (DIN: 00057433) retires by

rotation at the forthcoming annual general

meeting (AGM) and being eligible, seeks

reappointment.

Therefore, at the forthcoming annual

general meeting, approval of members

is being sought for the reappointment of

Mr. G V Prasad, who retires by rotation

and, being eligible, oǄers himself for the

reappointment.

SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT

OF NEW DIRECTORS

Recommending any new member on the

board is the responsibility of the NGCC

of the board, which consists entirely of

independent directors. Given the existing

composition of the board, the tenure

as well as the years left of the existing

members to serve on the board, and

the need for new domain expertise are

reviewed by this committee. When such a

need becomes apparent, the committee

reviews potential candidates in terms of

their expertise, attributes, personal and

professional backgrounds and their ability

to attend meetings in India. It then places

the details of shortlisted candidates to the

board for its consideration. If the board

approves, the person is appointed as an

additional director, subject to the approval

of members in the company’s next general

meeting.

FAMILIARIZATION PROCESS FOR

INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

To familiarize a new independent director

with the company, an information kit is

provided containing documents about the

company. It contains, inter alia, information

such as its annual reports, sustainability

reports, investor presentations, recent

press releases, research reports, code of

business conduct and ethics (COBE)

and the memorandum and articles of

association and a brief on company’s board

practices. The new independent director

individually meets with board members

and senior management. Visits to plants

and research locations are organized for

the director to understand the company’s

operations.

We believe that the board should be

continuously empowered with knowledge

of latest developments aǄecting the

company and the industry. Apart from

regular presentations on the company’s

business strategies and associated risks,

expositions are made on various topics

covering the pharmaceutical industry.

Updates on relevant statutory changes

and judicial pronouncements around

industryrelated laws are regularly circulated

to the directors. They also visit the

company’s manufacturing and research

locations. Each director has complete

access to any of the company’s information

and full freedom to interact with senior

management.

BOARD EVALUATION

Since FY2015, the board has carried out an

annual self-evaluation of its performance,

the working of its committees and peer

evaluation of each director internally.

Prior to that, on two such occasions,

an independent expert was engaged to

conduct the evaluation process. In FY2019,

an independent expert was engaged to

conduct the evaluation process and in

FY2020 the evaluation and eǄectiveness

process of the board, its committees

and individual directors was undertaken

internally.

During FY2021, also the evaluation process

was undertaken internally. For the purpose,

each director completed a questionnaire

involving peer evaluation and feedback on

processes of the board and its committees.

The contribution and impact of individual

members were evaluated on a number of

parameters, such as level of engagement,

independence of judgment, conǈict

resolution, contributions to enhance the

board’s overall eǄectiveness, etc. Peer

ratings on certain parameters, positive

attributes and improvement areas for

each director were provided to them on a

conǇdential basis.

The committees were evaluated on various

parameters such as eǄective discharge of

their roles, responsibilities and advice given

to the board for discharging its Ǉduciary

responsibilities, including adequate and

periodical updates to the board on the

committees’ functioning.

on the nature, scope and process of

audits and any views that they have

Dear Member,

Your directors are pleased to present the

37th annual report for the year ended March

31, 2021.

The ΃nancial year 2021 started with

COVID-19 related lockdowns in India and

several parts of our major markets. The

pandemic which started about 15 months

back impacted almost everyone and your

company was no exception. There were

challenges around movement of people and

all the business operations were impacted

— be it manufacturing, research and

development (R&D), marketing or the supply

chain and logistics. Our team accepted the

situation as a challenge and solved the

issues one by one to ensure that your

company continues to make medicines and

serve its patients across the globe.

We also collaborated with multiple global

partners and have been developing a

number of COVID-19 related drugs. We

have successfully launched a vaccine. We

found new ways of working by leveraging

digitalization and undertaking several

precautionary measures to ensure the

health and safety of our employees and

business partners. We contributed our bit to

support the needy and front line workers.

Our actions during the pandemic have been

driven by our purpose of ‘Good Health

Can’t Wait’ and re΄ect the dynamism and

empathy which are core to us.

Table 1 gives the consolidated and

standalone ΃nancial highlights of the

company based on Indian Accounting

Standards (Ind AS) for FY2021 (i.e. from

April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021) compared

to the previous ΃nancial year.

The company’s standalone total income for

the year was ₹ 141.50 billion, which was up

by 12% over the previous year. This was

US$ 1.93 billion. PBT was ₹ 30.56 billion

(US$ 418 million), which was up by 10% in

rupee terms over the previous year.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS AND

COMPANY AFFAIRS*

Revenues from Global Generics were up by

12% and stood at ₹ 154.4 billion. There was

growth across North America Generics,

Emerging Markets and India, with strong

growth in Europe.

Revenues from North America stood at

₹ 70.5 billion, registering a year-on-year

growth of 9%. This was largely on account

of revenue contribution from new products

launched, increase in volumes for some of

our base products, and favorable foreign

exchange movement, partly o΀set by high

price erosions in some of our products.

During the year, the company ΃led 20

abbreviated new drug applications

(ANDAs) and one new drug application

(NDA) under Section 505(b)(2) in the USA.

As of March 31, 2021, there were 95

generic ΃lings awaiting approval with the

US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA),

comprising 92 ANDAs and three NDAs

΃led under Section 505(b)(2). Of the 92

ANDAs, 47 are Para IV applications, and

we believe that 23 of these have ‘First to

File’ status.

The company’s consolidated total income

for the year was ₹ 193.39 billion, which was

up by 7% over the previous year. This

amounted to US$ 2.64 billion. Pro΃t before

tax (PBT) was ₹ 28.84 billion, representing

an increase of 53% over the previous year.

This translated to US$ 394 million.

During FY2020, the scheme of

amalgamation of Dr. Reddy’s Holdings

Limited with the company was approved

by the board of directors, members and

unsecured creditors of the company.

SCHEME OF AMALGAMATION

Revenues from Pharmaceutical Services

and Active Ingredients (PSAI) stood at

₹ 32 billion, with a year-on-year growth of

24%. During the year, the company ΃led

149 drug master ΃les (DMFs) worldwide,

including 14 ΃lings in the US.

Revenues from Emerging Markets were

₹ 35.1 billion, registering a year-on-year

growth of 7%. Revenues from India stood at

₹ 33.4 billion, showing a year-on-year

growth of 15%. Revenues from Europe were

₹ 15.4 billion, or a year-on-year growth of

32%.

letter from Chairman and Co-Chairman included in the Annual report, which is expected to be made

available to us after that date. The other information does not include the standalone Ind AS Ǉnancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone Ind AS Ǉnancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,

consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the Ǉnancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or

otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this

other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these

standalone Ind AS Ǉnancial statements that give a true and fair view of the Ǉnancial position, Ǉnancial performance including other comprehensive

income, cash ǈows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the

Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) speciǇed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 15, as

amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for

safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of

appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and

maintenance of adequate internal Ǉnancial controls, that were operating eǄectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting

records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone Ind AS Ǉnancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for chargeback,

rebates, sales returns and discounts, etc. The estimates

relating to the accruals are important given the

signiﬁcance of revenue and also considering the

distinctive terms of arrangement with customers.

These estimates are complex and requires signiﬁcant

judgement and estimation by the Company for

establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy of

revenues may deviate on account of change in

judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has

been considered as a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

Ÿ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating

eǄectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction processes.

Ÿ We tested management’s estimated sales deductions and obtained

management’s calculations for the respective estimates. We tested

management’s estimates over the determination of sales deductions accruals by

comparing the rates used in management’s estimate to rates in the underlying

contracts and historical sales deductions data.

Ÿ We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates,

discounts, allowances and returns, as applicable to current payment trends.

Ÿ We also considered the historical accuracy of the management’s estimates in

prior years and assessed the estimated amounts, we evaluated trends in actual

sales and discount accrual balances.

Ÿ We also tested management’s controls over the accuracy and completeness of

the estimates used to calculate the sales deductions.

Ÿ We also tested the underlying data used in management's calculations for

accuracy and completeness and veriǇed source data supporting the inventory

levels, rebate claims paid subsequent to period end, and volume discounts

settled during the period.

Ÿ We tested recording of revenue in appropriate period which included the

following procedures:

Ÿ VeriǇed sample sales transactions near period-end.

Ÿ Performed trend analysis over sales levels as compared to previous periods;

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited

98

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding

independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,

and where applicable, related safeguards.

1.

As required by the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 2016 (“the Order”), issued by the Central Government of India in terms of

sub-section (11) of section 143 of the Act, we give in the “Annexure 1” a statement on the matters speciǇed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order.

a) We have sought and obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the

purposes of our audit;

c) The Balance Sheet, the Statement of ProǇt and /oss including the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Cash Flow Statement

and Statement of Changes in Equity dealt with by this Report are in agreement with the books of account;

g) In our opinion, the managerial remuneration for the year ended March 31, 2021 has been paid / provided by the Company to its directors in

accordance with the provisions of section 197 read with Schedule V to the Act;

Ÿ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone Ind AS Ǉnancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether

the standalone Ind AS Ǉnancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

d) In our opinion, the aforesaid standalone Ind AS Ǉnancial statements comply with the Accounting Standards speciǇed under Section 133 of

the Act, read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended;

Ÿ Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,

whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signiǇcant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a

going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related

disclosures in the Ǉnancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit

evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a

going concern.

e) On the basis of the written representations received from the directors as on 31 March 2021 taken on record by the Board of Directors, none

of the directors is disqualiǇed as on 31 March 2021 from being appointed as a director in terms of Section 164 (2) of the Act;

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone Ind AS Financial Statements as a whole are free from material

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of

assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to

inǈuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone Ind AS Ǉnancial statements.

Ÿ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS Ǉnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and

perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suǅcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our

opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve

collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

Ÿ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal Ǉnancial

controls with reference to Ǉnancial statements in place and the operating eǄectiveness of such controls.

Ÿ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by

management.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signiǇcant

audit Ǉndings, including any signiǇcant deǇciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signiǇcance in the audit of

the standalone Ind AS Ǉnancial statements for the Ǉnancial year ended 31 March 2021 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these

matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we

determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected

to outweigh the public interest beneǇts of such communication.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

2. As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, we report that:

b) In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as it appears from our examination of

those books;

f) With respect to the adequacy of the internal Ǉnancial controls with reference to these standalone Ind AS Ǉnancial statements and the

operating eǄectiveness of such controls, refer to our separate Report in “Annexure 2” to this report;

The Board of Directors of the Company, in their meeting held on 27 March 2020, had approved the plan for restructuring of the Company’s

pharmaceutical services business that involves setting up a wholly owned subsidiary and transferring the all tangible and intangible assets,

incorporated wholly owned subsidiary. During the year ended 31 March 2021, the Company sold contract development and manufacturing

and transfer of employees.

Company Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

letter from Chairman and Co-Chairman included in the Annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after that date. The

Other information does not include the Standalone Ǉnancial statements, Consolidated Ǉnancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated Ǉnancial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated Ǉnancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider

whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated Ǉnancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or

otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of

this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated Ǉnancial statements in

terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated Ǉnancial position, consolidated Ǉnancial performance

including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash ǈows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group and joint ventures

in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) speciǇed under

section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of

the companies included in the Group and its joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance

with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and of its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and

other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and

prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal Ǉnancial controls, that were operating eǄectively for ensuring

the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated Ǉnancial statements

that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of

preparation of the consolidated Ǉnancial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated Ǉnancial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint

ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its joint ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,

matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or

to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are also responsible for overseeing the

Ǉnancial reporting process of the Group and of its joint ventures.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

Annual Report 2020-21

Company Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated Ǉnancial statements as a whole are free from material

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of

assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected

to inǈuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated Ǉnancial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ǉnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and

perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suǅcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our

opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve

collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal

Ǉnancial controls with reference to Ǉnancial statements in place and the operating eǄectiveness of such controls.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by

management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,

whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signiǇcant doubt on the ability of the Group and its joint

ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s

report to the related disclosures in the consolidated Ǉnancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our

conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause

the Group and its joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated Ǉnancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the

consolidated Ǉnancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

• Obtain suǅcient appropriate audit evidence regarding the Ǉnancial information of the entities or business activities within the Group of

which we are the independent auditors and whose Ǉnancial information we have audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated Ǉnancial

statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the Ǉnancial statements of such entities

included in the consolidated Ǉnancial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated

Ǉnancial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and

performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated Ǉnancial

statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signiǇcant

audit Ǉndings, including any signiǇcant deǇciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding

independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,

and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signiǇcance in the audit

of the consolidated Ǉnancial statements for the Ǉnancial year ended 31 March 1 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these

matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,

we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be

expected to outweigh the public interest beneǇts of such communication.

investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method;

•

assets held for sale are measured at fair value;

•

assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations are measured at fair value; and

•

right-of-use the assets are recognised at the present value of lease payments that are not paid at that date. This amount is adjusted

for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, lease incentives received and initial direct costs, incurred, if

any.

c) Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated Ǉnancial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All

Ǉnancial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

In respect of certain non-Indian subsidiaries that operate as marketing arms of the parent company in their respective countries/

regions, the functional currency has been determined to be the functional currency of the parent company (i.e., the Indian rupee).

The operations of these entities are largely restricted to importing of Ǉnished goods from the parent company in India, sales of these

products in the foreign country and making of import payments to the parent company. The cash ǈows realised from sales of goods

are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis. The cash

ǈows realised from sales of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent

company on a regular basis. The costs incurred by these entities are primarily the cost of goods imported from the parent company.

The Ǉnancing of these subsidiaries is done directly or indirectly by the parent company.

In respect of subsidiaries whose operations are self-contained and integrated within their respective countries/regions, the functional

currency has been generally determined to be the local currency of those countries/regions, unless use of a diǄerent currency is

considered appropriate.

d) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of Ǉnancial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and

assumptions that aǄect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.

Actual results may diǄer from these estimates.

letter dated 30 April 2014 that the Company had violated the Consumer

Product Safety Act (the “CPSA”) and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (the “PPPA”) and that the CPSC intended to seek civil penalties.

SpeciǇcally, the CPSC asserted, among other things, that from or about 14 August 2008 through 1 June 2012, the Company sold prescription drugs

having unit dose packaging that failed to comply with the CPSC's special child resistant packaging regulations under the PPPA and failed to issue

general certiǇcates of conformance. In addition, the CPSC asserted that the Company violated the CPSA by failing to immediately advise the

CPSC of the alleged violations. The Company disagrees with the CPSC’s allegations.

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the

Company for sales of Norǈoxacin in excess of the maximum selling price Ǉxed by the NPPA, which was ` 285 including interest.

2.32 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited

The Company Ǉled its response to the FCA Complaint on 23 February 2016 in the form of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which

relief can be granted. On 26 March 2017, the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss, dismissing the FCA Complaint and allowing the

plaintiǄs one more chance to reǇle this complaint in an attempt to plead sustainable allegations.

Namenda Litigation

On 29 March 2017, the plaintiǄs Ǉled their Ǉnal amended FCA Complaint, which the Company opposed and during the three months ended

31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiǄs Ǉled a petition with the Court requesting that

the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

On 23 August 2020, the Company and certain other defendants entered into a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement calls for the

dismissal with prejudice of the claims brought by the plaintiǄ on behalf of the putative class, in exchange for the payment of US$0.4 million.

The Company paid that amount into escrow. The Court preliminarily approved the settlement on 5 October 2020. The settlement agreement is

contingent upon Ǉnal court approval. The settlement agreement explicitly disclaims any liability or wrongdoing.

Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) began to investigate a sealed complaint which was Ǉled in the United States District

Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) related to these same issues (the “FCA Complaint”).

The Company cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation. The DOJ and all States involved in the investigation declined to intervene in the FCA

Complaint. On 10 November 2015, the FCA Complaint was unsealed and the plaintiǄ whistleblowers, who are two former employees of the

Company, proceeded without the DOJ’s and applicable States’ involvement. The unsealed FCA Complaint relates to the 6 blister pack products

originally subject to the investigation and also 38 of the Company’s generic prescription products sold in the U.S. in various bottle and cap

packaging.

On 18 January 2018, the Company and the DOJ entered into a settlement of the action and agreed to a consent decree providing for a civil penalty

of US$5 million (` 319), and injunctive relief. The settlement was without adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and the Company has not admitted

any violations of law pursuant to this settlement.

During the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiǄs subsequently

Ǉled a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was

denied.

The parallel investigation by the CPSC under the CPSA and the PPPA was referred by the CPSC to the DOJ’s oǅce in Washington, D.C. in April

2016, with the recommendation that the DOJ initiate a civil penalty action against the Company. The CPSC matter referred to the DOJ relates to

Ǉve of the blister pack products.

In June 2018, the plaintiǄs Ǉled their Notice of Appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. During the three months ended September 2018, the

plaintiǄs and the DOJ settled and thus this appeal was dismissed. The plaintiǄs then Ǉled an application for recovery of attorneys

fees from the

Company under the "alternative remedy doctrine." The Company made opposing Ǉlings to this and in response the plaintiǄs withdrew their

application.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the FCA Complaint is not probable. Accordingly, no provision

has been made in these consolidated Ǉnancial statements.

In August 2015, Sergeants Benevolent Assoc. Health & Welfare Fund (“Sergeants”) Ǉled suit against the Company in the United States District Court

for the Southern District of New York. Sergeants alleged that certain parties, including the Company, violated federal antitrust laws as a

®

consequence of having settled patent litigation related to the Alzheimer’s drug Namenda (memantine) tablets during a period from about 2009

®

until 2010. Sergeants seeks to represent a class of “end payor” purchasers of Namenda tablets (i.e., insurers, other third-party payors and

consumers).

Sergeants seeks damages based upon an allegation made in the complaint that the defendants entered into patent settlements regarding

®

Namenda tablets for the purpose of delaying generic competition and facilitating the brand innovator’s attempt to shift sales from the original

immediate release product to the more recently introduced extended release product.

Following the settlement agreement, the Company recognised such amount in the statement of proǇt and loss for the three months ended

30 September 2020.

Other class action complaints containing similar allegations to the Sergeants complaint have also been Ǉled in the U.S. District Court for the

Southern District of New York. However, apart from the Sergeants case described above, there are no such class actions that are pending and that

name the Company as a defendant.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability, apart from the settlement payment described above, that may arise on account of alleged

violation of federal antitrust laws is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated Ǉnancial statements.

On 5 November 2019 plaintiǄs MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC and MSPA Claims 1, LLC Ǉled suit against the Company and other drug

manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The claims in this complaint were similar in nature to the

claims in the Sergeants lawsuit, and those cases were coordinated for discovery purposes. On 14 April 2020, with the consent of the Company and

the other defendants, plaintiǄs MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC and MSPA Claims 1, LLC voluntarily dismissed their claims without prejudice.

In addition, the State of New York Ǉled an antitrust case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case brought by the

State of New York contained some (but not all) of the allegations set forth in the class action complaints, but the Company was not named as a

party. The case brought by the State of New York was dismissed by stipulation on 30 November 2015.

letter to inform Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. that, in light of the

information which had been provided, no further information would be requested at such time in response to this subpoena.

The Company has commenced a detailed investigation into an anonymous complaint. The complaint alleges that healthcare professionals in

Ukraine and potentially in other countries were provided with improper payments by or on behalf of the Company in violation of U.S.

anti-corruption laws, speciǇcally the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A U.S. Law firm is conducting the investigation at the instruction of a

committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. The investigation is ongoing. The Company has disclosed the matter to the US Department of

Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and Securities Exchange Board of India. While the matter may result in government enforcement

actions against the Company in the United States and/or foreign jurisdictions, which could lead to civil and criminal sanctions under relevant laws,

the probability of such action and the outcome are not reasonably ascertainable at this time.

On 15 May 2020, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc., and certain of the Company’s current or former directors and

oǅcers have entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the “Stipulation”) with lead plaintiǄ the Public Employees’ Retirement

System of Mississippi in the putative securities class action Ǉled against the defendants in the United States District Court for the District of

New Jersey. As consideration for the settlement of the class action, the Company has agreed to pay US$9 million.

Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, the settlement resolves the remainder of the litigation.

On 6 July 2016 and 7 August 2016, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. received subpoenas from the DOJ (Anti-trust Division) and the oǅce of the

Attorney General for the State of Connecticut, respectively, seeking information relating to the marketing, pricing and sale of certain of our

generic products and any communications with competitors about such products. On 15 May 2018, another subpoena was served on

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. by the DOJ (False Claims Division) seeking similar information. The Company has been cooperating, and intends to

continue to fully cooperate, with these inquiries.

On 21 March 2019, the District Court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. Pursuant to that decision, the

Court dismissed the plaintiǄs claims with respect to seventeen out of the twenty two alleged misstatements and omissions.

(iv) Securities Class Action Litigation

The settlement is subject to the approval of the court and may be terminated prior to court approval pursuant to the grounds for termination set

forth in the Stipulation. Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, in exchange for the settlement consideration, lead plaintiǄ and members of the

settlement class who do not opt-out of this settlement would release, among other things, the claims that were asserted, or that they could have

asserted, in this class action.

(v) Internal Investigation

Subpoenas from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the oǅce of the Attorne\ *eneral for the State of Connecticut

On 23 December 2020, the court issued a Ǉnal order and judgement approving the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement/court order, the escrow

was funded on 4 January 2021. The eǄective date of the settlement occurred on 1 February 2021, upon transfer of the settlement fund balance into

the Ǉnal escrow account. As the transfer of funds to the Ǉnal escrow account constitutes settlement of liability, the amount of liability has been

derecognised during the three months ended 31 March 2021.

The amount payable to the plaintiǄs on account of the settlement and the corresponding receivable from the insurer have been presented under

“other current Ǉnancial assets” and “other current Ǉnancial liabilities”, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as at

31 March 2020.

2.38 SECONDARY LISTING OF THE COMPANY'S ADR ON NSE IFSC LIMITED

The Company completed the secondary listing of its American Depository Receipts (“ADRs”) on NSE IFSC Limited under the symbol 'DRREDDY' on

9 December 2020. NSE IFSC Limited is a recognised international stock exchange established in the International Financial Services Centre

(“IFSC”) at Gujarat International Finance Tec (“GIFT”) City in Gujarat, India. IFSC is one of the permissible jurisdictions where Depository Receipts

can be listed. This listing will provide a secondary platform (other than NYSE Inc.) to overseas investors for trading in the Company's ADRs. This is a

secondary listing of ADRs that are currently issued by J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A. under its ADR Deposit Agreement with the Company, and no

further capital raising or issuance of new securities is involved.

The Scheme will lead to simpliǇcation of the shareholding structure and reduction of shareholding tiers.

The Promoter Group cumulatively would continue to hold the same number of shares in the Company, pre- and post the amalgamation. All costs,

charges and expenses relating to the Scheme will be borne out of the surplus assets of DRHL. Further, any expense, if exceeding the surplus assets

of DRHL, will be borne directly by the Promoters.

The Scheme also provides that the Promoters of the Company will jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its

directors, employees, oǅcers, representatives, or any other person authorised by the Company (excluding the Promoters) for any liability, claim,

or demand, which may devolve upon the Company on account of this amalgamation.

During year ended 31 March 2020, the scheme of amalgamation of Dr. Reddy's Holdings Limited with the Company was approved by the board of

directors, members and unsecured creditors of the Company. The no-observation letters from the BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of

India Limited were received on the basis of no comments received from Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”). The petition for approval

2.39 MERGER OF DR. REDDY'S HOLDINGS LIMITED INTO DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMITED

2.40 BUSINESS TRANSFER AGREEMENT WITH WOCKHARDT LIMITED

In February 2020, the Company signed a Business Transfer Agreement (“BTA”) with Wockhardt Limited (“Wockhardt”) to acquire select divisions of

its branded generics business in India and the territories of Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives for a consideration of ` 18,500.

The business consists of a portfolio of 62 brands in multiple therapy areas, such as respiratory, neurology, venous malformations, dermatology,

gastroenterology, pain and vaccines. This entire portfolio was to be transferred to the Company, along with related sales and marketing teams, the

manufacturing plant located in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh and all plant employees (together the “Business Undertaking”). The transaction involved

2,051 employees engaged in operations of the acquired Business Undertaking.

As of 31 March 2020, the acquisition of this Business Undertaking was subject to certain closing conditions, such as approval from shareholders

and lenders of Wockhardt and other requisite approvals under applicable statutes. Hence, the transaction was not accounted for in the year ended

31 March 2020.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent government restrictions, there has been a reduction in the revenue from the sales of the

products forming part of the Business Undertaking during March and April 2020. Accordingly, through an amendment to the BTA, the Company

and Wockhardt agreed that the consideration shall now be upto `18,500, to be paid as per the following terms:

a) an amount of ` 14,830 to be paid on the date of closing;

b) an amount of ` 670 to be deposited in an escrow account which shall be released subject to adjustments for, inter alia, net working capital,

employee liabilities and certain other contractual and statutory liabilities;

c) an amount of ` 3,000 (the “Holdback Amount”) which shall be released as follows:

Ÿ If the revenue from sales of the products forming part of the Business Undertaking during the twelve (12) months post-closing exceeds

`4,800, the Company will be required to pay to Wockhardt an amount equal to two (2) times the amount by which the revenue exceeds

` 4,800, subject to the maximum of the Holdback Amount.
