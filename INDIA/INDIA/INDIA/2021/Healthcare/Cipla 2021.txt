Dear Shareholders,

and multilateral agencies,

pharmaceutical companies and

citizens. My heartfelt gratitude to

our employees for their remarkable

dedication, beyond the call of duty,

for working round the clock to help

combat the ongoing challenges of

manufacturing and supply of vital

medicines.

I would like to take this opportunity

to applaud the stellar work being

done by all our managers, staff

and workers throughout India and

our global establishments. Guided

by our legacy and humanitarian

approach, Cipla has once again

been at the forefront in fighting

pandemics, be it HIV/AIDS, Bird-

Flu, Swine-Flu and now COVID-19.

We are providing a wide range

of essential medications and will

continue to do everthing in our

capacity in the relentless battle

to combat COVID-19. India must

overcome this pandemic as quickly

as possible. We consider it our

duty and responsibility to alleviate

pain and provide care. Through

Cipla Foundation, we will continue

to address critical needs of the

community by strengthening

CovidCare facilities, provide

life-saving medical equipment

and bring testing within reach of

patients.

Cipla is a leading partner of choice

for several innovator companies,

who are producing critical drugs

for COVID-19. We have ongoing

partnerships with Gilead, Novartis,

Boehringer Ingelheim, Johnson

partnered with Indian Council

of Medical Research (ICMR),

Council of Scientific & Industrial

Research (CSIR) and many private

organisations such as KARWA,

Premier Medical Corporation

and others for commercialisation

of medicines and diagnostics.

Expanding our role beyond

providing medicines alone, Cipla

is among the leading Indian

pharmaceutical companies offering

solutions against COVID-19 across

the spectrum, which includes

awareness, prevention, diagnosis,

treatment and care.

This is a time for companies like

ours to demonstrate solidarity

and support each other to ensure

Dear Shareholders,

people who have demonstrated

empathy, kindness and grit in

responding to a crisis like this.

This compassion and empathy

helped us build strong teams,

demonstrate greater collaborations,

nurture new generation leaders,

encourage innovation and agility.

It has helped us lean in and listen to

our people, patients, partners and

our stakeholders with the highest

level of responsiveness and highest

levels of collaboration.

The heath and well-being of

our employees is of paramount

importance for us and we are

providing 24*7 ambulance, support

in procuring oxygen concentrators,

consultations & quarantine facilities

in India to help those impacted by

the pandemic. We understand the

severity of the situation and the toll it

takes on our families and their loved

ones. In order to provide a helping

hand to a bereaved employee’s

family we have introduced a

compassionate relief policy in India

that provides medical, financial and

education support.

Stronger Together

Despite all challenges, Cipla

continued to be at the forefront

of care in the global fight against

COVID-19. Your Company is the only

Indian pharmaceutical company

offering solutions against COVID-19

across the care continuum –

including awareness, diagnostics,

treatment & post-covid care.

We forged partnerships and forayed

into the diagnostics space with

the launch of ELIFAST (antibody

detection kit), CIPtest (rapid antigen

test) and ViraGen (RT-PCR) test in

India. For Emerging Markets and

Europe, we collaborated with a

Belgium-based firm Multi G, for

commercialisation of rapid antibody

testing kits. Further, leveraging the

power of collaborations, we were

able to enhance global access to

innovative therapies. Your Company

emerged as a partner of choice for

Roche for their antibody cocktail

(Casirivimab and Imdevimab) and

Tocilizumab, Eli Lily for Baricitinib,

MSD for Molnupiravir, and Gilead

for Remdesivir. We ramped up

production by 5x for critical

COVID-19 drugs like Remdesivir, to

address the surge in demand. During

the year, we swiftly responded to

people reaching out to us on social

media and our helplines and served

over 3,00,000 patients with critical

COVID-19 drugs. As a leader in the

respiratory domain, we lay emphasis

on lung health management and

a non-executive director, and

independent directors. Cipla’s

Global Chief Financial Officer,

Global Head of Quality and the

ERM team, and specific business

leaders essential to the discussions

are invitees to these meetings.

Additionally, the Company’s

senior leadership team undertakes

various risk governance measures

at an operational level. The

ERM team coordinates and

monitors organisation-wide risk

management activities and reports

the progress to the IRMC every

quarter.

While every company, as part

of its risk management strategy,

tries to put in place mitigation

measures to the extent possible,

residual risks cannot be wished

away. We have listed a summarised

account of some of our key risks

and mitigation measures drawn

from management reviews and

deliberations of IRMC.

COVID-19 and Business Continuity

01

The COVID-19 pandemic

continues to pose a significant

threat to the safety of our

workforce. It imposes various

restrictions that impact our supply

chain activities, manufacturing

operations and mobility of

our field staff. However, the

availability of testing, treatment

and inoculation solutions are

positive developments to

consider.

As a global pharmaceutical company, our operations are exposed to a variety of

risks every day. Led by our commitment to 'Caring for Life', we adopt a patient-

centric approach to identify risks and develop mitigation measures. A robust

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework enables us to manage our risks

better. It also tracks significant external developments and internal challenges to

recognise new threats and their potential impact on our risk profile.

a) Workforce safety concerns

In FY 2020-21, a significant

transmission of coronavirus

across our geographies infected

some of our employees. While

most of the affected employees

recovered and resumed work,

some unfortunately succumbed

to the disease.

b) Supply chain disruption

During the last year, a pattern of

voluntary/government enforced

lockdowns at various vendor

locations, limited availability

of logistics services and rising

raw material and transportation

prices were observed in our

supply chain ecosystem. At

times, this posed challenges

around timely availability of raw

material at reasonable costs.

c) Production shortfall

Local lockdowns, government

restrictions, infections amongst

the workforce, and quarantine

requirements led to occasional

labour shortages, posing

a challenge in achieving

production targets.

d) Restricted field marketing

staff mobility

Throughout the reporting

period and across all

geographies that we operate

in, the mobility of our field

marketing associates and

ability to physically visit and

hold product information

discussions with Healthcare

Practitioners (HCPs) were

severely restricted.

amplify the interdependence between and across the

Company functions, to deliver the business outcomes.

Goals are ‘shared’ when two or more functional/business

leaders have a significant impact on the delivery of the

goal. Shared goals foster collaboration, accountability

and a sense of ownership by aligning to the goals

and eliminating siloes to build better appreciation of

priorities. These shared goals focus on both, performance

and long-term health outcomes, for the organisation.

The shared goals are defined on the basis of Cipla’s

winning aspiration and the MD & GCEO’s long-term and

short-term objectives. For each of the shared goals,

we have set out Key Result Areas (“KRAs”) and Key

Performance Indicators (“KPI”) that we aim to meet. These

are embedded into the goal sheets of the respective

Management Council members and are cascaded to

functional leaders and the respective teams to ensure

that everyone is moving together in the same direction to

achieve the common goal.

Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA regarding the Company’s

NDA for IV Tramadol. The CRL cited deficiencies related

to terminal sterilisation validation and stated that IV

Tramadol, intended to treat patients in acute pain who

require an opioid, is not safe for the intended patient

population. On 12th February, 2021, Avenue resubmitted

its NDA to the FDA for IV Tramadol on receipt of

official minutes from a Type A meeting with the FDA.

The resubmission included revised language relating

to the proposed product label and a report relating

to terminal sterilisation validation. The FDA assigned a

PDUFA goal date of 12th April, 2021, however, the FDA

stated that it is still reviewing the NDA resubmission

application. The Group has communicated to Avenue

that it believes a Material Adverse Effect {as defined

in the stock purchase and merger agreement (SPMA)}

citing CRL, impact of COVID-19 and impact on account

of change in product label. In addition, the Group has

retained the right to terminate the SPMA as the second

closing did not happen on or before 30th April, 2021.

Avenue

does

not

generate

revenue

and

has

incurred operating losses since its inception and

expects significant operating losses to continue for

the foreseeable future as it executes its product

development plan. As of 31st March, 2021, Avenue had

an accumulated deficit of USD 74.27 million. Avenue’s

ability to potentially commercialise IV Tramadol, and

the timing of potential commercialisation, is dependent

on the FDA’s review of Avenue’s resubmission of its

NDA for IV Tramadol, ultimate FDA approval, and

potentially, additional capital.

In light of the above events, the Management identified

impairment indicators in relation to the investment

in Avenue. These impairment indicators prompted
