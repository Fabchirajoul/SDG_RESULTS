Dear Shareholders,

We are glad to have concluded the ʱ scal year  on a positive

note marked by robust recovery trends in our non-COVID

business and also maintaining the track record of providing the

best quality diagnostics services to our patients. Notably, we

exited the year with complete revenue recovery while reverting

to the pre-COVID level growth trajectory. Though medicine

has become more evidence based with the infrastructure still

developing, India remains considerably disadvantaged when it

comes to accuracy and availability of reliable diagnostic tests.

This is due to fragmented presence of unorganized players that

lack the technology and desired skill sets to deliver the level

of quality required. At Dr. Lal PathLabs, we have deployed the

best digital infrastructure and highly skilled manpower to offer

a wide variety of services with the state-of-the-art diagnostics at

affordable prices.

The year gone by has witnessed a devastating impact from

COVID- pandemic for India and across the globe. While the

disruptions were quite intense initially due to lockdown, they

became better during the latter part of the year marked by the

return of near normalcy conditions. As the country navigates

through the second wave of the pandemic, strong and reliable

brands like Dr. Lal PathLabs have led by example in COVID

testing. We are better prepared for this surge and have earmarked

separate teams to ensure quality and efʱ ciency as the caseloads

rise signiʱ cantly across major metros in the country. We also

expanded our reach into several key pockets of West and South

India to augment our brand and drive volumes. While doing so,

we have enhanced our services for home collections for COVID

testing and leveraged our digital assets to boost online bookings.

Our three main laboratories, including the National Reference

Lab at Delhi, the Regional Reference Lab at Kolkata and Central

Lab at Indore continue to be the hubs for COVID testing, while

we added 4 more labs to increase our tooth-to-tail-ratio. Our

endeavor is to conduct highly specialized molecular and allied

tests at these labs now and later, once COVID testing volumes

decline.

We have seen a noticeable shift in consumer preference towards

efʱ cient diagnostic chains, especially this year on account of

COVID- pandemic. By virtue of providing excellence to the

scale of our operations, we were able to offer quick turnaround

time for key tests with accurate results thereby cementing our

position as the leading diagnostics player in the country.

While the Government spending on healthcare is still low in

India, it is making progress through various initiatives. In the

8nion Budget F< -, the Finance Minister announced that

under the Pradhan Mantri Aatmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana,

an outlay of over ` 4, crore over the next six years will be

allocated towards ramping up various primary, secondary and:

M A N AG I N G D I R E CTO R: Dear Shareholders,

FY- has been a difʱ cult and a milestone year for humanity with

many of us bearing the brunt of the inclement pandemic at a personal

level. While economy and operations were disrupted due to lock

downs but given the essential nature of our services, we continued to

serve our patients in this hour of crisis. The teams showed resilience

and ʲ exibility underlining continuity of service delivery.

While the ʱ rst half was adversely impacted but we regained

momentum during the second half of the ʱ scal year consequent to

relaxation of the most stringent of restrictions.

Our response has been consistent with the objective of serving the

patient community through dedication, compassion and empathy. In

the ʱ rst phase, we stood shoulder-to-shoulder with our countrymen,

pioneering testing capability in the private domain to diagnose the

COVID- virus. From a single lab at Rohini, Delhi we could ramp up

the network to 4 labs nationally by the end of year and as required,

this process of addition will continue. Prodded by the mandated curbs

on movement or hesitation, patients demonstrated preference for

home collection of samples. Established national networks like DLPL

could step in and meet this need. We also simultaneously augmented

our digital presence, revamped our apps in order to make the patient

experience more seamless. These enhancements will continue to get

implemented by dedicated teams.

We are proud of our teams and how they have risen to the occasion,

often going above and beyond their call off duty. During this hour,

it was also our moral responsibility to ensure that our employees

and their family members felt safe and protected. We supported

them in every manner possible in the discharge of their duties.

We rolled out initiatives to boost morale and ensured that their

welfare requirements were being taken care of. All these initiatives

have strengthened our bond with patients, employees and broader

stakeholder community. At the end of the day, the brand is nothing

but the people behind it.

While the contribution from Delhi-NCR region reduced to approx.

5 during the year, we still remain a very dominant player there

given our reach and scale advantages. This underscores better

realizations and thereby steady margins. During FY, our rest of

India segment demonstrated smart gains, with growth of .4 and

higher contribution of approx. 5 to sales as compared to  last

year. This was a result of our successful geographical diversiʱ cation

strategy as well as the pattern of the pandemic as it gave rise to

samples across States. Other areas in North India like UP, Punjab, J&K

and Haryana contributed another  .4 while the East contributed

., supported by the Kolkata Reference Lab. West and South

brought up the rest, however both regions have recorded gains in

sampling YoY on account of the pandemic.

Aided by the revival in non-COVID segment and supplemented

by COVID testing, revenues for FY enhanced by   YoY. PAT

increased by , with proʱ tability back at pre-COVID levels. During

the year under review, we served . million patients, having

processed 4 . million samples. Our bundled test offering ȟSwasthFit’

continued contributing to volume recovery despite challenges on

ground due to COVID-led disruptions. The share of ȟSwasthFit’ to

Non-COVID revenue has increased to and we believe this will

iii. Creating opportunities for employees to participate in

socially responsible initiatives.

The Company works primarily through its CSR Foundation,

namely, Lal PathLabs Foundation towards carrying out its

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities as covered by

the CSR Policy of the Company.

The Board of Directors of the Company has constituted a

Corporate Social Responsibility Committee to frame, monitor

and execute the CSR activities of the Company as per its CSR

Policy. Some of the key initiatives taken up last year are:

Skill Development in the field of Paramedics:

Skill development in healthcare is a key focus area for us. Lal

PathLabs Foundation is helping in the skilling and employment

of the unemployed rural youths, through well-established

training centers and focused projects, in the area of paramedics.

Key initiatives taken are as follows:

1.

Diploma in medical Laboratory technology: India has

requirement of having a trained healthcare workforce due

to the large population base and geography. Keeping it in

mind and being a leading diagnostic company in the country,

Lal PathLabs Foundation, started skill development projects

in paramedics and healthcare services in various part of the

country, preferably in tier II & III cities, exclusively focusing

on Phlebotomy Technician Training and Diploma in Medical

Laboratory Technology (DMLT). The need of the project

is to provide affordable and quality health diagnostic

solutions intermediaries in rural and remote areas of India.

These trained DMLT and Phlebotomists would act as a link

between the rural patients and the pathology laboratories,

diagnostic centres, hospitals and doctors. This is being done

by providing dignified and sustainable livelihoods to rural

youths and bridging the gap of trained paramedical health

staff in rural and remote part of the country.

Lal PathLabs Foundation is running DMLT course in Gurugram

(Haryana) and Kolkata (West Bengal). The project known as

“Institute of Laboratory Medicine” offers specialized course

in laboratory technology. The institute is affiliated to the

Indian Medical Association (IMA) for DMLT course. We are

providing quality and standard training as per norms laid

down by the IMA to unemployed underprivileged youths.

Candidates with 10+2 passed with science background

want to make their career in allied health services are

the ideal for the course. Objective of the project is to get

hands on learning experience in world-class state-of-the-

art laboratory with automated equipment that conforms to

the highest international standard. Lal PathLabs Institute of

Laboratory Medicine owes its origin to Dr. Lal PathLabs Ltd.,

India’s leading and the most reputed diagnostic chain, that

has been giving its customers a reason to smile for over 70

years, through deliverance of highly accurate and advanced

pathology solutions. During the financial year 2020-21 we

enrolled total 100+ candidates, trained 68, certified 64 and

successfully placed 30 candidates.

2.

Short Term Phlebotomy Technician Certification Course:

To bridge the gap of skilled work force in paramedics in

India, Lal PathLabs Foundation cautiously started flagship

program named “Academy for Laboratory Medicine” where

we are running Phlebotomy Technician Training Centers

in collaboration with implementing partners - ‘Institute

of Livelihood Research and Training’ (brand name B Able)

and Sambhav Foundation (brand name LabourNet). These

centres affiliated and candidates are certified by NSDC

- HSSC. Candidates who are 12th passed with science

background are enrolled for this short-term Phlebotomy

Technician

course. After

training

and

certification,

placement assistance is provided to them. Objectives of this

flagship programme is to train unemployed rural youths

in Phlebotomy Technician, connect them with available

job opportunities in their local geographical areas. This

course aims to provide dignified and sustainable livelihood.

In addition, it is to bridge the gap of skilled workforce in

paramedics, raise healthcare awareness and benefits of

early diagnostics, quality and affordable health diagnostic

solution in rural community at every doorstep by linking

pathology labs, diagnostic centres, hospitals and doctors.

We had total 10 Phlebotomy Technician Training Centres

during financial year 2020-21 in Lucknow, Varanasi,

Gorakhpur, Kanpur and Meerut in UP; Bhopal, Jabalpur and

Indore in MP; Jaipur and Udaipur in Rajasthan. We were

able to successfully train 1000+ candidates and place

approx. 75% of the certified candidates until March 2021.

healthcare initiatives:

Healthcare is another important focus area for Lal PathLabs

Foundation. Some of the key inactivates taken in this area are as

follow:

1.

non communicable Diseases (ncDs) management: India

is experiencing a rapid health transition with a rising

burden of Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs). NCDs

cause significant morbidity and mortality both in urban

and rural population, with considerable loss in potentially

productive years (aged 35–64 years) of life. Burden of Non-

Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and resultant morbidity

and mortality is expected to increase unless massive

efforts are made to prevent and control NCDs and their

risk factors. Based on available evidence, cancer, diabetes,

hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic

obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease, mental

disorders and trauma are leading cause of morbidity,

disability and mortality in India.:

In February 2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India vide its judgment and subsequent dismissal of the review petition in August 2019

had ruled in respect of compensation for the purpose of Provident Fund contribution under the Employee’s Provident Fund Act. The

Company has assessed possible outcomes of the judgment on determination of provident fund contributions and based on the legal

opinion obtained and current evaluation, the Company believes it is not probable that certain components paid by the Company will be

subject to payment of Provident Fund due to the Supreme Court order. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate its position

based on future events and developments.

48. The Indian Parliament has approved the Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘the Code’) which, inter alia, deals with employee benefits during
