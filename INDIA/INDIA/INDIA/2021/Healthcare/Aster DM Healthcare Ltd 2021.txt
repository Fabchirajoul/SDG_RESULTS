III. Other information:

(1) Reasons of loss or inadequate profits: The Company, on a

standalone basis, has only four hospitals- Aster Medcity

at Kochi, Aster CMI, Aster RV and Aster Whitefield at

Bengaluru. Aster RV hospital has commenced in the last

2-3 years and Aster Whitefield has commenced last year

and the losses have occurred in their ramp up phase.

(2) Steps taken or proposed to be taken for improvement: In

the normal course of operations a hospital, being capital

intensive in nature, reaches a break even in 3-5 year of

its operations. The revenue of the hospitals has been

increasing year on year and is expected to further improve.

(3) Expected increase in productivity and profits in measurable

terms: Q1 and Q2 of FY 2020-21 were severally impacted

due to COVID-19 first wave resulting in stopping all OPD

and elective surgeries in our hospitals. This has impacted

overall revenue for H1 FY 2020-21. However, during H2

FY 2020-21, we have seen positive growth in revenue as

compared to previous year due to businesses returning

back to normal.

Dear Shareholders,

Our new business

vertical Aster Labs

in India, which is

a NABL accredited

lab with ICMR

approval for

RT-PCR testing for

COVID-19, saw a

good momentum

in volumes.”

We had to continuously rethink, re-evaluate and redesign our

strategies in order to meet with changing conditions due to the

pandemic. As Friedrich Nietzsche, the great German philosopher

said, “That which does not kill us, makes us stronger”, the testing

times also proved the resilience of our team and business model.

Though we saw some impact on our financials the effect was

marginal and we are on a stronger footing than before.

The year was extremely unsettling for everyone, for us what

was of crucial importance was to proactively provide sustainable

healthcare to the society. Our first and primary focus was to

ensure continuity of business operations, so that we could

ensure best possible healthcare for our patients. We took

multiple steps in that direction, and adopted best possible

practices, formulated standardised and evidence-based

The last year has been one of the most

challenging year in world history, and

our commitment to provide quality

healthcare at affordable cost has

never been of more importance to us

and the countries and communities we

serve. Since the pandemic struck, each

Asterian has been tenaciously working

to ensure that we provide the best

possible healthcare to each patient.

Managing Director

by 1% to H 8,608 crore in FY 2020-21,

compared to H 8,652 crore in FY 2019-

20. Our PAT (post NCI) stood at H 148

crore during the year under review. Our

GCC operations continued to be major

contributors to the overall business,

accounting for 81% of the total revenue.

Our employees are our real strength

and we remained focussed on guarding

all Asterians against the COVID-19. Our

heart goes out to every healthcare hero

who worked relentlessly to save lives and

often have risked his/her own lives in their

line of duty. In the year under review, we

have announced 10-year salary support

for families of employees who died of

COVID-19. This shall be applicable to all

employees of Aster in India and GCC who

lost their lives due to COVID-19 or those

who may succumb, God forbid, to the

disease in future. I feel happy to announce

that we have managed to fully vaccinate

84% of our employees till 15th June 2021.

Looking ahead, I believe Aster DM

Healthcare is poised to embark on an

exciting journey. With our hospital in the

Caribbean, we are expanding into the

Western Hemisphere and unfolding a new

chapter in Aster’s history. In tandem with

our strategy towards achieving Vision

2030, we signed an agreement with

Cayman Islands Government to build Aster

Cayman Medcity, a 150-bed Multispecialty

Hospital over the next three years along

with an Assisted Living facility and a

Medical University in the long term. The

project would cater to the entire Caribbean

Region, America & Canada and introduce

the world to Aster’s world-class tertiary

and quaternary care bolstered by our

clinical and service excellence.

With the advent of the second wave in the

last quarter, GCC operations faced multiple

disruptions. Strict lockdowns, night curfews,

travel restrictions and bans at international

borders impacted our businesses,

particularly in UAE. But the positive news,

however, is that the vaccination drive in

Aster DM Healthcare Limited

Annual Report 2020-21

Corporate Overview

05:

Dear Shareholders,

Let me begin by first expressing how honoured I am

to be a part of Aster DM Healthcare. The resilience

and dedication shown by each team member inspires

me every day. The psychological impact along with

constant threat of possible health scare, was huge

but even then our teams kept going with renewed

dedication each day to win against this pandemic.

The year was a difficult one, personally and

professionally for everyone across the globe. As

countries in which we operate went into lockdowns,

we spent the initial weeks addressing and adapting to

the rapidly changing local circumstances. Our primary

focus was to switch over to telemedicine, reduce

mortality and morbidity, sustain our revenue streams

and ensure a robust liquidity in the system.

We believe that digital expertise is the future of

healthcare and wellness and are committed to

creating solutions that go beyond the literal meaning

of healthcare. Because our patient care outreach

is currently limited to hospitals, clinics, labs, and

pharmacies, we are always looking for methods to

break down these barriers and establish a ubiquitous

model of clicks and bricks. With resilience, we have

shifted a large part of our back-office work to a

shared service center in India and

took proactive measures towards

creation of digital assets.

On the technology front, we

initiated key innovative projects

aimed at suporting people and

their families with the necessary

knowledge and assistance to deal

with the pandemic. For instance,

we recently invested in a new

application development called

“Aster Health” that will serve as our

coordinated way of engagement

with our patient base for their

wellness. It shall have Teleconsult,

e-Pharmacy, Chronic Disease

Management and create various

themes to support patient care.

Our attempt to help people adjust

to the New Normal Living through

our new microsite- Our New

Earth also emerged as a one-

stop go-to solution for people

seeking practical and yet medically

verified guidance on topics ranging

from ways to safeguard against

COVID-19 in everyday routines,

assisting children and high-risk

groups, to providing guidance for

COVID-19 recovered patients to

adjust back to normal routine. It

acquired a lot of traction in the

GCC, India, and neighbouring

countries like Sri Lanka,

Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and

Iraq, with about 450,000 website

visitors and 20% plus return

visitors in a span of 10 months.

Even amidst the pandemic, we

continued our drive to maintain

our clinical excellence, achieving

some significant milestones which

need a special mention. We have

made huge strides in Transplant

services and Neurosciences. All our

seven Global Centres of Excellence

have been virtually connected,

now our entire clinical team can

come together to leverage on our

collective strengths and dreams to

be the global best.

As part of our inorganic expansion strategy,

we have entered into a partnership with

Roche Middle East, the world leader in

biotechnology, as a strategic partner across

the UAE, Qatar, KSA, Oman and Bahrain. This

collaboration will empower Aster hospitals,

clinics, and laboratories across the region to

adopt the latest diagnostic innovation and

solutions to support doctors in providing

optimal treatment solution to their patients.

We have also taken another giant step

towards global excellence by inking

the agreement to establish our Clinical

Excellence Hub in the Western Hemisphere,

at Cayman Islands in the Caribbean region.

In tough times like these, it is

unquestionably necessary to not only

unify our team mates for the shared goal

of tending towards our patients, but also

to let them know that they are our Heroes

for serving the people in need of the hour.

To that end, we started the Aster Salutes

Everyday Heroes programme, a group-wide

initiative that highlights the outstanding

work done by Asterians across geographies.

Being constantly motivated by the promise

of ‘We’ll Treat You Well’, we have also

continued to provide quality services

across the communities we serve across

the world. From our contributions to the

Kerala Chief Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund,

the distribution of free masks to spread

awareness regarding COVID-19, bolstering

of the UAE front line workforce by flying in

88 ICU nurses, to catering for the emergency

evacuation of critically-ill patients from

Yemen - there have been numerous acts of

valour which we are all proud of.

In conclusion, I want to again convey my

deepest appreciation to each Asterian for

the commitment and passion with which

they have stepped up and gone beyond the

call of duty in this challenging year.

Alisha Moopen

While writing this note, I am filled with pride and gratitude

for the consistent support that every one of you has

shown towards our shared purpose of building a better

and sustainable future for everyone. Today, despite the

recurrent Covid-19 scenario and unforeseen challenges,

Aster has been able to reach out to the masses with a

helping hand along with world-class medical care. We, as

Asterians, have been able to serve humanity when it needed

us the most, and that should make each one of us feel proud.

Our commitment to the attainment of UN SDGs is

reflected through the remarkable Environmental, Social

and Governance (ESG) performance achieved in these

testing times. I feel humbled and proud of our Aster staff,

Aster Volunteers (both internal and external), well-wishers

and supporters who made a significant effort towards

supporting our communities during the time of crisis.

The Aster Volunteers, our global CSR programme has impacted

additional 1.3 million+ lives in the last financial year. We

extended 195,990 free dialysis services through our associate

community dialysis centres, 84,350 people benefitted from our

Mobile Medical Clinics and large numbers of free surgeries &

medical investigations worth millions have been extended to

the underprivileged and needy. Out of the 250 Aster Homes

promised, 134 homes were delivered to the victims of the

2018 Kerala Floods in India, and the rest are being built to be

handed over shortly.

Our COVID-19 community support program benefitted

900,000+ individuals: We distributed 318,490 food and

ration kits, 15,486 PPE kits, 16,697 distress calls were

attended to help people get medical and emotional support,

and 500,000+ people benefitted through our webinars &

online awareness sessions and 93,980 individuals benefitted

from our mobile medical services in various geographies

during the ongoing crisis.

One of the important achievements we have is the area of

gender parity 60% out of the 21,933 staff that we have are

females. We also have extended our support for the people

with special needs, employing 114 of them as Asterians.

While being devoted to the service of people and the community,

we also remained committed to our environmental initiatives.

At 11 of our hospitals, we reduced electricity consumption

vis a vis last year and saved 5.7 GWh of electricity. Our water

consumption was also reduced across 9 hospitals, and we

saved 70,000 Kilo litres of water, and almost 1 million litres of

wastewater was reused post-treatment. We initiated a 2,358

MWh renewable solar PV project in the UAE and contracted an

ESCO to undertake energy efficiency projects at our hospitals.

Last year, we also introduced diagnostic services in India

through Aster Labs, which is fast expanding across the 5 States

that we are present in. Digitization and use of technology are

being adopted as an integral part of our business to ensure that

we remain ahead of the curve and serve patients as per their

needs. Our Aster Innovation and Research Centre is ensuring

that we introduce innovative solutions to ensure access to

quality care for a wider number of people. Aster e-Consult

service (telehealth), E-ICU, Teleradiology are some of the

services that have been implemented across geographies.

Aster received multiple recognitions in CSR and Sustainability

front, including the Excellence in CSR Awards (6 Stars) from

IBPC (International Best Practice Certification) - New Zealand,

Arabia CSR Awards and Dubai CSR label. We have been

continuously recognized by the Government of Kerala in India

for our waste management practices and pollution control.

We know that our work is not done yet, and there is a lot more

to be achieved, with a large number of people and communities

requiring support along with planet earth to be taken care of

tenderly. Let us work for a new tomorrow to shape a future for the

coming generations through sustainability as the centre point.

I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to all Asterians, Aster

Volunteers and other Stakeholders for working towards a

sustainable and inclusive world.
