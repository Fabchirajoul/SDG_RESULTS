ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22:

Dear Shareholders,

The last two years have witnessed unprecedented

disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lives, health

and businesses across the world were affected.

As I write this: letter, India has administered more than

2.03 Billion doses of vaccination. Without a doubt, this has

been one of India’s greatest healthcare achievements and

the Government’s judiciousness played a role in keeping

morbidity under tight control. While the various mutations

of the virus will continue to affect lives and businesses, I am

optimistic that science will be able to considerably mute the

effects of the virus globally.

Consequently, economies across the globe are on their

post-COVID-19 recovery path. This is especially true for India.

The Government of India’s latest estimate suggests that

real GDP growth has recovered well after a contraction of

6.6% in FY21 to grow by 8.7% in FY22. If one were to look at

the estimate by World Economic Outlook (WEO) published

by International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April 2022, India

is expected to record the highest GDP growth in FY22

compared to any other advanced or major emerging market

economy, including China.

Having said so, the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine

war cannot be overlooked. The IMF has scaled down world

economic growth for 2022 by 80 basis points to 3.6% and

this could reduce further if the war continues. While these

negative economic trends are likely to have a spill-over

effect on India, we are on a strong recovery path and hope

to recoup from the after-effects of the war soon enough.

letter and

spirit. This report, along with Management Discussion & Analysis

Report and additional shareholders’ information provides the

details of implementation of the Corporate Governance practices

by your Company as contained in SEBI (Listing Obligations and

Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended from

time to time (‘Listing Regulations’).

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PHILOSOPHY

Info Edge’s philosophy on Corporate Governance envisages

accomplishment of a high level of transparency, integrity,

honesty and accountability in the conduct of its businesses and

puts due prominence towards regulatory compliances. At Info

Edge, Corporate Governance is considered as a benchmark for

efficient working of Board of Directors, Management Reviews,

Strong Control Procedures and a guiding culture for employees.

The Company’s governance structure is designed to provide

a framework for the successful implementation of business

ethos.

Your Company always strives to adopt best global practices in

Corporate Governance and remains abreast with the continuous

developments in the industry’s Corporate Governance systems.

The entire framework is governed by a strong Board of Directors

and executed by a committed team of management and

employees.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

A quality Board, being at the core of its Corporate Governance

practice, plays the most pivotal role in overseeing how the

management serves and protects the long-term interests of

all stakeholders. Info Edge firmly believes that an active, well-

informed and independent Board is necessary to ensure the

highest standards of Corporate Governance to bring objectivity

and transparency in the management.

sElEctION OF thE bOarD: In terms of the requirement of the

provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘ the Act’), and provisions

of the Listing Regulations, the Nomination and Remuneration

Committee has been designated to evaluate the need for change

in the composition and size of the Board of the Company and to

select members to fill Board vacancies based on defined criteria

and nominating candidates for election by the shareholders.

cOmpOsItION OF thE bOarD: Info Edge’s Board consists

of an optimal combination of Executive Directors and Non-

executive Directors including Independent Directors and Women

Directors with varied professional backgrounds, representing a

judicious mix of professionalism, knowledge and experience.

As on March 31, 2022, the Company’s Board comprised of 10

(ten) Directors, of which three were Executive Directors, six

were Independent Directors (including two women Directors)

constituting 60% of the Board’s strength and one was a

Non-executive, Non-Independent Director. The Chairman of

the Board is a Non-executive, Non-promoter Director. Also,

in the opinion of the Board, the Independent Directors fulfill

the conditions specified in the Listing Regulations and are

independent from the management.

Even though, Regulation 17 of the Listing Regulations states

that if the Chairperson of the Board is a Non-executive, Non-

promoter Director, only one-third of the Board is required to be

independent, Info Edge has, believing in the significance of an

Independent Board, ensured that 60% of its Board members were

Independent Directors as on March 31, 2022.

In addition, there is a segregation between the position of the

CEO and the Chairman.:

ExEcutIvE lEaDErshIp:

In order to regulate external commitments of Whole-time

Directors and that of executive leadership of the Company, your

Company has adopted a policy-‘Policy for Personal Investments

and Engagement by Executive Leadership with other Entities’,

defining the limitations and approval process in relation to
