(CEO and MD).

TCoC5 for non-executive directors, and for independent directors,

carries explicit clauses covering avoidance of conflict of interest.

Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any employee – including the: Managing Director and executive directors – from accepting any

position of responsibility, with or without remuneration, with any

other organization without TCS’ prior written approval. For executive

directors and the Managing Director, such approval must be obtained

from the Board.

Values, Ethics and

compliance6

Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated

very principled conduct and has earned its reputation for trust and

integrity while building a highly successful global business.

The Company’s core values are: Leading Change, Integrity, Respect

for the Individual, Excellence, and Learning and Sharing.

The TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for

responsible corporate citizenship. It sets out guidelines on various

topics including respect for human rights, prohibition of bribery and

corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association, and

avoidance of conflicts of interest.

Every employee is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining

the Company. Annual refresher courses are mandated to ensure

continued awareness of the Code. Further, frequent communications

from the leadership reiterate the importance of the company values

and the TCoC.

6 GRI 2-12

Material Topic

TCS’ Approach

Customers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract

discussions, and through inclusion of specific clauses in proposals and

contracts.

Employees can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet

portal of the Company, which are investigated and tracked to closure

by the HR department. Employees and other stakeholders can also

report any non-compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by

senior executives directly to the

letter of the tax laws and regulations in all countries in which

it operates. Compliance is achieved through a robust compliance

reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on

minimizing the tax risk. TCS has zero tolerance towards tax evasion,

or the facilitation of tax evasion, by itself or by its employees or

vendors.

TCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments

and tax authorities worldwide. Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance

clearance from tax authorities on the proposed tax treatment of

transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes.

The Group has identified business segments (‘industry vertical’) as reportable

segments. The business segments comprise: 1) Banking, Financial Services

and Insurance, 2) Manufacturing, 3) Retail and Consumer Business,

4) Communication, Media and Technology, 5) Life Sciences and Healthcare

and 6) Others such as Energy, Resources and Utilities, s-Governance and

Products.

Revenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under

each reportable segment. Expenses which are not directly identifiable to

each reporting segment have been allocated on the basis of associated

revenue of the segment or manpower efforts. All other expenses which are

not attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as unallocable

expenses.

The assets and liabilities of the Group are used interchangeably amongst

segments. Allocation of such assets and liabilities is not practicable and any

forced allocation would not result in any meaningful segregation. Hence assets

and liabilities have not been identified to any of the reportable segments.
