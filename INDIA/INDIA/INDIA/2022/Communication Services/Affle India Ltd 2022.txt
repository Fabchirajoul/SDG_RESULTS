REIMAGINING FUTURE - STRENGTHENED

further strengthened our moat, enabled greater

AFFLE2.0 CULTURE ENABLED GROWTH

Entrepreneurial Passion, Conviction and

Commitment are profound catalysts of Afﬂe2.0

culture of tech innovation and sustainable

proﬁtable growth. It fortiﬁes Afﬂe’s purpose to

‘Enable a Sustainable Connected Ecosystem’ and

instills in us greater responsibility and

accountability to deliver cash ﬂow positive long-

term growth for all our stakeholders. We

consciously made efforts towards enhancing our

team capabilities in India and notably investing in

it. We also built local on-ground presence in some

of the international geographies like South East

Asia, Middle East Africa and Latin American

markets to augment the next level of growth in

the long-run. We continued our focus on talent

building and empowering our teams

with futuristic capabilities that further

augmented our reputation as a go-to digital

transformation partner for leading brands

across our high-growth industry verticals.

ROBUST PERFORMANCE

We continued our growth momentum

to perform well across all the business

and ﬁnancial metrics in FY2021-22 and

registered a growth of 109.3% y-o-y in

our Revenue from Operations. Our

Proﬁt After Tax (attributable to equity

holders of the parent) increased by

58.7% y-o-y and Normalized PAT

increased by 77.8% y-o-y. I am incredibly

proud that in the last 5 ﬁnancial years since

FY2018 since our initial DRHP was ﬁled, our

team has delivered over 6.5X growth in topline

and proﬁtability, a fact which stands further

grounded given it was a consistent y-o-y growth

that we continue to invest to drive long-term

sustainable growth through technology

innovation, market expansion and consolidation.

SUCCESSFUL TECH ACQUISITIONS

Tech acquisitions and investments are an integral

part of our future-back Afﬂe2.0 growth strategy.

We have an outstanding track record of unlocking

an all-round proﬁtable growth for the acquired

companies by successfully turning them around

over a period of time. We derive signiﬁcant

synergies with these platforms and see them

further strengthening our competitive moat.

GOOD GOVERNANCE

We continue to benchmark our governance, ESG

practices and ﬁnancial reporting with industry-

leading standards. Our proactive adoption of ESG

in FY2020-21 and perpetual initiatives toward

enabling a sustainable well-governed ecosystem

reinforces our commitment towards inclusive

value creation for the stakeholders and the

society at large. As a testament, we appointed
