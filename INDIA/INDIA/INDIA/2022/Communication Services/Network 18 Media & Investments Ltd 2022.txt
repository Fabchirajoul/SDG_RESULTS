High on digital desire

It is an increasingly dynamic world where consumer attention spans are shortening

continuously. The business landscape is highly aggressive and competition for

acquiring consumers has reached a crescendo. Globalization and localization are

happening simultaneously, and mass and niche are growing in parallel. In this

increasingly high-pitched battle, reach, engagement and diversity define the success

of a content platform. Today, content consumption is all about seamless cross-platform

viewing for most content and destination-based viewing for exclusive content, all

encompassed in an immersive experience with a touch of personalization.

Teaming up for

TOMORROW

A collective future which envisions

this, backed by a holistic approach to

make it accessible to our consumers,

fuels our beliefs at Network18.

Continuous innovations

in content, expanding our offerings,

creating brands that command

loyalty from audiences, and

establishing strong competitive

positions across genres, are some

of the key pillars of our strategy at

Network18. As one of India’s largest

media powerhouses, our mission is

to provide top-drawer content across

genres, regions and languages. While

our approach is channel-agnostic,

given the explosive growth in digital

consumption, we are focused on

strengthening our presence in the

digital space, in both news and

entertainment genres. We aim to

lead this digital transformation journey

with the help of our diverse portfolio

offerings. A cumulative reach of 700+

mn TV viewers and 250+ mn digital

consumers every month bears witness

to how teaming together has helped

us stand out and stay ahead of the

competition.:

LETTER TO

SHAREHOLDERS

The year gone by was a remarkable one

for your Company as it delivered its finest

operating and financial performance ever.

Not only did we scale new heights on

operating front, our profitability metrics

also achieved new levels. This is the result

of a well-defined strategy and a step-by-

step execution over the last few years. It

is no mean feat that this was achieved as

the economy and industry faced two of

the toughest years, affected by a global

pandemic the like of which has never

been witnessed before. Our experience of

last year had prepared us well to keep the

operations running uninterrupted while

maintaining the safety of our employees,

despite the resurgence of pandemic. We

continued with work from home policy

and made arrangements for healthcare and

vaccinations for all employees and their

families. And our people responded by

putting their best foot forward, pushing the

Company towards historical performance,

amidst an improving economic

environment.

The contours of the country’s media

landscape have been changing, with the

waves of digitization chipping away at

old ways and creating new. It is a great

opportunity for a Company like ours,

with a strong presence in both traditional

and new media segments, to lead this

transformational journey into the future.

And it is with an eye on this future that

our entertainment business, Viacom 18,

announced a partnership with Bodhi Tree,

Reliance and Paramount. This partnership

will not only enable the Company to

invest in scaling up its digital, sports

and other businesses, it will also bring

the invaluable experience of industry

veterans and distribution reach of a big

digital platform on board. We had already

started making investments for future

with expansion into sports and scaling

up of the digital business in the last fiscal,

and this partnership has the potential to

take Viacom 18 into the next phase of

growth, on the way to becoming one of

India’s largest broadcasting and streaming

companies. Viacom 18’s acquisition of

exclusive digital rights of IPL for the next 5

seasons is a massive step forward in

this journey.

We are also taking initiatives to make our

news businesses future-ready. With the

largest news portfolio in the country, in

both TV and Digital segments, our aim is to

become the most trusted source of news

for our audience. We are harnessing the

collaborative power of both our platforms

to deliver consumer-first news. We are

expanding our coverage along the dual

axes of width and depth to provide a 360o

coverage of events to our consumers

across the country – from national and

regional news to global and local round-

up. Our initiatives of going hyperlocal and

creating an integrated newsroom are laying

the foundations for us to stay relevant in

a fast-changing media landscape where

consumers’ trust and the ability to reach

them at multiple touchpoints will be

key to success.

As the country comes out of the impact

of pandemic, economic outlook, at least

in the short-term, looks soft due to events

beyond control. However, as a country,

we have shown in the past our ability to

partially insulate our story from the rest of

the world. India has taken massive steps

over the last few decades to set itself up for

a long-term growth and we believe that

this current phase will be a minor bump

on the road to sustained progress. As one

of India’s youngest media companies,

we endeavor to play a strong role in this

growth journey and transform ourselves

into becoming a platform of choice for

consumers across the country.

Key Audit Matter

Auditor’s Response

Carrying values of investments in a subsidiary and an associate

Investments in a subsidiary and an associate are accounted for

at cost less impairment, where applicable, in the Company’s

standalone financial statements.

Investments are tested for impairment if impairment indicators

exist. If such indicators exist, the recoverable amounts of the

investments in a subsidiary and an associate are estimated in

order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.

Any such impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of

Profit and Loss.

Principal audit procedures performed:

Our audit procedures included a combination of testing the

design, implementation and operating effectiveness in respect

of management’s assessment of existence of indicators of

impairment and where applicable, determination of recoverable

amounts to measure the impairment provision that needs to be

accounted for.

Our substantive testing procedures included evaluation of

appropriateness of management’s estimates and judgment

whether any indicators of impairment existed by reviewing

financial and other available information / data, if any, of a

subsidiary and an associate as at March 31, 2022.

exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least

twelve months after the reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when -

– It is expected to be settled in normal operating

cycle;

– It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;

– It is due to be settled within twelve months after

the reporting period, or

– There is no unconditional right to defer the

settlement of the liability for at least twelve months

after the reporting period.

The Company classifies all other liabilities as

non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-

current assets and liabilities.

(b)

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost, net

of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less

accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if

any. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing cost

and any cost directly attributable to bringing the assets

to its working condition for its intended use.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s

carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset,

as appropriate, only when it is probable that future

economic benefits associated with the item will flow to

the entity and the cost can be measured reliably.

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is

provided using straight-line method. Depreciation is

provided based on useful life of the assets as prescribed

in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. Leasehold

improvements are depreciated over the period of lease

agreement or the useful life whichever is shorter.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of

depreciation of property, plant and equipment are

reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted

prospectively, if appropriate.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of a

property, plant and equipment are measured as the

difference between the net disposal proceeds and

the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised

in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset

is derecognised.:
