Dear Shareholders,

The financial year 2021-2022 embodied resilience and change at ZEE. The hallmarks

of any transformation demand the elements of choice and action, and we at ZEE took

this as an opportunity to challenge the status quo and shape a new tomorrow. The

fundamentals of our business are resolute on agility, speed, and efficiency, which have

further been strengthened over the years impacted by the pandemic. This enabled

us to remain steadfast amidst challenging situations during the year, facing the

macroeconomic headwinds, and each time manoeuvring our sails swiftly. We ensured

that a sharp focus was maintained on delivering delight to our consumers and value to

all our stakeholders.

During the year, we adapted our business strategies to the changing industry

dynamics, to take advantage of new opportunities across the media and entertainment

sector and further grow the business. As we reimagine the future of the business,

transformative success will be our ultimate competitive advantage. This will not only

redefine our future, but will also enable us to shape the future of entertainment across

the globe.

Building a better tomorrow

We are witnessing the rules of the game are

being written and re-written every day. This is the

fastest-changing phase of the M&E landscape

that we have witnessed. Thirty years ago, we did

not have access to a gamut of content across

devices. Today, we cannot imagine a life without

fresh, original content being served to us on

a daily basis. This change is being driven by a

confluence of content, technology, opportunity,

reach and demand.

In order to succeed in this new context, we must

strike the right balance between heterogenous

content and immersive technology to harbour

the ability to constantly serve the several

consumer cohorts that exist. Rather than treating

it as an external disrupting factor, we have

embraced change as a core business capability.

Rather than

factor, we have

capability.

Message from MD and CEO’s Desk

We have consistently been taking strategic

steps towards this transformation, and we took

a big leap in this direction during the year by

announcing the proposed merger between

your Company and Culver Max Entertainment

Private Limited (formerly Sony Pictures Networks

India Private Limited). I firmly believe that this

merger will enable us to drive scale and build

a more sustainable, innovative and profitable

M&E company from the emerging markets. The

content consumption and creation ecosystem

is also witnessing mega-shifts and a powerful

merged entity will allow us to compete more

effectively, especially in the realm of digital

entertainment, where increasing adoption and

technology-led innovations are driving higher

growth. Together, we will create a scalable

business model focused on creating engaging

content, helping advertisers reach their

audiences across multiple touch points, driving

customer acquisition across linear and digital

platforms, synergistic distribution, and effective

monetisation streams across markets. Even as

the teams work incessantly towards seeking

the necessary legal and regulatory approvals,

we stay committed to building the merged

company with customer focus, value generation,

profitability, and talent as the core tenets.

INDIAN MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT

INDUSTRY

With India’s COVID-19 vaccination drive

witnessing an unprecedented response of over

1.9 billion doses administered and more than 87

crore people fully vaccinated, lockdown norms

were gradually relaxed.

While nominal GDP grew by 19.5% in FY22,

M&E advertising revenue grew 25.4% in CY21,

outpacing GDP growth. Advertising-to-GDP

ratio saw an increase from 0.30% to 0.32% in

CY21, and is expected to reach 0.36% by CY24,

as per the FICCI:EY report.

Post a pandemic-hit CY20, the revenue of the

M&E industry grew by 16.4% YoY, to ₹ 1,614

billion in CY21, but was still 11% below CY19

levels. Apart from digital media, revenue from

all other media came in below CY19 levels. With

continued social distancing norms for a large

part of CY21, the movie exhibition and live

events segment remained ~50% below CY19.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

During the year under review, your Company, like almost every

other company, faced fair share of volatility and uncertainty due to

COVID-19 pandemic. The year started amidst a very intense second

wave of COVID-19 and this disrupted content creation and production,

delayed theatrical releases and dented overall consumer confidence

and curtailed advertising spending by Brands. Post a pandemic hit

CY 20, the revenue of the Indian Media & Entertainment industry grew

in CY 21 but remains lower than pre-pandemic levels. As per FICCI EY

report, CY 21 industry revenues grew by 16.4% YoY to ₹ 1,614 billion,

but are still 11% below CY 19 levels.

Your Company advertising revenue recorded 17.3% growth in FY22

on the back of its strong market position, broad bouquet of channel

offerings and strong relationships with brands and advertisers

in the key segments. Subscription revenues marginally declined

during the year. A softer performance in TV subscription was offset

by higher subscription revenues from ZEE5. One of the significant

factors hindering subscription revenue growth is the embargo on

any change in channel / bouquet pricing by broadcasters till NTO 2.0

(New Tariff Order) is implemented. In absence of a clear way ahead on

NTO 2.0, near-term outlook for subscription growth remains subdued.

However, longer-term growth outlook continues to be strong. Your

Company will continue to monitor NTO 2.0 guidelines and implement

the same for improved revenue outcome.

ZEE5 has firmly established itself as the biggest publisher of original

digital content in India, catering to audiences across the country and

Indian diaspora globally. ZEE5 capitalised on this trend by releasing

over 45+ original on the platform during the year which has led to a

growth in its paid subscriber base.

During the first half of the year, theatrical launches of movies were halted

due to the second wave of COVID-19. However, in the second half of

the year, with theatres re-opening, movies business was a key pillar of

the recovery in the media & entertainment sector. At ZEE as well, your

studios business performed remarkably well during latter part of the

year, with films across languages including The Kashmir Files (Hindi),

Valimai (Tamil), Qismat 2’ (Punjabi), ‘Pandu’ (Marathi) and ‘Bangarraju’

(Telugu) garnering an extremely positive reception at the box office.

As per FICCI-EY report, the Indian M&E industry is expected to grow

at a CAGR of 13% to reach ₹ 2,320 billion by 2024.

In the Domestic Broadcast Business, your Company exited the year

with an all India viewership share of 17.1% in the last quarter and we

continued to be amongst India’s strong and leading TV entertainment

networks.

Further, with ZEE’s portfolio of 48 channels which caters to the diverse

Indian audience across the country, we built on our strong language

leadership to be among the top TV entertainment networks in 7 out

of the 9 local markets where we are present.

The Company continues to focus its energies on evolving the content

offerings to reflect the changing consumer needs, and significant

efforts are directed towards other markets including Hindi, Marathi

and Tamil with an aim to further strengthen our linear viewership share.

In the International Broadcast Business, your Company continued

to expand the reach of its channels across geographies with new

distribution partnerships. Company’s content in 18 languages,

including 8 foreign languages, is available in more than 170+ countries.

ZEE5, your Company’s OTT platform, witnessed significant growth

across all user parameters. The platform had 104.8 million and

10.5 illion global MAUs and DAUs, respectively in March 2022,

with an average watch-time of 214 minutes per viewer during the

month. Along with releasing a strong slate of original shows and

movies, the platform also entered into partnerships with key players

across the digital eco-system to make its content available to a wider

audience. ZEE5 continued with its global expansion with launch in key

international markets, including USA in June 2021.

Zee Studios, the movies business is a strategic part of our portfolio,

and it plays a very synergistic and complimentary role in the success

of our linear and digital businesses. Zee Studios produced/distributed

22 movies during the year, with a mix of theatrical and direct to digital

(ZEE5) releases.

Zee Music Company, your Company’s music publishing arm, continued

to expand its music catalogue across languages and maintained its

position as the second most subscribed music channel on YouTube.

ZEE LIVE, Your Company hosted multiple live events and virtual events

leveraging the reach of ZEE5 and satellite channels during the year.

Letter of Comfort (LOC) issued by the

Company to Yes Bank Limited:

With respect to the matter relating to the LOC issued by the Company to

Yes Bank as explained in note 36 of the standalone financial statements.

On account of the amount involved as well as the matter being under sub-

judice, we considered this to be a key audit matter.

Principal audit procedures performed:

•

Perused the legal opinions obtained by the Management from various

lawyers based on which the Management has concluded that LOC is not

in the nature of guarantee;

•

Perused the judgements of the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay respect

of the ad-interim application;

•

Considered if the LOC met the requirements of an executory

contract and if so whether it could be onerous in nature requiring a

provision under Ind AS 37 on ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and

Contingent Assets’.

Key Audit Matter

Auditors’ Response

Audit of transactions involving payment of advance for movie rights

acquisitions:

The Company pays advances for acquiring movies from aggregators,

sub-agents of aggregators and production houses. During the year, the

Company paid advances to such aggregators and production houses for

acquiring rights of movies on the basis of Memorandum of Understanding

(MOU) and/or agreements entered into with the respective aggregators or

production houses.

We considered this as key audit matter on account of the value of such

movie advances and the risks associated with non-performance.

Principal audit procedures performed:

•

Evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls

relating to authorisation of movie advances and adherence to the

approval policy framed by the Company;

•

Obtained supporting documents for the sample of movie advances paid

during the year which includes the MOU/agreement executed between

the Company and content aggregators and production houses stating

business rationale for the advance payments;

•

Checked appropriate approvals for the advance payments and

adherence to the approval policy;

•

For samples selected, obtained direct confirmation from the content

aggregators and the production houses confirming the outstanding

balances as at the year-end including identification of the films against

which the advances were given and the manner of utilisation of the

advances by such aggregators, where considered necessary in our

professional judgement.

Recoverability of long overdue receivables from a customer:

The Company has receivables of ₹ 2,446 million (net of allowance for

doubtful debts) from a customer, which include amounts which are long

overdue, as at 31st March 2022.

We considered this as key audit matter on account of risk associated with

long outstanding receivables from this customer, the Company’s assessment

of the recoverability of these receivables and consequent determination of

provision for expected credit loss which requires significant Management

estimates and judgements.

Specific factors considered by the Management includes credit worthiness

of the customer, adherence to the payment plan agreed by the Company

with this customer, including ageing analysis.

Refer note 44d(ii)B of the standalone financial statements.

Principal audit procedures performed:

•

Evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls

relating to the assessment of recoverability of receivables and

determination of the provision for expected credit loss;

•

Verified the completeness and accuracy of data considered for

ageing analysis and assessment of recoverability of receivables and

determination of the provision for expected credit loss;

•

Obtained the payment plan agreed by the Company (presented to the

Board of Directors by the Management) with the customer and checked

if the collections were in line with the agreed payment plan, including

subsequent collection after the balance sheet date till the date of the

standalone audit report;

•

Evaluated whether the provision for expected credit loss recorded

by the Company is appropriate considering specific factors like credit

worthiness of these customers and adherence to the payment plan

agreed with the Company;

•

Obtained direct confirmation from the customer as at the year-end for

the outstanding balance.

Valuation of investment in Optionally Convertible Debentures (OCDs) of

a subsidiary as at 31st March 2022:

The standalone financial statements reflect investments in Optionally

Convertible Debentures (OCDs) in a subsidiary with a carrying value of ₹

2,151 million. These OCDs are accounted at fair value through profit and

loss account.

We considered this as key audit matter due to the fair value gain recorded

during the year and because of the Company’s assessment of the fair value

calculations of the OCDs. This assessment involves significant judgements

about the valuation methodology, future performance of business and

discount rate applied to future cash flow projections.

Principal audit procedures performed:

Our procedures consisted of understanding the Management’s methodology

and key assumptions and included the following audit procedures:

•

Evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls

relating to Management’s review of fair value calculations;

•

Validating fair valuation model through testing of the mathematical

accuracy and verifying the application of the key input assumptions;

Letter of Comfort (LOC) to the said Bank confirming its intention, among other matters, to support ATL by

infusing equity/debt for meeting all its working capital requirements, debt requirements, business expansion plans, honouring the Put Option, take

or pay agreements and guarantees. The Company has received communication from the Bank mentioning defaults committed by LEL in repayment

of their loans to the Bank and calling upon the Company to support ATL in connection with honouring the Put Option. However, the Bank and LEL

remained in discussion to settle the borrowing.

The Company is of the view, based on legal advice, that the LOC neither provides any guarantee, commitment or assurance to pay the Bank.

On 26th June 2020, the Bank filed a plaint seeking ad-interim relief in the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay on the grounds that the aforesaid LOC

provided to the Bank is a financial guarantee. The Hon’ble High Court of Bombay, vide Orders dated 30th June 2020 and 19th August 2020 has

refused/dismissed the ad-interim relief sought by the Bank, including as part of the appeal proceedings filed by the Bank that were in favour of the

Company. The primary suit filed by the Bank on 26th June 2020 is yet to be heard by the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay.

The Management has assessed the nature of the LOC and based on legal advice obtained, the LOC has not been considered as a financial guarantee

by the Management, which would require recognition of a liability in the books of account of the Company. Further, based on an independent

valuation of ATL obtained, the Management has determined that the LOC also does not result in any executory contract that is onerous on the

Company which requires any recognition of liability in the books of account of the Company.

37.

During an earlier year, considering the increasing competition and content cost inflation, the Company entered into strategic content partnerships

with major production houses, movie studios and creative partners for movies monetisation. Accordingly, the advances aggregating ₹ 2,640 million

were outstanding as at 31st March 2021.

During the current year, the Company has received inventories and hence the aforesaid advances are settled.

38. Operational cost, employee benefits expense, advertisement and publicity expenses, electricity and water charges and repairs and maintenance

(plant and machinery) are net off recoveries ₹ 249 million (₹ 231 million).

39. SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company operates in a single reporting segment namely ‘Content and Broadcasting’.

expenses/claims, non-deduction/short deduction of tax at source, transfer pricing adjustments etc. The Management is of the opinion that

its tax cases are likely to be decided in its favour and hence no provision is considered necessary.

@ The Company has received legal notices of claims/lawsuits filed against it relating to infringement of copyrights, defamation suits etc. in

such claims/law suits.

the Hon’ble High Court of Judicature at Madras challenging the Tribunal Award. The Company has also filed an execution petition in April

2018. Accordingly, pending final outcome, effect has not been given in these financial statements. During an earlier year, the Company has

received ₹ 300 million which is accounted as deposits received in Other financial liabilities.

Letter of Award (LoA) and invoked the

performance bank guarantee issued. However, the Group, based on the legal opinion obtained, believes that this termination is based on the

inaccurate facts and acordingly, initiated arbitration proceedings before appropriate forum. Pending outcome of the ongoing arbitration proceedings,

the Group has considered the amounts paid for this project aggregating to ₹ 809 million (including the performance bank guarantee invoked),

outstanding as at 31st March 2022 as good and recoverable from network partner and is accounted as other receivables.

35. CAPITAL AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

i.

Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital account not provided for (net of advances) ₹ 453 million (₹ 651 million).

ii.

Other Commitments as regards media content and others (net off advances) ₹ 27,074 million (₹ 25,924 million).

iii.

Uncalled Liability/contractual obligation on investments committed is Nil (₹ 13 million).

36. ATL Media Limited (ATL), an overseas wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company incorporated in Mauritius, is engaged in broadcasting business.

Living Entertainment Limited, Mauritius (LEL), a related party of the Company, is a content provider. During the financial year ended 31st March 2016,

ATL had entered into a Put Option agreement with LEL to acquire the issued share capital to the extent of 64.38% held by LEL in Veria International

Limited (VIL) (another related party of the Group) at an exercise price of $ 105 million. The exercise period of the Put Option was from the agreement

date till the expiry date, i.e. 30th July 2019. In order to secure a borrowing, from Axis Bank Limited and Yes Bank Limited (Bank), LEL had assigned

all its right, title, benefit and interest under the said Put Option agreement in favour of Axis Bank DIFC branch, the security trustee for the benefit

of Axis Bank Limited and Yes Bank Limited. The Put Option agreement was amended and renewed by the parties (ATL and LEL) on 29th July 2019

and extended till 30th December 2026 based on certain representations made by LEL and the exercise price was set at $52.50 million (₹ 3,969

million as at March 2022; ₹ 3,848 million as at 31st March 2021) for the same quantum of shares as per the earlier Put Option agreement and LEL

extended the assignment of the Put Option to the security trustee.

During the financial year ended 31st March 2020, the Bank invoked the Put Option pursuant to the assignment and demanded ATL to pay the exercise

price. Subsequently, upon inquiry, ATL became aware of certain misrepresentations by LEL at the time of renewal of the Put Option agreement

and consequently, ATL has rescinded the Put Option from the renewal date of the Put Option agreement and also filed a suit against LEL and the

security trustee of the said Bank (security trustee subsequently excluded in the amended plaint filed during the year) in the Hon’ble Supreme Court

of Mauritius for inter alia declaration that the amended Put Option agreement has been properly rescinded and no longer binding and enforceable.

The matter is now sub-judice in Mauritius.

ATL does not consider that any liability will devolve on it and hence has not recognised any liability towards the fair value of the Put Option in its

books of account. Further, the Management of ATL has determined that based on valuation reports of VIL provided by LEL annually for subsequent

periods up till 31st March 2019, the value of the underlying shares in VIL was higher than the exercise price and hence no amount was required to

be recognised as liability towards the fair value of the Put Option in respect of those financial year ends.

37.

During an earlier year, considering the increasing competition and content cost inflation, the Company entered into strategic content partnerships

with major production houses, movie studios and creative partners for movies monetisation. Accordingly, the advances aggregating ₹ 2,640 million

were outstanding as at 31st March 2021.

During the current year, the Company has received inventories and hence the aforesaid advances are settled.

38. Operational cost, employee benefits expense, advertisement and publicity expenses, electricity and water charges and repairs and maintenance

(plant and machinery) are net off recoveries ₹ 139 million (₹ 153 million).

v.

Expenses relating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets is ₹ 568 million (₹ 605 million).

The Group has entered into various lease contracts at various premises used in its operations. Leases of premises generally have lease terms

million (₹ 2,018 million). (Refer note 44(d)(ii)A).

* Income-tax demands mainly include appeals filed by the Group before various appellate authorities (including Dispute Resolution panel) against

disallowance of expenses/claims, non-deduction/short deduction of tax at source, transfer pricing adjustments etc. The Management is of the

opinion that its tax cases are likely to be decided in its favour and hence no provision is considered necessary.

# Includes an income-tax demand, issued by Indian income-tax Authorities on a foreign subsidiary, Taj TV Limited, Mauritius (Taj Mauritius), amounting

to ₹ 6,215 million mainly on account of sale of Global Sports Broadcasting Undertaking during the year ended 31st March 2017.

During the FY 2017-18, one of the step down subsidiaries of ZEEL i.e. Taj, Mauritius, had sold sports business on a going concern & slump sale

basis to a third party in Mauritius. The Income-tax authorities during assessment scrutiny had disregarded the India-Mauritius Tax Treaty benefits

and taxed the entire Gains arising on Sale of Sports Broadcasting Undertaking under the Income-tax Act, 1961 alleging fixed place PE in India.

Considering the facts of the case, technical position under the India-Mauritius tax treaty collaborated by the opinion from leading tax experts, the

Group is of the view that the gain arising on sale of Sports Broadcasting Undertaking outside India i.e. Mauritius is not taxable in India. The group

subsequently filed an appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) and the matter is currently under litigation before the second appellate

authority. Considering the merits of the case, the Group has not recognised a provision in the books of account.

## The amount represents the best possible estimate arrived at on the basis of available information. The Group has engaged reputed advocates

to protect its interests and has been advised that it has strong legal positions against such disputes.

@ The Group has received legal notices of claims/lawsuits filed against it relating to infringement of copyrights, defamation suits etc. in relation

to the programmes produced/other matters. In the opinion of the Management, no material liability is likely to arise on account of such claims/law

suits.
