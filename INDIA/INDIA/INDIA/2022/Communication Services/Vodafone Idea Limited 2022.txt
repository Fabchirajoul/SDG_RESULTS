letter confirming payment of 10% of the

total dues along with an undertaking to pay the arrears

as per the Court judgement from FY 21-22 onwards.

The Company had on August 10, 2021 filed a review

petition with the Hon’ble Supreme Court for considering

to hear the modification application on correction of

manifest / clerical / arithmetic errors in the computation

of AGR demands which is still pending to be heard.

The Union Cabinet on September 15, 2021 approved

major structural and process reforms in the telecom

sector to boost the proliferation and penetration

of broadband and telecom connectivity. Further to

address liquidity requirements, the Cabinet has also

approved deferment of AGR dues which are payable

in annual instalments as determined by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court for up to four years without any change

in the instalment period and deferment of spectrum

auction instalments payable from October 01, 2021

to September 30, 2025 excluding the instalments due

for spectrum auction conducted in 2021. The DoT also

revised the definition of AGR effective October 01, 2021

to exclude non-telecom revenues. On October 14, 2021,

DoT issued the required notifications giving an option

for moratorium of Spectrum instalment and AGR dues

to be confirmed by the Company on or before October

29, 2021. It also provided a period of 90 days to confirm

upfront conversion, if any, of the interest amount arising

due to such deferment into equity. The Company has

conveyed its acceptance for the deferment of Spectrum

auction instalments & AGR dues by a period of four years

with immediate effect and has also requested for

inclusion of the amounts after the affidavit period till

AGR judgement of 2019 to be covered by the cabinet

relief package.

At its meeting held on January 10, 2022, the Board

of Directors approved the conversion of the full

amount of such interest on the deferred instalments

related to deferred annual spectrum liabilities and

AGR dues into shares in the company, either ordinary

and / or preference, at the discretion of government.

Subsequently on March 31, 2022, DoT has computed

the Net Present value (NPV) of the interest liability

on moratorium period amounting to ` 161,331 Mn

towards AGR dues (as per Hon’ble SC affidavit dated

September 01, 2020) and deferred annual Spectrum

liabilities respectively as on the date of exercise of

option i.e. January 10, 2022, which the Company has

confirmed on April 14, 2022. Further the accounting of

such conversion will happen upon the completion of the

process concluding with the actual issue of shares and

hence no effects have been given while drawing up the

Financial Statements for the year. Such conversion will

result in dilution to all the existing shareholders of the

Company, including the Promoters.

Accordingly, as at March 31, 2022, the net liability

towards AGR dues arising out of Hon’ble Supreme Court

judgment amounting to ` 659,534 Mn (net of payment

of ` 78,544 Mn) (including interest till March 31, 2022)

is disclosed as deferred payment obligation under long

term borrowings in the financial statements.

4.

The Company has incurred a loss of ` 282,372 Mn for the

year ended March 31, 2022 and its net worth stands at

negative ` 614,362 Mn. As at March 31, 2022, the total

external debt (including interest accrued but not due)

of the Company stands at `1,978,782 Mn. As of March

31, 2022, an amount of ` 68,131 Mn (March 31, 2021:

` 85,472 Mn) (net of waiver received) has been classified

from non-current borrowings to current maturities of

long-term debt for not meeting certain covenant clauses

under the financial agreements. Further, as a result of

earlier rating downgrade, certain lenders had asked for

increase of interest rates and additional margin money/

security against existing facilities. The Company has

exchanged correspondences and continues to be in

discussion with the lenders for next steps/waivers.

The existing debt as payable by March 31, 2023 is

` 81,555 Mn (excluding amount classified as current

on account of not meeting certain covenant clauses).

As the Company has already availed the moratorium with

respect to AGR and Deferred Spectrum Obligation as

referred above, and raised the fund from the promoter /

promoter group companies for ` 45,000 Mn as referred

in note 41(i), the Company’s ability to continue as a

going concern is now dependent on raising additional

funds as required, successful negotiations with lenders

for continued support and generation of cash flow from

operations that it needs to settle its liabilities as they

fall due. As of date, the Company has met all its debt

obligations. Pending the outcome of the above matters,

these financial statements have been prepared on a

going concern basis.:

referred in note 21 (C)(ii).

letter confirming

FY 21-22 onwards.

NOTES

forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company had on August 10, 2021 filed a review petition

with the Hon’ble Supreme Court for considering to hear the

modification application on correction of manifest / clerical /

arithmetic errors in the computation of AGR demands which

is still pending to be heard.

The Union Cabinet on September 15, 2021 approved major

structural and process reforms in the telecom sector to boost

the proliferation and penetration of broadband and telecom

connectivity. Further to address liquidity requirements, the

Cabinet has also approved deferment of AGR dues which are

payable in annual instalments as determined by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court for up to four years without any change in

the instalment period and deferment of spectrum auction

instalments payable from October 01, 2021 to September

30, 2025 excluding the instalments due for spectrum auction

conducted in 2021. The DoT also revised the definition of AGR

effective October 01, 2021 to exclude non-telecom revenues.

On October 14, 2021, DoT issued the required notifications

giving an option for moratorium of Spectrum instalment

and AGR dues to be confirmed by the Company on or before

October 29, 2021. It also provided a period of 90 days to

confirm upfront conversion, if any, of the interest amount

arising due to such deferment into equity. The Company

has conveyed its acceptance for the deferment of Spectrum

auction instalments & AGR dues by a period of four years with

immediate effect and has also requested for inclusion of the

amounts after the affidavit period till AGR judgement of 2019

to be covered by the cabinet relief package.

At its meeting held on January 10, 2022, the Board of

Directors approved the conversion of the full amount of

such interest on the deferred instalments related to deferred

annual spectrum liabilities and AGR dues into shares in the

company, either ordinary and / or preference, at the discretion

of government. Subsequently on March 31, 2022, DoT has

computed the Net Present value (NPV) of the interest liability

on moratorium period amounting to ` 161,331 Mn towards

AGR dues (as per Hon’ble SC affidavit dated September 01,

2020) and deferred annual Spectrum liabilities respectively

as on the date of exercise of option i.e. January 10, 2022,

which the Company has confirmed on April 14, 2022. Further

the accounting of such conversion will happen upon the

completion of the process concluding with the actual issue

of shares and hence no effects have been given while drawing

up the Financial Statements for the year. Such conversion

will result in dilution to all the existing shareholders of the

Company, including the Promoters.

Accordingly, as at March 31, 2022, the net liability towards

AGR dues arising out of Hon’ble Supreme Court judgment

amounting to ` 659,534 Mn (net of payment of ` 78,544

Mn) (including interest till March 31, 2022) is disclosed as

deferred payment obligation under long term borrowings in

the financial statements.:
