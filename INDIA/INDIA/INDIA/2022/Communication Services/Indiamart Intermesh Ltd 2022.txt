Through targeted interventions and decisive

actions, we further enhanced the ease of doing

business to propel the business transformation

of more suppliers and buyers across the country.

As the increasing internet adoption further

strengthens the opportunity matrix, we see these

interventions translating into a bigger outreach for

IndiaMART going forward.

While keeping our eyes firmly

on our long-term goals, we

continued to make strategic

investments in building the

ecosystem to enable businesses

and facilitate online commerce

in the long term. Our path for

strong growth is clearly defined

and we strive for greater success

as we move into the next

phase of the journey for the

transformation of businesses.

The transformation journey on which we,

at IndiaMART, embarked more than two

decades ago, scaled new heights during

FY 2022. Taking giant leaps in the new

environment catalysed by the COVID-19

pandemic, we innovated contemporary

solutions by embracing new technologies

and automation tools to address the

emerging needs of suppliers and buyers

in response to the dynamically changing

external eco-system.

Empowering Businesses:

Message from MD & CEO: Dear Shareholders

As you are aware, this financial year

witnessed major transformation in

the Indian Economy. From being

impacted by COVID-19 Wave 2 in

Q1 to a phase of recovery by Q4, it

witnessed many troughs and crests.

We, at IndiaMART, moved with agility

to cater to the changing external

dynamics and the evolving needs of

our stakeholders during the year. Our

role evolved from helping the nation

fight pandemic at the start of the year

to contributing to economic growth

and fast-paced recovery by the end of

the year. We closed the year with a

wave of excitement as we saw good

recovery and invested significantly

in strengthening our capabilities to

leverage emerging opportunities and

to progress in our journey of business

enablement.

Prioritising strategic growth

With our thrust on Empowering

Businesses, we, at IndiaMART, achieved

strong business growth during the year.

Our Collections from customers grew

by 32% to ` 9,317 million, Deferred

revenue witnessed a growth of 25% to

` 9,066 million and Paying Subscription

Suppliers grew from 152,394 as of

March 2021 to 169,324 as of March

2022. To effectively meet the evolving

needs of our growing supplier and

buyer network, we made focussed

investments in the expansion of

channel sales partners as well as hired

~1,000 new employees to strengthen

our resource base across our product,

sales and service functions. The impact

of these investments became visible in

the last quarter of the financial year

as we added our highest ever paying

subscription suppliers.

Responding with speed to the changing

market needs, we came out with new

innovations across our product lines

and sales network. In addition to

strengthening the value proposition

for Indian Suppliers, we launched an

exclusive service for Indian exporters,

‘IndiaMART Verified Export Services’,

which enables 50,000 export-oriented

sellers on IndiaMART’s platform to

expand their business across the globe.

This year, we also made progress

on conversational commerce as we

launched many features in our Lead

Manager

System

to

drive

better

business enablement.

We invested in advanced technologies

to enhance matchmaking and boost

system efficiencies during the year.

I am happy to share that our

improvement in relevancy through

AI/ML and behavioural data-driven

algorithmic matchmaking, our strong

tech-enabled, user-friendly and cost-

effective platform, have increased

customer satisfaction tremendously.

Our business enquiries have also

grown to 97 million for FY 2022.

As employees are one of the important

stakeholders, we took a pioneering step

of introducing the first-in-the-industry

‘Weekly payout of Salary’ regime across

all levels in the organisation. This was

done primarily by taking into account

the changing preferences of new-age

employees and providing them with

better liquidity during the month.

Our efforts to build a larger eco-system

to nurture business enablement and

digital commerce were also manifested

in our various strategic investments

during

the

year.

We

identified

Accounting as an important need for

businesses and therefore, acquired Busy

& Livekeeping and invested in Vyapar &

Realbooks. With these acquisitions and

investments, we are now present in all

the segments of accounting as we aim

to build up a new business line over the

next 3-5 years.

Additionally, in line with our strategy

of enabling businesses and online

commerce, we have made multiple

investments in the areas of logistics,

supply

chain,

vertical

commerce,

financing

and

other

business

enablement softwares. Cumulatively,

these initiatives will help us further

strengthen our core business proposition

of product discovery and conversational

commerce.

Looking ahead with optimism

Going forward, we will continue to

augment our technology and product

suite for further ease of our customers.

Our negative working capital business

model, strong zero-debt balance sheet,

category, regional diversification, and

brand awareness will further drive our

efforts to realise our customer promise.

Coupled with the rapid growth in

internet adoption & mobile penetration,

we are well poised to leverage the

future growth opportunities and are

evolving accordingly.

In conclusion

On this note, I would like to take the

opportunity to thank each one of you

for your sustained trust in IndiaMART.

I am also grateful to our stakeholders,

whose

continued

support

and

commitment has made it possible for

us to make doing business easy and

stay firmly on course of our long-term

goal. I am confident that together,

we shall further empower small and

medium businesses, who have emerged

as a formidable force in steering India’s

growth story which we are committed

to partnering.

Traditionally, construction equipment was never

bought through an online medium. We partnered

with IndiaMART to maximise our reach to every

potential customer of a Hydraulic Excavator, Cranes,

Piling Rigs, Road &, Mining Equipment. SANY is the

fastest growing organisation in this industry for the

last 5 years and we intend to extend that streak.

The experience with IndiaMART has been quite

satisfying. I think they have a talented bunch of

backend service managers. We have been getting

encouraging numbers in terms of leads, and we

hope the conversion increases to 15-20% in the

long term.

CORPORATE INFORMATION

IndiaMART Intermesh Limited (“the Company” or “the

Parent Company”) is a public company domiciled in India

and was incorporated on 13 September 1999 under the

provisions of the Companies Act applicable in India. The

company and its consolidated subsidiaries (hereinafter

collectively referred to as “the Group”) is engaged

in e-marketplace for business needs, which acts as an

interactive hub for domestic and international buyers

and suppliers. The registered office of the Company is

located at 1st Floor, 29-Daryagang, Netaji Subash Marg

New Delhi-110002, India.

The consolidated financial statements were authorised for

issue in accordance with a resolution passed by Board of

Directors on 28 April 2022.

2.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.1 Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared

on the historical cost basis as explained in the accounting

policies below, except for the following:

•

certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair

value where Ind AS requires a different accounting

treatment (refer accounting policy regarding financial

instruments);

•

share-based payments

•

net defined benefit (asset)/liability - Fair value of plan

assets less present value of defined benefit obligations.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements

requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates

and judgements. It also requires the management

to exercise judgement in the process of applying the

Group’s accounting policies. The areas where estimates

are significant to the consolidated financial statements,

or areas involving a higher degree of judgement or

complexity, are disclosed in Note 3.

2.2 Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the

financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries

and associates as at 31 March 2022. Control is achieved

when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable

returns from its involvement with the investee and has

the ability to affect those returns through its power over

the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee

if and only if the Group has:

•

Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give

it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of

the investee)

•

Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its

involvement with the investee, and

•

The ability to use its power over the investee to affect

its returns

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting

rights result in control. To support this presumption and

when the Group has less than a majority of the voting

or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all

relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it

has power over an investee, including:

•

The contractual arrangement with the other vote

holders of the investee

•

Rights arising from other contractual arrangements

•

The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

•

The size of the group’s holding of voting rights relative

to the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other

voting rights holders
