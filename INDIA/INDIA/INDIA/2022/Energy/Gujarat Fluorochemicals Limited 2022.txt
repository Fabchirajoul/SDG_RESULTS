Annual Report 2021-22

16

The global turmoil has had its ripple

effect on the Indian economy as well.

Although India continues to be among

the fastest growing major economy

but inflationary pressures, sharp spike

in commodity prices, global political

uncertainty, continue to pose risk to our

country’s growth prospects in the near

term.

Despite global turmoil and macro-

economic challenges posing a threat

to the Company’s business, GFL

posted strong growth and sustained

its market leadership by deploying

various strategies. The Company has

delivered strong performance by steadily

enhancing its operational efficiency,

deploying robust technology and

leveraging a fully integrated business

model.

The raging pandemic (which spanned

for two years) posed many operational

challenges but we successfully managed

our working capital and delivered a solid

performance. In FY22 our revenue from

operations grew from H 2651 crore to

H 3954 crore, registering 49% growth. Our

EBITDA stood at H 1198 crore, vis-à-vis

H 638 crore in 2020-21. Our PAT stood

at H 775 crore, compared to H 361 crore

in the previous year, growing by 115%.

Sustained profit growth was achieved

by implementing capacity expansions,

further increasing market reach and

having stringent operation control

programmes, while making no comprises

on the product quality.

The growth in consumption across

the globe has helped bolster demand

for GFL’s products. As the world limps

back to normalcy we expect the retail

spending to touch pre-pandemic levels.

This will enable manufacturing to hasten

its path to recovery with a positive trade

momentum.: Dear Shareholders,

FY22 has been a year marred by recurring

waves of the pandemic, global geopolitical

tension and a challenging and uncertain

macro-economic environment. The pandemic-

induced disruptions put brakes on the growth

engine of the Indian economy, as businesses

suffered and millions of people lost their lives

and livelihoods.

GFL has grown and is on the cusp of entering
