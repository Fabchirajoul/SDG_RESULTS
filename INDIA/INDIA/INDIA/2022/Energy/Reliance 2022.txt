Managing Director’s statement

Chairman and: Managing

Managing Director’s Statement

too delivered robust earnings with

strong fuel margins.

Reliance posted a record high EBITDA

of `1,25,687 crore on a consolidated

basis for FY 2021-22, which was

28.8% up from the previous year.

The consolidated net profit for

the year stood at `67,845 crore –

again a new record.

The Company had achieved a net

debt-free status last year, thanks to

the largest ever capital raise we had

carried out in India Inc.'s history in

the previous year. During FY 2021-22,

the Company’s capex increased in

all businesses, due to which the year

closed with marginal net debt.

The Company continues to manage

its treasury operations actively

and efficiently to reduce interest

burden and lengthen maturities.

At the very beginning of FY 2021-22,

Reliance Industries made history

by raising a jumbo loan of $4 billion

on better terms than any corporate

in the Asian region with similar

credit profile. It was the largest-ever

foreign currency bond issuance from

India, with the lowest coupon rate

achieved for benchmark 30-year

and 40-year issuances by a private

sector BBB corporate from Asia ex-

Japan. Similarly, the Company paid

`30,791 crore to the Government of

India towards its 15 years of future

spectrum dues to save on annual

interest cost burden.

Executing our growth plans

Reliance’s diversified portfolio of

business verticals represent our

growth engines, where we have been

adding capabilities consistently.

During FY 2021-22, each one of these

growth engines moved into top gear,

cementing Reliance’s position further

as India’s largest company by sales,

profits as well as market value.

globally. Greater affordability and

competitive cost structures will ensure

massive adoption of Green Energy

solutions, providing a booster to

India’s Green Energy transition, as well

as helping our country to become

‘Atma Nirbhar’ in our energy needs.

A step towards

Net Carbon Zero

Reliance also took an important

step towards our goal to achieve net

carbon zero status by year 2035. We

initiated the process to separate the

petcoke gasification complex into a

Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, with an

aim to repurpose the unit and unlock

value through future collaborations.

Presently, the syngas produced at

the complex is used as fuel at the

Jamnagar complex and is a major

source of carbon emission. With

Reliance switching to green and

renewable energy for its energy

needs, syngas will become available

for upgradation to high value

petrochemicals and hydrogen fuel.

The highly concentrated stream of

CO2 in syngas can be easily captured

and sequestered. All these steps will

greatly reduce the carbon footprint of

the Jamnagar complex.

Financial and operational

performance FY 2021-22

Let me now elaborate on Reliance’s

operating and financial performance

during FY 2021-22.

During the year, Reliance was able

to overcome all the pandemic-led

difficulties to post another record

performance operationally as well as

financially with strong contribution

from all our businesses. Both the

consumer businesses, Retail and

Digital Services, recorded highest

ever revenues and EBITDA. The E&P

business also posted significantly

improved numbers with strong

volume growth and improved

realisations. The largest contributor

to our earnings – the O2C business

Retail

PG 54

Braving the intermittent COVID

restrictions, the Retail business

continued to expand offline, as well

as online. It added nearly 8 million

sq ft of retail space taking its total

retail space to over 41.6 million sq

ft. Besides, the business added 11.1

million sq ft of warehousing space

during the year. Importantly, the

business created over 1,50,000 jobs

through the year.

The business posted all time high

revenues and EBITDA with steady

improvement in profit margins.

Growth was seen across all

product categories from Consumer

Electronics to Grocery to Apparel &

Footwear. Even the relatively smaller

segments of jewellery, pharma

and furniture & home décor, and

new businesses like Freshpik and

Milkbasket, witnessed rapid growth.

In our New Commerce initiative, the

focus remained on on-boarding

merchants during the year. FY 2021-22

witnessed over 3-fold jump in the

number of merchants onboarded as

compared to the previous year.

The Retail business continued to forge

partnerships across the value chain

to enhance customer experience and

product offerings. Throughout the

year, the Retail business invested over

`9,700 crore in these partnerships.

Jio is working relentlessly to make

India 2G-mukt, so that even the

poorest of the poor can enjoy the

benefits of digital connectivity. The

progress of telecom technology

is making inefficient 2G obsolete.

The Jio revolution since 2016 has

already lowered the 4G tariffs below

the 2G tariffs in India. However,

handset affordability has proven

a major hurdle for over 250 million

Indians, preventing a transition to

digital networks.

To overcome this hurdle, Jio

launched JioPhone Next – world’s

most affordable full-touchscreen

4G phone – in collaboration with

Google. The phone runs on Pragati

OS – a specially optimised version of

Google’s Android OS.

The technology in the Internet,

Communication and Telecom (ICT)

industry continues to make rapid

strides globally and India is getting

ready to join the 5G bandwagon.

Jio also took major steps in getting

ready for 5G, with its 100% indigenous

technology. Jio successfully carried

out 5G testing across sites and has

completed 5G coverage planning

across 1,000 Indian cities. Jio has

also developed several use cases for

5G in industries like healthcare and

industrial automation.

Jio entered into a strategic

partnership with Google for its Cloud

Solutions to power the 5G experience

of Indian enterprises as well as

consumers. Jio also joined hands

with University of Oulu in Finland – the

leader of the world’s first major 6G

research programme – to accelerate

research and standardisation in

6G – the futuristic next generation of

telecom technology after 5G.

Oil to Chemicals

PG 98

The rapid growth in vaccinations and

reopening of economies helped a

strong economic recovery globally

in FY 2021-22. As a result, the global

demand for oil and transport fuels

grew rapidly and recovered by 6.8

mb/d to 98.5 mb/d in FY 2021-22, up

7.4% Y-o-Y. The rapid growth in fuel

demand supported the refining

margins. Reliance maintained high

level of capacity utilisation across

sites throughout the year.

The demand growth in downstream

chemicals, polymers and polyesters

was comparatively subdued, due

to the volatility in feedstock prices.

There was also a constraint on

global logistics and higher ocean

freights that weighed on the

business environment.

The availability of domestic gas as

well as internal fuels meant that we

could eliminate our dependence

on high-cost LNG.

All the while, we continued to

innovate and improve operationally.

We commissioned and stabilised

the Petroleum Naphtha quality

upgrade, capturing higher

premium. Likewise, Reliance won

the ‘Innovator of the Year’ award for

our proprietary catalyst RELCAT A for

manufacturing LLDPE.

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Managing Director’s Statement

During the year, Reliance and bp’s fuel

and mobility joint venture, Reliance BP

Mobility Limited (RBML), launched its

first Jio-bp branded Mobility Station

at Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra. This

kicked off the rebranding process for

all 1,460 fuel outlets the JV operates

in India with a view to provide an

unmatched and distinctive customer

experience. These Mobility Stations

bring together a range of services for

consumers on the move – including

additivised fuels, EV charging,

refreshments & food, and plan to offer

more low carbon solutions over time.

With a vision of being the leading

EV charging infrastructure player

in India, Jio-bp constructed and

launched couple of country's largest

EV charging hubs in Delhi NCR with

BluSmart as its primary customer.

Reliance’s world-class O2C assets

and very high level of backward

integration will continue to maximise

output and returns, and continue

to transition towards a sustainable,

carbon-neutral, circular economy

business in the coming years.

Oil and Gas E&P

PG 122

FY 2021-22 was a milestone year

for our Oil & Gas business, with

two of the three phases of KG-D6

development project commissioning.

Notwithstanding the difficulties

caused by the COVID pandemic,

Reliance and bp were able to

complete the work on Satellite

Cluster and R-Cluster fields to

start production and scale up

during the year.

With both these fields commissioning,

KG-D6 is now producing 18 MMSCMD

of natural gas, accounting for ~20% of

India's gas production.

The business posted significantly

improved financial performance,

thanks to a recovery in domestic

pricing of natural gas.

The third phase of KG-D6 project

is progressing as per plan. The

development of MJ field is nearing

completion of drilling activity, as

well as the offshore installations. The

project is expected to commission

by end 2022 and take our total

production to 30 MMSCMD.

In line with our strategic intentions,

Reliance exited all its remaining

investments in US shale gas this year.

Corporate Social

Responsibility and

Sustainability

Reliance has always believed in

doing well by doing good. It is our firm

belief that the long-term success of a

corporate depends on giving back to

the society it operates in and ensuring

its operations are sustainable.

During FY 2021-22, Reliance Industries

continued to remain India Inc.'s

largest spender on Corporate Social

Responsibility.

The breadth and depth of work

Reliance Foundation carried out in

India’s fight against COVID was simply

astonishing. It set a new benchmark in

what a corporate foundation can do

and achieve, if it is determined and

focused. Reliance Foundation created

massive COVID-care infrastructure

pan-India, treating lakhs of patients. It

supplied free-of-cost medical oxygen

to over 1 lakh critical patients a day,

provided lakhs of PPE kits free-of-

cost to frontline workers, distributed

8.5+ crore free meals through

'Anna Seva' to the needy, 40+ lakh

vaccinations provided free of cost by

Reliance to support the nation in its

vaccination mission.

All the while, Reliance Foundation’s

work in the fields of Rural

Empowerment, Sports for Youth,

Education, Disaster Management

among others continued

to progress well.

Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic struck at a

time when the world was entering

a great phase of transformation.

Now that the pandemic is nearly

over, geopolitical tensions in several

parts of the world have come to a

boil. All this has resulted in significant

volatility, high inflationary pressure

and uncertainty in the energy

and commodity markets. Crude

oil prices, which had dipped into

negative territory at the start of 2020,

jumped to a 14-year peak of $130 at

the start of 2022.

Reliance is built to weather such

storms. Firstly, it is well diversified

across Digital Services, Retail

and Energy & Materials business.

Secondly, over the years it has

built in unparalleled level of agility

in each of its business verticals.

Thirdly, its global scale of operations

help in overcoming many hurdles.

And lastly, the Company’s balance

sheet has expanded, but is

extremely light on debt.

In its true ethos of Care and Empathy,

Reliance has charted its next journey

of transformation to help the world

cope with the climate change

crisis. Over the next 12 months our

investments across the Green Energy

value chain will gradually start going

live, scaling up over the next couple

of years. This new growth engine

holds great promise to outshine

all our existing growth engines in

just 5-7 years.

At the same time, Reliance continues

to expand its existing businesses

to newer frontiers of technology,

innovation, scale and execution.

Jio has already created the most

reliable connectivity infrastructure

throughout India, and is ready with an

array of value-added digital services

and products. Today Reliance Retail

has the deepest grassroots level

pan-India supply chain capability,

the broadest supplier base, and a

network of kirana partners to provide

excellent service to end consumers.

Reliance’s O2C business is a global

leader in terms of level of integration

– a business model innovation that is

being emulated globally.

All of Reliance’s capabilities are

created to serve India, to enable

Indians. I am sure India will emerge

stronger out of the current volatility,

just the way it did through the

last couple of years. India is set

to become one of the world’s top

three economies in the next couple

of decades, and all of Reliance’s

business verticals will play a

leading role in achieving that. India

and Reliance will aim to play a

leading role in the world’s transition

to Clean Energy.

The last two years were the most

difficult for everyone in living

memory. I have great admiration

and appreciation for the scientists,

doctors, nurses, and all frontline

workers who risked their lives,

our teams at O2C, Jio, Retail and

Foundation, who helped not just the

Company, but also the society whom

we serve, navigate the difficult times.

I would also like to place on record my

sincere appreciation to the Board of

Directors for their guidance. I would

like to express my gratitude to all

our stakeholders for their continuing

faith in Reliance.

With best wishes,

Sincerely

Our Leadership

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Managing Director,

Shri Mukesh D. Ambani, the Company

re-engineered its existing facilities

to set up the largest production

facilities in India to produce and

deliver medical oxygen from a

single location in record time. The

Company adopted a two-pronged

approach to strengthening the

availability of medical-grade oxygen

in India, including:

• Refocusing several industrial

processes at Reliance's Jamnagar

and other facilities for rapid scale-

up in the production of medical-

grade liquid oxygen.

• Managing the supply chain

by augmenting loading and

transportation capacities to

ensure the swift and safe supply

of oxygen to states and Union

Territories across India.

Despite not being a manufacturer of

medical-grade oxygen historically,

the Company's engineers quickly

reconfigured and optimised

operations, which were initially

designed for refining and producing

petrochemical grade oxygen to

produce high-purity medical-grade

oxygen during the second wave of the

pandemic. Reliance also converted

nitrogen tankers into transport trucks

for medical-grade oxygen through

innovative and safe processes

approved by the Petroleum and

Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO),

the relevant regulatory body of the

Government of India.

In the words of Chairman and Managing

Director Shri Mukesh D. Ambani, "For me

and all of us at Reliance, nothing is

more important than saving every

life as India battles against a new

wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is an immediate need to

maximise India's production and

transportation capacities for medical

grade oxygen. I am proud of our

engineers at Jamnagar who have

worked tirelessly, with a great sense

of patriotic urgency, to meet this

new challenge. I am truly humbled

by the determination and sense of

purpose shown by the bright, young

members of the Reliance family

who have once again risen to the

occasion and delivered when India

needs it the most."

Expanding COVID Care

Facilities

• As the second wave of COVID-19

infections gripped the country,

Reliance BP Mobility Limited

(RBML, Operating under the brand

name Jio-bp) reintroduced its

programme of supplying fuel

free of cost to COVID emergency

services vehicles. Under the

pan-India programme, a total

of 2,203.59 KL was dispensed to

56,283 emergency vehicles (53,272

HSD and 3,011 MS) from May 13

to June 30, 2021.

• Reliance procured and

administered 40+ lakh vaccine

doses. Of this, 9.4 lakh doses were

given to various state governments

and 2 lakh to the armed forces.

Since its inception, Reliance has been

committed to sustainable growth,

which has only been possible due

to the underpinning governance.

The Company recognises the role of

robust governance mechanisms for

long-term value creation. Efficient

corporate governance has acted as

a pillar of Reliance's sustained growth

throughout the year.

Reliance's Corporate Governance

practices are driven by the principles

of transparency, accountability,

and integrity. This is operationalised

by relevant policies and Standard

Operating Procedures (SOPs) to

ensure compliance and good

governance for all stakeholders.

Board Governance

Reliance’s senior leadership

comprises of a 14-member Board

which is responsible for direction

and oversight of Reliance. The

Board of Directors come from

diverse backgrounds with unique

competencies and rich experience.

The induction into the Board of

Directors is instituted by the Board

level Human Resources, Nomination

and Remuneration Committee. This

Committee oversees aspects which

include formulation of the criteria for

determining qualifications, positive

attributes, and independence of

a Director, and recommend to

the Board a policy, relating to the

remuneration of the Directors, Key

Managerial Personnel, and other

employees. The Committee has

also developed a set of criteria for

evaluating the performance of the

Board of Directors, including that of

Independent Directors. Attendance,

familiarity with the business, and

engagement are some of the key

parameters defined for evaluating

the Board's performance. The Board

of Directors, through its Committees,

oversee the ESG initiatives

and performance.

Board diversity in skill-set, nationality,

experience, and perspective is

important for effective leadership and

governance. A diverse Board provides

guidance and effective oversight

over the Company's operations.

It enhances responsiveness to

stakeholder needs, collaboration

across departments, and provides

expertise leading to the continuous

growth of the Company. Presently,

the Board consists of two eminent

women directors.

Regulatory Issues and

Compliance

Regulatory compliance at Reliance

has been of utmost importance,

especially in an evolving regulatory

scenario. Reliance’s Regulatory

compliance risk is addressed by the

Reliance Compliance Management

System. It is a digitally enabled

comprehensive compliance

management framework that's

integrated with business processes,

risks and controls and updated on

a regular basis.

Changes in regulations are

also monitored on an ongoing

basis by the Group Compliance

Committee. The Directors get

monthly or quarterly information

on key statutory and regulatory

developments, as well as

key judicial rulings affecting

interpretation of important laws.

ESG Governance

Reliance is on a continuous

improvement journey to create long-

term value for its stakeholders. The key

decisions that are taken pertaining to

ESG include indepth analysis through an

Integrated Profit and Loss lens. Reliance

has integrated ESG into its governance

structure so that the Company can

have a better oversight and strengthen

management responsibility for

business-related ESG challenges and

opportunities.

The Corporate Social Responsibility

& Governance (CSR&G) Committee

oversees the implementation of

sustainability activities. Business

Responsibility Report (BRR) describing

the initiatives taken by the Company

from an environmental, social and

governance perspective is reviewed

and recommended to the Board by the

CSR&G Committee. The progress on the

Company’s CSR initiatives is periodically

reviewed by the CSR&G Committee

and the Company’s Board of Directors.

RIL continuously enhances its existing

systems and processes to capture

the impact of its social/economic and

developmental initiatives. The Risk

Management Committee oversees

the ESG related risks and risk mitigation

measures. Further, the Health, Safety

& Environment (HSE) Committee

reviews the environment related

policies and matters.

Detailed information on various Board

Committees is available on https://

www.ril.com/OurCompany/Leadership/

BoardCommittees.aspx and the Corporate

Governance section of this report.

Policies and Codes

Policies and codes are the essential

components that help operationalise

governance frameworks. Reliance's

policies and codes signify the Company's

commitment to the highest business

ethics and corporate values and are

communicated transparently to all the

relevant stakeholders. A detailed list of

policies is available in the Corporate

Governance Section of this report.

Ambani expressed his optimism that

India can become the first country in

the world to produce Green Hydrogen

at less than US$ 1 per 1 kg in 1 decade

to meet the 1-1-1 target. India has

set the goal to reach 450 GW of

scale solar energy producers who

can produce Green Hydrogen for

local consumption. This endeavour

by Reliance is aligned with its vision of

Due to the inherent limitations of an audit including internal, financial and operating controls, there is an unavoidable risk that

performed in accordance with the CSAS.

Basis for Opinion

We have followed the audit practices and processes as were appropriate to obtain reasonable assurance about the correctness

of the contents of the secretarial records. The verification was done on test basis to ensure that correct facts are reflected in the

secretarial records. We believe that the processes and practices, we followed provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

by the Company and provided either as scanned copies by email or through permitted access to the Company’s in-house

portal and also the information provided by the Company, its officers, agents and authorized representatives during the conduct

of secretarial audit, we hereby report that in our opinion, the Company has, during the audit period covering the financial

year ended on March 31, 2022 (“the Financial Year”), complied with the statutory provisions listed hereunder and also that the

Company has proper Board-processes and compliance-mechanism in place to the extent, in the manner and subject to the

reporting made hereinafter:

letter from the management on the

assessment of these matters.

Key audit matters

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

C. Fair Valuation of Investments

As at March 31, 2022, the Company has investments of

` 78,144 crore in the Equity and Preference Shares of Jio Digital

Fiber Private Limited (JDFPL) which are measured at fair value

as per Ind AS 109 read with Ind AS 113.

These investments are Level 3 investments as per the fair

value hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly determination

of fair value is based on a high degree of judgement and

input from data that is not directly observable in the market.

Further, the fair value is significantly influenced by the

expected pattern of future benefits of the tangible assets

of JDFPL (fiber assets). Refer Note 2 and Note 38A in the

financial statements.

Accordingly, the same has been considered as a

key audit matter.

Our audit procedures included and were not limited

to the following:

• Reviewed the fair valuation reports provided by the

management by involvement of internal specialist / external

valuation experts.

• We assessed the assumptions around the cash flow forecasts

including discount rates, expected growth rates and its

effect on business and terminal growth rates used through

involvement of the internal experts.

• We also involved internal experts to assess the Company’s

valuation methodology and assumptions, applied in

determining the fair value.

• We discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared

to previous year / actual performance with management

to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used in the cash

flow forecasts.

• Assessed the objectivity and competence of our internal

expert and Company’s internal/external specialists involved

in the process.

• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the

financial statements.

D. IT systems and controls over financial reporting

We identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting

as a key audit matter for the Company because its financial

accounting and reporting systems are fundamentally

reliant on IT systems and IT controls to process significant

transaction volumes, specifically with respect to revenue

and raw material consumption. Also, due to such large

transaction volumes and the increasing challenge to protect

the integrity of the Company’s systems and data, cyber

security has become more significant.

Automated accounting procedures and IT environment

controls, which include IT governance, IT general controls

over program development and changes, access to

program and data and IT operations, IT application controls

and interfaces between IT applications are required to be

designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate

financial reporting.

Our procedures included and were not limited to the following:

• Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging

IT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT

and internal audit and identified IT applications that are

relevant to our audit.

• Assessed the design and evaluation of the operating

effectiveness of IT general controls over program development

and changes, access to program and data and IT operations

by engaging IT specialists.

• Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity at

the Company in respect of the overall security architecture and

any key threats addressed by the Company in the current year.

• Assessed the design and evaluation of the operating

effectiveness of IT application controls in the key processes

impacting financial reporting of the Company by engaging

IT specialists.

• Assessed the operating effectiveness of controls relating

to data transmission through the different IT systems to the

financial reporting systems by engaging IT specialists.

We have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.

letter from the management on the

assessment of these matters.

Key audit matters

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Fair Valuation of Investments

As at March 31, 2022, the Holding Company has investments

of ` 78,144 crore in the Equity and Preference Shares of Jio

Digital Fiber Private Limited (‘JDFPL’) which are measured at fair

value as per Ind AS 109 read with Ind AS 113. Refer Note 2 of the

Consolidated Financial Statements.

These investments are Level 3 investments as per the fair value

hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly determination of fair

value is based on a high degree of judgement and input from

data that is not directly observable in the market. Further, the

fair value is significantly influenced by the expected pattern

of future benefits of the tangible assets of JDFPL (fiber assets).

Refer Note 37A of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accordingly, the same has been considered as a

key audit matter.

Our audit procedures included and were not limited

to the following:

• Reviewed the fair valuation reports provided by the

management by involvement of internal specialist / external

valuation experts.

• We assessed the assumptions around the cash flow forecasts

including discount rates, expected growth rates and its

effect on business and terminal growth rates used through

involvement of the internal experts.

• We also involved internal experts to assess the Holding

Company’s valuation methodology and assumptions,

applied in determining the fair value.

• We discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared

to previous year / actual performance with management

to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used in the cash

flow forecasts.

• Assessed the objectivity and competence of our internal

expert and Holding Company’s internal/external specialist

involved in the process.

• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Holding Company in

the financial statement.

Impairment of assets of subsidiaries of Reliance Industrial Investments and Holding Limited

The auditor of Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings

Limited, (‘RIIHL’), subsidiary of the Holding Company, has

reported a key audit matter on impairment of investment and

loans given to subsidiaries as the recoverability assessment

involves significant management judgement and estimates.

Though these investments and loans are eliminated at the

consolidated level, the assets of the RIIHL subsidiaries are

included on a line-by-line basis in the Consolidated Financial

Statements. Refer Note B.3 (j) of the Consolidated Financial

Statements for accounting policy regarding impairment of

financial assets. Accordingly, the impairment of these assets is

considered to be a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures included and were not limited

to the following:

• Obtained and read the financial statements of RIIHL and its

subsidiaries to identify whether any impairment has been

recorded in the current year.

• In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the

auditor of RIIHL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures

performed by them to address the key audit matter. As

reported to us by the subsidiary auditor, the following

procedures have been performed by them for material

subsidiaries: -

- Assessment of the net worth of RIIHL subsidiaries/

associates on the basis of latest available

financial statements.

- Assessment of the methodologies applied to ascertain

the fair value or as the case may be, value in use of the

assets of the subsidiaries/associates, where the net

worth was negative.

- Assessment of the input data and key assumptions

used to determine the fair value of ‘subsidiaries’ assets,

cash flow estimates including sensitivity analysis of key

assumptions used.

Revenue Recognition

a) The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’),

subsidiary of the Holding Company, have reported revenue

recognition as a key audit matter due to the high volume

of the transactions, high degree of IT systems involvement

and considering that accounting for certain revenue

streams and tariff schemes involve exercise of judgements

and estimates regarding application of the revenue

recognition accounting standards.

Our audit procedures included the following:

• Obtained and read the financial statements of RJIL and

RRVL Group to identify whether the revenue recognition

policies are included in the Consolidated Financial

Statements of the Group.

• In respect of the key audit matter reported by the auditors of

RJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed

by them to address the key audit matter. As reported by

the subsidiary auditor, the following procedures have been

performed by them:-

- Involvement of internal IT specialists and testing of the

IT environment inter alia for access controls, change

management and application specific controls over

the subsidiary company’s billing and other relevant

support systems;

- Evaluation and testing of the design and operating

effectiveness of the relevant business process controls,

inter-alia controls over the capture, measurement and

authorisation of revenue transactions;
