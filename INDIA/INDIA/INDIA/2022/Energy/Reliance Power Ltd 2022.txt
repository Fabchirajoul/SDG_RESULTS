Directors’ Report:

letter dated May 30, 2018, has issued directions

to the CERC and other State regulators (SERCs) to consider

the revised emission standards as Change in Law (CIL) and

accordingly devise an appropriate regulatory mechanism

to address the impact on tariff. During FY22, CERC issued

framework for computing tariff recovery to mitigate

impact of Change in Law due to implementation of new

environment norms.

In the present sector context, banks and financial institutions

are not forthcoming to finance the additional capital

expenditure arising from implementation of CAPEX to meet

new environment norms. Certainty in cost recovery on

account of additional capital and operational costs, under

concluded long-term and medium-term PPAs, is critical to

securing financing for timely completion of additional capital

expenditure.

Further, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate

Change vide its Gazette Notification dated Mar 31, 2021

categorized all TPPs with reference to its location and

revised the timelines for compliance of new emission norms.

Reliance Power’s operating project portfolio is well diversified

in terms of location, fuel source and off-takers. Projects’ key

differentiators help mitigate sectoral challenges highlighted above.

Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project, developed by Sasan Power Ltd.,

is the most competitive thermal power supplier for all its procurers;

has a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) in place and

a strong payment security mechanism mitigating risks relating to

demand and weak financial condition of distribution companies.

Further, it has a captive coal mine, which provides complete fuel

security. During FY22, Sasan recorded a Plant Load Factor (PLF)

of 94.19%, which is the highest PLF in the country, a distinction

achieved for the fourth successive year. Rosa Power Project,

developed by Rosa Power Supply Company Ltd., operates under

a cost-plus business model wherein tariffs are determined by the

State Regulator under Section 62 of Electricity Act. Rosa Power

too has a long-term PPA in place and has a three-tier payment

security mechanism mitigating demand & payment related risks.

Rosa has always consistently maintained its high plant availability,

with FY 22 witnessing a plant availability of 85%.

Sasan Power and Rosa Power have been working in right

earnest towards implementation of projects to comply with new

environmental norms.:
