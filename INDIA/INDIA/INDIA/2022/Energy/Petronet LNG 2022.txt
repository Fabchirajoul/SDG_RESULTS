DeAR SHAReHOLDeRS

On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is our privilege and

honour to present the Twenty-fourth Annual Report along with

Audited Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements

and Auditors’ Report thereon for the financial year ended

31st March, 2022.

PHYSICAL PeRFORMANCe

DAHeJ LNG TeRMINAL

India, like the rest of the world has also gone through an

extremely challenging year 2021-22 for energy, especially

Natural Gas and LNG. Despite the high LNG prices globally and

energy supply related challenges, Dahej LNG Terminal having

17.5 MMTPA nameplate capacity, operated at about 15.32

MMTPA (87.5 %) during the FY 2021-22 as compared to 16.40

MMTPA (93.7 %) in the FY 2020-21. Despite all the odds, Dahej

terminal achieved highest ever daily throughput of around

73 MMSCM on 03.07.2021.

During the financial year 2021-22, the Dahej Terminal handled

232 LNG Cargoes and supplied 792.9 TBTUs of RLNG as

compared to 254 LNG cargoes and RLNG supplies of 849.24

TBTUs in previous financial year.

Dahej Terminal’s truck loading operations demonstrated

significant improvement, on a cumulative note, 4040 trucks

were loaded during the period April 2021- March 2022 as

compared to 2852 trucks during the previous year i.e increase

of around ~ 41.7% and loaded highest number of 25 trucks on a

single day on 03rd January 2022.

Despite marginally lower capacity utilization during FY 2021-22,

efficient operations of Dahej plant resulted in an improvement

of ~ 2.4% in average specific power consumption as compared

to that of previous financial year.

KOCHI LNG TeRMINAL

Kochi Terminal having name plate capacity 5 MMTPA, operated at

1.04 MMTPA (20.7%) during the FY 2021-22, as compared to 0.90

MMTPA (18.09%) in the FY 2020-21. Also, Kochi terminal achieved

highest ever throughput of 6.15 MMSCMD on 26.08.2021. The

utilization of Kochi Terminal increased further during 2021-22,

owing to commissioning of pipeline connectivity to Mangalore

in year 2020 and other sections in year 2021 of GAIL’s Kochi-

Koottanad-Bangalore-Mangalore Natural Gas pipeline, thereby

connecting new customers on RLNG.

During the FY 2021-22 Kochi Terminal handled 16 LNG Cargoes

as compared to 14 LNG Cargoes in FY 2020-21 and supplied

54 TBtus of RLNG as compared to 46.92 TBtus in FY 2020-21.

LNG was also supplied through trucks to various consumers

in the absence of pipeline connectivity. Kochi Terminal’s truck

loading operations also demonstrated significant improvement

wherein, 471 trucks were loaded during FY 2021-22 as compared

to 376 trucks during FY 2020-21 i.e. increase of around ~ 25.3%.

Also, trial run of marine fishing boat on dual fuel (LNG + Diesel)

has been successfully completed, which will pave the way for

use of LNG in fishing boats and develop a new segment of gas

consumption in the country, which will have huge potential to

contribute in making India gas-based economy.

Ex Ship (DES) basis and fourth long term-chartered LNG vessel

“Prachi” was novated to Exxon Mobil in the year 2017-18.

During FY 2021-22, the overall shipping operations have run

smoothly and efficiently. The jetty utilization has been optimized

that none of the contingencies described below would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,

results of operations or cash flows.”

notices by way of writ petitions before the Hon’ble High Court of Gujarat who had quashed the supplementary bill/demand

notice and remanded the case back to the Collector of Electricity Duty vide order dated 1 July 2014. The Company has made

its submissions before the Collector of Electricity Duty, Gandhinagar and same has been resubmitted during the year in fresh

to Section 24 of the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958. The Hon’ble High Court of Gujarat has quashed the notice. Stamp authorities

have filed Special Leave Petition (SLP) in Hon’ble Supreme Court against the same and the case is pending as on date.

The potential liability from the effective date of amendment i.e. 1 April 2006 till 31 March 2022 on the CIF value would be

Rs. 32,719 lac (Rs. 29,514 lac as on 31 March 2021).

c.

The Company has received refund of Rs.112 lac, Rs.284 lac and Rs.346 lac from Customs department vide CESTAT order dated

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial

liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to

ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and

stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding

through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out market positions.

Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Company treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining

availability under committed credit lines.:
