ANNEXURE TO THE DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Annual Report 2021-22

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

letter.

1.

Maintenance of secretarial record is the responsibility of

the management of the Company. My responsibility is

to express an opinion on these secretarial records based

on my audit.

2.

I have followed the audit practices and processes as

were appropriate to obtain reasonable assurance about

the correctness of the contents of the secretarial

records. The verification was done on the test basis to

ensure that correct facts are reflected in secretarial

records. I believe that the process and practices,

I followed, provide reasonable basis for my opinion.

3.

I have not verified the correctness and appropriateness

of financial records and books of accounts of the

Company.

4.

Wherever required, I have obtained the management

representation about the compliance of the laws, rules

and regulations and happening of events etc.

5.

The compliance of the provisions of corporate and other

applicable laws, rules, regulations and standards is the

responsibility of the management. My examination was

limited to the verification of procedure on test basis.

6.

The secretarial audit report is neither an assurance as to

future viability of the Company nor of the efficacy or

effectiveness with which the management has

conducted the affairs of the Company.
