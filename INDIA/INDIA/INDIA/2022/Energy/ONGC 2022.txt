Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors of your Company, it is my

pleasure to present the 29th Annual Report of Oil And Natural

Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC/ the Company) and its Audited

Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 (FY’22),

together with the Auditors’ Report and Comments on the Financial

Statements by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India.

As the global economy recovers from the stress of COVID-19

pandemic, supply chain disruptions, extreme weather events,

energy supply crunch and geo political upheavels have caused

turbulence in energy sector. With global demand rebounding and

outpacing supply, energy prices have increased substantially from

the last years level. Years of inadequate financial returns coupled

with low commodity prices and surge in net zero aspirations have

depressed investments in fossil fuels. The whittled down spare

capacity has contributed to the present demand supply mismatch

and the same is not expected to moderate in 2022.

Your Company, on its part, has been maintaining the pace of

capital spending and project execution, sustaining its production,

optimizing operating costs to improve the value proposition for all

stakeholders while looking for cleaner ways of doing its business.

Your Company, along with its group companies, has registered yet

another year of robust performance and made substantial progress

on most of the priority areas.

Despite the challenges faced by the Company during the second

wave of pandemic and the consequent logistic constraints, your

Company’s standalone production during the year was 40.453

Million Metric Tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas (MMTOE) (against

FY’21 production of 42.369 MMTOE ).

• Crude oil production, including share of JV production, was

21.707 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT) during FY’22 against 22.533

MMT during the previous year.

• Natural gas production, including share of JV production, was at

21.680 Billion Cubic Metres (BCM) against 22.816 BCM during

FY’21.

• Value Added Products (VAP) production during FY’22 was 3.089

MMT against 3.120 MMT during FY’21.

Backed by an intensive and continuous exploration programme,

your Company declared four oil and gas discoveries (two on-land

and two offshore) during FY’22.

During FY’22, accretion of In-place volume and EUR (Estimated

Ultimate Reserves) in 2P category from ONGC operated areas

in India has been 90.50 MMTOE and 40.82 MMTOE respectively.

Reserve Replacement Ratio (RRR – 2P EUR) from domestic

fields was 1.01 with respect to 2P reserves. Your Company has

maintained Reserve Replacement Ratio (2P) of more than 1 for the

16th consecutive year.

Your Company has four direct subsidiaries, namely ONGC Videsh

Limited (OVL), Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited

(MRPL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) and

Petronet MHB Limited (PMHBL).

Your Company also has nine Associates/ Joint Ventures, namely

ONGC Petro additions Limited (OPaL), ONGC Tripura Power

Company Limited (OTPC), ONGC TERI Biotech Limited (OTBL),

Dahej SEZ Limited (DSL), Mangalore SEZ Limited (MSEZL),

5. INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

There was only one (01) Independent Director in the Company

Directors, including one Independent Woman Director, were

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

letter dated May 25, 2017, June 4, 2018 and January 14, 2019 had

asked contractor for re-casting of accounts of the PMT JV and for

remitting the respective PI share of balance dues including interest

till the date of remittance. As the Company is not a party to the

arbitration, the details of the proceedings of arbitration and copy of

the order of London High Court are not available with the company.

The Company has responded that The English High Court has

delivered its final verdict on May 2, 2018 following which the Arbitral

Tribunal re-considered some of its earlier findings from the 2016 FPA

(Revised Award); The Government of India and JV Partners have

challenged parts of the Revised Award before English court. On

February 12, 2020, the English Court passed a verdict favouring the

challenges made by BGEPIL and RIL and also remitted the matter

in the Revised Award back to Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration.

In January 2021, the Tribunal issued a verdict favouring BGEPIL/

RIL on the remitted matter, which has been challenged by the GOI

before the English Court. Pending finalization of the decision of

the Arbitral Tribunal, the Company has indicated in their letters to

DGH that the final recasting of the accounts is premature and the

issues raised by DGH may be kept in abeyance and therefore no

provision for the same has been considered necessary and has

been considered as contingent liability.

iv. Note No. 48.1(b), with respect to ongoing disputes/demands

raised on various work centres of the company under Service Tax

(ST) and Goods & Service Tax (GST) in respect of ST and GST on

Royalty levied on Crude Oil and Natural Gas. Based on the legal

opinion, the company has disputed such levies and contesting the

same at various forums. The estimated amounts under disputes as

worked out towards ST and GST (including interest and penalty upto

March 31, 2022) of ` 40,172.56 million and ` 1,02,731.94 million

respectively (Total ` 1,42,904.50 million), has been considered

as contingent liability. As a measure of abundant caution, the

company has deposited ST and GST along with interest under

protest amounting to ` 13,524.39 million and ` 74,043.48 million

respectively (Total ` 87,567.87 million).

Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements is not modified

in respect of these matters.

supervision of Directorate General of Hydrocarbons. The Company

issued notice of award (NOA) for 49 marginal fields covering 13

contract areas through the bidding process and signed contacts

for production enhancement for 21 marginal fields and NOA of 28

fields were cancelled due to non-submission of performance bank

guarantee by the successful bidders.

has handed over 19 fields to the contractors upto March 31, 2022

and handing over of 2 fields is in progress. For bid out of balance 43

marginal nomination fields in 11 Contract Areas the company had

currently under assessment and the impact of the same on the

carrying value of oil and gas assets is not material.

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited

letter dated July 4, 2011, had

directed the Company not to participate in the Arbitration initiated

by the JV Partners (BGEPIL & RIL). MoP&NG has also stated that

the Arbitral Award would be applicable to the Company also as a

constituent of the Contractor for both the PSCs.

Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), vide letters dated

May 25, 2017 had informed the Company that on October 12,

2016, a Final Partial Award (FPA) was pronounced by the Tribunal

in the said arbitrations. As informed by BGEPIL additionally Audit

Award on January 11, 2018, Agreement Case Award on October

1, 2018 and Jurisdictional Award on March 12, 2019 wherein the

principles relating to the aforesaid disputes were pronounced.

However, the details of proceedings of the FPA and other Orders

are not available with the Company. DGH, vide their: letter dated

May 25, 2017 and June 4, 2018, marked to the Contractors, had

directed the payment of differential Government of India share of

Profit Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be payable by Contractors

pursuant to Governments interpretation of the FPA (40% share of

the Company amounting to US$ 1,624.05 million, including interest

upto November 30, 2016) equivalent to ` 123,021.60 million @

` 75.75 i.e. closing rate as on March 31,2022 (March 31, 2021:

` 119,351.43 million). In response to the letters of DGH, the JV

partners (with a copy marked to all Joint Venture Partners) had stated

that demand of DGH was premature as the FPA did not make any

money award in favour of Government of India, since quantification

of liabilities were to be determined during the final proceedings of

the arbitration. Further the award had also been challenged before

the English Commercial Court (London High Court). Based on

the above facts, the Company had also responded to the letters

of DGH stating that pending finality of the order, the amount due

and payable by the Company was not quantifiable. In view of the

Company, if any changes are approved for increase in the Cost

Recovery Limit (CRL) by the Arbitral Tribunal as per the terms of the

PSCs the liability to DGH would potentially reduce.

The English Court has delivered its final verdict on May 2, 2018

following which the Arbitral Tribunal re-considered some of its earlier

findings from the 2016 FPA (Revised Award).The Government of

India and JV Partners have challenged parts of the Revised Award

before English Court. On February 12, 2020, the English Court

passed a verdict favoring the challenges made by BGEPIL and RIL

and also remitted the matter in the Revised Award back to Arbitral

Tribunal for reconsideration. Based on the information shared by

BGEPIL in January 2021, the Tribunal issued a verdict favoring

BGEPIL/RIL on the remitted matter, which has been challenged by

the GOI before the English Court.

Based on the information shared by one of the JV partners in the

earlier periods, The GOI has also filed an execution petition before

the Hon’ble Delhi High Court seeking enforcement and execution

of the October 12, 2016 FPA. BGEIPL / RIL contend that GOI’s

execution petition is not maintainable and have opposed the reliefs

sought by the GOI under the said petition. The matter is pending

before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court and no final orders on the

reliefs sought by the GOI have been passed so far. In January 2018,

the Company along with the JV partners has filed an application

with MC for increase in CRL in terms of the PSCs.

The application has been rejected by MC. Pursuant to the rejection,

the JV partners have filed a claim with Arbitral Tribunal. One of the

JV partners has further informed the Company that the hearing

before the Arbitral Tribunal has been partially heard in the quarter.

Further the additional hearing are scheduled to be heard in the

Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of the year 2022.

DGH vide letter dated January 14, 2019 has advised the

contractors to re-cast the accounts for Panna-Mukta and Mid and

South Tapti Fields for the year 2017-18. Pending finalization of the

decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, the JV partners and the Company

had indicated in their letters to DGH that the final recasting of the

accounts was premature and thus the issues raised by DGH may

be kept in abeyance.

During the financial year 2010-11, the Oil Marketing Companies,

nominees of the Government of India (GoI) recovered US$ 80.18

million (Share of the Company US$ 32.07 million (equivalent to

` 2,429.30 million)) as per directives of GoI in respect of Joint

Operation - Panna Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts

(PSCs). The recovery is towards certain observations raised by

auditors appointed by the

letter dated December, 31, 2014, that royalty should not be taken

as a basis for fixation of Stamp Duty to the mining leases granted

under the ORD Act read with PNG Rules.

The Solicitor General of India, through his opinion dated May 05,

2007, had also opined that the distinction between royalty and

rent is well settled. Rent would be payable regardless of whether

the property is worked upon or not. On the other hand, royalty is

a variable figure. It would depend upon the quantity of mineral

obtained. If the mine is not worked upon, rent would nevertheless

be payable. Hence, he opined that inclusion of royalty for the

purpose of calculation of stamp duty is unjustified and not tenable.

In absence of clarity on the issue the amount of firm liability or

contingent liability is unascertainable.

48.1.2 A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from

past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the

occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future

events not wholly within the control of the entity. During the normal

course of business, several unresolved claims are currently

outstanding. The inflow of economic benefits, in respect of such

claims cannot be measured due to uncertainties that surround the

related events and circumstances.

asked contractor for re-casting of accounts of the PMT JV and for

remitting the respective PI share of balance dues including interest

2, 2018 following which the Arbitral Tribunal re-considered some

back to Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. In January 2021, the

Tribunal issued a verdict favouring BGEPIL/RIL on the remitted

Court. Pending finalization of the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal,

as indicated in Part C of Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013. The

impact on account of above change is decrease in depreciation by

` 1,141.81 million during current financial year. Overall future impact

grants. The Company had adjusted the cost of Property, Plant and

Equipment as at April 1, 2017 and credited deferred Government

grant amounting to ` 3,618.21 million. The deferred Government

grant is amortised over the remaining useful life of the Property,

Plant and Equipment amounting to ` 159.02 million for the year

ended March 31, 2022 (Year ended March 31, 2021 ` 159.02

million).

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

letter dated August 8,

2006 from the contractor / JV for an amount of US$ 166 million

as short paid on account of cost recovery of Development cost in

excess of Base Development Cost.

In August 2008 three JV partners excluding the company had

invoked arbitration against Government of India (GoI) on the issue.

The contention of claim as operator was that it should be allowed

100% Cost recovery of the Base Development cost. The issue was

argued at various levels including court of Appeals and Malaysian

Federal Court. The decision of court was in favour of JV partners.

After Federal court of Malaysia decision, the case was filed with

Delhi High court for enforcement of award in India. Delhi High Court

vide order dated February 19, 2020 allowed enforcement of the

Arbitration Award including declaratory relief. GoI had filed an SLP

in Honorable Supreme Court of India against the said order and

the judgment dated September 16, 2020 was in favour JV partner.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), GoI vide: letter

dated October 10, 2018 issued a recovery notice to Oil Marketing

companies (OMCs) for US$ 52 million plus applicable interest

towards short payment of Government share of Profit Petroleum

on account of dispute of Cost recovery of Base Development

cost from the payments made to the Company towards the sales

proceeds of Crude Oil and Natural Gas. During the year OMCs

deducted and deposited the sales proceeds of Crude Oil and

Natural Gas to MoPNG and the entire amount of US$ 83 million

(US$ 52 million along with interest of US$31 million) (equivalent to `

6,099.67 million) has been recovered.

In view of the Supreme Court Judgment for enforcement of arbitration

award in India, an amount of US$ 83 million (US $ 52 million along with

interest of US$31 million) has been adjusted from profit petroleum

payable to GoI during the year 2020-21 and 2021-22.

the Mozambique Operations, recoverable from the National Oil

Company of Mozambique relating to Area-1 offshore Mozambique

based upon clause 9.13(e) of EPCC and clause 4 of funding

agreement. The said item is tested for impairment under Ind AS 36,

considering the repayment is directly linked with the positive cash

flows from the project on commercial production.

letter dated 22nd April 2021 in the project due to security

situation. The site was evacuated on 2nd April 2021. In view of the

FM situation various expenditures were incurred in the nature of

stoppage, standby, settlement and preservation costs. The Group

has assessed that these costs amounting to ` 6,885.59 million are

not directly attributable to completion of underlying assets and

therefore have been charged to the statement of profit and loss

account. Further, Considering the force majeure, capitalisation

of borrowing costs amounting to ` 3,139.38 million has been

suspended effective from April, 2021 and the said borrowing costs

have been charged to the statement of profit and loss account.

2022, Input Tax Credit under GST amounting to ` 891.70 million

has been claimed by the company in the GST returns filed and

the same is reflected in the Electronic Credit Ledger (ECL) of the

Said order of Bombay High Court was challenged by HDCPL

before its Division Bench and is still pending before the Court. In the

meantime, HDCPL had initiated an arbitration proceeding against

MoPNG for termination of PSC. However, PPCL is not a part of it.

Under Section 9 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, Directorate

General of hydrocarbon (DGH) on behalf of MoP&NG has initiated

The Company along with Consortium member, M/s Hindustan

Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) (PI - 60%) and M/s M3nergy

(PI – 30%) was awarded a Contract vide letter of award dated

31st March, 2006 for the development of ONGC’s offshore marginal

Oilfields viz. B -192, B - 45 and WO – 24. The Service Contract for

Cluster-7 was signed on 27th September, 2006 between ONGC and

Consortium members. The Company is the Executing Contractor

and its participating interest (PI) is 10%.

The said Service Contract was terminated by ONGC. Subsequently,

HPCL/PPCL started arbitration proceedings against M3nergy which

are still in progress, hence the joint bank account has not been

closed.

53.3.2.4 SR – ONN – 2004 / 1 (South Rewa Block)

The Company along with Consortium member M/s Jaiprakash

Associates Limited (PI - 90%) was awarded PSC for the SR-

ONN-2004/1 block vide letter dated 12th February, 2007 of Ministry

of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MOP & NG) under NELP – VI round.

The Company is the executing contractor and its PI is 10%. The

PSC was signed on 2nd March, 2007.

Consortium has proposed to relinquish the block effective from

23rd October, 2014 and Operating Committee Resolution (OCR)

for relinquishment of the block has been submitted to

letter dated July 4, 2011, had

directed the Company not to participate in the Arbitration initiated

by the JV Partners (BGEPIL & RIL). MoP&NG has also stated that

the Arbitral Award would be applicable to the Company also as a

constituent of the Contractor for both the PSCs.

Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), vide letters dated

May 25, 2017 had informed the Company that on October 12,

2016, a Final Partial Award (FPA) was pronounced by the Tribunal

in the said arbitrations. As informed by BGEPIL additionally Audit

Award on January 11, 2018, Agreement Case Award on October

1, 2018 and Jurisdictional Award on March 12, 2019 wherein the

principles relating to the aforesaid disputes were pronounced.

However, the details of proceedings of the FPA and other Orders

are not available with the Company. DGH, vide their: letter dated

May 25, 2017 and June 4, 2018, marked to the Contractors, had

directed the payment of differential Government of India share of

Profit Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be payable by Contractors

pursuant to Governments interpretation of the FPA (40% share of

the Company amounting to US$ 1,624.05 million, including interest

upto November 30, 2016) equivalent to ` 123,022 million @ `

75.75 i.e. closing rate as on March 31,2022 (March 31, 2021: `

119,351.43 million). In response to the letters of DGH, the JV

partners (with a copy marked to all Joint Venture Partners) had stated

that demand of DGH was premature as the FPA did not make any

money award in favour of Government of India, since quantification

of liabilities were to be determined during the final proceedings of

the arbitration. Further the award had also been challenged before

the English Commercial Court (London High Court). Based on

the above facts, the Company had also responded to the letters

of DGH stating that pending finality of the order, the amount due

and payable by the Company was not quantifiable. In view of the

Company, if any changes are approved for increase in the Cost

Recovery Limit (CRL) by the Arbitral Tribunal as per the terms of the

PSCs the liability to DGH would potentially reduce.

The English Court has delivered its final verdict on May 2, 2018

following which the Arbitral Tribunal re-considered some of its earlier

findings from the 2016 FPA (Revised Award).The Government of

India and JV Partners have challenged parts of the Revised Award

before English Court. On February 12, 2020, the English Court

passed a verdict favoring the challenges made by BGEPIL and RIL

and also remitted the matter in the Revised Award back to Arbitral

Tribunal for reconsideration. Based on the information shared by

BGEPIL in January 2021, the Tribunal issued a verdict favoring

BGEPIL/RIL on the remitted matter, which has been challenged by

the GOI before the English Court.

Based on the information shared by one of the JV partners in the

earlier periods, The GOI has also filed an execution petition before

the Hon’ble Delhi High Court seeking enforcement and execution

of the October 12, 2016 FPA. BGEIPL / RIL contend that GOI’s

execution petition is not maintainable and have opposed the reliefs

sought by the GOI under the said petition. The matter is pending

before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court and no final orders on the

reliefs sought by the GOI have been passed so far. In January 2018,

the Company along with the JV partners has filed an application

with MC for increase in CRL in terms of the PSCs.

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited

letter dated January 14, 2019 has advised the

contractors to re-cast the accounts for Panna-Mukta and Mid and

South Tapti Fields for the year 2017-18. Pending finalization of the

decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, the JV partners and the Company

had indicated in their letters to DGH that the final recasting of the

accounts was premature and thus the issues raised by DGH may

be kept in abeyance.

During the financial year 2010-11, the Oil Marketing Companies,

nominees of the Government of India (GoI) recovered US$ 80.18

million (Share of the Company US$ 32.07 million (equivalent to

` 2,429.30 million)) as per directives of GoI in respect of Joint

Operation - Panna Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts

(PSCs). The recovery is towards certain observations raised by

auditors appointed by the Director General of Hydrocarbons (DGH)

under the two PSCs for the period 2002-03 to 2005-06 in respect of

cost and profit petroleum share payable to GoI

Pending finality by Arbitration Tribunal on various issues raised

above, re-casting of the financial statements and final quantification

of liabilities, no provision has been accounted in the financial

statements. The demand raised by DGH, amounting to US$

1,624.05 million equivalent to ` 123,021.60 million@ ` 75.75 i.e.

closing rate as on 31.03.2022 (March 31, 2021: ` 119,351.43

million) has been considered as contingent liability.

The Company’s share of US$ 32.07 million ` 2,429.30 million @ `

75.75 i.e. closing rate as on 31.03.2022 (March 31, 2021: ` 2,356.82

million) recovered by Government of India has been disclosed

under Note No.19.1 in the financial statements.

58.1.5 The Company is operating Petroleum Mining Leases (PML)

granted by the State Government (s) after initial clearance from the

Government of India (GoI). The grant of oil mining lease is regulated

and governed by the provisions of the Oilfields [Regulation

and Development] Act 1948 (ORD Act). Once the lease order is

granted, the lessee has to execute lease deeds with the respective

State Government. The stamp duty on the executed lease deed

is payable as per the Stamp Act of the respective States. Certain

State Governments are of the view to include the amount of Royalty

apart from other payments like Security Deposit, surface rent and

dead rent etc. for the purpose of calculation of stamp duty under

the Stamp Duty Act (s) applicable for such States.

However, the company is of the view that the royalty payable by the

Company is not a rent to the State Government(s) but is payable

under Rule 14 of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 1959

(PNG Rules). There is a distinction between the concept of rent

and royalty. The word “royalty” signifies in mining lease that part

of reddendum which is variable and depends upon the quantity of

minerals gotten or the mineral worked out within a specified period.

Whereas rent is the amount payable for use and occupation of

land. Hence, it could be reasonably assumed that for the purpose

of calculation of stamp duty, amount of royalty would not form part

of the consideration value of lease deeds to be executed for PML

granted. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of

India communicated to the State Government of Tamil Nadu vide: letter dated December, 31, 2014, that royalty should not be taken

as a basis for fixation of Stamp Duty to the mining leases granted

under the ORD Act read with PNG Rules.

The Solicitor General of India, through his opinion dated May 05,

2007, had also opined that the distinction between royalty and

rent is well settled. Rent would be payable regardless of whether

the property is worked upon or not. On the other hand, royalty is

a variable figure. It would depend upon the quantity of mineral

obtained. If the mine is not worked upon, rent would nevertheless

be payable. Hence, he opined that inclusion of royalty for the

purpose of calculation of stamp duty is unjustified and not tenable.

In absence of clarity on the issue the amount of firm liability or

contingent liability is unascertainable.

58.1.6 In respect of subsidiary, OVL

The Service Tax Department had issued a demand cum show-

cause notice dated October 11, 2011 requiring the Company to

show cause why service tax amounting to ` 28,163.14 million

(including Education Cess and SHE cess), the interest on such

amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered from

the Company. Service Tax Department has calculated these tax

amounts based on foreign currency expenditure reported in the

Company’s financial statements covering the reporting periods

from April 1, 2006 to December 31, 2010 and contending that

these expenses represent business auxiliary services rendered by

the Company foreign branches and operator of the Joint Venture/

Consortium to the Company. Subsequently, five more demand-

cum-show cause notices have been issued based on similar

contentions covering the period upto March 31, 2015 to show

cause why service tax amounting to ` 32,863.61 million (including

Education cess and SHE cess), the interest on such amount and

penalty should not be demanded and recovered from the Company.

A demand-cum-show cause notice has been issued based on

similar contentions covering the period April 1, 2015 to March 31,

2017 to show cause why service tax amounting to ` 15,633.22

million (including Education cess and SHE cess), the interest on

such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered

from the Company. Further, a demand-cum-show cause notice dt.

10.02.2020 has been issued based on similar contentions covering

the period April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 to show cause why service

tax amounting to ` 2119.93 million (including Education cess and

SHE cess), the interest on such amount and penalty should not

be demanded and recovered from the Company.The Company is

of the view that the said service tax is not payable and contesting

the same. No provision is required to be made in the financial

statements at this stage. In the assessment of the management

based on independent and competent legal opinion obtained

and other attendant factors including circular no. 35/9/2018-GST

dated March 05, 2018 issued by Central Board of Excise and

Customs, the possibility of the success of the Company’s position

is extremely high and the possibility of the success of contentions

of the Department is very low. Since the chances of payability of

the service tax itself have been evaluated by the management as

being remote/very low, the chances of assessment of interest and

penalty are evaluated to be much lower. Accordingly, the amounts

covered by the abovementioned show-cause notices (i.e. tax

amount as well as potential interest and penalty thereon) are not

considered as contingent liability in accordance with the applicable

accounting standards. Further, according to the legal opinion

obtained by the Company, a show-cause notice in itself does not

qualify as a demand and the chance of the claim being payable by

the Company is remote as the Company has a very good case to

argue and succeed before the concerned authorities based on the

legal position as on date.

58.1.7 In respect of subsidiary MRPL, there is a claim from the custom

department for customs duty amounting to ` 2,121.14 million

The Company has set up a Petrochemical Complex in Special

Economic Zone (SEZ), situated at Dahej, State of Gujarat. In view

of changes in market dynamics over the years, the demand for

petrochemical products has increased in domestic market and

India is now a net importer of polymers. Therefore, Company is

selling its majority of products in Domestic Tariff Area (DTA), thereby

substituting the imports and saving foreign exchange outflow of the

country. However, Basic Custom Duty is applicable on the sale of

products from SEZ to DTA which is directly impacting the margin of

the company. Therefore, Board of directors has accorded approval

to make an application for voluntary exit from SEZ.
