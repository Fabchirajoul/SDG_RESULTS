OVERVIEW: Message from the

MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN: Dear Shareholders,

While the global economy is facing many headwinds in

the form of economic slowdowns in developed markets,

geo-political crisis and rising commodity prices, the Indian

economy has displayed remarkable resilience amidst a

challenging external environment. The latest Economic

Survey forecasts India’s GDP growth at a healthy 6 to

6.8%. The compounding effect of liberalization, robust

macroeconomic policies implemented over several decades,

growing domestic demand and strong GDP growth has

created a favorable growth environment for India.

Similar to how a monument is built over a period, starting

with the foundation, the laying of brick after brick, then

the pillars, followed by the roof, and then the flag at the

top, building something spectacular takes time and effort.

Small changes done patiently and persistently compound

to significant growth and transformation. In 2022, Castrol

India leveraged this power of compounding to achieve

resilient growth while being relevant to its customers and

supporting their needs.

Your Company implemented transformational initiatives

in four key areas to sustain the current growth momentum

and accelerate future growth. First, improving supply chain

efficiencies, to stabilize the effects of rising base oil and

additive prices and bringing in better productivity at the

Castrol India plants. Second, enhancing its distribution &

customer reach to explore new markets and geographies.

Third, bringing in financial efficiency with robust working

capital management. And fourth, implementing

management efficiency, doing more with less and utilizing

the compounding of year-on-year incremental growth.

This compounding of incremental growth has helped

shape the Castrol brand to what it is today. However,

incremental improvement and compounding cannot be

the only growth plan. This is where having a future-proof

strategy becomes imperative! Your Company is future-

proofing its business by actively transitioning from being

a trusted product brand, to a products & services brand. In

2022, Castrol acquired a 7% stake in ki Mobility Solutions,

part of TVS Group and a leading digital platform company

in automotive aftermarket, with an investment of Rs. 487.5

Crores, marking the single largest all-cash deal till date

for your Company!

Castrol is already a renowned global lubricant brand. With

the foray into service & maintenance and adjacencies such

as aftermarket auto care, Castrol aims to transition into

a renowned product and services brand. Another growth

area for your Company is the rapidly evolving electric

mobility space. In India, less than 1% of total cars sold are

electric vehicles (EV) and industry reports predict that the

EV transition will happen faster in the two-wheeler and

three-wheeler space.

Your Company already supplies EV fluids to four-wheeler EV

OEMs such as Tata Motors, MG Motor and BYD. In addition,

Castrol India is exploring technology collaborations with two

and three-wheeler EV OEMs. On the product side, Castrol

India will soon launch its innovative range of Castrol ON

EV fluids for the EV aftermarket. The incremental impact of

these initiatives will be seen over the next few years.

On the sustainability front, Castrol India continued to make

steady progress in 2022 across its three focus areas of

saving waste, reducing carbon and improving people’s lives.

Sustainable, honest, and enlightened companies make

it a priority to improve year after year. This incremental

improvement is not only imperative for growth and survival,

but is crucial to evolve, adapt and add value to society,

customers, employees and shareholders. Castrol India is

deeply aware of this responsibility and will continue to strive

towards growth, transformation and value creation for all

its stakeholders.

R Gopalakrishnan,

MANAGING DIRECTOR: Dear Shareholders,

2022 was a challenging year with a volatile and difficult

business environment, but the team at Castrol India

demonstrated agility and delivered a resilient financial

performance. We registered annual Revenue from

Operations of Rs. 4,774 Crores, delivering 14% growth from

2021. Profit Before Tax for 2022 stood at Rs. 1,093 Crores,

marking a growth of 6% from 2021.

In 2022, we continued to keep safety at the center of our

operations. Our plants at Silvassa, Patalganga and Paharpur

completed 10 years, 6 years, and 5 years of recordable

injury-free operations respectively. Our Industrial Complete

Chemical Management Services team also completed 10

years of recordable injury-free operations.

To balance rising input costs and increased forex &

inflationary challenges in 2022, we undertook strategic

pricing decisions to maintain an optimal price-volume mix.

This helped us navigate 2022 successfully. Not only did we

protect our margins and achieve healthy volume growth, but

we also surpassed our volumes from 2021 and even from

2019 (pre-pandemic)! Further, we made steady progress

on several forward-looking initiatives that will support

Castrol India to become future-ready. These included our

enhanced play in service & maintenance, rural expansion,

and strategic collaborations with leading industry players.

Last year, Castrol Auto Service (CAS) expanded to 230 car

workshops across 110 cities. Castrol Bike Points crossed

5,215 outlets across India and Castrol Express Oil Change

outlets scaled up to 42. One of our biggest milestones from

2022 was our strategic collaboration with TVS-owned

ki Mobility Solutions (KMS), with Castrol acquiring a 7%

stake in KMS through a planned investment of Rs. 487.5

Crores. Castrol’s established brand equity and nation-wide

footprint, combined with KMS’ digital strength will bring

structure to India’s fragmented automotive service sector

and enable consumers to reap the dual benefits of trusted

brands and reliable services.

Advancing our sustainability agenda in 2022, we introduced

targeted interventions in our plant operations, product

packaging, and distribution, with a focus on saving waste,

reducing carbon emissions, and improving people’s lives. In

2021, we had introduced new light-weight bottle designs

for our medium packs that reduced our plastic use on

average by 20% per bottle. In 2022, we launched Castrol

POWER1 ULTIMATE in 100% recycled bottles, made

from reprocessed plastic waste. As part of our Extended

Producer Responsibility, we are also working with key

stakeholders to collect, reuse, and recycle all the plastic we

place in the market.

We continued to make a positive social impact in our

communities. Our CSR initiative, ‘Sarathi Mitra’, completed

five years of supporting truck drivers’ health, wellbeing,

and livelihoods and increased its reach to 169,000 truck

drivers. Castrol Eklavya, our CSR program for mechanics

increased its reach to 244,000 mechanics across India. To

upskill the mechanic community, Castrol India rolled out

a unique EV-readiness training program for car and bike

mechanics in 2022. The initiative covered 200 mechanics

across Delhi and Chennai, and helped them learn the basics

of EVs, diagnostic skills for service & maintenance and gain

certification from ASDC.

All these achievements were made possible thanks to

the dedication of our employees and the continued trust

and support of our shareholders, distributors, customers,

and wider stakeholders. With the Indian economy poised

for growth, we remain confident of the long-term growth

opportunities for Castrol India. We will continue to

strengthen our business by exploring avenues for future

growth and offering sustained value and returns to our

shareholders and the wider society.

5. SUPPLY CHAIN

materials continued to be visible in parts of the portfolio

in 2022. Additionally, Russia-Ukraine war worsened

the external environment and with western world

imposing sanctions on Russia, crude witnessed sharp &

raw material shortages and uncertainties across the

globe including India. Due to this, Base Oil prices which

were originally forecasted to go down in 2022 versus

2021, started increasingly rapidly and significantly.

In this volatile environment, your supply chain has

supported timely pricing decisions through frequent

forecasting & scenario planning. Your sourcing teams

also undertook strategic sourcing of raw materials

both for supply security and cost avoidance. Your

supply chain team continued its focus on servicing the

customers & ensuring supply continuity in an uncertain

supplier market scenario. Your Company continued

to transform while performing, with projects both to
