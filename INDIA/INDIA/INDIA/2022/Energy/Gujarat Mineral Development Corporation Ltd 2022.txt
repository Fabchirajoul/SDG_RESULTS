DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

Financial Year 2021-22 was another unique one

as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to aﬀect

the lives and livelihood of people, and had a

major impact on societies and economies around

the world.

However, GMDC is no stranger to challenges, as

we've always had our visionary leadership to

guide us through challenging times. We take

pride in being India's largest merchant seller of

lignite with ﬁve operational lignite mines in India

at Kutch, South Gujarat, and Bhavnagar region.: MANAGING DIRECTOR

Managing Director

We are revamping

our sales and

marketing function

with revised sales

target and addition

of new customers.

SECURING EFFICIENCIES

Over the next few years, our focus will be to realise more value

by using latest technologies, cutting-edge research and

increased digitalisation. We are building end-to-end

operational eﬃciencies in mining to improve productivity and

cost eﬀectiveness. Increased focus on internal processes and

prudent accounting practices is helping us gain further

eﬃciencies.

Additionally, we are revamping our sales and marketing

function with revised sales target and addition of new

customers. Signiﬁcant steps have been taken to leverage price

buoyancy and implement a dynamic pricing strategy.

SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS

Lowering carbon footprint and supporting green energy is a

key area of focus for us. We have made signiﬁcant strides in this

direction by developing capabilities for beneﬁciation and de-

sulfurisation of lignite. Additionally, we are on the lookout to

expand our footprint in Renewable Energy and are also

working to improve eﬃciencies in the current RE business.

Panandhro Mine is having lease area of 1,151 hectares and 568 hectares. In respect of lease area of 1,151 hectares, the company has

deposited an amount of ` 9,600 Lakh in escrow account as per calculation accepted by the Oﬃce of the Coal Controller of India as

In respect of lease area of 568 hectares, the life of mine was over in March 2007. As lignite was exhausted, the last production of

lignite was done therein in March 2007. It was last done more than two years before the Mine Closure Guidelines, 2009 which came

into force w.e.f. 27th August, 2009. Mine closure activities are also almost over in the said lease area.

In the MCG there was a clause for deposition of funds for mine closure in the escrow account at the prescribed rates. However, there

was no provision in the MCG to apply them with retrospective date. Therefore, the MCG are not applicable in respect of 568

hectares lease area. Hence, the same has not been provided and deposited.
