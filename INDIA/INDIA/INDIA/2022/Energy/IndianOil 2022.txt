S t r o n g G o v e r n a n c e i n L e t t e r a n d S p i r i t:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to present the 63rd Annual Report

and the Fifth Integrated Annual Report of the Company for the

financial year ended March 31, 2022, along with the Audited

Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements and

Auditor’s Report thereon on behalf of the Board of Directors

of the Company.

The year 2021-22 was remarkable for IndianOil both in terms

of challenges and opportunities. The uncertainties on crude

prices coupled with wide demand fluctuations further reiterated

the fact that agility and innovations are the keys to survival

and sustenance in today’s complex business environment.

IndianOil navigated through the Covid-19 pandemic induced

plummeting product demand with innovative strategies,

launch of new products and by optimising its functions

across the value chain from crude procurement to product

positioning.

Through the course of this tumultuous journey, IndianOil

remained committed to ensuring uninterrupted supply of fuel.

Every IOCian and members of the extended IndianOil family

reinforced service excellence and ensured that there was no

panic over fuel availability across the country. Going beyond

the call of duty, the Company worked on supply of the life-

saving liquid medical oxygen with the best possible logistic

solutions leveraging our expansive supply chain.

In order to provide clean cooking fuel to BPL families, Government has approved “Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)”

scheme where free LPG connections are issued by Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to the women belonging to the Below

Poverty Line (BPL) households as per SECC -2011 (Rural) database. The scheme was launched on May 1, 2016. As per the

scheme, the initial cost towards connection charges (Refundable deposit) would be borne by the Central Government for

each card holder. Few State Governments have also extended this scheme to other beneficiaries. As per the scheme, OMCs

would provide an option for EMI/Loans towards cost of burner and 1st refill to the PMUY consumers. The loan amount is

to be recovered from the subsidy amount payable by the government to the customers on each refill sale. During the year,

discounting of the loan has been done based on assumption of 4 refills in a year and respective average subsidy rate per

cylinder under different range of subsidy buckets.

2016 the unamortized portion of the cost was accounted under erstwhile Ind AS 17 as “Prepaid Rentals” and was amortized

as “Rent Expenses” upto 31st March 2019. Subsequently, the unamortized portion as on 1st April 2019 was accounted as

“Right of Use Assets” as per the provision of Ind AS 116. Based on the opinion, the said cost amounting to H 741.00 crore has

been capitalized in books of accounts in respective assets class such as Building, Plant & Equipment etc. by corresponding

reduction in gross block of “Right of Use Assets”. This has resulted in additional depreciation amounting to H 116.00 crore and

buffer of H 5048.09 Crore (after adjustment of uncompensated cost of H 1893.22 Crore) as the retail selling price was less than

MDP and accordingly the revenue from sale of LPG was reduced by this amount.
