Managing Director’s

overview

Overview

The principal message that the

management wishes to convey

to the shareholders is that the

company is engaged in moderating

its liabilities and attempting to

reinvent itself to capitalise on the

opportunities within the global rig

service industry.

One of the casualties of possibly the

longest downtrend seen in the global rig

service market is that the time has come

to stop waiting expectantly for a revival

and seek nimbler and restructured ways of

returning to profitability.

In the past, the company worked with the

optimism that if it remained asset-rich, it

would be empowered to capitalise on a

prospective rebound, maximise cash flows,

pare liabilities and strengthen its Balance

Sheet to be able to live another day. The

optimism could not be sustained given a

mounting deficit and the pressure from

bankers and institutions to moderate debt.

Given this, the company decided to

restructure even as there were signs of a

revival in the crude oil market. We believe

that the recent revival in oil prices following

the Ukraine-Russia war will enhance cash

flows for oil drilling companies that could

prompt the next round of oil exploration.

The company embarked on the exercise

to sell 14 rigs owned by the Company

and its step-down subsidiaries (including

five rigs in the current financial year)

following Board and shareholder approval.

Six rigs have already been delivered and

transactions completed, which helped

moderate debt. The sale of the balance of

eight rigs is in various stages of completion.

We believe that this sale exercise reflects

the company’s commitment to stay

responsive and responsible to the interests

of its stakeholders.

I must reiterate a point that I had made

last year that during the previous sectorial
