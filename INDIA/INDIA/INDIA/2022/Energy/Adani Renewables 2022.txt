turning point in terms of the

world’s movement towards

by embracing ‘Panchamrit’ -

India’s climate action response -

at the 26th session of COP26.

The Company’s success lies in

its ability to respond to the new

energy scenario and discover

new horizons. Our Company has

moved with speed to capitalise

on emerging opportunities. This

third Integrated Report 2021-

22 provides a sectorial context

and strategic journey. Our

commitment is a business model

focused on strengthening a clean

and competitive energy eco-

system.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

Dear stakeholders,

India is the world’s third-largest

energy consuming country.

Even as India’s energy use has

doubled since 2000, 80% of

the demand is still being met by

conventional fuels - coal, oil and

solid biomass.

What makes this space promising

is that with increased incomes

and aspirations, India’s energy

consumption will rise from a

point where it is less than half the

world’s average on a per capita

basis.

With India recovering from a

Covid-induced slump since

2020, a dynamic phase of

energy generation has begun. In

recent years, India has extended

electricity connections to millions

of its citizens, prompting a

massive expansion in renewable

energy sources, led by solar

energy. This is an area where

Adani Green Energy Limited is at

the forefront.

At AGEL, we are driven by a

commitment to lead India’s

transition to renewable energy

agenda. In line with this large

vision, we have been widening

Dear stakeholders,

Through our Integrated Report,

which comprises ESG disclosures,

we aim to deepen our stakeholder

engagement.

After two weeks of intense

negotiations at the UN COP

26 Climate Summit in Glasgow,

countries agreed upon the

Glasgow Climate Pact. The Pact

builds upon targets set out in the

Paris Agreement, an international

legally binding treaty, that aims

to limit global warming to 1.5

degrees Celsius when compared

to the pre-industrial levels.

No industry has more potential

to reduce carbon emissions and

confront climate change than

the renewable energy sector.

As one of the largest renewable

energy companies in India, Adani

Green Energy Limited (AGEL/

company) is committed to build

a sustainable energy future that

is affordable, reliable and clean.

As a renewable energy leader,

climate-related issues are core

to our strategy. Our entire Board,

led by our Chairman, has an

oversight of climate-related risks

and opportunities. An oversight

of climate-related issues include

physical risks from climate

change, government policies,

incentives, international carbon

negotiations, renewable energy

and emerging technologies,

among others.
