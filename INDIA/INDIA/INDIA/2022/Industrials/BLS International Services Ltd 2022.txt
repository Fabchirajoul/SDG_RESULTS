PROGRESSING WITH

PASSION, DELIVERING

INDUSTRY-LEADING

VALUE TO STAKEHOLDERS: Dear Shareholders,

FY 2021-22 has been one of the most challenging and

difficult times for all of us. The way everyone came

together and displayed tremendous grit and resilience,

fills me with a sense of optimism and confidence.

We ensured business resilience and continuity by

restarting our operations amidst the pandemic, while

also ensuring health and safety of our workforce and

the applicants visiting our centers.

Against the backdrop of a challenging operating

environment, we undertook proactive measures

to sustain our growth trajectory, which had been

consistent for years, and ensured long-term value

creation for our stakeholders.

Global visa application centers have significantly

contributed towards growth in the Indian economy

during the pandemic. International borders opened

and travel restrictions began to ease during the year.

Driven by the opening up of economies and a pick-up

in travel industry across the globe and reduction in

COVID-19 cases, our visa services showed tremendous

resilience. In terms of number of applications, we

reached almost 63% of our pre-COVID levels. Our

Consular services surpassed pre-COVID levels.

As global operations resumed, we swiftly updated

and followed the COVID-19 Standard Operating

Procedures (SOP) and COVID-19 guidelines. Regular

safety awareness trainings were provided to

employees through the digital medium. We equipped

all our centers with the corrective resources to

protect the staff and customers. Security personnel

were equipped for crowd management, and social

distancing and security screening were ensured, as

per the protocols.

Our business volumes started recovering in the first

half of FY2022. Although we foresee market conditions

to remain volatile, we expect a general trend of

strengthening business recovery over the next couple

of years. We expect sustained momentum with the

opening up of borders and with an increased appetite

for global travel.

AS A RESPONSIBLE GLOBAL CITIZEN, BLS REMAINS DEEPLY

COMMITTED TO ENHANCE OUR VALUE PROPOSITION FOR ALL

OUR STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH CONTINUOUS INVESTMENT

IN HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY.

Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

FY2022 was another unique year as the COVID-19

pandemic continued to affect the lives and livelihood

of people for two consecutive years. However, this was

followed by better-than-expected economic recovery

and businesses picking up in the second half of the

year. The travel & tourism sector was led towards

normalcy after two worst-affected years in global

tourism. Coordinated and effective global efforts to

fight the pandemic with a widespread vaccine rollout

resulted in an increased appetite for global travel.

The year culminated with rapid growth as domestic

projects continued to outperform and our visa services

showed tremendous resilience. Today, we are back

on track and witnessing a phase of rapid growth.

We foresee a sustained growth momentum as we

added new clients and governments, initiated new

partnerships, and further strengthened our portfolio

of services. Our extensive network of 15,500+ centers

equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and a robust

strength of 20,000 employees & associates gives us

the confidence for secular growth from here on.

Gaining resilience

This year, BLS International Services has completed

17 years since its launch. The theme of my letter is

looking back at all these years, and also looking ahead

at the next decade ahead of us.

BLS is no stranger to challenges, as we’ve always

had our experienced leadership guide us through

challenging times. Being a niche industry with high

entry barriers, the visa processing industry offers key

advantages to players like BLS International Services.

Most services offered by governments across the

globe are still semi-automated with a low penetration

of cutting-edge technologies. And outsourcing to

a specialized partner can reduce delivery time and

increase efficiency, which is win-win proposition for

the government from cost and service perspective.

BLS offices and operations across the world are

certified by several industry best practices for

diverse functions such as Quality Management

System, Information Security Management System,

OUR EXTENSIVE NETWORK

OF 15,500+ CENTERS

EQUIPPED WITH STATE-

OF-THE-ART FACILITIES

AND A ROBUST STRENGTH

OF 20,000 EMPLOYEES &

ASSOCIATES GIVES US

THE CONFIDENCE FOR

SECULAR GROWTH FROM

HERE ON.
