Forward-looking statement / Cautionary statement

In this annual report, we have disclosed forward-looking

information to enable investors comprehend our prospects

and take informed investment decisions. This report and other

statements – written and oral – that we periodically produce/

publish, may contain forward-looking statements that set out

anticipated results based on the management’s plans and

assumptions. We have tried wherever possible to identify such

statements by using words such as ‘anticipates’, ‘estimates’,

‘expects’, ‘projects’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’ and words of

similar substance in connection with any discussion of future

performance. We cannot guarantee that these forward-looking

statements would be fully realised, although we believe we

have been prudent in our assumptions. The achievement of

results is subject to risks, uncertainties and even inaccurate

assumptions. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties

materialise, or if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate,

actual results could vary materially from those anticipated,

estimated or projected. We undertake no obligation to publicly

update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of

new information, future events or otherwise.:

Dear Stakeholders,

It is a pleasure to once again connect

with you and report the performance and

exceptional progress that HG Infra has

made through the year.

FY 2021-22 has been yet another

challenging year. Beginning with a more

severe wave of COVID-19 pandemic which

put immense socio-economic stress to

global supply chain disruptions, high

input prices and geopolitical tensions,

the year had it all. That said, the efforts

undertaken by the Government of India

in such times have been commendable.

The urgency displayed in vaccinating

the population, the infusion of funds to

sustain economy and policy measures

towards

manufacturing

self-reliance

helped reduce impact of subsequent

waves

and

considerably

improved

business sentiments. And surely so, the

Indian economy saw one of the fastest

growths in many years at 8.9% even as

extraordinary challenges persisted.

Delivering a stellar performance

Considering

the

ongoing

business

environment, I am immensely proud

of our team who maintained steadfast

commitment towards execution and

pursuing growth. We achieved major

milestones in several of our projects.

Provisional

completion

certificates

were received for three HAM projects

(Gurgaon-Sohna, Rewari Ateli Mandi and

Narnaul Bypass) and three EPC projects

(Banar-Bopalgarh, Jodhpur-Marwar and

Morshi-Chandur

Bazar).

Additionally,

we are eligible for bonus in Rewari

Ateli Mandi and Narnaul Bypass projects

for 170 days to 255 days respectively.

All other projects are progressing well

and we expect to complete them on

schedule.

Led by strong execution, we reported a

standalone revenue growth of 43% to

` 36,152 million in FY 2021-22, and yet

again becoming one of the fastest growing

road EPC players. 8% of the revenue came

from primary contracting, manifesting our

growing stance in the industry and the

ability to independently bid for orders.

This reinforces our belief in delivering

sustainable growth over the long run.

Our sharp focus on selective bidding

alongside operational efficiency and

digital measures helped mitigate costs

pressures, thereby ensuring a steady

margin profile. EBITDA grew 40% to

` 5,847 million with a margin of 16.2%

which is nearly flat at previous years’

level. PAT growth was stronger at 61% to

` 3,388 million, resulting in 90 basis points

improvement in PAT margins to 9.4%. This

was primarily on account of reduction in

interest costs.

The total order inflow at ` 43,279 million

for FY 2021-22 was slightly muted given

the rising competition in EPC and HAM

projects as well as our focus on selective

bidding to meet IRR criteria. Our total

order book now stands at ` 79,729 million

as on March 31, 2022 providing us strong

revenue visibility.

We closed the year on a strong footing

in terms of balance sheet strength.

As on March 31, 2022, our standalone

gross debt stood at ` 3,147 million

with a healthy debt:equity of 0.23x

which improved over last year’s level of

0.28x. Working capital days was low at

31 days as compared to 33 days in the

previous year.

streams:

•

(i)

Construction contracts

The Company recognises revenue from engineering,

procurement and construction contracts (‘EPC’)

over the period of time, as performance obligations

are satisfied over time due to continuous transfer of

completion method), based primarily on contract cost

incurred to date compared to total estimated contract

costs. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if

clause or there are amendments in contracts, the

Company estimates the amount of consideration

to which it will be entitled in exchange for work

of the business and allocates funds on the basis of a single reportable segment i.e. ‘EPC business’. The Company has no other reportable

segment. The Company does not have any reportable geographical segment as it caters to the needs of only the domestic market.

Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity

for the year ended March 31, 2022:

Managing Director of the

Holding Company has been identified as CODM and

he assesses the financial performance and position of

the Holding Company, and makes strategic decisions.

Refer Note 40 for segment information presented.

(e) Foreign currency translation

(i)

Functional and presentation currency

Items

included

in

the

consolidated

financial

statements of the Group are measured using the

currency of the primary economic environment in

which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).

The consolidated financial statements are presented

in Indian rupee, which is H. G. Infra Engineering

Limited functional and presentation currency.

(ii)

Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the

functional currency using the exchange rates at the

dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains

and losses resulting from the settlement of such

transactions and from the translation of monetary

assets and liabilities denominated in foreign

currencies at year end exchange rates are generally

recognized in profit or loss.

(f) Revenue recognition

The Group derives revenue principally from following

streams:

•

Construction contracts

•

Service concession arrangement

•

Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance

contracts)

(i)

Construction contracts

The Group recognises revenue from engineering,

procurement and construction contracts (‘EPC’)

over the period of time, as performance obligations

are satisfied over time due to continuous transfer of

control to the customer. EPC contracts are generally

accounted for as a single performance obligation as it

involves complex integration of goods and services.

The performance obligations are satisfied over time as

the work progresses. The Group recognises revenue

using input method (i.e percentage-of-completion

method), based primarily on contract cost incurred

to date compared to total estimated contract costs.

Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are

recognised in the period in which they are determined

as assessed at the contract level. If the consideration

in the contract includes price variation clause or there

are amendments in contracts, the Group estimates the

amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in

exchange for work performed.

Due to the nature of the work required to be

performed on many of the performance obligations,

the estimation of total revenue and cost of completion

is complex, subject to many variables and requires

significant judgment. Variability in the transaction

price arises primarily due to liquidated damages,

price variation clauses, changes in scope, incentives,

if any. The Group considers its experience with similar

transactions and expectations regarding the contract

in estimating the amount of variable consideration

to which it will be entitled and determining whether

the estimated variable consideration should be

constrained. The Group includes estimated amounts

in the transaction price to the extent it is probable

that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue

recognised will not occur when the uncertainty

associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

The estimates of variable consideration are based

largely on an assessment of anticipated performance

and all information (historical, current and forecasted)

that is reasonably available.

Progress billings are generally issued upon completion

of certain phases of the work as stipulated in the

contract. Billing terms of the over-time contracts

vary but are generally based on achieving specified

milestones. The difference between the timing of

revenue recognised and customer billings result in

changes to contract assets and contract liabilities.

Payment is generally due upon receipt of the invoice,

payable within 90 days or less. Contractual retention

amounts billed to customers are generally due upon

expiration of the contract period.

Notes

to the Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended March 31, 2022:

managing director who is identified as the chief operating decision maker of the Group, examines the

performance of the business and allocates funds on the basis of a single reportable segment i.e. ‘EPC business’. The Group has no other

reportable segment. The Group does not have any reportable geographical segment as it caters to the needs of only the domestic

market.

Accordingly, the segment revenue, segment results, total carrying amount of segment assets and segment liability, total cost incurred

to acquire segment assets and total amount of charge for depreciation during the period, is as reflected in the Financial Statements as

of and for the financial year ended March 31, 2022.

Non-current assets excluding financial assets, deferred tax assets amounts to `5,676.97 Millions (March 31, 2021 `5,033.77 Millions)

are located entirely in India.

Information relating to major customers

Revenue of approximately `36,126.98 Millions (for the year ended March 31, 2021 `21,533.38 Millions) was derived from external

customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of the total revenue.
