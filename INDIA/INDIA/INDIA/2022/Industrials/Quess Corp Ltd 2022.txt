Dear Shareholders,

March 11th, 2020 – that was the date

the World Health Organization (WHO)

declared the novel coronavirus as a

global pandemic. It is now 29 months

and counting!

Some of the changes that it has caused

to the world are irreversible, particularly

related to employment. While the

use of technology in everyday life has

gone up significantly, so has the role

of Government to provide equitable

healthcare facilities to all.

Changes of this nature also represent

opportunities for enterprises - the

renewed focus on technology and the

I am confident that

our transformation

drivers will propel

us to become a world

class organization

which is amongst

the top 3 players in

every business line

and among the top

25 global staffing

companies, with

women constituting

at least 50% of the

workforce.

“

“

digitization of business operations that

lead to a better customer experience.

Through this, Quess has pivoted to

a simpler structure with an ability to

nimbly respond to these opportunities.

At the beginning of the pandemic,

we had 318k associates and we are

currently at 437k (FY22), a growth

of ~40%. Our cash generation has

almost doubled from ~` 500 mn per

quarter (prior to the pandemic) to

~`1,070 mn per quarter, along with

an improving ROE. A brief snapshot of

our key Financial & Operational metrics,

pre-Covid (FY19) and now (FY22), are

12 QUESS CORP LIMITED:

Dear Stakeholders,

Before I walk you through the progress

made by your company during the year,

I would like to thank each and every

one of you for the support that I have

received since becoming ED and CEO.

I am even more excited today about the

opportunity and growth potential of our

company, than in 2007 when we founded

Quess and I look forward to achieving all

the goals that we have set for ourselves.

The year had its up and downs, the

beginning of the year saw impact of the

delta wave followed by a quick recovery.

Even though the second wave stalled

expansion / recovery plans across

sectors, fewer rationalisations were

observed for existing manpower. As a

result, business saw a fast turnaround

post Q1 and we ended the year with the

highest ever revenue and profit before

taxes on an annual basis. We have

become more agile, efficient and focused;

and for this we must thank each of the

~437,000 Quessians, who have worked

tirelessly to get us to this stage.

Digital transformation and tech adoption

has been the driving theme for the year

and it shows in our performance as

well. Not only the Global Technology

Solutions vertical remained our most

profitable vertical, but 2 of our GTS

service lines - Multi Country Payroll

(MCP) Solutions and Insurance Platform

IT Services debuted amongst global

contenders on the Everest Group PEAK

Matrix. Quess was also named amongst

the Top 10 HR Tech solution providers in

India by the Enterprise World magazine.

We continue to invest in and strengthen

our digital platforms with single minded

zeal. Our efforts have been validated by

external investment in Monster – Our

White Collar Jobs Platform and over 4

million downloads of Qjobs- Our Blue

Collar Jobs Platform.

In the recent investors meet, we re-

iterated our purpose to build a leading

institution that drives productivity for our

clients by outsourcing and optimizing

their key business processes, and to

be the preferred firm for employees,

customers and investors alike. We made

significant progress on all 3 fronts and

have laid out the vision for the future.

Starting with our customers, whom we

can’t thank enough for standing by us

during tough times and for trusting us

MESSAGE FROM

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR & GROUP CEO

“We have direct and positive impact on

India’s vast labour force – last year we hired

~120,000 FTE, with our activities extending

right from training and skilling, to providing

secure jobs, to making talent ready for

employment

“

16 QUESS CORP LIMITED:

Dear Shareholders,

Life will never be the same for most

of the world’s population. The world

in general and Quess in particular,

has witnessed the impact of multiple

waves of the Covid-19 pandemic on our

company and the world’s economy very

closely. As they say adversity pushes you

to find new paths, we took the challenge

thrown by the pandemic head on and

successfully adapted to new working

norms.

Thanks to our diversified portfolio of

offerings, we were able to respond

swiftly to the volatile impact of the

pandemic with a continued focus on

customer acquisition, service quality,

cost optimization and cash generation.

Having said that, it is also true that

some of our business like facilities

management, Qdigi, Training and Skills

Development, and Food Services did

not witness the recovery like the other

businesses due to a continued work-

from-home scenario. Notwithstanding

the impact of Covid-19 on the global

economy and the labour market, most

of our businesses quickly began to

resurge, reaching pre-COVID levels of

performance,

Financial Performance

This year saw a steady growth during

the year especially in our two critical

business – Staffing and CLM, backed by

strong execution in sales, delivery and

operations. Full Year revenues from

operations grew 26% to ` 136.92 billion

from ` 108.37 billion in FY’21.

Our reported EBITDA for FY’22 grew

36% in the same period to ` 6.23 billion

vs. ` 4.58 billion in FY’21. This year we

took an extraordinary Expected Credit

Loss provision in Q2 to the tune of ` 0.45

billion. Adjusted for that, our EBITDA

would stand at ` 6.68 billion for FY’22.

Our reported EBITDA margins across

operations was 4.55% for the year, an

improvement of 32 bps from 4.23%

reported in FY21. Our normalized

EBITDA margin for the same period was

4.88% for FY’22 vs. 5.33% for FY’21, a

drop of 45 bps mainly due to service mix

changes.

The EBITDA growth has been slower

than revenue growth mainly due to

the faster growth in WFM platform led
