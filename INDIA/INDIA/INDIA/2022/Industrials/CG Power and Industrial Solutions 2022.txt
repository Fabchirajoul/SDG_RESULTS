Bouncing Back – Stronger,

Bigger & Hungrier: Dear Shareholders,

I am extremely happy to share with you

that we have successfully turned around

CG Power and Industrial Solutions (CG)

in the first full year of operations. About

18 months ago, when we welcomed

CG as a subsidiary of Tube Investments

of India (TI), in the Murugappa Group,

we decided to focus on bringing back

the glory of CG. Today, I am filled with

excitement and confidence as I see

the successful building blocks back

together. My heartfelt thanks to all

our stakeholders – vendors, partners,

customers,

our

people,

bankers,

management team and well-wishers,

who have believed in us and reinstated

their confidence in us.

The world order is changing, and we

are aligning to the needs and demands

of it. The geo-political situation arising

on account of the COVID-19 pandemic

and the Russia-Ukraine war, provides

us with an opportunity to not only make

India self-reliant, but also become a

manufacturing hub for supplies to other

countries. From the railway offerings

to the power system, CG continues to

innovate and become a strategic partner

for customers in India and globally.

As a subsidiary of TI and part of the

Murugappa Group, your Company has

been led by the Group’s strong ethics

and governance. This has enabled us to

rise like a phoenix from the ashes and

gather speed.

FY 2022 has been a defining year for

us. We have managed to resolve many

legacy issues impacting our Company,

and

have

achieved

a

complete

operational and financial turnaround

this year. Our teams have worked round

the clock to regain confidence of our

vendors,

customers

and

investors.

All our businesses have performed to

their potential with highest ever sales

reported

by

Motor,

Railways,

and

Transformer Divisions. On a standalone

basis, the total sales for the year were at

`5,159 crore, recording a growth of

104% YoY, and Profit Before Tax (before

exceptional items) for the year stood at

`502 crore as against loss of `91 crore

in the previous year. Free cash flow

generated for the year was at `392 crore.

CG is bouncing back – stronger, bigger

and hungrier. Our inherent strengths

are navigating our paths as we look

at tapping newer opportunities and

avenues in the years to come.

I would like to keep my letter short and

let the results speak for themselves.

Hope you enjoy reading our Annual

Report 2021-22. The team has put in

efforts to bring you well-structured and

detailed information of your Company’s

businesses and operations. The theme,

this year, is Gaining Momentum -

highlights our commitment, values, and

faith in our people and the market.

I would like to once again thank each one

of you for trusting us and our purpose.

We will continue to build across the

blocks and become stronger than ever

before.

Wishing all good health and prosperity!

Vellayan Subbiah

Dear Shareholders,

The Financial year 2021-22 is the first full

year of operations of your Company after

the new Promoter, Tube Investments

of India took over the Company in

November 2020. I am happy to inform

to you that the Company made all round

progress and staged a big come back

during the year under report. Let me

share some details.

Operational performance

Your Company has two businesses –

Industrial and Power Systems. Within

a month of taking over the Company,

the new management initiated several

steps to revive the operations of the

businesses. All the vendors’ payments

were settled and need based working

capital funds were provided without

any interruption. Number of meetings

with vendors and customers were

held to give the confidence that your

Company would deliver on all its future

commitments. These enablers coupled

with a good demand environment

helped

the

businesses

improve

their performance substantially. The

Industrial Systems segment, consisting

of the Motor business and Railway

business clocked a turnover of `3,644

crore, registering a growth of 103% over

last year. The Power systems segment,

which gets its orders mostly against

Your Company today is strongly

positioned, both operationally

and ﬁnancially, to grow and

seize the potential opportunities.

The medium to long-term

opportunities and the outlook

remains strong.

holding subsidiaries. For the year ended

31 March, 2022, your Company recorded

a turnover of `5,561 crore, a growth of

88% over last year and reported a PAT

(before exceptional items) of `405 crore, a

growth of 254% over the last year.

Resolution of Legacy issues

The year also witnessed substantial

resolution of legacy issues. Some of the

major issues resolved were:

a. Recasting of accounts

Your Company was directed by the

Hon’ble NCLT to recast and reaudit

its Annual accounts (including that of

subsidiaries) for the past five years

from FY 2014-15 to FY 2018-19 and

in aggregate 148 Accounts had to be

reopened, recast and reaudited by

Independent chartered accountants

appointed

by

the

Ministry

of

Corporate

Affairs

(“MCA”).

The

teams worked round the clock and

completed the exercise during the

year. The audited recast financial

statements, were submitted by the

MCA to Hon’ble NCLT and the same

were taken on record by the Hon’ble

NCLT vide its order dated 26 October

2021 marking the completion of this

mammoth exercise. The auditors

issued an unmodified Audit opinion

on the recast Accounts. Under the

provisions of the Companies Act

2013, the Accounts recast shall be

final. To give effect to the recasting,

your Company undertook voluntary

revision of accounts for FY 2019-20

and FY 2020-21.

b. Settlement of Guarantee

obligations of the Company

During the year, your Company

settled its obligations aggregating

to `1,406 crore, arising out of

the guarantees extended by your

Company, to secure the loans given

to its subsidiaries.

c. Sale of property at Kanjurmarg

The previous management had

entered into an agreement in the

year 2015 to sell the property at

Kanjurmarg but the sale could not

be completed and some disputes

arose between the parties. This was

pursued, the dispute settled, the sale

completed in December 2021 and

your Company realised proceeds of

`402 crore.

Utilising the sale proceeds and the

operational free cash flows, your

Company could prepay a debt of

`650 crore during the financial year.

The aggregate Debt outstanding

as

on

31

March,

2022

was

`302 crore as against `945 crore as

on 31 March, 2021.

The

sustained

improvement

in

operational and financial performance

and the deleveraging led to an

improvement in your Company’s

financials. The Company’s financial

ratings improved to AA-/ Stable

(Long term) and to A1+/ Stable for the

short-term credit.

Outlook

All the businesses of your Company

have multiple opportunities for growth.

The Industrial Business, given the

massive investments in the infra sector

and the starting of the Capex cycle, is

expected to have a sustained organic

growth. Besides, the EV segment is

another big opportunity to cater to for

the next several years.

In the Railways Business, the Ministry

of Railways have unveiled the roadmap

for the next decade with significant

outlay. The introduction of Vande

Bharat trains, setting up dedicated

freight corridors, and measures to

improve passenger safety, etc., are all

new business opportunities for your

Company.

Significant investments are committed

in the energy sector. Development

of solar parks and ultra mega solar

power projects with proposals to set

up 25 solar parks targeting over 20,000

MW of solar power over 5 years have

been announced. These will result

in

increased

requirement

of

your

Company’s products under the Power

Systems business.

Your

Company

today

is

strongly

positioned,

both

operationally

and

financially, to grow and seize these

potential opportunities. The medium

to long-term opportunities and the

outlook remains strong. However, in the

immediate year, your Company needs to

face the consequences of the Russia-

Ukraine war. The continued disruption

in supply chain, high inflation leading

to high input costs and margin pressure

are challenges to reckon with.

As

we

take

the

steps

towards

cementing our momentum, I express

my sincere thanks to all our employees

for their commitment and resolve,

Directors for their guidance and to our

Lenders, Dealers, Customers and the

our shareholders for their continued

support.

NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

CORPORATE INFORMATION

CG Power and Industrial Solutions Limited (the ‘Company’ or ‘Parent’) with CIN No: L99999MH1937PLC002641 is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in

India whose shares are publicly traded. The registered ofﬁce is located at 6th Floor, CG house, Dr. Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai – 400 030, India. The Company

has changed its name from Crompton Greaves Limited to CG Power and Industrial Solutions Limited w.e.f. 27 February, 2017.

The Company and its subsidiaries (collectively the ‘Group’) is a global enterprise providing end-to-end solutions to utilities, industries and consumers for the

management and application of efﬁcient and sustainable electrical energy. It offers products, services and solutions in two main business segments, viz. Power

Systems and Industrial Systems for the year ended 31 March, 2022.

The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March, 2022 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on

02 May, 2022.

2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.1

Basis of preparation:

The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notiﬁed under Section 133 of the

Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended from time to time and presentation requirements of Division

II of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets

and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:

•

Derivative ﬁnancial instruments,

•

Certain ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities measured at fair value.

The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (‘`’) and all values are rounded to the nearest crores, except when otherwise indicated.

2.2

Basis of consolidation:

The Group consolidates all entities which are controlled by it. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements comprise the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its

subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the

ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those

which signiﬁcantly affect the entity’s returns. The entities are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.

The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions including unrealised

gain/loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies

in use at the Group. Proﬁt or loss on each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the

non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interest having a deﬁcit balance.

If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity

while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in consolidated statement of proﬁt and loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.

Changes in the Group’s holding that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s holding and the

non-controlling interests are adjusted to reﬂect the changes in their relative holding. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are

adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to equity holders of the parent.

Joint Ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control. Associates are entities over which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence but not control. Investments

in Joint Ventures and Associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is

increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the proﬁt or loss of the investee after the acquisition date. The Group’s investment in Joint Ventures and

Associates includes goodwill identiﬁed on acquisition.

2.3

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost comprises the

purchase price, net of trade discounts and rebates, directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use and capitalised

borrowing costs. When significant parts of the plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based

on their specific useful lives.:

Managing Director of the Company for a period of 2 years effective from

26 November 2020, along with other terms and conditions of appointment, including payment of remuneration. The terms of

remuneration of Mr. Natarajan Srinivasan as approved by the Members inter alia included incentives and high performance bonus,

each of which, at 100%, would be 35% of his Annual Pay.

The Members are requested to note that ever since the change in Management of the Company in November 2020 pursuant

to acquisition of controlling stake by Tube Investments of India Limited, there has been a swift turnaround in the operational

and financial performance of the Company, under the strong and able leadership of Mr. Natarajan Srinivasan. He has played

significant role in resolving many of the legacy issues, including (a) completion of restatement/voluntary revision of accounts in

a record time, (b) resolving long pending issues relating to sale of Kanjurmarg property which helped the Company to reduce its

debts, (c) repayment of debt relating to the CG House property which enabled avoidance of its sale and the CG House property

continues to remain with the Company; and (d) guiding the Company on regulatory matters including investigations by SFIO,

Enforcement Directorate and CBI, which all helped the Company in posting the excellent performance.

As can be seen, all the businesses of the Company have performed to their potential with highest-ever sales reported by Motors

and Railways segment. On a standalone basis, the total sales of the Company for the year were higher at ` 5,159 crores, recording

a growth of 104% YoY, and Profit Before Tax (before exceptional items) for the year stood at ` 502 crores as against loss of

` 91 crore in the previous year. Free cash flow generated for the year was ` 392 crores. Market capitalization of the Company

which was ` 4,982 crores in November 2020 rose to ` 27,316 Crores as on 31 March 2022.

Considering the significant performance of the Company, including achievement in terms of Profit Before Tax, based on

recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board approved the payment of incentive of ` 1.53 crore

and high performance bonus of ` 1.53 crore to Mr. Natarajan Srinivasan, as per the terms of remuneration already approved by

the shareholders. Thus, the total remuneration of Mr.Natarajan Srinivasan for the year 2021-22, including the salary, incentive and

high performance bonus, aggregates to ` 6.25 crores.

Further, considering the significant contribution of Mr. Srinivasan in the complete turnaround in operational and financial

performance of the Company and resolving of many of the legacy issues of the Company, the Nomination and Remuneration

Committee has recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, subject to further approval by the Members, the

payment of special incentive of ` 5 crores to Mr. Natarajan Srinivasan for the financial year 2021-22. Since this special incentive

is in addition to the incentive and high performance bonus earlier approved by the Members of the Company, it requires approval

of the Members.:

Managing Director under the Act is Rs. 33.26 crore, being 5% of the profit for the year as computed under the provisions of

Section 197 and 198 of the Act.

Except for Mr. Natarajan Srinivasan, none of the other Directors and Key Managerial Personnel of the Company or their relatives

are, in any way, financially or otherwise, concerned or interested in the said Ordinary Resolution set out at Item No. 5, except to

the extent of their shareholding in the Company, if any.

The Board recommends the Ordinary Resolution at Item No. 5 for approval of the Members.
