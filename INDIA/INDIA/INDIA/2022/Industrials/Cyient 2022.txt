Dear Shareholders,

Thirty is considered a significant decade in the

life of a human – it brings both freedom and

responsibility to the person. I believe this is the

case for a company too.

Cyient (formerly, Infotech) started as a

digitization company with a modest personal

investment in 1991. At the turn of the century,

we pioneered outsourcing engineering services

from India and successfully created the brand

“Engineered in India.” Today, as a 31-year-old

global technology solutions company with over

a billion dollars market cap, Cyient stands tall

on its long list of achievements, bringing it both

freedom and immense responsibility.

Historically, outsourcing enterprises became

successful largely because they learned

how to scale a process and build domain

expertise. So did Cyient. But such practices are

outmoded today because of the acceleration:

Dear Shareholders,

As I look back at the year and my role

at Cyient, I find myself reminiscing

about how the company has grown

in earnest and the consistent path it

has taken. Cyient as an organization

has demonstrated its ability to adapt

and change. Today, it is a leading

technology solutions company with

over 16,000 associates serving 240

customers in 18 countries. Over the

years, good governance and best

practices built into the organization’s

functioning under the astute

leadership of Dr. BVR Mohan Reddy

have ensured its success and growth.

Values FIRST, enunciated by Dr.

Reddy, stand for Fairness, Integrity,

Respect, Sincerity, and Transparency.

These values are embodied in the

people of Cyient, whose unwavering

focus on these has ensured Cyient’s

consistent growth.:

Dear Shareholders,

The last two years have tested our strength and

resilience as an organization. I am proud of how we

navigated through the COVID-19 pandemic and

several related socio-economic factors that have

disrupted the fundamentals of our business. While

the last 24 months have been challenging, I feel more

optimistic about our outlook than ever before. This

optimism stems from all Cyient associates, who

have demonstrated unwavering confidence in the

organization and a steadfast commitment to ensuring

our customers can successfully maneuver through

their transformation journeys, whether organizational,

technological, or digital.

At the offset of this note, I want to extend my heartfelt

gratitude and appreciation to our associates for

keeping the spirit of Cyient eternally strong.

Our ability to successfully navigate the challenges we

faced has only strengthened our confidence in the

strategy we designed based on strong operational

excellence, expanding our offerings to new areas like

consulting, and a keen eye on the future technology

trends that will position us uniquely for growth in the

future. Our focus on operational excellence resulted

in improved efficiency, providing us with a strong

financial position. In parallel, we continued to invest in

new service offerings and building solutions aligned

to the technology trends impacting our customers’

businesses.

FY 22 Business Performance

In FY22, we have seen tremendous growth

opportunities that have helped us strengthen our

position as a strategic partner with several of our

customers. We delivered robust performance for the

year in line with our expectations. We recorded revenue:

Managing Director & CEO

Over the years, Cyient’s strengths have been rooted

in mechanical design, data services, and build to print

(B2P) manufacturing. These areas have provided us

the foundation for new, solutions-led growth. As we

move forward, we will continue to strengthen and

sustain these core services. To accelerate our S3

execution, we will focus on 5 key pillars of growth -

Digital, Embedded, Geospatial, VLSI, and Network

capabilities to create a strong portfolio of offerings

for our markets and customers. The five pillars

create growth opportunities across all our verticals,

including aerospace, rail, automotive, mining, utilities,

communications, healthcare, semiconductor and

geospatial. The Five pillars represent horizontal

capabilities that enable us to pursue “multi-threaded”

opportunities across our customer base. While we

continue to strengthen our capabilities internally, we

are also pragmatically looking at opportunities to

acquire organizations that will help accelerate

our strategy and strengthen our positioning.

In FY 22, we acquired WorkForce Delta

(WFD), a highly specialized technology

company providing solutions for workforce

management. Technology enablement

of complex workforces in industries like

utilities, communication, and mining is a

key pillar of our digital focus. Much of the

work to acquire Grit Consulting, was done

in FY 22. Singapore-based firm Grit

Consulting has deep-rooted expertise

in consulting for asset-intensive

industries like mining and energy. This acquisition

will enable Cyient customers across sectors to draw

value from the Grit’s deep knowledge and Cyient’s

technology solutions capabilities.

I look forward to providing you with more details and

the first-year performance in the next year’s update.:

Managing Director & CEO

Industry Recognitions and Accolades

We continue to focus on building a strong

differentiation, and our efforts have been recognized

by various industry bodies. At the NASSCOM

Engineering and Innovation Excellence Awards 2021,

Cyient won four awards: The Social Impact Solution of

the Year, two awards for Engineered in India Product of

the Year, and Service Delivery Excellence. ISG named

Cyient as a Rising Star in IoT - Connected Mobility

Consulting and Services in their Services and Solutions

Quadrant Report 2021 and a Digital Engineering

– Industrial leader in their Study on Manufacturing

Industry Services 2021. We also won the Annual

HYSEA-STPI Top Exporter from Telangana Award

2021. Cyient was positioned as a Major Contender in

5G Engineering Services in the Everest Group’s PEAK

Matrix Assessment 2021 and was also recognized

as an Expansive-Established player in ER&D and IoT

Services in the 2021 Zinnov Zones ratings. The Everest

Group also recognized Cyient as a Major Contender in

Digital Product Engineering Service Providers. In the

12th Aegis Graham Bell Award, Cyient was named the

winner for Innovation in IoT.

These recognitions are a testament to the

extraordinary work of our teams and the vision to

deliver industry-leading technology solutions. They

also validate our strategic initiatives and the pragmatic

investments in building a differentiated business.

Our Outlook and the Future

I am confident that FY 23 represents a pivotal year

in the organization’s transformation. Our focus on

strengthening our service delivery capabilities, our

investments in 5-pillars of growth, our industry-leading

solutions portfolio along with a well-thought-through

and executed acquisition strategy will enable us to

start delivering industry-leading earnings growth.

Our focus is on industry verticals that have shown

tremendous resilience and an appetite for technology

transformation. With our consulting expertise,

domain knowledge, and technology capabilities, we

are uniquely positioned to accelerate our customers’

transformation and deliver on our brand promise of

applying technology imaginatively to solve problems

that matter.

Thank you for your extraordinary support in FY 22, and

I look forward to the same in FY 23 as we embark on an

accelerated growth journey.:

Dear Shareholders,

Businesses are reflecting on the changes they

have made within the organization to keep

up with the new world. In the last two years,

enterprises have accelerated their digital

transformation journey, with COVID-19 playing

the catalyst. Regardless of the pandemic,

Moore’s law continues to stand the test of

time. Computing power continues to increase

exponentially, and data transmission volumes

are doubling every nine months.

As we set sail toward our true north across the

technology frontier, we keep in mind that it is

not a destination- it is the result of evolution.

Cyient is steadily transforming itself into a

‘Technology Solutions Organization’ at the

confluence of Engineering Megatrends and

Technology disruptions. I see us pitted among

the driving forces of the ‘Transformation Era

2.0’, leading technology-led transformation,

such as helping physical products evolve into

‘intelligent connected products,’ building Next

Gen Connectivity infrastructure, Shaping

Autonomous Systems, Improving Sustainable

Energy Sources, and Innovating through Meta

Platforms

As I continue to witness aggressive changes

and the proliferation of newer technologies, I

am excited by the wide range of opportunities

that present themselves for the future of

Cyient. In our 30 years of experience, we have

built products through our core competence

in electronic systems design, integration, and

manufacturing services. Today, I am positive

that orchestrating a wide range of evolving

technology disruptions will deliver immense

value to our customers, creating an ecosystem

steered by five megatrends.:

Dear Shareholders,

Inclusivity is more than just an

initiative. It is a mindset that

celebrates commonalities and

differences. At Cyient, we are

focused on creating an inclusive

culture that allows each associate

to be their best self at work. We

consider Inclusion and Diversity

a business imperative that is

embedded into our values and

processes. In today’s age, where

organizations are navigating through

a myriad of challenges, building an

organization that champions its

people is paramount to our growth of

success.

Over the last five years, Cyient has

launched several initiatives that

foster our commitment to inclusion

and diversity. The openness and

warmth with which these initiatives

were welcomed give me new hope

that we are steering this ship in

the right direction. We have found

alignment to our vision, creating

a collaborative workplace that

supports diverse thinking and

attracts and inspires talented people

to reach their potential. We launched

a partnership with the Thurgood

16. BOARD EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT:

The company believes that formal evaluation of the

is a potentially effective way to respond to the demand

for greater board accountability and effectiveness. For

performance and effectiveness. In addition to greater board

accountability, evaluation of board members helps in:

●

More effective board processes

●

Better collaboration and communication

●

Greater clarity with regard to members’ roles and

responsibilities and

●

Improved Chairman -: Managing Director – Board

relations;

By focusing on the board as a team and on its overall

performance, the company ensures that communication

and overall level of participation and engagement also

improves.

In order to facilitate the same, the board undertook

a formal board assessment and evaluation process

during 2021-22. The board evaluation was performed

after seeking inputs from all the directors and included

criteria such as the board composition and structure,

effectiveness of board processes, information and

functioning as provided by the Guidance Note on Board

Evaluation issued by the Securities and Exchange Board

of India on January 05, 2017.

The Leadership, Nomination & Remuneration Committee

has overall stewardship for the process. The evaluation

process covers the following aspects:

●

Peer and self-evaluation of Directors;

●

Evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of

the board;

●

Global Business

Understanding of global business dynamics, across various geographical markets,

business units and regulatory jurisdictions.

Strategy and Planning

Appreciation of long-term trends, strategic choices and experience in guiding and

leading management teams to make decisions in uncertain environments.

Governance

Experience in developing governance practices, serving the best interests of all

stakeholders, maintaining board and management accountability, building long-term

effective stakeholder engagements and driving Values-FIRST.

The eligibility of a person to be appointed as a director of the company depends on whether the person possesses the

requisite skill sets identified by the Board as above; and whether the person is a proven leader in running a business that

is relevant to the company’s business or is a proven academician in the field relevant to the company’s business. Being

an Engineering services provider, the company’s business runs across different business units, geographical markets

and is global in nature. The directors so appointed are drawn from diverse backgrounds and possess special skills with

regard to the industries / fields from where they come.:

Managing Director of the

Company shall serve as an independent director

in not more than two other listed entities.

3.

The Directors must ensure that their existing

and planned future commitments do not

materially interfere with their quality of service

on

the

Company’s

Board/

Committees/

Management. Service on Boards/ Committees

of other organizations shall be consistent with

the Company’s Code of Conduct.

4.

Executive Directors are allowed to serve on

IT and engineering service business or the key

economic or academic institutions of the nation,

or whose prime objective is to benefit society.

5.

interest. There are no other limitations except

Details of the familiarization programme for Non-

Executive Directors and their: letter of appointment

are published on the website of the company in the

governance/

17. Board Evaluation and Assessment

The Board of Directors has carried out an annual

evaluation of its own performance, board committees

and individual directors pursuant to the provisions of

the Act and SEBI Listing Regulations.

Board evaluation processes, including in relation to

the chairman, individual directors and committees,

constitute a powerful and valuable feedback

mechanism

to

improve

board

effectiveness,

maximise

strengths

and

highlight

areas

for

further development. In addition to greater board

accountability, evaluation of board members helps in:

●

More effective board processes

●

Better collaboration and communication

●

Greater clarity with regard to members’ roles

and responsibilities and

●

Improved

Managing Director & CEO

The CEO is vested with operational responsibility

for delivering the company’s strategy. The CEO’s

relationship with the chair is the key dynamic that

underpins the effectiveness of the board.:

letter of appointment issued to the non-

executive directors states the time the non-

executive director will be required to spend on the

company’s business, and indicates the possibility of

additional time commitment when the company is

undergoing a period of particularly increased activity,

such as in the case of an acquisition or takeover.

As part of the process of learning more about the

business and of becoming effective boardroom

contributors in the company, non-executive directors

- supported by the chair and CEO - build recognition

among executive directors of their contribution

in order to promote mutual respect. This, in turn,

allows them to support executive directors in their

management of the business while monitoring their

conduct.

Non-executive directors maintain confidence in

the governance of the company by upholding high

standards of integrity and probity, and supporting

the chair and executive directors in the embedding of

the appropriate culture, values and behaviours in the

boardroom and beyond.

Because of the importance of the process of decision

making to the work of the board, non-executive

directors insist on accurate, clear and comprehensive

information being provided sufficiently in advance to

enable thorough consideration of the issues prior

to, and informed debate and challenge at, board

meetings.

At Cyient, non-executive directors supplement

their knowledge of the business with the views of

shareholders and other stakeholders - either directly

or as conveyed to them by the chair, CEO or in special

circumstances, the lead independent director. Such

opinions and judgments are valuable in providing

different perspectives of the company’s progress

and performance.

22. Role of Independent directors

The independent directors bring an element of

objectivity to the board processes; they bring in an

objective view in the board deliberations. They provide

a valuable outside perspective to the deliberations

of the board and contribute significantly to the

decision-making process. Independent directors play

a pivotal role in maintaining a transparent working

environment in the company.

23. Declaration by Independent Directors

All the Independent Directors have confirmed that

they meet the criteria as mentioned under Regulation

16(1)(b) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and

Disclosure Requirements), 2015 read with Section

149(6) of the Act.

During the financial year 2021-22, information as

mentioned in Schedule II Part A of the SEBI (Listing

Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), 2015, has

been placed before the Board for its consideration.

The terms and conditions of appointment of the

Independent Directors are disclosed on the website

of

the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance

with Ind AS 108 notified under the Companies (Indian

Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015.

xix. Financial instruments

(A) Initial recognition:

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised

when a Company becomes a party to the contractual

provisions of the instruments. Financial assets and

financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value and

subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value

through other comprehensive income and fair value

through profit or loss. Transaction costs that are directly

attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets

and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and

financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are

added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial

assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial

recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to

the acquisition of financial assets or liabilities at fair value

through profit or loss are recognised immediately in

statement of profit and loss.

(B) Subsequent measurement

a. Non-derivative financial instruments

i)

Financial assets carried at amortised cost: A

financial asset is subsequently measured at

amortised cost if it is held within a business

model whose objective is to hold the asset in

order to collect contractual cash flows and the

contractual terms of the financial asset give

rise on specified dates to cash flows that are

solely payments of principal and interest on the

principal amount outstanding.

ii)

Financial assets at fair value through other

comprehensive income: A financial asset is

subsequently measured at fair value through

other comprehensive income if it is held within

a business model whose objective is achieved

by both collecting contractual cash flows and

selling financial assets and the contractual

terms of the financial asset give rise on specified

dates to cash flows that are solely payments of

principal and interest on the principal amount

outstanding. The Company may also make an

irrevocable election for its investments which

are classified as equity instruments to present

the subsequent changes in fair value in other

comprehensive income based on its business

model.

iii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or

loss: Financial assets which are not classified in

any of the above categories are subsequently

fair valued through profit or loss.:

Voluntarily obtained a rating of CGR 2+ from ICRA for corporate governance practices:

letter, duly signed by the first holder, stating the new address and folio numbers of the shares

you own to our R & T agents. An acknowledgement will be sent to your new address confirming the up-dation of the change in

our records.

In the case of dematerialized holdings, please write to your Depository Participant (DP) intimating them of the change and ask for

a confirmation that their records reflect the new address.

If dividend cheque is lost/was never received/has expired, how to get a fresh cheque re-issued?

Please write to our R&T Agent, with details of folio numbers (in the case of physical holdings) or the DP ID and Client ID in the case

of dematerialized holdings. After verification, they will issue a fresh instrument.

To avoid this problem in the future, you can use the ECS facility in which the dividend amount is automatically credited to the bank

account of your choice. To avail of this facility, give your request to our R&T agent in writing.

Also, you might consider dematerializing your holdings through a Depository Participant. This would not only eliminate the issues

of storage and risk of loss of paper certificates but also ensure automatic crediting of dividends to your bank account.

How does a shareholder re-claim the shares and/or unclaimed dividend transferred to IEPF?

Such shareholders may make an application to the IEPF Authority in Form No. IEPF-5 available on www.iepf.gov.in online and send

a physical copy of the same duly signed to the R&T Agent along with requisite documents enumerated in the Form No. IEPF-5.

No claims shall lie against the company in respect of the dividend/shares so transferred to the IEPF.:
