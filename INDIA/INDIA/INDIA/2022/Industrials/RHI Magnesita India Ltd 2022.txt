Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to report that RHI Magnesita

India has successfully navigated another

challenging year in 2021 whilst continuing

to build business efficiencies to better serve

our stakeholders and to grow our leadership

position in the refractory industry.

Merger and emergence of

the market leader

During the year, we successfully completed

the merger of the three legal entities in

India to emerge as one strong company

that is the refractory market leader in

India. The financial results of the company

stand testimony to the benefits that the

merger has delivered. The company is well

positioned now to provide customers with

one-stop solution for all their refractory

product, systems and service needs.

The COVID-19 pandemic continued to run

havoc during the initial part of the year. The

company took adequate safety measures

to ensure health & safety of its employees

as well as communities around it. Special

vaccination camps were organized at the

manufacturing locations for the employees

and communities. The COVID-19 preventive

measures were strictly deployed in all

the operational locations of the company

through the year.

We are in the business of manufacturing

and supply of refractory products, systems

and solutions, predominantly for the steel

industry in India and globally. Hence, it

is impacted by the dynamics of the steel

industry in India and worldwide. As the

country emerged out of the shadows of the

COVID-19 pandemic, there was upswing in

demand for the steel makers second quarter

onwards post COVID-19, primarily led by

surge in demand in the export markets and

revival of domestic infrastructure sector,

while it continued to face the pressure

of higher input costs. India’s crude steel

production grew 18% y-o-y to 120.10 mn

ton during the year. The newly integrated

company was able to react quickly and

effectively to the fast-recovering market.

However, we were highly challenged by a

volatile global economic environment post

COVID-19. The steep rise in raw material

prices that took off in the previous financial

Managing Director has been identified

segment information presented.

2.19 Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised

products or services to customers either over time or at a point

of time at an amount that reflects the consideration the Group

expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or

services. Control is defined as the ability to direct the use of and

obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from an asset.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is

the expected consideration to be received, to the extent that

it is highly probable that there will not be a significant reversal

of revenue in future periods. If the consideration in a contract

includes a variable amount, at the inception of the contract, the

Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be

entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services to the

customer.

At the inception of the contract, the Group identifies the goods

or services promised in the contract and assesses which of

the promised goods or services shall be identified as separate

performance obligations. Promised goods or services give rise

to separate performance obligations if they are capable of being

distinct.

Revenue from the delivery of products is recognised at the

point in time when control over the products is passed to

the customers, which is determined based on the individual

Incoterms agreed in the customer contract.

Revenue from contracts for total refractory management

services,is recognized over time on the basis using the output-

oriented method (e.g. quantity of steel produced by the

customer).

Revenue from providing services is recognised in the accounting

period in which the services as rendered.

The Group recognises contract liabilities for consideration

received in respect of unsatisfied performance obligations

and reports these amounts as other liabilities. Similarly, if the

Group satisfies a performance obligation before it receives the

consideration, the Group recognises either a contract asset or

a receivable, depending on whether something other than the

passage of time is required before the consideration is due.

2.20 Government grants

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value

where there is reasonable certainty that the grant will be

received and the Group will comply with required conditions.

Export incentive under Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export

products (RODTEP), Merchandise Exports from India Scheme

(MEIS) and duty drawback are accrued when no significant

uncertainties as to the amount of consideration that would be

derived and as to its ultimate collection exist.:
