ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

EXPANDING HORIZONS:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to write to you after yet another

eventful year of progress. We are proud to have continued our

industry-leading growth momentum through a year that was

relentless with the unprecedented inflationary pressures, ongoing

war and supply chain constraints. Also, intermittent COVID-19

virus outbreaks continued its impact across the globe with various

disruptions to businesses, and caused social and economic

upheaval and lockdowns in some parts of the world.

To this effect, we mobilised a host of

support services for our employees

and their families, which include

critical medical equipment supplies,

doctor consultations and financial

assistance. We also stepped up our

partnerships with various NGOs,

volunteering our time and financial

support to provide COVID-19 relief.

The year in retrospect

During the year, we achieved the

highest ever top line and profitability.

This robust performance in a year

marked with challenges was a result

of our relentless focus on execution,

wherein we reinforced our core

strengths by investing in expanding

our capacities and distribution

networks. The year saw surging input

costs and supply-side constraints.

However, we mitigated the situation

by taking a balanced approach of

price hikes and cost optimisation

initiatives. Our attempts at widening

our distribution network also yielded

results, and so did our efforts to

enhance the brand visibility.

We progressed on our journey to

make Astral structurally, financially

and operationally future-ready. The

modernisation and de-bottlenecking

journey continued for existing

facilities, as we added innovative and

disruptive products in our Pipes and

Adhesives category.

Continuous upheavals

notwithstanding, we recorded

strong growth across all our

business segments, with the Pipes

and Adhesives business segment

recording the highest production

volumes historically. We also made

impressive progress on the Water

Tanks business and remain confident

of doubling our revenues in the same

in FY23.

Focusing on the next

In a future-oriented move, our Board,

in a meeting held on April 29, 2022,

approved to acquire 51% controlling

equity stake in the operating paint

business of Gem Paints Private

Limited. Strategically, the entry into

paints gives us the opportunity to

harness synergies with the existing

sales and distribution network and

legacy of the Astral brand, and has the

potential to create significant value for

all our stakeholders.

We continue to map our portfolio

against the dynamic market

environment to create a portfolio that

serves as a lever for our ambitions.

Thus, we have reworked our product

offerings to also include faucets and

sanitaryware, transforming us into a

complete building material player.

We will leverage our vast and deeply

entrenched pan-India distribution

network to drive growth in new

businesses. Our go-to-market

strategy will be to gradually scale

up the new offerings by focusing

on specific geographies and then

eventually metamorphosing into a

pan-India player. We anticipate that

these two new product categories

alongwith other newly launched

products will add ~ ₹ 1500 crores to

our top line over the next five years

with no additional CAPEX. Gem

Paints’ current capacity allows for

a threefold increase in sales from

our existing levels. Furthermore,

we have acquired a ready facility on

asset purchase basis at Jamnagar to

manufacture faucets.

Purpose beyond profit

In addition to our obligations to

our customers, we think that social

and environmental responsibility is

necessary for long-term success.

Through a variety of projects, the

Astral Foundation made considerable

progress in its objective to serve and

empower marginalised communities.

In line with our commitment to

achieving holistic progress, we are

working continuously to empower

our people. This year we ensured

better training and up-skilling of our

team members as we recorded a

threefold increase in training man-

hours compared to the previous year.

We endeavour to make Astral a truly

enriching workplace with supportive

policies and appropriate health

and safety measures. I am happy

to announce that our commitment

to employee care and career

development earned us Great Place

to Work® Institute’s certification as

a Great Place to Work® in India for

2021-22.

We continued to prioritise our ESG

(environment, social and governance)

initiatives, and the efficient utilisation

of energy from cleaner sources at our

facilities remained one of our primary

focus areas during the year. The year

also witnessed us consuming the

highest ever solar units, as we doubled

our installed solar power capacity

compared to last year, and now ~ 20%

of our Santej and Dholka plants’ power

needs are met by solar energy.

Looking ahead

Although the economic environment

remains uncertain, the long-term

growth opportunities remain

favourable for us. Over the

past few years, we have made

substantial investments to support

our decentralisation strategy by

expanding our manufacturing

capacities. We now believe we

have reached a point where all

of our investments will bear fruit

and accelerate the growth of our

company.

The past year has been a pivotal one,

with numerous initiatives undertaken

which were essential to accelerate the

growth of our business. As we tread

new avenues to capitalise on growth

opportunities and enhance value, we

impetrate our stakeholders to remain

as committed to us as they have been

in the past. We believe in our ability

to endure the ebbs and flows of the

business cycle and will continue to

work to the best of our abilities to

deliver value.

In closing, I would like to express

my sincere appreciation to all our

stakeholders for their confidence and

support. I am certain that we will script

an exciting growth journey ahead.

Looking forward to our prosperous

future at Astral Limited, thank you.

Regards

Sandeep Engineer

CHAIRMAN & MANGING DIRECTOR

While we are learning from this new order of conducting

business in this new environment, the most important

responsibility for us at Astral has been to ensure the

health of our people. We will always prioritise the safety

and community at large.

We continue to map our

portfolio against the dynamic

market environment to

create a portfolio that serves

as a lever for our ambitions.

ASTRAL LIMITED

ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

EXPANDING HORIZONS

Dear Shareholders,

It’s been an incredible year for us at Astral, and I’d like to take

this opportunity to thank you all and my dear colleagues for

the unwavering support. We have all endured one of the most

challenging periods of the pandemic, and I hope that you and

your families are healthy and safe.

FY22 has bolstered our faith in our business model and strategic

decisions. The resilience demonstrated by the Company amidst

the disruptions caused by the pandemic resulted in its best-ever

performance. This strong performance is a testimony to our

robust business model and execution capabilities.

Reviewing FY22

In FY22, we witnessed strong growth

across our business segments and

we closed the year with a revenue

of ₹ 43,940 million up by 38.34% as

compared to ₹ 31,763 million in FY21.

Our EBITDA grew by 18.97% to

₹ 7,883 million in FY22 from

₹ 6,626 million in FY21. Our PAT

stood at ₹ 4,904 million in FY22 as

compared to PAT of ₹ 4,082 million in

FY21. This performance is remarkable

given the challenging operating

environment, which included

managing supply chain issues, volatile

raw material prices, and adhering to a

multitude of COVID-19 constraints.

We maintained healthy liquidity

to meet operational and strategic

objectives. Despite the strong

revenue growth, we ensured to keep

our working capital cycle in check.

As a result, the net working capital

days decreased from 27 in FY21 to

21 in FY22. Despite holding higher

inventory throughout the year to

alleviate supply-side challenges, we

optimised our working capital cycle

by reducing our debtor days to 22

in FY22, as against 32 in FY21. As of

March 31, 2022, our net cash balance

was ₹ 5,566 million, up from ₹ 4,094

million as of March 31, 2021.

With revenues of ₹ 34,433 million, the

pipes business performed extremely

well during the year. EBITDA for

the year was ₹ 6,624 million with an

EBITDA margin of 19.20%. The strong

performance was driven by a mix of

volume and realisation growth along

with well diversified demand from

across geographies. The adhesives

business recorded a strong top line

growth of 37.39% reaching

₹ 10,091 million in FY22 as against

₹ 7,345 million in FY21. EBITDA for the

year stood at ₹ 1,287 million with an

EBITDA margin of 12.80%.

Inflationary pressures began building

up in FY21 and largely persisted

through FY22. As a result, prices of

our key inputs touched all-time highs

while exhibiting significant volatility in

the interim. While most of the inflation

was passed on to the end-user with

a lag, we took a tactical call to face

the inflation in specific categories to

strengthen our competitiveness and

aggressively pursue market share.

This is reflected in the year-on-year

decline in the operating margin.

However, it was still better compared

to the industry margins.

Delivering on our promises

We have always upheld our

commitment to increasing value

for our stakeholders. Despite

the challenging environment,

we remained steadfast in our

commitment to deliver ₹ 10,000

million in top-line from our adhesives

business and attained double-digit

growth in our pipes business, as

promised to our shareholders.

A future brimming with

opportunities

By acquiring Gem Paints Private

Limited, Astral has now diversified

into the paints industry, which

provides a significant opportunity for

our growth objectives. The existing

facility’s 36,000 KL capacity can

accommodate a threefold increase

in volume without additional capital

expenditures. In addition, we intend

to leverage our existing dealer and

distribution network to drive the

growth in this segment.

Beginning June 2022, the Company

also started marketing faucets and

sanitary ware under the brand name

Astral. The Company will operate

in the premium economy segment

in this product category and will

kick start the operations using an

asset-light model and only announce

CAPEX once critical sales are

achieved. We are confident of adding

incremental revenues of ₹ 15,000

million from these two new product

categories and newly launched

products in the next five years.

Astral is a very strong brand that has

earned the confidence of millions

of consumers in India. We will try to

build on our learnings and leverage

our strengths in distribution as we

straddle multiple categories. We

will also continue to invest in brand

building across diverse channels.

Today, we are a stronger company

with diversified and growing

businesses, applying our learnings

across the spectrum. While there is

more work to be done, I am confident

in our strategy and plans to deliver

industry-leading growth.

I am proud of our team for displaying

grit and character during these

trying times. Their perseverance and

dedication have helped us to navigate

the difficulties of the last few years. I

thank you, our shareholders, for your

trust and confidence throughout

our journey. And I am excited about

the future as we set out to extend

our horizons further, trace a higher

growth trajectory and set new

benchmarks for excellence.

Segment revenue, segment expenses, segment assets and

segment liabilities have been identified to segments on the

basis of their relationship to the operating activities of the

segment. Inter segment revenue is accounted on the basis of

transactions which are primarily determined based on market

/ fair value factors. Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities

which relate to the Group as a whole and are not allocable to

segments on a reasonable basis have been included under

“unallocated revenue / expenses / assets / liabilities”.

x) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of

estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements

in conformity with the Ind AS requires management to

make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect

the application of accounting policies and the reported

amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures as at date of the

consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts

of the revenues and expenses for the years presented.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on

historical experience and other factors that are considered

to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates

under different assumptions and conditions. The estimates

and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing

basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised

in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision

affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and

future periods if the revision affects both current and future

periods.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The following are the key assumptions concerning the

future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the

end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk

of causing as material adjustment to the carrying amounts of

assets and liabilities within next financial year.:
