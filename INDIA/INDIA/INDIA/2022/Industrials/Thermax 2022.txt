Managing Director & CEO

With the aim of radically

changing Thermax’s service

levels, a core team worked

through Covid’s second

wave to develop Thermax

Edge - our customer portal.

MESSAGE FROM

THE MANAGING

DIRECTOR & CEO

Across all sectors, climate change

remains at the top of the agenda of

most customers. FY 2021-22 has been a

watershed year for several products

in our ever-growing green portfolio.

Dear Shareholder,

I have been with Thermax for more than two years

now, and this is the first time during my tenure

that the long shadow of Covid-19 is seemingly

behind us. No summary of the year gone by can

be complete without considering the immense

hardships many had to endure.

Covid’s second wave was particularly severe

for the Thermax team in India. We lost a few

of our colleagues, and many families suffered

casualties. Our prayers go out to the loved ones

we have lost. As we turn a new chapter, a heartfelt

thank you to all the employees and partners

that ensured business continuity through the

Covid-induced challenges.

Even as the impact of Covid-19 on business

is gradually subsiding, new challenges are

emerging. Prime among these is the impact of

commodity prices resulting from geopolitical

strife and high inflation. Steel prices surged

with a rise of 36% during the past financial year.

Prices of other commodities also soared as

demand outstripped supply, including crude,

nickel, copper and aluminium. Freight has also

been uncertain and expensive. Our Chemicals

business was particularly impacted during the

year as a significant portion of its orders come

from exports to Europe and North America.

About 30% of Thermax’s revenue was contributed

by projects having longer gestation period.

The impact of this unanticipated increase in input

costs has been approximately 70% which were

offset by way of productivity increases and cost

outs. In addition, we also increased our prices

on multiple occasions during Q3 and Q4 across

various product categories. The delay in the

impact of price increases and the elastic nature

of demand for the product businesses resulted in

lower price realisation than anticipated.

As I look forward to the next financial year of

FY 2023, the outlook on commodities appears

to be mixed. Our focus will be on minimising

Thermax’s exposure to commodity price

fluctuations. This implies passing on international

freight costs to our customers, having shorter

quotation validity windows, and ensuring faster

ordering of raw materials once we receive

an order.

Despite medium-term impediments, our business

continues to be stronger than ever. The strength is

a result of three key factors – positive momentum

in the Indian economy, growing demand for green

energy, and a keen focus on innovating and

developing our products and services.

2. Board of Directors

A. Composition of the Board

The Company believes that its Board needs to have

an appropriate mix of executive, non-executive and

independent directors to maintain its independence,

and separate its functions of governance and

management. The Board of your Company comprises

10 directors – one non-executive and non-independent

chairperson, one non-executive director, one executive

director and seven independent directors (out of

whom one is independent woman director). This is in

conformity with the requirement of Regulation 17 of the

Listing Regulations. The Board periodically evaluates the

need for change in its size and composition.

None of the directors on the Board holds directorships

in more than 10 public companies or serves as a

Director or as Independent Director (ID) in more than

seven listed entities. No Executive Director serves as an

ID in more than three listed entities.

Necessary disclosures regarding Committee positions

in other public companies as on March 31, 2022, have

been made by the Directors.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the Members of Thermax Limited

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial

consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the consolidated

Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and

notes to the consolidated financial statements, including

a summary of significant accounting policies and other

explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the

consolidated financial statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and

according to the explanations given to us and based on

the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate

financial statements and on the other financial information of

the subsidiaries and associate, the aforesaid consolidated

financial statements give the information required by the

Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner

so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with

the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the

consolidated state of affairs of the Group, its associate as

at March 31, 2022, their consolidated profit including other

comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and

the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year

ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial

statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing

(SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further

described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit

of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ section of our

report. We are independent of the Group and its associate

in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the

Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with

the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit

of the financial statements under the provisions of the

Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our

other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these

requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the

audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate

to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated

financial statements.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to Note 31 of the Consolidated Financial

Statement relating to demand orders on the group for

Rs. 1,385.47 crores (including penalty of Rs. 331.88 crores

and excluding interest not presently quantified) by the

Commissioner of Central Excise, Pune. The Holding

Company has filed an appeal against the said orders.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional

judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the

consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended

March 31, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context

of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a

whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not

provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter

below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter

is provided in that context.

We have determined the matters described below to be the

key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have

fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s

responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial

statements section of our report, including in relation to these

matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of

risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial

statements. The results of audit procedures performed

by us, as reported by them in their audit reports furnished

to us by the management, including those procedures

performed to address the matters below, provide the basis

for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated

financial statements.:

The timing and amount of the cash flow which will arise from these matters, will be determined by the relevant

authorities on settlement of the cases or on receipt of claims from customers.

*Claims against the Group not acknowledged as debt on account of ongoing arbitration/ legal dispute with the

various customers / vendors of the Group. Based on the legal opinion on few matters and management assessments

of the facts of the case, no provision against above claim is considered. Pending resolution of the matters, it is not

practicable to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any.

e) There are certain law suits, disputes, warranty claims, etc., including commercial matters that arise from time

to time in the ordinary course of business, the amounts involved in such matters are currently not quantifiable.

However, based on managements assessment under Ind AS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent

Assets” , that claims are not tenable / probability of final outcome against the Group is low and therefore not

disclosed as contingent liabilities.

A

Contingent liabilities

a) During earlier years, the Group has received demand notices/show cause-cum-demand notices from

the Excise department covering period from June 2000 till June 2017 for Rs. 1,385.47 crores (March 31, 2021:

Rs.1,385.47) (including penalty but excluding interest and further penalty thereon).

These demands are of excise duty payable on inclusion of the cost of bought out items in the assessable value of

certain products manufactured by the Group, though such duty paid bought out items were directly dispatched

by the manufacturers thereof to the ultimate customer, without being received in the Group’s factory. The Group

has filed an appeal against the said orders received before CESTAT, Mumbai. Based on independent legal advice,

the Group is confident of the issue being ultimately decided in its favour and accordingly no provision has been

considered necessary.

The Company’s portfolio includes boilers and heaters,

absorption chillers/ heat pumps, power plants, solar

equipment, air pollution control equipment/system,

water and waste recycle plant, ion exchange resins and

performance chemicals and related services.

The Company is a public limited company incorporated

and domiciled in India. It is listed on the BSE Limited

(BSE) and National Stock Exchange Limited (NSE)

in India. The address of its registered office is D-13,

MIDC Industrial Area, R.D. Aga Road, Chinchwad,

authorized to issue these standalone financial

statements on May 20, 2022. The CIN of the Company is

L29299PN1980PLC022787.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

2.1.Basis of preparation and measurement

(a) Basis of preparation

These standalone financial statements have been

prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting

Standards (Ind AS), notified under the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as

amended from time to time) and presentation

requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the

Companies Act, 2013, (Act) as applicable to the

standalone financial statements.

The preparation of the standalone financial

statements requires the use of certain critical

accounting judgements, estimates and

assumptions. It also requires the management to

exercise judgment in the process of applying the

Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving

a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or

areas where assumptions and estimates are

significant to the standalone financial statements

are disclosed in note 3.

The employee welfare trusts (including an ESOP

trust) being separate legal entities, are not

considered for the purpose of consolidation in the

standalone financial statements. However, these

trusts have been consolidated in the consolidated

financial statements under Ind AS 110.

The accounting policies adopted for preparation

and presentation of these standalone financial

statements have been consistently applied except

for changes resulting from amendments to Ind AS

issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, effective

for financial years beginning on or after April 1, 2021

as disclosed in note 2.2.

(b) Basis of measurement

The standalone financial statements have

been prepared on the accrual and going

concern basis under historical cost convention

except the following:

Derivative financial instruments;

Certain financial assets and liabilities

measured at fair value (refer accounting policy

regarding financial instruments); and

Defined benefit plans whereby the plan assets

are measured at fair value.

2.2. Changes in accounting policies and

disclosures

2.2.1. Consequent to amendments to the Schedule

III to the Companies Act, 2013 current maturities of

long-term borrowings (March 31, 2021: Rs. Nil) have

been presented as part of the short term borrowings,

which were previously included under ‘Other financial

liabilities’, lease liabilities (March 31, 2021: Rs.6.91) have

been presented on the face of balance sheet, which

were previously included under ‘other financial liabilities’

and Security deposits (March 31, 2021; Rs.10.59) have

been presented as part of ‘other financial assets’,

which were previously included under ‘loans’ in

financial assets.

2.2.2. Others

Several other amendments and interpretations apply

for the first time in the year ended March 31, 2022,

but do not have an impact on the standalone financial

statements of the Company.

2.3 Summary of significant accounting

policies

a. Investment in associates

Associates are those entities over which

the Company has significant influence.

NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended March 31, 2022

(All amounts are in Rupees Crore, except per share data and unless stated otherwise):

Managing Director and Chief

Executive Officer as the chief operating decision

maker of the Company.

v. Contingent liabilities

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made where

there is a possible obligation that arises from past

events and the existence of which will be confirmed

only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one

or more uncertain future events not wholly within

the control of the Company or a present obligation

that arises from the past events where it is either

not probable that an outflow of resources will

be required to settle the obligation or a reliable

estimate of the amount cannot be made.

w. Earnings Per Share (EPS)

The Company presents the basic and diluted EPS

data for its equity shares. Basic EPS is computed

by dividing the net profit for the year attributable

to the equity shareholders of the Company by

the weighted average number of equity shares

outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is

computed by adjusting the net profit for the

year attributable to the equity shareholders and

the weighted average number of equity shares

considered for deriving basic EPS for the effects of

all the equity shares that could have been issued

upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity

shares (which includes the various stock options

granted to employees).

x. Dividends

Dividend to equity shareholders is recognized

as a liability in the period in which the dividends

are approved by the equity shareholders.

Interim dividends that are declared by the

Board of Directors without the need for equity

shareholders’ approvals are recognized as a

liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in

the year in which the dividends are declared by the

Board of directors.:
