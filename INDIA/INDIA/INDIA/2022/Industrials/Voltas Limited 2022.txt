year witnessed a lot of

disruptions, including the

second and third wave of

Covid-19, and frequent

lockdowns. However, the

economic activities gradually

regained momentum as

markets started recovering

and consumers continued

to invest in their homes,

for their comfort and

Letter of intent) contained a bouquet of orders

across Water, HVAC, Rural Electrification and Urban infra

activities.

In the midst of various challenges during the year,

Infrastructure Solutions has successfully executed time

bound projects such as:

MEP project GARUD, which has been inaugurated by

Hon’ble Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi.

IAQ projects of ~` 35 crores for TCS in record time.

Commissioned a project of 300 MW AC & 225 MW DC

under Solar EPC for Azure Power.

Commissioned 100 MW AC & 140 MWp DC, out of 300

MW AC & 426 MWp DC. for Soft Bank Energy (now

taken over by Adani).

Opportunities and Outlook

The Government’s push on infrastructure is expected

to increase spending on infra projects. This will provide

opportunities to bid for Metro, Rural Electrification and

Solar Projects. Having credentials of timely execution

of the projects and that too in a most cost-effective

manner

across

metro,

large

rural

electrification,

underground cabling, and solar projects, giving the

Company a competitive edge over others.

inFrastructure sOlutiOns

The resumption of construction activities, unlike amid

the national lockdown in the previous year, helped the

business vertical in better and timely execution of projects.

Availability of sites and a healthy project mix drove the

business during the year. During the pandemic, there

was a delay in capex plans, especially by corporate clients

in MEP business. However, focus on the Government

backed infra projects helped to mitigate the risk of

reduced private investments. Now, with easing of Covid-19

cases in India corporate investments are expected to

start flowing. However, increased and unprecedented

fluctuations in commodity prices and supply and demand

gap have added to the lead time of materials. In the Water

Business, the Company has developed in-house strengths

in Engineering/Designing of treatment processes and in

project execution. The Company has expertise in varied

domains like WTP, Industrial ETPs, ZLDs, STPs, and Drinking

Water Projects.

Over ` 1,190 crores of fresh orders were added across

Domestic markets in 2021-22. The carry-forward order

Outlook and Opportunities

Successful completion of Expo 2020 by the UAE resolving

the regional crisis (Qatar vs rest of the region), combined

with signing up of the trade and relationship agreement

with Israel, has changed the economic scenario. Both the

UAE and Qatar announced several new projects, reflected

in the higher inflow of inquiries for IOBG. The improvised

structures and systems implemented in the past paved

way for IOBG to harvest dividends from new project

announcements – reflected in the early signs of project

bookings during the past few months.

Bahrain is warming up with new projects announcements

in the Tourism industry while Saudi is firing all cylinders

with mega projects moving from drawing board to reality.

There is a renewed focus on destination tourism, utility

plants, infrastructure, manufacturing sector, and oil

and gas balance of plants. IOBG will strategically focus

on these segments as it enjoys strong prequalification

to stand above the competition. IOBG is looking for the

possibility of early pre-bid agreements as well as strategic

tie-ups with main contractors, developers and even with

the competitors.

threats

The current geopolitical situation with uncertainty over the

war in Europe has led to an increase in the commodity

prices combined with higher logistics cost resulting in

an adverse impact on supply chain. To add to this the

increased demand for skilled workforce has resulted

in higher attrition rates across the region. This, in turn,

impacts the international operations and margins.
