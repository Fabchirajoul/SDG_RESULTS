MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

I am confident that TTL

will enhance its market

share in 30.1-100 MW

segment significantly

in the coming years, to

further push the bar of

sustainable growth for

itself and for its clients.: Dear Shareholders,

At TTL, we have always believed that sustainable growth is the only way forward for

businesses and corporates to progress to the next level. We look at sustainability

as being central to the value proposition that we are focussed on delivering to our

stakeholders through our innovation-led efforts. In line with this belief, we continue to

invest in long-term sustainable growth for ourselves and for our customers. This makes

us the preferred choice of customers globally, and enables us to stay ahead of the growth

curve across the operational and financial metrics of our business.

Marked by many notable milestones, FY 22 saw a

huge scale-up of our performance, with TTL reporting

its highest ever turnover of ` 8.52 billion – a marked

growth of more than 21% over the previous financial

year. We also posted our highest ever order booking

of ` 11.8 billion during the year. Our order book, as

of April 1, 2022, stands at a healthy 52% higher than

the previous fiscal, coupled with a sizeable domestic

enquiry book which reported an increase of 57% over

FY 21. The international enquiry generation, also showed

a significant increase of 25% against FY 21. All this

gives us good visibility for further growth in the coming

year, and augurs well for the Company's long-term,

sustainable expansion and progress.

As you are aware, our consolidated results for FY 22

include the impact of business combination of Triveni

Energy Solutions Limited (TESL) as a wholly-owned

subsidiary {Formerly GE Triveni Limited, which was

previously a joint venture}, from September 6, 2021, i.e.

the date of acquisition of TESL. It further includes the

impact of the acquisition of TSE Engineering (Pty.) Ltd

(TSE) as a subsidiary from March 1, 2022. Both these

transactions are in line with our conscious focus on

maximising value creation for our stakeholders across our

business segments.

I am happy to say that the TESL acquisition was formalised

after an amicable resolution with GE parties, with whom

Q&A WITH VICE CHAIRMAN & MANAGING

DIRECTOR

The Company has

reported an excellent

performance during

the year in a challenging

environment. What were the

highlights of this performance

and the drivers behind it?

It has been a good year for TTL,

and we have reported some

historic numbers in a difficult and

challenging period. Our revenue

from operations grew by 21% as

compared to the previous year, with

domestic sales showing an increase

of 60%. Though export turnover

declined 23%, due mainly to the

lower order book of the previous year

resulting from the pandemic impact,

however the new order booking

trends have been extremely positive.

As a result, the mix of domestic and

export sales changed to 70:30 in FY

22 as compared to 54:46 in FY 21.

This change in the sales mix,

which was skewed more towards

the domestic during the year, has

naturally impacted the Company’s

EBITDA margins since the domestic

market has lower margins than

exports. Overall, the margins have

declined to 22.5% in FY 22 as against

23.7% in FY 21, with the higher

raw material costs also adding to

the pressure. Thus EBITDA growth

was lower at 15%, however, on an

absolute basis was still impressive

at ` 1.92 billion in FY 22 as against

` 1.67 billion in FY 21. I am happy

to share that the Company's Profit

after Tax (PAT) grew by an impressive

164% to ` 2.7 billion during the year,

aided by the one-time settlement

pertaining to TESL (erstwhile GETL)

which has encouraged the Board of

Directors to recommend the payment

of final dividend @ 85% (` 0.85 per

**Dr Santosh Pande, ceased to be Director w.e.f. September 20, 2021 due to his death. Whereas, Mr Vijay Kumar Thadani, joined

the Board w.e.f December 15, 2021. Since both of them drew remuneration only for part of the year, the ratio of their remuneration

to median remuneration and percentage increase in remuneration is not comparable and hence not stated above.

***The percentage increase in remuneration in FY 22 is not comparable, as previous year remuneration was only for part of the year

i.e w.e.f. Nov 01, 2020 hence not stated above.

Note:

(i)

The remuneration to Non-Executive Directors includes commission in accordance with the relevant provisions

of Companies Act, 2013 due to better profitability.

(ii)

In the Financial year 2021-22, the annual median remuneration of employees was ` 0.88 million, an increase of

16.6 % over the corresponding remuneration in the previous year.

(iii) There were 621 permanent employees (other than trainees) on the rolls of the Company as on March 31, 2022.

(iv) The average percentile salary increase for employees was 11.38% against 20.6% for managerial remuneration.

The increase in managerial remuneration is due to a higher performance bonus as a result of improved

performance and profitability, which is consistent with significant management efforts to plan, implement, and

achieve improvements in operational efficiencies as well as efforts to settle a dispute with the Joint Venture

Partner of one of its subsidiaries. The increase in remuneration is in accordance with the approval of the Board/

Shareholders, as per relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.

(v) As the liability for gratuity and leave encashment is provided on an actuarial basis for the Company as a whole,

the amount pertaining to the key managerial personnel are not ascertainable and, therefore, not included.

(vi) It is hereby affirmed that the remuneration paid during the financial year ended March 31, 2022 is as per the
