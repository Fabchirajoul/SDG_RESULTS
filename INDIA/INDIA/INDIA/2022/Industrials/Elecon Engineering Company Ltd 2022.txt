Managing Director

We witnessed strong order intake in the Gears business due to favourable demand

environment. Although the external environment has turned slightly challenging

due to ongoing geopolitical conﬂict, we are seeing healthy inﬂow of orders from

our end-user industries. We continue to focus on cost reduction initiatives along

with improvement in overall production efﬁciency to mitigate the impact of rise

in input and logistics cost. All our overseas entities have now turned proﬁtable.

We are presently working towards improving our market reach further in Europe,

USA, Canada, and Latin America. The proposed increase in government capital

expenditure announced in the recent budget augurs well for the industry and is

likely to result in sustainable growth in the gears division.

M. M. Nanda - Head Gear Division

Fiscal 2022 marks the inﬂection point in terms of performance in the MHE division

and we are fairly conﬁdent that the performance will improve further in the

coming years. In the MHE division, we have successfully closed few legacy projects

and collected the outstanding guarantees as well as payments and we intend to

wind up the other loss-making projects in due course of time and completely

focus on proﬁtable products business. During the year, we undertook various

cost optimization initiatives, streamlined execution capabilities and focused

on improving receivables management. We are conﬁdent of turning around

the performance in the MHE division led by our unwavering focus on choosing

proﬁtable business in the products business and staying away from loss making projects business.
