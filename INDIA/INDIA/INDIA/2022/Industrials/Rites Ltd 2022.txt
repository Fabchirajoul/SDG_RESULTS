of the Group due to outbreak of COVID-19. Group has impaired, as a prudent measure, the trade receivables and unbilled

revenue towards expected credit loss as per Group’s accounting policy to the extent of H 104.85 crore (previous year H 110.19

No significant credit risk on cash and bank balances including clients’ funds amounting to H3431.63 crore (previous year H

3403.60 crore) is expected as holding Company and its Indian Subsidiaries parks surplus funds with Schedule Banks having

good credit adequacy ratio and least NPA as determined by RBI and guidelines of the respective companies. Holding Company

and its Indian Subsidiaries has parked its owned funds in fixed deposits of H 774.98 crore (previous year H 886.63 crore) with

Schedule banks with negligible credit risks.

Non-Strategic Investments primarily include investments in liquid mutual fund units of H 25.92 crore (previous year H 85.77

crore) and tax-free bonds of H 95 crore (previous year H 120 crore) issued by Public Sector Undertaking where risk is minimal.

The holding Company has given House building, multi-purpose loans etc. to the employee which are insured, and are

mortgage against house properties in line with the policies of the Company. The risk of default in respect of these loans is

considered negligible.

iii) Liquidity Risk of Group

Group’s principal sources of liquidity are “cash and cash equivalents” and the cash flow that is generated from operations.

Group has outstanding bank borrowings of H 24.65 crore (previous year H 32.38 crore). Group has a working capital of

H1648.42 crore (previous year H 1714.84 crore) including cash and bank balance (owned funds) of H 707.65 crore (previous

year H 924.87 crore) and current investment H 75.92 crore (previous year H 110.77 crore). Group believes that the working

capital is sufficient to meet its requirements, accordingly no liquidity risk is perceived by the Group.

Financial Statements

Statutory Reports

Corporate Overview:

Managing Director who is also Chief Executive Officer.

i)

The group has identified five operational reportable segments based on operations being carried out which are as under: -

•

Consultancy Services

•

Leasing of railway rolling stock & equipments

•

Export of rolling stock, equipments and spares

•

Turnkey Construction Projects

•

Power Generation

ii)

Geographicalwise revenue segment is disclosed as under:

A)

Revenue within India from consultancy includes quality assurance & project management services, turnkey construction

projects, power generation and domestic lease rental services to clients located inside India.

B)

Revenue from outside India includes services rendered and export sales of rolling stock & spare parts to the clients located

outside India.

iii) The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue &

expenditure in individual segment, as set out in the note of significant accounting policies.

iv) Revenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under each reportable segment. Expenses which are not

directly identifiable to each reporting segment have been allocated on the basis of attributed direct cost. All other expenses

which are not attributable or allocable to the segments have been disclosed as un-allocable expenses.

v)

Assets and liabilities used in the Group’s business are not identified to the reportable segments as these are used interchangeably

between segments. Depreciation, amortisation & impairment on Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets cannot be

allocated to a specific segment. The Group believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segmental disclosure relating to

total assets, total liabilities and depreciation, amortisation & impairmentsince a meaningful segregation of the available data could

be onerous.
