Export

Despite the much-awaited development of effective vaccines against

COVID-19, the virus continued to spread and mutate throughout the

year 2021. The pace of recovery was slightly better than 2020 with less

lockdowns. However, it remained slow and uneven across world regions

due to varying degrees of mobility restrictions, vaccination rates and

business confidence. Apart from the slow recovery due to pandemic,

other crises that stalked the world were global supply chain bottlenecks,

in particular non-availability of semiconductor components and the

uncertain freight rates. These did affect world trade and thereby exports

and Genus was no exception.

Genus export did slightly better after having plunged to low the previous

year after years of steady growth. It had to grapple with disruptions in both

domestic and global demand due to pandemic induced challenges.

The global economic slowdown while showing signs of recovery, continued

to dent meter demand and to add to that poor deployment of meters,

absence of inspection, restriction in the movement of goods, the large-

scale logistical disruptions in the countries of Genus interest have been

significant contributing factors that impacted exports and payment cycles.

The overseas inquiries, opportunities and tenders were limited but

marginally better during this period as compared to the previous year. It

helped Genus to have good order booking for the coming year.:
