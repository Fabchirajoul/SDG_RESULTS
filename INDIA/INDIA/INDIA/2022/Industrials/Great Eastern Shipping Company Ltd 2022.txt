Chairman's Statement: CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

Fellow Shareholders,

This year the cover of the annual report has our Company’s Coffee Table Book.

This book captures 74 years of the Company’s history and is an exemplary effort

by an internal team of employees! The e-version of the book is available on the

Company’s website. I hope you, your family, and your friends enjoy reading it!

I am particularly excited to share with you that on all non-financial parameters,

we have had the best year of the previous seven decades. The reason I

emphasize on non-financial parameters is because it is the culmination of this

data that determines the brand of a shipping company. Our vessels and the

processes we follow at work are inspected by multiple authorities at multiple

times. The findings of such inspections culminate in a database which is then

analyzed by our highly quality conscious customers. It is this data which leads

me to conclude that this has been our best year ever.

While brand differentiation is important, so too is the process of capital allocation

and the timing of straddling the spot and the time charter markets. The ensuing

decisions go into determining the results for individual years and the eventual

Net Asset Value (NAV). Here, too, I am equally enthused to report that whilst for

the period 2012 to 2017, the Company’s NAV-based return was about 8% p.a., for

the following five years period ending March 2022 the return has been close to

15% p.a. This almost 7% CAGR increase is the result of better decision making.

Inexplicably, whilst the overall value of the Company doubled in the last five

years, the stock price performance for the same period has been disappointing.

Moving forward, what would be our key focus areas? Undoubtedly, it would be to build upon the brand that is ‘Great Eastern Shipping’ as well as

create an organization whose culture will encourage and enable free expression of ideas and free expression of thoughts. This is not to say that there

will be less focus on the measurable returns on capital deployed. After all, the profits that we generate are equally important for they enable us to

reward our shareholders, as well as to keep adding to our CSR activities which we so greatly value.

A particular thank you to all our seafarers who have worked tirelessly in ensuring that we run amongst the best ships globally. After having inspected

several ships towards acquisitions, I can say this without any hesitation.

Complacency in any organization can set in quickly and eventually leads to its inevitable decline. I keep reminding our management team of the

same and I’m confident that they will ensure that each and every Gescoite will continue to set higher and higher benchmarks. This will not only be a

testimony to what Indians can achieve, but will also show to the world, that an Indian company can be recognized as the best in class.

6VARIABLE PAY

It provides a variable level of remuneration dependent on short-term performance of the individual as well as the Company vis a vis industry

performance globally. The test of performance by the Company is whether it is able to increase its profits when the industry environment is favourable

and whether it is able to minimise its losses when the environment is harsh. The Company believes that performance of each and every employee

of the Company contributes to its overall performance and hence should be rewarded suitably. Hence, the Company follows the policy of making

payment of variable pay to its executive directors annually.

Variable pay is decided based on performance of executive directors as well as the Company. Where possible, the Company uses quantifiable, hard

targets that can be factually measured and objectively assessed. The Company also reviews the underlying performance of the group in light of the

annual plan, competitors results, etc.

Variable pay may vary from time to time but shall be maximum four times of the Consolidated Salary. Executive directors with bigger operating

responsibilities may be entitled to more variable pay as compared to others.

PENSION

Pension recognises and appreciates the experience, expertise, advice, efforts and contribution provided and made by executive directors to the

Company during their long years of service with the Company and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries, whether in their capacity as executive directors

or otherwise.

The Company may provide pension (which includes providing perquisites) to its eligible executive directors upon their ceasing to hold office in the

Company in recognition of their past services in accordance with a scheme formulated by the Board of Directors.

REVIEW

Salary reviews consider both external competitiveness and internal consistency when determining if any increases should be applied. Salary

increases will be generally in line with all employee increases within the Company and other companies based in India and abroad.

Salaries are compared against other shipping and offshore majors, but the Company also monitors market practice among companies of a similar

size, geographic spread and business dynamic to the Company.

Salary increases are not directly linked to performance. However a base-line level of personal contribution is needed in order to be considered for a

salary increase and exceptional sustained contribution may be grounds for accelerated salary increases.

Specific measures and targets may be determined each year by the Committee. The principal measures of increments / bonus will be based on

value creation and may include financial measures such as operational efficiency, operating cash flow, operating profit, cost management, project

delivery, etc.
