Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to present KNRCL’s annual report for

FY 2021-22. I hope that all you have been keeping safe and are in

the best of your health. The pandemic has clearly reinforced the

message ‘Health is Wealth’ and I insist each one of you to be very

careful about the health of yourself and your loved ones.

While the year 2020 was the darkest year because of the

pandemic, things gradually shaped up for 2021-22. Undoubtedly,

the pandemic did not disappear. However, the nationwide rollout

of the vaccine programme enabled normalcy in the world.

There were certain headwinds during the year in the form of

rising inflationary pressure and the Ukraine crisis but India is

still expected to grow at 7.3% and become the fastest-growing

economy in the world in 2022-23, owing to its strong workforce

and undeterred faith in the ecosystem.

Overview of the Construction Industry

The year 2021-22 has been yet another tumultuous year for

the construction industry. The global economy has also been

witnessing difficult times due to the constant military conflict,

which has consequently spiralled the input costs and the

devastating impact of the pandemic. It left a significant impact

on the road construction sector, which is anyway sensitive to

economic cycles. The road construction sector holds potential to

stimulate recovery and plays an instrumental role in generating

employment across the nation.

With string recovery measures in place, the sector can foresee

a huge transformation towards sustainability and digitisation.

During the year under review, much relief was observed due to

the unprecedented relief packages by the Government like debt

moratorium. Additionally, various infra investment programmes

announced by the Government will act as an aid to economic

growth. It has also been observed that organisations across the

globe are adopting the remote mode of working and this can

prove to be beneficial in the long run.

Company’s Strategy

Despite the tough times, your Company’s Balance Sheet has

been resilient and has in fact grown further. Your Company

adopted multiple strategies to reinforce the Company’s financial

position and build a strong foundation to ensure preparedness

for the future. Keeping this in mind, your Company adopted

asset-light policy of monetising BOT and HAM projects. This

enabled the Company to pass on the debts of the SPVs and

obtain equity with return.

Performance Snapshot

With a whirlwind of a year, Government intervention and a

slew of measures became very necessary and this enabled

your Company to make progress despite various limitations.

Ultimately, your Company ended the year with a strong set

of numbers. Your Company achieved a milestone turnover of

` 32,725.92 Mn, thereby recording an increase in turnover of

21.09%. Profit after Tax for the year stood at ` 3,818.00 Mn, an

upward shift of 56%. Notably, your Company has maintained

its ‘zero debt’ level, owing to timely execution of projects and

asset-light policy. Your Company’s net worth amounted to

` 22,419.69 Mn.

The Board of Directors proposed a final dividend of ` 0.25 per

share, subject to approval of shareholders at the ensuing Annual

General Meeting (AGM) of the Company.

Overview of India’s Infrastructure Development

Infrastructure development in India has been a key driver for the

Indian economy. India is expected to become the third-largest

construction market by 2025. India will require investments worth

` 50 Tn (USD 777.73 Bn) across infrastructure by 2022 and 2023

for a sustainable development in the country. Undoubtedly, this

is a huge opportunity in the highway network development in the

Dear Shareholders,

During the last financial year, India’s economy recovered at a

good pace, recording 8.7% GDP rate and also retained the status

of being the fastest-growing economy of the world. However,

the Russia-Ukraine military conflict accelerated the inflation

and interest rates in India and also led to creation of supply

constraints. Oil prices witnessed an upward trend, due to supply

fears as Russia is one of the biggest producers and exporters of

oil. This also led to some tension amongst the people all across

the globe. Additionally, domestic steel prices saw a surge pricing

amidst the military conflict. Cement prices shot up due to higher

fuel prices, thereby leading to price hike and this largely impacted

the infrastructure sector. Raw material prices are up 60-70% in

the last one year and the Bitumen market is witnessing heavy

price fluctuations since the onset of pandemic and the ongoing

military conflict.

On a Positive Note

The Government has laid emphasis on the creation of world-

class infrastructure in a planned and sustained manner. India is

already implementing the National Infrastructure Pipeline with

an outlay of ` 111 Lakh Crore (USD1.4 Tn). Under the Pipeline,

the central and state governments have committed to spend

approximately 80%, while the remaining 20% is expected to

come through private participation. Over the last two years, we

have witnessed that despite the pandemic affecting multiple

sectors, the infrastructure and construction industries have

continued to grow. For example, despite the challenges put forth

by the pandemic, India has been constructing 37 km of roads

per day. (Source: https://constructiontimes.co.in/2022-beckons-

opportunities/).

Our Response to Uncertainty

Your Company has always displayed strength and flexibility

despite many limitations and turbulent times and this year is no

exception. The 2021-22 proved to be a milestone year as your

Company surpassed the revenue figures from the previous year

and the total for the year stood at ` 32,726 Mn. The Net Worth

of your Company amounted to ` 22,420 Mn. Despite all the

uncertainties and adversities, your Company continues to be

in the resilient mode, whether it comes to dealing with the past

pandemic or the present inflationary trend to provide impetus for

accelerated growth.

Notably, your Company’s conservative bidding approach and

timely execution track record has helped it generate industry

leading margins and operate with a healthy balance sheet. Your

Company’s Asset-Light policy in BOT and HAM projects is being

pursued to strengthen the financials of your Company and to

recycle the capital for new HAM projects. Your Company has also

attained the ‘zero-debt level’ status on a standalone basis.

Various factors like concerns about budgetary outlays for roads,

intense competition in the roads space is likely to reverse due to

tightening of pre-qualification norms. Additionally, volatility in

commodity prices and a turn in the interest rate cycle are causing
