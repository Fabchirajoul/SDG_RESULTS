Dear Shareholders,

It is an honour and a privilege to present the 58th Annual

Report of the company to our valued shareholders. I am

happy to share that your company is back in black after

two years of loss.

The past year has been challenging, with the first quarter

severely impacted by the devastating second wave

of COVID-19 affecting operations of manufacturing/

EPC industry across the country. Global supply chain

disruptions due to COVID-19 restrictions, as well

as geopolitical developments in the fourth quarter

leading to drastic increase in input costs, particularly

steel, CRGO, CRNGO, amongst others, added to these

challenges. However, sustained demand during the

year from both private and government sectors as well

as improved industrial production activity has helped

economic recovery with India’s GDP growing by 8.7%

during FY 2021-22—the highest amongst the major

economies of the world.: Letter to Shareholders
