Highlights, FY 2021-22

Omni Customer.

Omni Havells.

Our initial journey was focused around the traditional brick and

mortar channel in the urban markets. Over the years, we have

evolved keeping pace with the changing consumer preference and

multiplied our GTM into a multi-channel offering. Our channels for

urban markets comprise of Dealers, Distributors, E-commerce,

Brand Shops, Modern Format Retail, CSD/CPC canteens and

Projects. With plans of increasing our reach to newer geographies,

we have expanded into rural markets to capitalise on the

aspirational customers developing in the hinterland. Further, we are

now focusing on developing our presence in international markets,

where the credibility of 'Make in India' products has improved over

the years.

As we progress into these new channels, our primary target is to

increase accessibility for the customer and growth opportunity for

our trade partners. We are ensuring that customers get seamless

service, irrespective of the channels, and trade practices remain

uniform, transparent and fair.:

Managing Director’s message

Delivering delightful

experiences

Our Valued Shareholders,

I am pleased to present the Integrated

Report of your Company for FY 2021-22.

Despite the challenging macro

context, business stayed firm, riding

on focused execution and market

share gains.

Another challenging year was well-

managed, owing to the strategic

choices and perseverance of team

Havells India Limited. While navigating

the short-term challenges of the

pandemic and cost inflation, we

continued with investments towards

branding, expanding the distribution

network, and innovation.

Our organic growth was strong, with

broad-based market share gains. We

limited the impact of unprecedented

commodity inflation through efficiency

and calibrated price increases.

Highlights of the year

COVID-19 continued to impact the

business across sectors. With the

onset of the second wave in Q1

FY 2021-22, demand for summer

products was severely impacted.

At Havells, we relied on agility and a

pragmatic approach to manage the

situation. We worked closely with

our channel partners, ensuring their

business continuity and well-being.

We also pitched in with emotional,

psychological and medical support for

our stakeholders. Work-from-home

and an accelerated use of technology

were encouraged.

The latter half of the year was

reassuring with revival in housing as

well as infrastructure. Commodity

costs remained volatile and

inflationary, impacting our margins as

we went for calibrated price increases.

We fuelled our growth agenda through

disciplined cost management, and

improving operational efficiency at all

levels of the business. In combination

with sales growth, this enabled

reinvestment in product innovation,

brand building, digitalisation and

sustainability initiatives, while creating

value for our shareholders.

We introduced the ‘Employee

Ownership Plan’ (EOP) to recognise

the exemplary contribution of our

employees towards profitable growth

of the organisation. The EOP is in

addition to the existing ‘Employee

Stock Schemes’, and aims at creating

long-term wealth for our employees in

line with the Company’s performance.

Emerging trends

The FMEG industry has enormous

growth potential, given the

improvement in electricity availability

and demand for comfort, convenience,

and hygiene. This will exhilarate the

overall portfolio. Additionally, the

Internet of Things (IoT) is driving a

digital wave in home automation,

making it imperative for brands to

offer innovative solutions that will

help customers in realising their

smart home aspirations. Today,

the consumer is far more aware

and aspirational. Rising internet

penetration has further accelerated

the adoption of smart solutions.

We, at Havells, are cognisant of this

opportunity, and are investing in R&D

directed towards this.

Recently, there has been a lot

of attention on self-reliance in

manufacturing, as part of the central

government’s ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’

project. Various government initiatives

such as Production Linked Incentive

(PLI) scheme, national infrastructure

pipeline, and targeted investment

towards manufacturing of electronics,

among others, are charting a positive,

long-term prospect for the economy,

and consequently, the Company.

At Havells, self-reliance has always

been at the core, as we strongly

believe in maximising in-house

manufacturing to have a better control

over quality, supply chain and margins.

Omni Customer, Omni Havells

Customers seek borderless shopping,

and our endeavour is to offer them

a seamless experience. We are

available to the customers, both at

the traditional retail shops as well as

at modern formats. In recent years,

we have increased our presence on

new-age digital platforms, such as

e-commerce marketplaces as well as

the Company-managed portal, O2O.

As digitisation increases, e-commerce

is expected to grow and mature as a

channel, and our portfolio and go-to-

market strategy will evolve alongside.

Havells has strong brand salience

in urban markets, and is expanding

its footprint deeper into India. As

electrification and income levels

improve in rural markets, we are ready

with an organised rural distribution

network, with a unique product

portfolio suitable for these markets.

Different channels have their own

strengths. Modern retail shops offer

larger displays and good ambience,

e-commerce is synonymous with ease

of shopping and delivery, and the

good old local shops offer personal

touch and comfort.

In addition to expanding its retail

base, Havells is also increasing

its participation in B2B projects to

capitalise on large industrial and

infra opportunities.

The two most important aspects of a

multichannel approach are transparent

and fair-trade policies across

channels, and aftersales services

that are channel agnostic. In this

rapidly changing environment, we are

partnering with our customers – large

and small, digital, and physical. We are

ensuring a unified experience for end-

consumers and trade partners.

Sustainability

Sustainability has always been at

the core. We remain committed

to inclusive growth with due

consideration towards social impact.

The thrust in our value proposition

has been to create opportunities for

our stakeholders, where we can be

partners in sustainable growth.

As a part of our commitment to

combat climate change, we have

almost doubled our solar-installed

capacity since FY 2020-21, and are

aggressively pursuing means and

technologies of switching to cleaner

fuels. Product stewardship would be

a key approach in our climate action.

In line with this, we are ramping up

investments in R&D on aspects of

energy efficiency, circularity, long-term

durability and performance of our

products, to provide our consumers

sustainable and eco-conscious

product offerings.

We track and respond to external and

relative indices for ESG performance

assessment as we believe in

benchmarking ourselves to the

emerging dynamic ESG challenges.

We have consistently ranked in the top

10 global companies on the DJSI for

our sector and have also been part of

the RobecoSAM Yearbook for the third

year in a row. Morgan Stanley Capital

International (MSCI) has upgraded the

ESG Risk Rating to ‘A’, and we are now

part of FTSE4Good Indices family.

In addition, CRISIL rated us 'Strong'

in their recently published ESG

ratings in 2022.

Empowered, agile and

accountable organisation

Our Strategic Business Units (SBUs)

are driving performance by responding

quickly and directly to consumer and

channel dynamics that are unique

to their business units. This way,

each SBU has an equal opportunity

to grow with access to capital and

resources. This has resulted in a

simpler, faster, and agile way of

operating, with focused and expert

categories, and greater empowerment

and accountability, flowing through

the business.

Our value creation model is based

on the balanced pursuit of top-

and bottom-line growth as well as

improved capital efficiency. Our

priorities are to invest in long-term

growth and development of our

business. Investing for the long term

takes the form of R&D investments,

brand support and capital expenditure

to support organic, profitable growth.

Outlook

The raw material and supply chain

costs have risen substantially across

the industry, and there is no respite

as of now. This could create pressure

on the customer’s wallet. We are

of the view that these are short-

term challenges, and the underlying

demand remains strong, which could

lead the way to recovery in margins.

Regards,

Anil Rai Gupta

Chairman and: Managing

letter and spirit

and adherence to ethical standards for effective

33. Environment, Health and Safety

During the financial year 2022 which was still reeling

under the shadow of the pandemic, Havells continued

to focus on the aspects of Environment, Social and

Governance (ESG) that would work towards an inclusive

society, which was stronger and more resilient. For

Havells, Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) is an

integral part of the larger ambit of Sustainability umbrella

and is fully committed to run its operations including

allocation of resources using principles of sustainable

deployment to curtail the impact on the environment

and communities.

Our manufacturing facilities are certified with the

integrated management systems such as ISO45001/

OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety) and

ISO 14001 (Environment Management System) and ISO

50001(Energy Efficiency). We are committed to providing

a safe and productive environment for our workforce and

we continue to maintain best health and safety measures

leading to Zero occupational fatality. Adhering to the

COVID-19 prevention directions, we maintained the

highest level of health and safety protocols at all our

plants and offices. Our approach at workplaces was

strategically formulated and implemented, considering

the nature of working site, employee strength, floor

density and other relevant attributes, through the robust

COVID-19 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

Detailed directions through SOPs continued to be

systematically disseminated to the workforce via

workmails, Company’s intranet, displays at factory/

office sites, online trainings, etc. We also deployed Work

from Home policies for our employees to maintain safe

working conditions in Covid times along with ensuring

vaccination of the workforce. Through the new normal,

we have sustained best environmental and health &

safety standards that are derived out of our Integrated

Management System- Quality Energy Environment

Health and Safety (IMS-QEEHS) Policy.

Despite the trying times of pandemic and stricter ESG

rating methodology, Havells was ranked 7th in the

electrical equipment section globally in Dow Jones

Sustainability Index (DJSI) Assessment. Havells has

been consistently ranked in the top 10 global companies

for ESG performance in the electrical sector for last

three years, in addition to be featured in S&P Global

Sustainability Yearbook.

In addition, during the year, in October 2021, Havells has

been upgraded from ‘BBB’ to ‘A’ rating in Morgan Stanley

formulated MSCI ESG Rating. MSCI ESG methodology

is formulated to evaluate a company’s resilience in the

long-term and gauge companies’ exposure to ESG risks.

With an aim to continuously strengthen our processes,

we conducted various awareness sessions and events

on health, safety and environmental topics, online and

in field. Even though our Company does not fall under

energy intense sector, we are still mindful of our impact

on the environment and are taking progressive steps to

minimise the same. Contributing proactively to Nation’s

ambition to achieve the United Nations Sustainable

Development Goals (UN-SDGs), we have mapped our

activities and sustainability efforts to SDGs. In pursuit

to reduce our resource footprint, some of the major

initiatives includes, planting over 15 lakhs tree saplings

in the last 4 years, doubling our total solar installed

capacity to 9 MW from existing capacity of 5.6 MW. With

our dedicated and planned efforts, we have implemented

resilient strategic measures across the organisation to

create sustainable and equitable progress.

34. Research and Development

We continue to make very good progress on the

roadmap that we laid out for our R&D transformation

few years ago.

During financial year 2021-22, our R&D spend stood

at ` 110.26 crores, which is 0.79% of total revenue.

The spends continued to be focused on capacity and

capability building at our three core R&D centers based

out of Noida HO, Noida Sector 59 and Bengaluru.

Our target is to further intensify the efforts on R&D

investments and expand it to ~ 2% of total revenue in

coming years.

Our investments in state-of-the art Customer Experience

and Design (CXD) studio forms the core of understanding

social, emotional and behavioural needs of customers

through design thinking and co-creation methodologies

with dealers, business teams, industry thought leaders

and potential customer groups. CXD focuses on

discovering customer pain points and addressing them

through novel and useful product designs.

The efforts of CXD studio are continuously appreciated

by our customers and its further augmented by tally

of acclaimed design awards. In 2021, we received the

prestigious India design mark awards for Silencio mixer

grinder, Freedom – adaptable architectural light, Puro

storage water heater and Endura pearl grand streetlights

series. NU Bulb+ and Vogue high bay luminaires won

Good design awards Japan 2021 and Red dot award

2021 respectively. Freedom – adaptable architectural

light was also awarded CII Design excellence award.

Our Bengaluru Innovation Centre launched in 2019-20

continues to drive our transformational strategy with

clear focus on establishing Centers of Excellence (COEs)

in Internet of things (IoT), Software, Engineering Design.

and Power Electronics. These COEs are playing a pivotal

role in our innovation journey and self-reliance for critical

technologies while accelerating the digital journey for our

products giving an unparalleled smart and connected

experience to our customers. In a short span of less

than two years, this center has grown to a team of 80+

top-notch R&D members who are actively leveraging the

Silicon Valley of India ecosystem by collaborating with

technology providers, start-ups and academia.

The advanced R&D center at Noida Sector 59, continues

to play a critical role in ensuring the Havells brand

promise of quality and customer value proposition.

With many industry leading and accredited labs under

its umbrella, the R&D center ensures every product

and Innovation that goes out in the market undergoes

rigorous validation and testing to meet the standards of

safety, reliability and customer experience till the end

of lifecycle. This includes building new infrastructures

for adoption of new technologies across our product

range like the recent addition of anechoic test facility

for understanding and regulating noise factors in

appliances. Furthermore, to improve whole value chain of

product development and delivery to customers, various

initiatives and methodologies are driven like advance

simulation to improve cycle time of development and

advanced material substitution for cost reduction

without compromising on product quality.

Overall, we are promoting a culture and mindset of

intellectual assets creation. During 2021-22, we applied

for 9 new patents and 233 new design registrations

taking our cumulative tally to 112 and 781, respectively.

We are extremely proud to report that our innovation

efforts are getting recognised across the industry.

Havells was awarded prestigious CII Top 25 Innovative

qualify for this highly coveted list. Two of our flagship

products - Havells Efficiencia Neo ceiling fan and Monza

by Bureau of energy efficiency.

As the world is coming out of the pandemic, our strong

resolute in R&D has helped to navigate many challenges

like materials supply disruptions, cost escalations

and changes in customer preferences. The wealth of

knowledge and infrastructures that we have created over

these couple of years will stay with us and will continue

to be source of competitive advantage.
