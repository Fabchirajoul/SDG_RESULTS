Dear Shareholders,

I am privileged to present the 36th Annual Report of your

Company for FY 2021-22. The year saw socio economic and

business environment gradually returning to normalcy post the

pandemic onslaught. Hopefully ill effects of the deadly virus are

on the wane; thanks to extraordinary efforts of governments all

over the world and indomitable spirit of mankind.

Volatile oil prices in international markets because of

Russia-Ukraine war have served as a stark reminder for

prioritising energy security around the world. Rise in inflation

has engulfed global economy. Clarion calls are heard all over for

safeguarding energy needs by leveraging captive energy sources

and alternative resources.

We have witnessed built up of increasing momentum towards

environmental awareness on the back of strong Race to Zero

campaign launched during COP 26 Glasgow Summit. Several

nations have pledged carbon neutrality targets by committing to

sustainable climate actions. Energy transition has emerged as

foregone conclusion to curb the temperature rise below 1. 5OC.

Based on the work of scientists and economists, scholarly

analysis indicates that humanity might avert catastrophe by

investing the equivalent of just 2% of global GDP into climate

solutions.

Bioeconomy is poised to play pivotal role in the energy

transition. It is well established that bioeconomy facilitates

sustainable climate actions by way of decarbonization and

carbon recycling. By institutionalizing progressive policy

framework, countries around the world are mainstreaming

bioeconomy.

India announced Carbon Neutrality target of 2070 and has tabled

Panchamrit agenda during the COP26 Climate Change Summit.

As a part of 75th anniversary of independence, Hon. Prime

Minister launched a global initiative LiFE- 'Lifestyle for the

Environment Movement' on occasion of World Environment Day.

Being flag bearer of Bioeconomy in India, your company is well

positioned to contribute to these important initiatives.

Your Company believes Science is Universal, Technology

development is local however Applications are global. We have

been leveraging our core competence of developing and

deploying innovative technology solutions to secure growth

objectives. As a run up to E20 blending by FY 2025-26, India has

achieved 10% blending ahead of time and as a market leader,

your company has played a crucial role. In the process, share of

your company in global ethanol production capacity has also

crossed double digits. Your company has launched new

technologies and expanded market footprint while adding new

customers. Global accolades have only reinforced your

company’s position as a leading technology solutions provider.

With calls for energy transition getting louder, Your company is in

pole position to capitalize on the emerging opportunities. I am

pleased to table major developments, your Company achieved
