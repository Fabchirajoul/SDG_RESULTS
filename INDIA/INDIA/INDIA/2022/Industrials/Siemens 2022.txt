(Up to 29th January, 2021):

Dear Shareholders,

The financial year 2020-21 was marked by the onset of the second COVID-19 wave in

India. The Government of India and various State Governments, together with citizens,

responded in a commendable manner to the unprecedented crisis. These concerted

efforts contributed to the Indian economy remaining resilient in the face of disruptions

in supply chain, capacity utilization, labor-related concerns, and stress on the healthcare

infrastructure.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) hailed the Government of India’s efforts

in handling the pandemic, including fiscal support, support to vulnerable groups,

monetary policy easing, liquidity provision and regulatory policies. The Indian economy

remains one of the high growth economies, and has been steadily recovering from the

impact of the pandemic that began in 2020. The accelerated vaccination efforts leading

to a significant number of citizens being fully vaccinated, is also contributing to the

economic recovery. With an improvement in the economic scenario, there has been an

increase in investments across various sectors of the economy and new opportunities

are emerging. It, however, needs to be emphasized that the core sectors and the SMEs

need continuous capital investments to drive consistent, all-round economic growth. Only then would capacity utilization and

investments in the manufacturing sector improve.

Despite the challenging conditions, all businesses of the Company performed exceedingly well, with the Order Backlog at a record

level. The Company’s business structure is well oriented in meeting the needs of the industry in improving efficiency, quality,

flexibility and speed. With its wide-ranging portfolio, market-oriented organization structure, global technology leadership and

strong local competence, the Company is in a good position to partner with the country in sustainable growth.

Financial Performance – Highlights

For the financial year ended 30th September 2021, the Company received New Orders valued at ` 142,344 million, a 32.4 percent

increase over ` 107,517 million in the financial year ended 30th September 2020. The Order Backlog as of 30th September 2021

stood at ` 135,198 million. Sales (excluding other operating revenues) were up by 33.1 percent to ` 127,559 million, compared

to ` 95,808 million in the previous year.

Profits from Operations stood at ` 12,312 million compared to ` 7,399 million in the previous year. For the year ended

30th September 2021, the Company’s Profit before Tax stood at ` 14,306 million compared to ` 10,206 million in the previous

year, an increase of 40.2 percent. The Profit after Tax for the year was ` 10,627 million, increase by 40.3 percent compared to

` 7,574 million in the previous year. The Board of Directors of the Company has recommended a dividend of ` 8/- per equity

share of the face value of ` 2/- each for the Financial Year ended 30th September 2021. The above financial performance is for

continuing operations.

Business Performance – Highlights

From an operational perspective, the Company continued to focus on health and safety of its people while maintaining

business continuity, meeting customer needs and profitable growth. In addition to introducing innovative solutions and digital

technologies to the market, the Company also placed high emphasis on efficient working capital management.

Among the key highlights during the financial year 2021, the Company received an order from India’s largest shipbuilder

Cochin Shipyard Limited to implement advanced marine solutions for a fleet of boats equipped with electric propulsion and

battery-integrated technology. The Company commissioned India’s first high-voltage direct current link featuring

voltage-sourced converter (VSC) technology for Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID). The Company has also

partnered with POWERGRID to commission Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) solutions at POWERGRID’s substations

at Bikaner, Fatehgarh and Bhadla. The STATCOM will be integrated with voltage-sourced converter (VSC) technology which

offers high economical and technical flexibility through its modular design.

The Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Switch Mobility Automotive Limited to jointly address

need of electric commercial vehicle customers and execute e-mobility projects. The MOU is aimed at delivering efficient,

cost-effective and sustainable e-mobility solutions to various commercial vehicle customers in India. The Company announced

the successful deployment of Smart Metering Technology for over 2,00,000 Smart Meters in North Delhi, together with and

Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited. In the mobility space, the Company provided state-of-the-art automated train technology

systems aimed at improving capacity, punctuality, reliability, and provide enhanced safety for passengers of Bengaluru Metro.

The Company further strengthened its manufacturing footprint in India with the opening of a medium voltage switchgear

factory in Goa. The state-of-the art factory will produce vacuum interrupters, the centerpiece of medium-voltage switch-gear

components.

Dear Member(s),

Sub.: Green Initiative – Electronic mode of service of documents

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) has allowed paperless compliances by companies through electronic mode by

providing the same under the Companies Act, 2013 and rules framed thereunder. The Members can receive various notices and

correspondences including Annual Reports i.e. Audited Financial Statements, Directors’ Report, Auditors’ Report, etc., through

electronic mode (e-mail). The initiative taken by the MCA is a welcome move for the society at large, as this will reduce paper

consumption to a great extent, ensure prompt receipt of communication and avoid loss of document in postal transit.

We are sure that you will whole-heartedly support this initiative for a greener environment and co-operate with the Company

to make it a success. We therefore request you to fill up the E-communication Registration Form below, for registering your

e-mail ID as under:

i)

In respect of shares held in physical form, to the Registrar and Share Transfer Agent (“RTA”), TSR Darashaw Consultants

Private Limited at csg-unit@tcplindia.co.in, or to the Company at Corporate-Secretariat.in@siemens.com; and

ii)

In respect of shares held in demat (electronic) mode, to your respective Depository Participant(s).

Please note that the E-Communication Registration Form should be signed by the sole / first named Member as per the

specimen signature recorded with the RTA. Even after registering for E-communication, the Members are entitled to receive

such communication in physical form, upon request. These documents will also be available on the Company’s website

www.siemens.co.in for your ready reference under the Investor Relations section.

Let’s be part of this ‘Green Initiative’

Thanking You,

Yours faithfully,

For Siemens Limited
