Dear Shareholders,

A warm welcome to you all. I hope all is well with you and

your family. Fy 22 is no less than a roller coaster ride for

all of us. From a deadlier second wave of the Covid-19

pandemic in the first quarter to geo-political conflict in

the last quarter, Fy 22 witnessed many challenges and

turmoil, including restrictions, lockdowns, disruptions

in supply chains, sharp rise in prices of commodities

and building materials, along with a third wave of the

pandemic during early 2022. These hardships and

adversities rattled economies and daily lives of people

across nations and the construction industry was no

exception.

Still, proving our resilience as a country, we unitedly

stood against all odds and made our country one of the

fastest-growing economies in the world. A special thanks

to our frontline forces who have been tirelessly fighting

against this health scare caused by the pandemic,

safeguarding our lives, as the danger still lurks in the

shadows. Their effort and dedication are unparallel and

highly commendable.

Despite the fact that the year was full of difficulties

and uncertainties that forced the industry to constantly

reevaluate its strategies, the infrastructure industry has

seen a decent growth owing to various relief measures

and support extended by the Government under the

Atmanirbhar Bharath Abhiyan. The Government’s aim

to build a nation with top-notch infrastructure has set a

promising panorama of opportunities for the sector and

all its stakeholders.

Over the years, the infrastructure sector has seen a

continuous flow of Government funding, and off late,

the flow of investments by the private sector has been

guarded particularly where revenue (traffic) risk is

involved. However, to realize the Governments’ goal of

timely core infrastructure development in a massive way,

under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), extensive

large-scale investment by the private sector across

sectors is an imperative. To promote more and wide

spread participation by private sector in development

of national highway projects through Build-Operate-

Transfer(BOT)-Toll, Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT), Hybrid

Annuity Mode (HAM) formats, the Government is open

to make changes in the contract conditions, techno-

financial bidding criteria and other terms to make them

more amenable and bankable for private investment,

which is an encouraging step in the right direction.

If we look at the business opportunity landscape for the

Company, greenfield expressways are among high-value

projects that National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)

is focusing on for implementation on both EPC and HAM

modes. Infrastructure sector as a whole would be benefited

by major Government initiatives such as Bharatmala

Pariyojana, Sagarmala, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation &

urban Transformation, Jal Jeevan Mission and the projects

being rolled-out therefrom. For faster implementation

of these projects across the sectors, geographies and

proponents, PM’s Gati Shakti National Master Plan

framework will further act as a helping hand.

The capital budget for key infrastructure components in the

Union Budget 2022-23, increased by 35%, which testified the

Government’s focus and commitment towards infrastructure

development. PM’s Gati Shakti’s National Master Plan, with

its initial financial allocation of ₹ 20,000 Cr, is already on track

to achieve Government’s goal of becoming a uS$ 5 trillion

economy by 2025.

Government’s focus on Jal Jeevan Mission to achieve its

objectives of ‘Har Ghar Pani Ghar Ghar Pani’ and ‘Har Ghar

Nal Se Jal’, will also provide ample opportunities in the

drinking water supply sector across the states where our

Company has already forayed into.

Now, with great pleasure, let me share with all of you,

highlights of our Company’s performance during Fy 2021-22.

The Government’s aim to

build a nation with top-notch

infrastructure has set the path

for a promising future. We

are well-positioned to take

advantage of the prospects

and hold onto our market-

leading position, thanks to our

strong order book, vast industry

experience, and proven expertise.
