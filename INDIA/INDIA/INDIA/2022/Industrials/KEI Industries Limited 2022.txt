Managing Director and Rajeev Gupta, Executive Director (Finance) & CFO

of KEI INDUSTRIES LIMITED to the best of our knowledge and belief, certify that:

A. We have reviewed the, audited Standalone and Consolidated financial results for the year ended on

March 31, 2022 and based on our knowledge and information confirm that:

1)

these statements do not contain any materially untrue statement or omit any material fact or

contain any statements that might be misleading;

2)

these statements together present a true and fair view of the Company’s affairs and are in

compliance with existing accounting standards, applicable laws and regulations;

B.

There are, to the best of their knowledge and belief, no transaction entered into by the listed entity

during the year ended on March 31, 2022 which are fraudulent, illegal or violative listed entity’s code

of conduct.

C. We accept responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal controls for financial reporting and

we have evaluated the effectiveness of internal control systems of the company pertaining to financial

reporting and we have disclosed to the auditors and the audit committee, deficiencies in the design

or operation of such internal controls, if any, of which we are aware and the steps we have taken or

propose to take to rectify these deficiencies.

D. We have indicated to auditors and the audit committee of the Board that there have been:

1)

no significant changes in internal control over the financial reporting during the year;

2)

no significant changes in accounting policies during the year except as disclosed in the notes to

the financial results for the year ended on March 31, 2022 as below:

The Company has changed its accounting policy for valuation of Raw Materials, Finished Goods,

Project Materials and Work in Process from First In First Out (FIFO) to Moving Weighted Average Cost

Method w.e.f. April 01, 2021. The Company believes that this change to moving weighted average

cost method is preferable as it reflects better matching of the actual cost flows with the physical flow

of goods and also improves comparability with Company’s industry peers. Hence, it provides reliable

and more relevant information to the users of financial statements about the Company’s inventory

valuation.

In accordance with Ind AS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, this

change in method of accounting for inventories has been retrospectively applied to all previous years

presented herein. Previous years comparative figures have been adjusted to reflect what results would

have been had the company applied Moving Weighted Average Cost method of inventory valuation

for inventories. The cumulative effect on retained earnings for these changes was ` 3.32 Million at

April 01, 2020. However, due to huge volume of inventory, it is impracticable for the Company to give

impact and figures that what would have been had the company continued to follow the FIFO method

of inventory valuation.

As a result of the change in the company’s accounting policy, financial statements as at March 31,

2020 and March 31, 2021 have been restated.:
