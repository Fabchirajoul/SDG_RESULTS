Dear Shareholders

The fiscal 2021-22 has been a year of

recovery and transition for the Indian

economy. After experiencing the

worst of the pandemic, the gradual

opening of the economy with increasing

vaccination coverage and a further

resumption in businesses activities

helped India gained momentum. Signs

of continued economic revival could

be evidenced in the healthy growth of

indicators like total GST transaction, coal

production, electricity demand etc.

However despite the fast paced

recovery, towards the end of the fiscal,

the economy had been subjected to

external risks. The geopolitical stress

between Russia and Ukraine elevated

oil and commodity prices thereby

exacerbating the already soaring

inflation in India.

Although the headwinds prevail in near

term, India with its ever resilient spirit

is well equipped to mitigate the long

term impacts of the conflict. Through

the budget 2022-23, the government

has enacted structural reforms that

are in line with its long term goals. The

massive ramp up of capital spending

as well as the emphasis on developing

infrastructure will deliver tailwinds

helping India to sustain in the long term.

After being the worst sufferers of

the pandemic, the travel and tourism

industry has finally shown recovery,

with a promising surge in travel in

the second half of fiscal 2021-22. An

increase in vaccine rollout and the

relaxation on inbound and outbound

travel led the Indian travel and tourism

industry to finally be able to overcome

the pandemic induced shock to the

industry. With a soaring hope for travel

industry to quickly come back to

normalcy, the current fiscal is likely to be

a year of travel comprising of Domestic

Travel, Revenge Travel and enhanced

corporate Travel.

The rebound in travel has been more

apparent on the online than in the

offline booking segment. With a wider

adoption of internet usage, there has

been a boost in online ticket booking.

The fiscal 2021-22 showed a further

increased preference of customers

for online bookings with increased

dependence on online travel platforms

and apps. It is the seamlessness online

bookings provided to customers that is

making them their preferred choice. As

we move ahead, I believe, with more

Indians preferring internet for effective

prices and convenient accommodations

and the changing consumer

preferences, we are poised to seize the

multitude of opportunities that lie ahead.

During the year under review,

we registered a strong financial

performance with a total income of

H 1,952.30 crores which increased from

H 861.64 crores in 2020-21. Our EBITDA

stood at H 953.56 crore over

H 272.74 crore in the previous fiscal. Our

PAT grew to H 663.69 crores from

H 187.02 crores in FY 21. Both

EBITDA and PAT ended up at healthy

margins of 48.84% and 34.00%

respectively.

Considering the excellent performance

of the Company, the Directors have

recommended a final dividend of

H 1.50/- per share (H 120 Crores) for

FY 22, subject to approval of

shareholders in the Annual General

Meeting. This is in addition to the

interim dividend of H 2/- per share (H 160

Crores) declared in February 2022 and

paid to shareholders in March 2022.

With this, the total dividend declared by

the Company for FY 22, is H. 3.50/- per

equity share of the face value of

H 2./- each.

Coming to our segment wise highlights

for the year 2021-22, regarding Internet

Ticketing, I am delighted to inform that

an average of 11.44 lakh tickets were

sold daily through IRCTC’s website

and Mobile App, which accounted for

80.43% of the total reserved tickets

booked online on Indian Railways .

The Company touched another

milestone of achieving a record booking

of 15.88 lakh tickets on 21st March,

2022. We also launched full fledged

E-ticket booking through AskDisha

This has helped build a brand presence and recognition which

has helped to connect with new potential customers.

from social media platforms. For a brand, it’s a constant juggle

to produce interactive posts and engage its customers with

the brand. IRCTC posts received a 6,95,936 number of people

news websites, online forums etc. Receiving such significant

number of responses is a huge success in itself showing a

Auditor’s Remarks

Management Reply

Point 1 of

Emphasis of

Matter

We draw attention to Note No.79 regarding

non-recognition of revenue in the financial

years 2020-21 and 2021-22 from the increase

to be made in license fee due to tariff revision

made by the Railway Board in FY 2019-20 as

the exercise regarding sale-assessment, which

will determine the % of increase in license fee, is

still under progress as on date. As the revenue

to be recognised can’t be measured reliably at

this stage, the same has been postponed.

As per the CC-60, due to COVID pandemic sales

assessment could not be done as either the trains were

not running or were running at very less capacity. Hence

income on account of above circular was not booked in

FY 2020-21 and 2021-22.

The sales assessment is under process and the income will

be booked upon the completion of the same.

Point 2 of

Emphasis of

Matter

We draw attention to Note No. 77 regarding

certain applications made by the Company

in previous years for advance ruling relating

to applicability of Goods and Services Tax in

respect of certain income / receipts amounting

to H33,595 Lakhs received mainly from the

Ministry of Railways, Government of India for

which the decision of the Authority for Advance

Ruling is awaited.

The Company has applied for advance ruling for following

issues for which decision of AAR is still awaited:

Reimbursement of Service Charges: The Government of India

through Ministry of Railways, in the public interest had waived

off the service charges from the passengers for booking of

online train tickets through IRCTC's website. The Government

of India has reimbursed consolidated amount of H 8000 lakh,

8800 lakh and 3227 lakh for the 2017-18 , 2018-19 and 2019-

20(up to July-19) respectively. Section 15 (2) of CGST Act 2017,

excludes the amount of reimbursement of expenses received

from the Central Government and State Governments from

the value of taxable supply, hence the amount received from

the Indian Railways being the Central Government towards

the reimbursement of expenses incurred for the providing of

same should not be charged to GST. Therefore no GST was

paid by IRCTC for above reimbursement.

Reimbursement of Travel Insurance: The Government of

India has decided to provide travel insurance on free of

Cost to the passengers who have booked the train ticket

through online to promote digitalization. Accordingly,

IRCTC provided the Insurance free of Cost for which

Ministry of Railway had been reimbursed the travel

insurance of H 47 Cr on which no GST was paid by the

Company being reimbursement of expenses received

from the Central Government.

MDR Received from Acquirer Banks. IRCTC has received

H 300 lakh in FY 2019-20 from Acquirer Banks towards its

share of MDR charges being rate or fee charged on the

merchant service provider. The Company has treated this

payment as subsidy and no GST was paid on the aforesaid

amount, as subsidy received from Central Government and

State Governments shall be excluded from the value of

supply and same shall not form part of consideration for the

purpose of levying GST.:

letter for debtors as well as creditors is

sent to all the parties (Railway as well as Non Railways).

Railway is following cash system of accounting while

IRCTC follows accrual system of accounting and there

is enormous ongoing transaction between IRCTC and

Railways. Regular meetings are being held with Zonal

Railways for reconciliation of Payable/Receivable.

Regarding

response

from

Third

confirmation, parties will be strictly instructed for sending

the Confirmation.

Further, For identification/monitoring of MSME parties, the

necessary fields have been incorporated in Bill Tracking

System (BTS) developed by IT team. The procedure/

system for identification of MSME parties in ERP also under

consideration.

Point 2 (a) of

Report on other

Legal & Regulatory

Requirements

We have sought and obtained all the information

and explanations which to the best of our

knowledge and belief were necessary for the

purposes of our audit except for non-receipt of

balance confirmation letters for amounts due

from / to the Railways, other debtors, creditors

and balances / deposits held with the banks.

Most of the outstanding in respect of trade receivables/

trade payables are related to different Zonal Railways and

Government Entities. Further, the Railway do the accounting

on Cash basis and hence Balances in regard to receivable/

payable can’t be confirmed by Railway on a particular date.

However, for FY 2021-22, the balance confirmation letters

has also been sent to Railways/Government Bodies and

other debtors, creditors as per requirement. Henceforth, In

regard of third party Balance confirmation, parties will also

be strictly instructed for sending the Confirmation.

Point 1(a) of

Annexure-1 to

audit report

The Company has maintained proper records

showing full particulars, including quantitative

details and situation of fixed assets (property,

plant & equipment) except for number-wise

identification of these assets.

The practice of identification number of assets is already

there in IRCTC and all major assets have the identification

number. However, it is found missing on few newly

purchased assets/small assets. The necessary instructions

in this regard to follow the same continuously, is being

issued to all zonal offices of IRCTC.:

letter for debtors as well as

creditors is sent to all the parties (Railway as well as Non

Railways).

Railway is following cash system of accounting while

IRCTC follows accrual system of accounting and there

is enormous ongoing transaction between IRCTC and

Railways. Regular meetings are being held with Zonal

Railways for reconciliation of Payable/Receivable.

Manual controls are followed instead of

system-based automated controls, checks and

3rd party applications / portals are posted

manually in ERP by compiling data through

Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that

are relevant to our audit of the financial Statements under the

with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe

that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and

appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the

Standalone Financial Statements.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to:

1.

Note No.79 regarding non-recognitionof revenue in the

financial years2020-21 and 2021-22 from the increase to

be made in license fee due to tariff revision made by the

Railway Boardin FY 2019-20as theexercise regardingsale-

assessment,which will determine the % of increase in

license fee, is still under progress as on date. As the

revenue to be recognised can’t be measured reliably at

this stage, the same has been postponed.

2.

Note No. 77 regarding certain applications made by the

Company in previous years for advance ruling relating to

applicability of Goods and Services Tax in respect of certain

with Govt. authorities under Other Current Assets.

4.

Letter dated 20.07.2021, has raised the issue of Railway Share and asked the Company to pay

Railway Share of all the Rail Neer Plants in accordance with the MoU dt. 19.01.2007.

In response to: letter dt. 20.07.2021, Company has represented on the same ground as done in past. However, the Railway

Board has not accepted the contention of the Company and advised to share 15% of profit for Departmental plants and 40%

revenue share in terms of Catering Policy 2017 for PPP plants being run by licensees vide letter dt. 30.09.2021

The Company has now agreed to share 15% profit for all the plants including PPP plants and informed Railway Board vide letter

dated 24.02.2022 and paid dues amounting to H2713.32 Lakhs which was accepted by Railway Board subject to reconciliation.

However, the Company contended that PPP Plants are not run on licensee model as these plants are set up by IRCTC and sale

of Rail Neer takes place on the invoices of IRCTC only.

Accordingly, Company has booked expenses for an amount of H2713.32 Lakhs as Railway share on Railneer plants up to

31.3.2021 and classified it as an “Exceptional Item” in the statement of Profit & Loss for the year ended March 31, 2022. No

Provision for Railway share for the Financial Year 2021-22 is required in the books as the Railneer Segment shows loss for the

current year after charging above payment of H2713.32 Lakhs against the profits of Railneer segment.

Note :- 55 Capital Advances For Flats & Land

The following amounts were paid for Purchase/construction of flats and land which are still pending as on date:-

Note :- 76 Tejas and Mahakal Express trains:

Railway Board had mandated IRCTC to operate 02 rakes of Tejas trains and 01 rake of Kashi Mahakal express trains as passenger

trains to provide passenger with an option of travelling in premium segment private trains. IRCTC has inaugurated both the trains on

4th Oct, 2019 and 17th Jan,2020 on the sector Lucknow –New Delhi-Lucknow and Admedabad –Mumbai-Ahmedabad respectively.

In the financial year 2020-21, both Tejas trains have been run from the month of October, 2020 and stopped due to the COVID -19

pandemic and suspension of passenger's trains services. The representations have been made to Railway Board for waiver of fixed

commitments against both Tejas and Kashi Mahakal trains for the non operational period during the financial year 2020-21 due to

present pandemic. Railway Board vide letter no TC-II/2910/20/Trains dated 11.5.2021 has only agreed to waive off the component

of "loss of paths to Good trains" in calculation and charging of fixed cost for IRCTC passenger trains for non –operational period

up to 31.12.2020 and has decided that other charges applicable will remain the same. IRCTC has again requested Railway Board to

reconsider waiving off the fixed charges (fixed haulage and Custody charges) amounting to H2793 Lakhs for non-operational period

of the three trains considering it as a force majeure situation , as the lockdown and restriction imposed by Government of India due

to COVID-19 pandemic was beyond control of IRCTC. However, IRCTC has made full provision for the fixed charges for both the

Tejas trains and Kashi Mahakal express trains train in the Financial Year 2020-21. The matter is pending.

Note :- 77 The Company has applied for advance ruling for following issues for which decision of AAR

is still awaited:

1.

Reimbursement of Service Charges: The Government of India through Ministry of Railways, in the public interest had waived

off the service charges from the passengers for booking of online train tickets through IRCTC's website. The Government of

India has reimbursed consolidated amount of H8000 lakh, 8800 Lakhs and 3227 Lakhs for the 2017-18 , 2018-19 and 2019-20(up

to July-19) respectively. Section 15 (2) of CGST Act 2017, excludes the amount of reimbursement of expenses received from

the Central Government and State Governments from the value of taxable supply, hence the amount received from the Indian

Railways being the Central Government towards the reimbursement of expenses incurred for the providing of same should not

be charged to GST. Therefore no GST was paid by IRCTC for above reimbursement.

2.

Reimbursement of Travel Insurance: The Government of India has decided to provide travel insurance on free of Cost to

the passengers who have booked the train ticket through online to promote digitalization. Accordingly, IRCTC provided the

Insurance free of Cost for which Ministry of Railway had been reimbursed the travel insurance of H4700 Lakhs on which no GST

was paid by the Company being reimbursement of expenses received from the Central Government.
