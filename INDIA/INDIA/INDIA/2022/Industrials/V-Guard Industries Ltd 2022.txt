letter from the proposed auditors to act as the Statutory Auditors

of the Company, in accordance with the provisions of Section 139 and Section 141 of the Companies Act, 2013 and the

Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014.

Accordingly, consent of the members is being sought for passing an Ordinary Resolution as set out at Item No. 4 of the

Notice for appointment of M/s. Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP as Statutory Auditors of the Company for

a period of 5 (Five) years and authorize the Board to fix the terms and conditions of appointment, remuneration etc.,

based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee.:

Managing Director and

Whole-time Director(s) is expected to exceed 11% of the net profits of the Company and the remuneration payable to

him in the said financial years may also exceed the limit of 5% of the net profits of the Company.

The employee stock compensation expenses relating to the options vested had been taken into the Statement of Profit

and Loss in the respective years of vesting and there will not be any impact neither on the profits nor on the cashflow

for the financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24 on account of increase in the overall managerial remuneration.

Accordingly, based on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors in

their meeting held on May 19, 2022 considered the proposal to increase the overall limit of managerial remuneration

payable from 11% to 15% of the net profits of the Company calculated as per Section 198 of the Act and increase the

limit of the remuneration payable to Mr. Ramachandran V, in excess of 5% of the net profits of the Company, for the

financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24.

Considering the unpredictable business environment, your Directors submit that the increase in the overall limit

of managerial remuneration and the limit of remuneration payable to Mr. Ramachandran V, Whole-time Director is

proposed by your Board mainly to facilitate exercise of options vested to him out of the stock options granted during

the year 2016 which will lapse in the coming financial years, if not exercised and the Board do not intend to provide

any undue remuneration to the Whole-time Director.

Your Directors recommend the Ordinary and Special Resolutions set out at item nos. 6 and 7 of the Notice of the AGM

respectively to the members for their approval.

Except Mr. Ramachandran V, Director, and his relatives, no other Director and Key Managerial Personnel of the Company

including their relatives are interested or concerned, financially or otherwise, in the resolutions set out at item nos.6

and 7 of the accompanying notice.
