Performance and Outlook

The Company’s performance during the Financial Year 2021-22 (FY 21-22) on a standalone basis improved substantially as

compared to the previous financial year (FY 20-21) with all three segments viz. ‘Freight Rolling Stock’, ‘Passenger Rolling

Stock’ and ‘Shipbuilding, Bridges and Defence’ (‘SBD’) recording noteworthy increase in revenue, as explained further in

‘Segment Review’ under the section ‘Management Discussion and Analysis’ herein below. All the key performance factors

improved remarkably with the total income being higher by 44.40%; the EBIDTA went up from Rs. 13065.44 lakhs in FY 20-

21 to Rs. 18168.33 lakhs in FY 21-22: an increase of 39.06% and Profit after tax, from Rs. 5027.56 lakhs in FY 20-21 to Rs.

7940.62 lakhs in FY 21-22 was up by 57.94%.

On a consolidated basis, the Group’s total income increased from Rs. 154549.87 lakhs in FY 20-21 to Rs. 196662.75 lakhs

in FY 21-22 i.e. an increase of 27.25%; the EBIDTA from Rs. 10549.64 lakhs in FY 20-21 to Rs. 16875.94 lakhs in FY 21-22

recorded an increase of 59.97% and Loss after tax for FY 21-22 reduced systematically to a level of Rs. 68.55 Lakhs as

compared to Rs. 1878.65 Lakhs in FY 20-21, being an improvement of 96.35%.

The financial performance during FY 20-21 having been impacted due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the lockdown

announced by the Governments as a measure to combat the pandemic in the countries where the Group operates

notwithstanding, the improvement in the performance for the year under review is commendable since the impact of COVID-

19 pandemic was felt during FY 21-22 as well, more particularly in the first half, however, the macro-economic scenario has

improved this year and the demand remained strong as the entire value chain gradually returned to normal.:

letter of acceptance for

an order for manufacture and supply of 24,177 Wagons from IR valued at over Rs. 7,800 crore (approx.) which is

required to be executed over a period of 39 months. The Company possesses the necessary infrastructure and capacity

to supply the Wagons against this order, however, further augmenting of its facilities to optimise production costs and

efficiencies has been initiated. With the pace at which the IR is modernising and upgrading its network, the demand for

wagons is expected to remain buoyant in the coming years.

Under the Passenger Rolling Stock segment of the Company, the execution of Pune Metro project is a very important

milestone for the Company. The Company along with its subsidiary: TFA, had signed the first contract for design,

manufacture and supply of 34 trains of 3 coaches each for Pune Metro (Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited).

Under this contract, the first 3 trains are to be built in TFA’s plant in Caserta, Italy and the balance 31 trains will be

manufactured in the Company’s plant in India.

The execution of the Pune Metro project is on schedule and the production at the Plant at Uttarpara, West Bengal is in

full swing and expected to be completed within FY 2022-23. During FY 2021-22, significant milestones pertaining to this

Project were achieved viz. flag- off of the first train manufactured for Pune Metro from Italy on 30th July, 2021; inauguration

of the first aluminium coach designed and manufactured by the Company for Pune Metro by the Hon’ble Prime Minister

Shri Narendra Modi on 6th March, 2022, when he also bought a ticket from the kiosk from an app on his mobile and took

a ten-minute ride from Garware Station to Anand Nagar Station in Pune; and the dispatch of the first metro coach

produced in India for Pune metro from the Company’s factory in Uttarpara, West Bengal, which was flagged-off by

Hon’ble Shri Manoj Joshi, IAS, Secretary - Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs Government of India. The Company is

planning to bid for upcoming metro projects in Tier I and Tier II cities based on its award of Pune Metro order.

“Make in India” initiative coupled with launch of Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC), metro projects across all major

Indian cities are expected to boost wagon and electrical train manufacturing industry in the country and the DFC

wagons are expected to contribute significantly to the Company’s revenues in future.

The Company had earlier collaborated with ABB India Limited (ABB) to work together to design, develop and manufacture

state of the art 3 phase IGBT based propulsion systems for EMU/MEMU being manufactured in Titagarh’s plant at

Uttarpara, West Bengal, with certain components being supplied by ABB. In addition to a good market potential for the

propulsion business, such business alliance is also very strategic for train production business. In the propulsion

tenders, your Company is well placed and is expecting additional orders. While the trial production of the traction

motors and the traction converters has already commenced at the Company’s facilities, the regular production is expected

to start within FY 2022-23, which would be a very important milestone as it would move the Company into a high

technology area of propulsion electronics.:

letter dated 14th December, 2021 from Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National

Stock Exchange (NSE) regarding non-submission of the financial results for the quarter and half year ended 30th

September, 2021 (‘Results’) till the date of such email/: letter, which was a non-compliance of Regulation 33 of SEBI

(LODR) Regulations, 2015, advising the Company to pay the respective applicable fine of Rs. 1,45,000/- plus GST@18%

to each Stock Exchange. The Company paid the said fine under protest to BSE and NSE and requested them to waive

the fine levied and refund the amount paid on the grounds that, as was already communicated to the respective Stock

Exchanges, the delay in submission of the Results was due to reasons beyond the control of the Company. The Company

had earlier sought additional time for preparation/finalization of the Results, since its subsidiary, Titagarh Firema S.p.A.,

Italy, on an entirely unavoidable ground, was awaiting the sanction of one-time debt restructuring by its Banker in

accordance with the applicable regulations of their local Government for a situation having arisen out of the pandemic,

and had requested for additional time to provide its quarterly and half yearly results which have to be consolidated with

the Results of the Company. Further, the Company received another letter dated 30th December, 2021 from NSE

levying the fine of Rs. 190,000/- + GST@18% for delay in submission of the said Results by 38 days from its due date

(i.e. Rs. 5,000 per day/fine amount). Since the Company had earlier paid the fine levied for 29 days, the differential

amount of Rs. 45,000/- + GST@18% was paid by the Company to NSE on 5th January, 2022.

BSE and NSE regarding non-submission of the financial results for

the quarter and half year ended 30th September, 2021 (‘Results’) till

the date of such email/letter, which was a non-compliance of

Regulation 33 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, advising the

Company to pay the respective applicable fine of Rs. 1,45,000/- plus

GST@18% to each Stock Exchange. The Company paid the said

fine under protest to BSE and NSE and requested them to waive the

fine levied and refund the amount paid on the grounds that, as was

already communicated to the respective Stock Exchanges, the delay

in submission of the Results was due to reasons beyond the control

of the Company. The Company had earlier sought additional time for

preparation/finalization of the results, since its subsidiary, Titagarh

Firema S.p.A., Italy, on an entirely unavoidable ground, was awaiting

the sanction of one-time debt restructuring by its Banker in accordance

with the applicable regulations of their local government for a situation

having arisen out of the pandemic and had requested for additional

time to provide its quarterly and half yearly results which have to be

consolidated with the Results of the Company.

Further, the Company received another letter dated 30th December,

2021 from NSE levying the fine of Rs. 190,000/- + GST@18% for

delay in submission of the said Results by 38 days from its due date

(i.e. Rs. 5000 per day/fine amount). Since the Company had earlier

paid the fine levied for 29 days, the differential amount of Rs. 45,000/

The observations/ remarks of the Company are the same as

mentioned above in the matter regarding delay in submission of

financial results for the quarter/year ended 31st March, 2020, i.e. the

delay was due to a reason beyond the Company’s control i.e. time

taken in passing the final order by the Hon'ble National Company

Law Tribunal sanctioning the Scheme of Amalgamation of two

subsidiaries with the Company from the Appointed Date i.e. 1st April,

2019. In view of the same, the Company had requested BSE and

NSE not to take any consequential action in that regard.

The aforesaid Scheme of Amalgamation was sanctioned on 30th

September, 2020 and the Company submitted the Results for the

Quarter/Year ended 31st March 2020 and the Quarter ended 30th

June, 2020 to the Stock Exchanges on 8th October, 2020 and 14th

October, 2020 respectively.

BSE by an email dated 27th July, 2021 informed that the Company

was liable to a basic fine of Rs. 1,45,000/- plus GST@18% for the

delayed submission of Results for the Quarter ended 30th June 2020,

however

the Company’s representation for waiver of fine was placed before

its relevant Committee and after considering the facts of the case,

the written submissions made by the company, the Committee

decided to partially accede to the request for waiver of fines and

advised the Company to pay a basic fine of Rs. 70,000/- plus

GST@18%, which was paid by the Company.

On 19th March, 2021, the Company received a letter from NSE which

mentioned that the Company’s representations for waiver of fine for

delay in submission of financial results for the quarter ended 30th

June, 2020 was placed before the Relevant Authority of the Exchange

and the Company’s request for waiver of fine was not considered

favourably and therefore demanded fine. The Company paid the said

fine to NSE on 10th May, 2021 and informed NSE by its letter dated

11th May, 2021 that although the Company had stated favorable/

genuine grounds to waive off the fines but to avoid any stricter action

of NSE, the Company has paid the stated amount ‘under protest’

and requested to waive off the fines levied & refund the amount paid

to the Company at the earliest. The response from NSE is still awaited.
