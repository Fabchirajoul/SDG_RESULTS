Notes:

(i)

Most of the issues of litigation pertaining to Central Excise/Service tax/Income tax (including transfer pricing matters) are

based on interpretation of the respective law & rules thereunder. Management has been opined by its counsel that many of

the issues raised by revenue will not be sustainable in law as they are covered by judgements of respective judicial authorities

which supports its contention. Further, in several matters, the management has successfully defended their case at lower

forums of adjudication. Accordingly, the management do not envisage any material impact on the standalone financials

statements of the Company.

(ii) Sales tax/VAT related litigation/demand primarily pertains to non submission of required declaration forms in time due to

non-receipt of the same from customers and/or some interpretation related issues. However in most of the cases, required

documents are being filed and minor impact if any, shall be given in the year of final outcome of respective matter in appeal.

(iii) The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‚ÄòCode‚Äô) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-employment benefits

received Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. However, the date on

which the Code will come into effect has not been notified. The Company will assess the impact of the Code when it comes

into effect and will record any related impact in the year the Code becomes effective.

(i)

Most of the issues of litigation pertaining to Central Excise/Service tax/Income tax (including transfer pricing matters) are

based on interpretation of the respective law & rules thereunder. Management has been opined by its counsel that many of

the issues raised by revenue will not be sustainable in law as they are covered by judgements of respective judicial authorities

which supports its contention. Further, in several matters, the management has successfully defended their case at lower

forums of adjudication. Accordingly, the management do not envisage any material impact on the consolidated financial

statements of the Group.

(ii) Sales tax/VAT related litigation/demand primarily pertains to non submission of required declaration forms in time due to

non-receipt of the same from customers and/or some interpretation related issues. However in most of the cases, required

documents are being filed and minor impact if any, shall be given in the year of final outcome of respective matter in appeal.

(iii) The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‚ÄòCode‚Äô) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-employment benefits

received Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. However, the date on

which the Code will come into effect has not been notified. The Group will assess the impact of the Code when it comes into

effect and will record any related impact in the period the Code becomes effective.
