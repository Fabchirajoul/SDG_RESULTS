2. Composition of CSR Committee

The Corporate Social Responsibility & Sustainable Development

(CSR & SD) Committee of the Board recommends the CSR

projects from time to time for the approval of the Board. The

immediate past Independent Directors of CSL vacated their

office with effect from July 15, 2020 on completion of tenure

of their appointment prescribed by the Government of India.

Therefore, due to the non-appointment of Independent

Directors by the Government of India, CSL could not re-constitute

the Committee with effect from July 15, 2020 till December 19,

2021. In the absence of CSR & SD Committee, CSR proposals were

considered directly by the Board based on the recommendations

of below Board level CSR Executive Committee. However, CSR

& SD Committee was re-constituted with effect from December

20, 2021, on account of appointment of Independent Directors

on the Board of the Company. The Composition of the CSR & SD

Committee as on March 31, 2022 is given below:
