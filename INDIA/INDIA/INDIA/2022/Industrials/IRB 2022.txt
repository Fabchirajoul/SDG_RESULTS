Dear Stakeholders,

After successfully steering through the unprecedented

pandemic, IRB group is now looking forward to a robust

growth phase. While the pandemic brought uncertainties

and unforeseen challenges for the business, we also

encountered good growth opportunities during this

period, which we successfully lapped up in spite of the

challenges. The Mumbai–Pune TOT was one of our

largest wins of the year. The constraints at that time led to

increased leverage levels for funding such opportunities

and maintaining cashflows during such a period.

As a prudent practice, we have always worked on keeping

leverage in check and hence – as we were getting out of

the pandemic and seeing growth opportunities coming

back – we decided to address both – i.e., bring leverage

down and have growth capital ready to encash upon the

opportunities that were in the offing.

We firmly believe that this

sustainable growth model will take

the company into a completely

uncharted territory of value creation,

where we will attempt to achieve

both – adding growth opportunities

and simultaneously releasing

cashflows for shareholders, which

is unheard of in the Infrastructure

segment.

Financial Analysis

3.1 BOT Assets

As is the norm for financing highway BOT projects,

debt funds from project lenders are the major source of

funding. The project lenders have reposed trust in the

Company’s financial strength, demonstrated by healthy

growth in internal accruals and net worth. Besides, they

have also shown faith in the Company’s project execution

capabilities. This trust of the project lenders has played a

primary role in helping IRB achieve the required financial

closures.

IRB invested in projects that were under construction

and are now in operation. With this, it has augmented

capacity to invest in new projects that may be secured on

a diligent evaluation of their risks and commercial viability.

Internal accruals were robust even after providing for debt

repayments post impact of COVID-19.

The total consolidated income for FY22 stood at ` 63,554

million as against ` 54,875 million in FY21 registering a

growth of 16%. The consolidated toll revenues for FY22

has increased to ` 17,875 million from ` 15,594 million

FY21 registering a growth of 15%. The consolidated

construction revenues for FY22 has increased to ` 40,162

million as against ` 37,392 million in FY21 registering a

growth of 7%.

EBITDA for FY22 increased to ` 33,492 million from

` 27,016 million in FY21 registering a growth of 24%.

Interest costs has increased to ` 18,904 million in FY22

from ` 16,924 million in FY21 increased by 12%.

Depreciation has increase to ` 6,828 million in FY22 as

against ` 5,817 million in FY20 increased by 17%.

PBT excluding extraordinary income has increased to

` 7,759 million in FY22 from ` 4,274 million in FY21,

registering a growth by 82%.:
