Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to present to you the performance of your

th

Company during the 57 year of its service to the Nation.

Financial Year 2021-22 has been one of recovery and resilience for the

global economy. Boosted by a rapid vaccination drive, resumption of

economic activities and accelerated adoption of technological tools,

the world gradually emerged from the shadows of the COVID-19 crisis.

India as a nation has displayed the ability to not only overcome the

pandemic but is also growing despite the geo political situations and

facing the challenges with considerable effectiveness. This is due to its

robust economic fundamentals, strong domestic consumption and the

government’s focus on boosting capital expenditure and private

investment through various initiatives like the PM Gati Shakti,

Production Linked Incentive Schemes and Make In India, among others.

The focus on self-reliance, building resilient supply chains and

promoting ease of doing business will lay a firm foundation for future

growth and transform India into a global hub for various economic

sectors, including the crucial hydrocarbons sector and allied industries.:
