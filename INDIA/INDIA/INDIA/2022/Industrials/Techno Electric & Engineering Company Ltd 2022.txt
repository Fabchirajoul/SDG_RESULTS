Managing Director’s

Perspective: Dear Shareholders,

I would like to start this letter by expressing

my deepest gratitude for your continued

faith in the Company. It gives me great

pleasure to report that we delivered a

strong performance in FY2021-22 despite

multiple waves of the pandemic, rising

inflation, and high commodity prices. Our

strong fundamentals, operational expertise,

strong track record execution and prudent

strategic decisions helped us to weather the

external challenges.

OPPORTUNITIES IN AN EVOLVING

ENERGY LANDSCAPE

With rising climate change concerns, the

transition to clean energy has accelerated

in recent years. Countries across the globe

have been setting aggressive targets and

implementing various policy measures for the

adoption of sustainable energy systems to

secure their future energy needs, and India is

no exception.

The power sector in India is one of the most

diverse in the world, with power sources

ranging from fossil fuels such as coal, lignite,

gas, and diesel to non-fossil fuels such as

hydro, solar, wind, nuclear power, and so

on. Over the years, the Indian government

has implemented a slew of emission-cutting

measures, such as increasing the share of

renewable energy sources and installing

air pollution control systems for thermal

power plants.

As per emission norms, coal-fired thermal

power plants aggregating more than

150 GW, need to limit their sulphur and

nitrogen emissions (SO2 and NOx) by

installing Flue Gas Sulphurisation (FGD)

systems by December 2024. Further, India

continues to invest in renewable power

and related transmission infrastructure and

energy storage infrastructure. At COP26,

our honourable Prime Minister announced

to install 500 GW capacity of renewable

energy sources by 2030. This will require 25

to 30 GW of energy storage solutions at grid

level. Gradually, India’s energy mix has been

shifting from fuel-based to non-fuel-based

energy sources, offering new opportunities

for sustainable energy systems.

Apart from the shift in power generation

trends, India has also focused on developing

smart grids for cost-effective and efficient

power transmission and distribution. Towards

this, the government implemented multiple

policy measures, including replacement

ROBUST PERFORMANCE

In FY 2021-22, our revenue from operations

grew by 21% to ₹10,739 million from

₹8,892-million in the previous year. Profit

After Tax (PAT) for the year increased by 45%

to ₹2,639 million from ₹1,818 million in the

previous year. EBITDA for the Company stood

at ₹2,222 million compared to ₹2,161 million,

up by 3%. We experienced some pressure in

the EBITDA margins due to prevailing inflation

and high commodity prices cycle and also

higher overseas rate.

of the conventional metres with Advanced

Metering Infrastructures (AMIs), known as

smart metres.

LEVERAGING OPPORTUNITIES TO FAST-

TRACK GROWTH

With our decades long experience in the power

infrastructure sector, strong engineering

capabilities, continuous technology adoption

with track record of project execution, we are

well-positioned to capitalise on the evolving

opportunities while also powering the nation’s

energy transformation journey.

Increased focus on FGD segment: As

India strives to cut emission through FGD

implementation, we expect strong growth

from this segment. Over the past couple of

years, we have made significant progress

by installing FGDs for CPSUs and SEBs. In

coming years, we anticipate more business

from SEBs and private sector for FGD

installation. During FY 2022-23, we received

two orders worth ₹1,455 crores which were L1

last year. This level of business will continue

for the next three to four years as India has yet

to install 80 GW of FGD systems.

Steady Growth from AMI Segment: We

see tremendous opportunities in the smart

metering segment as India plans to install

around 250 million smart meters by 2025

Accelerating

growth with

sustainability

I am confident that our

strategic measures backed by

our strong fundamentals will

help us accelerate growth.

We will continue to adopt new

technologies, ensure timely

execution and delivery, and

be at the forefront of industry

innovation.
