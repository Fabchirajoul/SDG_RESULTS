letter of 03.05.2018 had

proposed for change of alignment i.e. through Kalyani

Expressway. Ministry of Railways (CRB) had responded

this proposal by writing to Chief Secretary, GoWB that

under such a situation, it will become a new project

requiring fresh sanction. RVNL, on its part, had requested

State Government vide: letter dated 19.11.2018 to lay a

new pipeline through another alignment for which RVNL

would bear the cost. Vide a recent letter dated 05.05.2022

State Govt. asked for a additional pipe line of 90" dia. at

project cost in lieu of closing 60", 48", 42" pipe lines on

BT Road. Work onthis phase of the Metro corridor could

not be initiated due to above account.

New Garia-Airport Metro Corridor

3.11.5.In the section of New Garia to Rabindra Tirtha of

Dum Dum Airport-New Garia project, initially 4 packages

of Viaduct were awarded on 21.10.2011. About 17 km

viaduct has been completed. The contracts for 21

stations (3 packages) were awarded on 05.03.2014. Out

of 21 stations, station land for one (Technopolis Metro

station) is just handed over. For construction of stations,

6481 piles, 813 pile caps, 789 piers & 677 pier caps

have been cast. The project got delayed because of

issues relating to land acquisition, traffic diversion, utility

diversion and other permission over busy EM Bypass

road. Further, change of alignment proposed by State

Government where unauthorized buildings were

constructed even after the Gazette Notification for Metro

construction, and other impediments like shifting of

markets, traffic guard, raising of 220 KV overhead line,

removal of encroachments, etc. slowed down the

progress of work. Substantial part of these impediments

have been either removed and the balance are on the

way of being removed. The alignment from City Centre-

II to Airport is now approved by State Government after

long persuasion and contract for construction of Metro

beyond Titumir to Airport has been awarded on

18.01.2021, The work is under progress.In this section

the commissioning will be in 3 phase i.e (a)Ph-I-New

Fair Value Measurement

Company measures financial instruments at fair value at

each reporting date. Fair value is the price that would be

received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in

an orderly transaction between market participants at

the measurement date. The fair value measurement is

based on the presumption that the transaction to sell

the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

•

in the principal market for the asset or liability or

•

in the absence of a principal market in the most

advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must be

accessible to the company. The fair value of an asset or

a liability is measured using the assumptions that market

participants would use when pricing the asset or liability

assuming that market participants act in their economic

best interest. The company uses valuation techniques

that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which

sufficient data are available to measure fair value

maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and

minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.
