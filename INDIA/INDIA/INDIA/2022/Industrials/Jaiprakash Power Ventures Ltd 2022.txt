Date: 29th April, 2022

DECLARATION BY THE: MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO AS PER REGULATION 34 OF THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA (LISTING OBLIGATIONS AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS)REGULATIONS, 2015

I hereby confirm that the Members of Board of

letter dated 30.05.2018

has decided that such costs shall be considered for being

made pass through in tariff by Regulatory Commission in

accordance with the law.

•

To encourage increased purchase of Power, following

measures have been taken:

o

Power For All (PFA) initiative with States and UTs

for bringing uninterrupted supply of quality power

to each household, industry, commercial business,

small & medium enterprises, etc. In this respect,

the Govt of India has launched a scheme named

SAUBHAGYA – Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar

Yojana to provide last mile connectivity in rural and

urban areas.

o

Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) for

strengthening of sub-transmission and distribution

networks in the urban areas; Metering of distribution

transformers / feeders / consumers in the urban

areas and IT enablement of distribution sector.

o

Augmenting Transmission capacity to remove

transmission constraints.

o

Flexibility in utilization of domestic coal for reducing

the cost of power generation.

•

The Indian Railways also plans to introduce 16,000 km of

new lines, besides the doubling the existing lines of 6,900

km. This would be a key supply driver of coal in the next

decade.

•

Make in India: This initiative, which aims to boost

manufacturing’s share of GDP from 16% to 25% by

2022, would also lead to substantial growth in electricity

demand.

•

Reduction of aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C)

losses: Programs for reduction of AT&C losses like Ujwal

DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), Integrated Power

Development Scheme (IPDS) and Deendayal Upadhyaya

Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) have been implemented

by the Government. The Revamped Distributed Sector

Scheme launched by MoP aims to reduce AT&C losses

ot PAN India level of 12% to 15% by 2024-25.

•

Demand-side management (DSM), energy conservation

and efficiency improvement programmes: Programmes

for DSM, improvement of energy efficiency and energy

conservation measures like standards and labelling,

the Perform-Achieve-Trade (PAT) scheme in industries,

energy-efficient lighting solutions and the Super-Efficient

Equipment Programme would reduce power demand.

The Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced

the Union Budget for 2022-23 under the Narendra

Modi government. Among other things, the Budget has

introduced a slew of reforms and initiatives for the energy

and power sector. Here we take a brief look at them:

(i)

Co-firing of five to seven per cent biomass pellets

in thermal power plants has been proposed by

Union Minister that will result in CO2 savings of 38

MMT annually. This will also provide extra income

to farmers and job opportunities to locals and help

avoid stubble burning in agriculture fields.

(ii) Four pilot projects for coal gasification and conversion

of coal into chemicals required for the industry have

also been proposed to evolve technical and financial

viability.

(iii) Energy efficiency and saving measures through

setting up of Energy Service Company (ESCO)

business model in large commercial buildings will

also facilitate capacity building and awareness for

energy audits, performance contracts, and common

measurement & verification protocol.

(iv) Considering the constraint of space in urban

areas for setting up charging stations at scale, a

battery swapping policy will be brought out and:

a run of the river scheme, shall utilize the flowing water of the river to generate

electricity. Such right to utilize water available upstream of the project are granted by

JPVL had executed Bulk Power Transmission Agreement for long term

open access (LTOA) with Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (PGCIL) for

transmission of power from Nigrie STPP (JNSTPP) and Bina TPP (JBTPP).

Due to cancelation of coal mines & after re bidding of coal mines which

allowed usage of 85% of coal for Long term PPAs only in respect of JNSTPP.

As per change in coal policy, FSAs were entered for the quantity of coal

to the extent required for generation of power for supplying to DISCOMs

under long term PPA in respect of Bina TPP. There was no assured supply

of coal for the capacities of Plants and these events have resulted in

material change in sale of power of the Nigrie STPP and Bina TPP.JPVL had

requested PGCIL for relinquishing of LTOA in respect of Bina TPP and Nigrie

STPP for the part of sale of power without any payments because of force

majeure events i.e cancelation of coal mines and change in coal policy.

As per the regulations, if LTOA is surrendered/relinquished, relinquishment

charges has to be paid. Petitions was filed with CERC that LTA granted

to JNSTPP and JBTPP may please be kept in abeyance /surrender/

relinquished without any payment. CERC had not accepted our application.

PGCIL has sent intimation for recovery of dues of Rs 10,112 lakhs

(previous year Rs. 10,112 lakhs) & Rs 1,037 lakhs (Rs. 1,037 lakhs)

for JNSTPP & JBTPP including transmission charges of Rs. 8,139

lakhs (previous year Rs. 8,139 lakhs) & Rs 169 lakhs (Rs. 169 lakhs)

respectively for from the date of effectiveness to date of relinquishment.

Appeals filed against the Order of CERC with APTEL, which are under

process. An appeal against the said demand had also been filed by the

Association of Power Producers (JPVL as member) against the above said

demand with APTEL and next date of hearing is 03.08.2022

g(i)

In Sangam Power Generation Company Ltd (SPGCL), the Income Tax

Authority had demanded Income Tax on Interest Income for the assessment

year 2011-12 and 2012-13 and the case was decided in favour of the

Income Tax Department in the Hon’ble High Court of Lucknow. Further the

company decided not to file appeal against the order in the higher court.

Accordingly, the Company had accounted provision for Income Tax and

Interest thereon amounting to Rs. 645.92 Lakhs and Rs. 67.15 Lakhs

respectively as per order passed by the assessing authority.

g(ii)

In Sangam Power Generation Company Ltd (SPGCL), The Uttar Pradesh

Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) vide: letter dated March 05, 2019

issued preliminary default notice under Article 14 read with Article 4.6 of

the Power Purchase Agreement and demanded certain compensation, as

liquidated damages. However, the company vide it's letter dated March 14,

2019, refuted that no claims lies in favour of UPPCL/Procurer(s) as UPPCL/

Procurer(s) have admittedly defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under the

RFQ/RFP/PPA, by not handling over the possession of the requisite land to

SPGCL without any encumbrances. The company denied each and every

allegation made and the claims placed for the LDs being untenable under

law.

Note 47

Disputed Green Energy Cess & Water Tax (Vishnuprayag HEP)

Company has not made the provision amounting to Rs. 10,770 Lakhs (Previous

year Rs.9,204 Lakhs) and Rs. 4,671 Lakhs (Previous year Rs. 3,966 Lakhs) of

Green Energy Cess and Water Tax respectively against the demand and an appeal

filed before The Hon’ble High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital which has granted

stay in January, 2017. Subsequently in February'2021, in case of wate cess, Hon'ble

High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital passed a common Order against the Company

throught a common judgement for all petitioners against which a special appeal

has been filed in March,2021 before division bench headed by Honible Chief Justice

of Hon'ble High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital and stay has been granted against

the Order passed in February,2021 for Water cess.Currently matters are pending

in the Hon’ble High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital. The Management is confident

that no demand will be crystallized due to the amended implementation agreement

dated 22nd March, 2003 in which it has mentioned that Vishnuprayag HEP, being

a run of the river scheme, shall utilize the flowing water of the river to generate

electricity. Such right to utilize water available upstream of the project are granted by

Government of Uttaranchal for non-consumptive use without charging any royalty,

duty, cess or levy of any kind.

Note 48

In the earlier years, Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd. (UPPCL) had sent notice/

recovery plan in respect of unit VHEP for recovery of Rs. 39,970 lakhs (including

carrying cost of Rs. 2916 lakhs for year ended 31st March,2022 and Rs 8,193

lakhs for the financial year 2018-19 to 2020-21) (as at 31.03.2021 Rs. 37,054

lakhs) being amount excess paid to the Company as assessed and estimated by

the UPPCL on account of carrying cost (excess payment made to the Company

towards income tax and secondary energy charges for financial years 2007-08 to

2019-20 and 2014-15 to 2019-20 respectively) and hold back Rs. 16,044 Lakhs

till March’22 (up to March’21 Rs. 9,140 Lakhs) including recovery for carrying

cost of Rs 11,109 lakhs (upto March’21 Rs. 8,193 Lakhs) as stated above. Based

on the legal opinion obtained by the Company, the action of UPPCL for denying

income tax and secondary charges and holing / deducting amount, is not as per the

terms of the power purchase agreement (PPA), and the Company had filed a petition

with Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) against UPPCL for

the aforesaid recovery. UPERC vide its order dated 12th June,2020 had disallowed

the claims of the Company and upheld the recovery/proposed recovery of excess

payment made. Against the Order of UPERC the Company has preferred an appeal

before APTEL. Meanwhile in 2020-21 UPPCL and Company both have agreed that

recovery of amount paid in excess (subject to ongoing reconciliations and final

outcome of appeal filed with APTEL for revision in design energy) to be made from

monthly power sale invoices raised/to be raised for next 7 years starting from FY

2021-22.

In addition to that as per recovery plan, UPPCL will charge carrying cost on

outstanding amount @SBI MCLR plus 350 basis points starting from financial

year 2021-22 to financial year 2027-28. In view of the above and considering

prudence, from 2020-21 onwards, revenue from UPPCL has been accounted for

net of the component of income tax and excess secondary energy charges. Pending

the decision on Company’s appeal filed with Appellate Tribunal for Electricity

(APTEL) as stated above, no provision in these financial statements has been

considered necessary by the management against the disallowances of income

tax and secondary energy charges of Rs. 39,970 lakhs and carrying cost (amount

unascertainable). Further the management believes that it has credible case in its

favour and accordingly amount which has been deducted by UPPCL of Rs.16,044

Lakhs (shown as part of trade receivables) is considered good and same is

recoverable with interest from UPPCL.

Note 49
