interest rate sensitivity for fixed rate instruments

The Company does not account for any fixed-rate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through statement of profit or loss.

Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments

A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) profit or loss by

the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant.

Note 44 Financial instruments – Hedge accounting

The objective of hedge accounting is to represent, in the Company’s financial statements, the effect of the Company’s use of financial

instruments to manage exposures arising from particular risks that could affect profit or loss.

Currency risk-

The Company’s risk management policy is to hedge its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of highly forecasted sales. The Company

uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk. Such contracts are generally designated as fair value hedges. Company’s policy is

to match the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts with that of the hedged item.

Commodity risk

The Company’s risk management policy is mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the aluminium/copper/zinc prices on highly forecast purchase

transactions. The Company uses futures contract to hedge its commodity risk. Such contracts are generally designated as cash flow hedges.

interest rate

The Company’s risk management policy is to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure on floating rate borrowings by entering into fixed-rate

instruments like interest rate swaps to eliminate the variability of cash flows attributable to movements in interest rates. Such hedges are

designated as cash flow hedges.

For derivative contracts designated as hedge, the Company documents at inception the economic relationship between the hedging instrument

and the hedged item, the hedge ratio, the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge and the methods used to assess the hedge

effectiveness. The hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. The tenor of hedging instrument may be

less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability.

Financial contracts designated as hedges are accounted for in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 109 depending upon the type of hedge.

Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness

both on prospective and retrospective basis. The prospective hedge effectiveness test is a forward looking evaluation of whether or not the

changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging position are expected to be highly effective on offsetting the changes in the fair value or

cash flows of the hedged position over the term of the relationship.

On the other hand, the retrospective hedge effectiveness test is a backward-looking evaluation of whether the changes in the fair value or cash

flows of the hedging position have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged position since the

date of designation of the hedge.

Hedge effectiveness is assessed through the application of critical terms match method/Dollar offset method. Any ineffectiveness in a hedging

relationship is accounted for in the statement of profit and loss:
