Managing Director:

Managing Director

It gives me immense pleasure to present to you this 63rd Annual

Report for the Financial Year 2022. In many ways the year 2022 was

special for all of us and truly became a year of milestones in the KSB

history. This report provides a comprehensive overview of our

company's progress and achievements, as well as a look at the

challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. I believe that this

information will not only provide you with a deeper understanding of

our Company, but it will also serve as a valuable resource for those

interested in our industry and the trends shaping our future.

This year we celebrated 150 years of KSB group world-wide. This

historic milestone could be achieved only because of the strong

foundation laid by our founding members and zealous employees with

their persistence and dedication over all these years as well as the

continuous support of all stakeholders. I am sure we will continue this

legacy of delivering value to all the stakeholders over many more years

to come.

We have been successful to meet the market demand by continuous

investments in our plants, products and infrastructure. Our Sinnar

factory manufacturing products for our standard business underwent

an expansion with the addition of a new industrial shed. We also

completed the investment in our Steel Foundry unit to upscale the

capacities. Furthermore, the capacity of Central Warehouse,

Chinchwad has been expanded for catering to the increasing demand

for spare parts. To expand our footprints in Bangladesh market, we

have inaugurated our liaison office at Dhaka. With a view to increase

our focus on the eastern and north-eastern parts of India, we set up

new sales offices at Patna and Guwahati. To support our new business

vertical for Mechanical Seals, we inaugurated the first Mechanical Seal

repair centre at Chinchwad, Pune. A new state of the art training centre

for Valves has been established at the Valves Division in Coimbatore.

We continuously evaluate various inorganic growth opportunities, in

order to further increase our market offerings and reach. As part of this

strategy, we have successfully acquired the technology of Bharat

Pumps and Compressors Limited (BP&CL), Naini, Prayagraj. Apart from

generating business for selling of Pumps for various critical

applications, the technology acquisition will enable KSB to serve the

industry with spares supplies where BP&CL pumps are installed in

critical applications.

The year 2022 started on a very positive note with a healthy order on

hand situation. A well-defined Strategy 2024 – “climb towards

leadership” was put in place right from the beginning of the year. We

received many high value orders such as Flue-gas desulfurization (FGD)

application pump orders, orders from the petrochemical and chemical

market segments as well as breakthrough orders in Solar pumping
