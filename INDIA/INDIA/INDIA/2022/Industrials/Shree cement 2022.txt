MANAGING DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE

Sustainability

enabling innovation

I am, however, of the view that sustainability is an

even greater enabler of innovation than technology.

Sustainability links society and all its parts with the

eternal cycle of life – of creation, degeneration and

renewal. Dramatic changes in the natural world, as

visible through climate change, call for review in our

approach to innovation. It is necessary that new business

models internalise the concept of finiteness. This has

triggered a new kind of innovation – where Man is now

exploring alternatives like biofuels, carbon and hydrogen

transformation technologies. The quest for building more

equitable, inclusive and sustainable societies has been

another shaping force. Today’s businesses are expected

to harmonise their existence with a society that needs to

be sustainable at various levels – for its people and for

the planet.

For Shree Cement, sustainability has always been a

primary lever for innovation. As an organisation, we

have always optimised on the premise that resources

are limited. We have focused on innovations that can

optimise processes. We have designed operational

methods that dynamically calibrate performance

to achieve the highest productivity. We have always

remained involved with our employees, communities

and stakeholders to ensure that their interests

remain aligned with ours and we can work together

in mutual harmony.

The underlying driving force for our industry-leading

performance is careful integration of sustainability as an

integral part into our business. The care for our planet and

concerns of our stakeholders motivate us to identify novel

models and ways to bring about meaningful difference

to our working. Our incessant quest to reduce carbon

footprint from our operations and transforming our

products from grey to green remained hallmark of our

sustainability efforts in FY 2021-22. I would like to highlight

some of the notable achievements of FY 2021-22 driven by

the sustainability lever as under:

•

Our usage of alternative raw materials has grown

from 26.01% to 27.23% during FY 22. Our consumption

of alternate fuels has gone up from 6.03% to 9.84%

in FY 2021-22. This is a result of our firm belief the

resources that we use today should also serve the

needs of our future generations.

•

Our share of green power in total consumption at

48.2% is amongst the best in the industry. The quest

for continually increasing this share is mainly driven

by our conviction that Earth’s fossil fuels are finite and

soon they may pose supply constraints.

•

Similarly, our water positivity ratio has also grown

to over 5 times our consumption. This is significant

as majority of our operations are located in

water stress zones.

•

Our all-round improvement measures and unique

initiatives towards greening of our operations have

enabled us to bring down our Specific Net Scope 1

CO2 emission to 529 Kg/ tonne of cement equivalent

from 543 Kg/tonne in FY 2018-19. We aim to make

meaningful cut to our emission level by targeting

12.7% reduction in our Scope 1 and 27.1% in Scope

2 emissions vis-a-vis FY 2018-19 by 2030. In order to

give credence to this commitment, we have got our

targets validated by Science Based Targets Initiatives

(SBTi), a partnership between CDP, UN Global

Compact, WRI and WWF.

•

Our focus on digitalisation enhances efficiency of our

processes. We have taken steps to further strengthen

our digitalisation efforts that would help bring ease

of operation for our channel partners as well as

streamline our logistic and marketing operations.

We have also initiated steps to upgrade our ERP

system to make it more robust and help faster

decision making.

•

Our continually rising CSR spend on carefully crafted

CSR programmes that take into account the needs of

our communities have helped us win their hearts and

made them a part of Shree family.

•

Our governance model of “walking the talk” is driven

by the element of trust that our shareholders have

posed in us. We have completed most of our projects

in scheduled time and costs.

During the year, we have reinforced our vision and

commitment towards sustainability. Appointment of a

high-rank senior official as Chief Sustainability Officer is

testimony to our commitment towards enhanced focus on

sustainability. Also, we have undertaken comprehensive

review of our ESG practices with a view to further improve

them with greater focus. We have strengthened our

ESG policies to demonstrate our commitment towards

the cause of sustainability. Areas where possibility of

improvement or strengthening is possible have been

identified and required actions are underway.

We believe in building capabilities and innovating

solutions to manage menace of carbonisation. Towards

this objective, we have initiated a dialogue with World

Bank to work as knowledge partner on projects

related to sustainability and climate change. Through

our membership with Global Cement and Concrete

Association (GCCA), we have participated through project

INNOVANDI to accelerate development of enabling

technologies for Carbon Capture, Usage and Utilisation.

Maintaining a sustainable world is a challenging task.

The needs are in a constant state of flux, and so are the

routes to equilibrium. At Shree Cement, we approach

each challenge with zeal and dedication – for successful

innovation requires an incessant ability to refresh and

refocus. Our aim is to keep setting new objectives for

ourselves as the world’s sustainability requirements evolve.

The brighter side of grey, colours and inspires our

perspective. We have never let a closed door defeat us,

regarding barriers as opportunities to be circumvented.

We have always challenged ourselves to derive innovative

ways of doing established things, and that constant

transformation for incremental and exceptional

improvement will continue. Our first Integrated Annual

Report for FY 2021-22, is a step forward towards showing

our customers, our stakeholders and our industry peers

all the work that we have already done in the area of

sustainability, and how we envision achieving better

growth and profitability given the changing global and

industry scenario.

H.M. Bangur: Managing

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE

to constantly search for answers as to why they are in

business, who they are as a company, what their impacts

on the world are, how they align their business model

with the needs of society and how they engage with their

people and with other stakeholders.

Change is thus inevitable; be it because of external events,

internal processes, ESG aspects or otherwise. Important

for organisations is to be change ready. We, at Shree

Cement, however see these challenges as an opportunity of

creating strategic agility into our operating model and that

of transforming the performance of the organisation. We

have internalised change as a way of life. People at Shree

keep moving their goal post and set new performance

benchmarks for themselves as a daily routine. On their way

towards achieving newer benchmarks, sometimes they fail.

We however encourage this as it brings new learnings and

sets the tone for making the next attempt for improvement.

Our mantra is that “If you don’t step forward, you are always

in the same place.” Shree Cement’s success is based on its

ability to consistently adapt to new waves of change in the

business environment.

Our operational approach underline large leaps as well

as small steady steps to manifest growth in tandem

with future outlook that’s promising and achievable.

Our objective is to ensure sustained value creation for

all our stakeholders, including employees, vendors and

suppliers, customers, investors, as well as the Mother

Earth. But central to this pursuit remains one of our most

important stakeholders – our future generations. The

reason of our existence is to build a legacy of economic

prosperity founded on the rock of conserving and

protecting the planet for generations to come.

The success story of Shree is therefore crafted on a

rich legacy of sustainable growth.

We use novel technologies and innovative solutions for

continual betterment in our sustainability scorecard.

Some unique practices reflecting on our sustainable

growth journey are as under:

Scaling-up rapidly, creating value.

In the past two decades, our production capacity has

grown at a faster rate than the industry. Our rapid

progress has been marked by aggressive capacity

expansion in record time and at lower costs than the

industry. We’ve also been effective in achieving speedier

stabilisation of our new plants, resulting in more

consistent production and a higher return on investment.

This has resulted in continuous growth in output and

corresponding increase in revenues, resulting in significant

value addition to shareholder wealth. A strong liquidity

position and a deleveraged balance sheet give us the

confidence to keep exploring newer opportunities.

Unmatched processes, uncompromised planet.

Our singular process of questioning existing ways of

doing things has created a sustained and continual

improvement in our productivity and efficiency levels.

This reinforces our commitment to finding sustainable

ways of manufacturing cement. In some cases, our

productivity levels are even higher than those designed

by the OEMs. It helps us save additional resources in

terms of people, machines and materials and contributes

towards the greening of our planet and making extra

returns on our financial capital. Our initiatives like using

alternative raw materials and fuels, harnessing maximum

potential of WHR generation and increasing renewable

energy capacity of solar and wind are enriching these

efforts and bringing out constant betterment in our

environment footprint.

Motivated people, bolstered productivity.

Our talent management philosophy is built around the

idea that ‘the more the Company does for them, the

more they will do for the Company’. We continue to

invest in upskilling our teams and providing them the

opportunities to grow personally and professionally. The

training and development programmes designed for our

employees are in line with our core philosophy, ‘Care

for People’. Our unique ‘Shree Family’ culture fosters a

culture of belongingness amongst the employees and

their families with the Company. Our recognition as a

Great Place to Work© in India and as one of ‘India’s Best

Workplaces’ in the manufacturing sector is a testimony to

our commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive culture

with sustainable workplaces. With our vision to create a

zero-harm environment, we promote a safe work culture

for our employees.

Empowered today, enriched tomorrow.

Our commitment to community welfare dates to our

inception. We emphasise on creating value for the

society by protecting and supporting our communities.

We closely interact with our nearby communities and

design multiple programmes to improve the standards of

education, provision of healthcare, vocational education,

infrastructure, etc. to raise their overall status in the

society.

We are aware that our actions of today will determine

the course of our future. It is why we stand committed to

building a better future by leveraging and building on our

foundations of sustainable growth – steadily, earnestly

and resolutely.

Our next phase of stakeholder value creation will come

from our vision to expand our capacities while continuing

our journey of reducing our carbon footprint. We are

envisioning an increase in installed capacity to 80MTPA

by 2030 exploring new geographies through both the

organic and inorganic routes. We aim to reduce our GHG

emissions in line with the targets validated by Science

Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

Our mantra is to keep trying new things as we believe that

with one failure, comes many successes. At Shree Cement,

our continuous pursuit towards excellence gives us the

optimism of creating a bright future for our stakeholders.

Training and development

The hard work and skills that our people bring to our

company is the key to our success. Thus, nurturing

their talent and motivating them to succeed helps us

to be on the forefront. Our training and development

programmes help employees improve their skills and

knowledge base.

To enable continued learning and prevent the hindrance

caused during the pandemic, we launched an online

learning initiative ‘Shree STEPS’ with support of learning

platform ‘Edcast’ that enabled virtual trainings during

the testing times. With the help of this programme,

traditional classroom style learning was completely

transformed to online training within 10 days of the

onset of the pandemic. With the shift from classroom to

online training we could witness a 59% increase in time

spent on learning.

During FY 2021-22, we conducted 403 training

programmes and provided trainings to our employees on

Nurturing the wellbeing of our employees

We understand that individuals produce the best

possible results when they have sound state of

physical and mental health. Hence, the wellbeing of our

employees and their families is our top priority. Along

with a competitive remuneration, all our permanent

as well as contractual employees are covered under

‘personal accidental cover’. Health insurance is extended

to the families of permanent employees as well.

State-of-the art health facilities are provided at our

workplaces and in our townships which can be availed

by our staff as well as local communities. Wellness

Management Centers (WMC) are developed at all our

locations with deployment of qualified healthcare

professionals. These centers are equipped with facilities

for spirometry test, X-ray, Audiometry tests, eye care,

road accident care and annual health checkup, etc.

COVID-19 vaccination drive was carried out at all our

locations in 274 sessions during year FY 2021-22.

During the year, as the pandemic hit the country, we took

proactive measures to facilitate our employees connected

with the workplace through our online platform SPARQ.

This application facilitated all workplace related details,

information and activities in virtual manner for our

employees to continue working from home.
