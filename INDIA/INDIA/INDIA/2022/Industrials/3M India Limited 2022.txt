Recent Indian Accounting Standards :

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 23, 2022, MCA

amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022, applicable from April 1,

2022, as below:

Ind AS 103 – Reference to Conceptual Framework

The amendments specify that to qualify for recognition as part of applying the acquisition method, the

identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in

the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting under Indian Accounting Standards (Conceptual

Framework) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India at the acquisition date. These changes

do not significantly change the requirements of Ind AS 103. The Group does not expect the amendment to

have any significant impact in its consolidated financial statements.

Ind AS 16 – Proceeds before intended use

The amendments mainly prohibit an entity from deducting from the cost of property, plant and equipment

amounts received from selling items produced while the company is preparing the asset for its intended

use. Instead, an entity will recognise such sales proceeds and related cost in profit or loss. The Group does

not expect the amendments to have any impact in its recognition of its property, plant and equipment in its

consolidated financial statements.

Ind AS 37 – Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract

The amendments specify that that the ‘cost of fulfilling’ a contract comprises the ‘costs that relate directly

to the contract’. Costs that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that

contract (examples would be direct labour, materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate directly

to fulfilling contracts. The amendment is essentially a clarification and the Group does not expect the

amendment to have any significant impact in its consolidated financial statements.

Ind AS 109 – Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021)

The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes when it applies the ‘10 percent’ test of Ind AS 109 in

assessing whether to derecognise a financial liability. The Group does not expect the amendment to have

any significant impact in its consolidated financial statements.

Ind AS 116 – Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021)

The amendments remove the illustration of the reimbursement of leasehold improvements by the lessor in

order to resolve any potential confusion regarding the treatment of lease incentives that might arise because

of how lease incentives were described in that illustration. The Group does not expect the amendment to

have any significant impact in its consolidated financial statements.:

letter and

RSUs will be Nil. As of the year end a sum of Rs. 1,337.31 lakhs (2021: Rs. 2,267.10 lakhs) is liability and the same

is included under ‘Other financial liabilities’ (refer note 16).

B.

Measurement of fair values

The Group measures compensation expense for stock appreciation rights (SARs) at their fair value determined

using Black - Scholes Model and restricted stock units (RSUs) based on fair market value of shares of 3M

Company, USA as on 31 March, 2022.

The fair value of the cash settled SARs and the inputs used in the measurement of fair value at grant date and

measurement date of the SARs are as follows:

As at

31 March 2022

As at

31 March 2021

Expected dividends (%)

The expected term of the SARs is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term of the SARs, as well

as expected exercise behavior of the employee who receives the SAR. Expected volatility during the expected

term is based on historical volatility of the observed market prices of the 3M Company USA’s publicly traded

equity shares particularly over the historical period commensurate with the expected term.
