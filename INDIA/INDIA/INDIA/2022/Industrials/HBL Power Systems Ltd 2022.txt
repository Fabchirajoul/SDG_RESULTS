DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

We are excited to share our thoughts with you

for we stand at the threshold of a significant

change in our business prospects.

FY22 has been a very interesting journey. It was

bleak at the start. And better at the end.

The fiscal started with the life-threatening

second wave of Covid-19 pandemic which

tested India severely. The impact of this health

scare and its impact on the economy were

significant. But a resilient India bounced back

with vigour only to face inflationary pressure

prevailing across the globe consequent of the

pandemic further fuelled by the geopolitical

tensions towards the close of the fiscal. This

resulted in a substantial increase in input cost.

T

HE team continues to engage

with customers to pass on the cost

increase with some success. But a

large part of the cost increase needed

to be absorbed which weighed on

business profitability.

Despite these headwinds, we

continued to receive a strong flow

of business for all three verticals.

Business volumes for our defence

batteries, particularly in exports,

grew which helped in improving

profitability.

We reported a healthy improvement

in business performance. Revenue

from operations increased by 34%

from H909 crore in FY21 to H1,221crore

in FY22, the pre-covid levels. EBITDA

more than doubled from H72 crore in

FY21 to H160 crore in FY22. EBITDA

margin stood at 12% in FY22 against

9% in FY21.

We continued to reduce our

debt exposure - both long-term

and working capital - which has

significantly strengthened the

organisation’s ability to address an

exciting future.
