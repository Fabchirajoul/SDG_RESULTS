(A) CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

(i)

The steps taken or impact on conservation of

energy:

Blade

•

Reduction of electricity demand load by 500

KVA after analyzing the consumption pattern

and by aligning the processes. It has resulted

into saving of Rs. 24 Lakh per annum.

•

Upgraded the blade production process by

reducing the energy consuming resources

such as reduction in operational hours of

blade manufacturing equipment which has

resulted in approx. saving Rs. 3.60 Lakh per

annum.

•

Hazardous waste utilization by substituting

conventional fuel required in Cement plant

with our crushed process waste; about 55

tonnes of waste generated was co-processed

in the cement manufacturing plant.

Tower

•

Optimized tubular tower design for 2 MW–

HH92 manufacturing process rwhich equires

10-12% less energy for rolling, welding as well

as its internal handling and transportation.

This has led to 10% lesser energy (electricity &

diesel fuel) consumption

(ii)

The steps taken by the Company for utilising

alternate sources of energy: The Company is itself

engaged in the renewable energy business.

3 MW wind turbine Generator technology

introduced. The manufacturing of prototype of 3

MW Nacelle and hub is in process.

Blade Plant

•

Modification of resin tub and reusing of resin pipe

lead to reduction in the resin consumption.

•

Green mesh setting modified to eliminate/reduce

profile repairs in blades.

speedy execution and has helped in meeting the

Prototype development timeline.

•

Necessary infrastructure has been established for

continuous production of tubular towers for 3MW

wind turbine generators.

•

Significant cost savings achieved by continual

improvement in the processes/ technology such as

42: Impact of COVID-19

Due to outbreak of COVID-19 globally and in India, the Group’s management has made initial assessment of impact on

business and financial risks on account of COVID-19. Considering that the group is in the business of Manufacturing of

Wind Turbine Generator which fall under the Renewable Energy sector being the priority sector, Erection, procurement

and operation & maintenance services of Wind Turbine Generator in the Renewable Energy Sector and power generation,

the management believes that the impact of this outbreak on the business and financial position of the Group will not be

significant. The management does not see any risks in the group’s ability to continue as a going concern and meeting its

liabilities. The Group has used the principles of prudence in applying judgements, estimates and assumptions and based on

the current estimates, the Group expects to recover the carrying amount of trade receivables including unbilled receivables,

investments, inventories and other assets. Further, Supply/Commissioning of WTGs against certain purchase order does not

require any material adjustment on account of delays, if any considering disruption due to COVID-19. The eventual outcome

of impact of the global health pandemic may be different from those estimated as on the date of approval of these financial

statements. Due to the nature of the pandemic, the Group will continue to monitor developments to identify significant

uncertainties in future periods, if any.

43: Balance Confirmation

The Group has a system of obtaining periodic confirmation of balances from banks, trade receivables/payables/advances

to vendors and other parties (other than disputed parties). The balance confirmation letters as referred to in the Standard

on Auditing (SA) 505 (Revised) ‘External Confirmations’, were sent to banks and parties and the party’s balances are subject

to confirmation/reconciliation. Considering the large amount of outstanding advances and certain balance confirmation

received from the parties, IWL committee of the Board of Directors of operations in its meeting held on March 09, 2022,
