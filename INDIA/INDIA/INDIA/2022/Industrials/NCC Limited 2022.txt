I thank you all – our valued

Warm Regards

Dr. AVS Raju

Founder & Chairman Emeritus:

Dear Shareholders,

FY22 year’s performance is yet again a testimonial of our

company’s ability to remain resilient during difficult times.

This year has been relatively a good year for our Company. I

congratulate the management and our strong team of employees

for tirelessly working for this success.

A Resilient NCC

It’s a known fact that macro-economic volatilities make an adverse

impact on businesses. The outcome of such shocks can at times

be detrimental for many, yet few remain resilient during these

adverse times as they learn, adapt, change and emerge stronger.

To remain strong has its foundation on the quality of corporate

governance, capabilities such as strategic agility, risk management

and focus on quality. At NCC since its inception, the company has

gone through many economic upheavals. Over the years we have

set NCC as a benchmark among construction companies with

our unique business model and operational approach. During the

tough years in the past, we focused on making NCC’s internal

environment more resilient.

On Performance

Performance in FY22 is an outcome of our key strategies i.e to

remain asset light, strong execution coupled with our financial

discipline. We increased our revenue across our key business

verticals. Margins during the year were subdued because of

higher commodity prices. On a standalone basis our revenue

during the year under review is ` 9,930 crore as against ` 7256

crore in FY21. Segment diversity across building, mining, railways,

electrical, water & environment is one of the key differentiators

at NCC. Our diversified order book asset is at ` 39,361 crore as

of March 31, 2022. This includes new orders of ` 12,158 crore

received during FY 22. I am happy that we considerably reduced

our debts during the year.

External environment

We have stepped into FY23 amidst mounting global economic

challenges and fiscal measures by our country to contain the

impact. Retail inflation increased to an eight-year high of 7.79%

in April, 2022. The RBI’s twice hike in repo rate was impending

due to the inflation spike and global macroeconomic scenarios.:

MANAGING DIRECTOR

Going forward we expect more

orders to come in from

diverse segments like buildings,

roads, water and others.

I am confident that FY 2022-23

and beyond we are on a strong

position aided by our existing

order book as well as the new

emerging opportunities.: Dear Shareholders,

We began the year amidst a huge wave of the pandemic which

took a severe toll on lives and livelihoods both in our country and

the world over. As the world was witnessing the disruptions

brought by the pandemic, economic activity continued to

experience severe volatility and uncertainty. Your company too

was affected particularly in the first half year of the year under

review due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic and as

a result of the pragmatic steps taken by the management, the

situation gradually improved especially in the 3rd & 4th quarters.

We have maintained our strength and decisive attitude, strong

execution skills, capabilities, diverse order booking and debt

reduction in the year under review.

The ongoing geopolitical conflict, re-imposition of lockdown in

China on account of fresh COVID-19 cases, global inflation and

continuing supply shortages are expected to adversely impact

the global GDP growth in 2022-23. The world bank expects

global growth to decelerate from an estimated 5.5% to 3.25%.

The Govt. of India’s decision to lower fuel prices is one of

the important steps to contain the increasing burden on the

economy. Amidst external challenges, as per the initial estimates,

India’s GDP is expected to grow in the range of 7.5% in FY 2022-

23. With low non-performing assets (NPAs) and healthy balance

sheets, the Indian banking system is well positioned to offer

much needed support to businesses. As a result, despite certain

setbacks, I am optimistic that India’s growth story will continue.

Overview of FY 2021-22

I had projected in my previous letter about improving our order

book and a strong FY 2021-22. I am happy to inform you that

with the relentless pursuit of our team with support from our

clients, we have achieved good growth in Turnover of the

Company besides good collections from the clients including

Andhra Pradesh which led to a steep reduction in the debt of the

Company. The margins were affected in the year under review

because an increase in the input costs. An order book to sales

ratio of 4x provides strong visibility in revenue growth in the near

term future. We have a strong order book from buildings, water,

environment, railways, electricals and mining segments. Some of

our major clients in buildings include UP Housing Development

Board, AAI, AIIMS, NBCC, BMRCL and MMRDA. Our water and
