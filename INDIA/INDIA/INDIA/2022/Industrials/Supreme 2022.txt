1.25 ReCeNt INDIAN ACCOuNtING StANDARDS (IND AS)

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards / amendments under Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On 23rd March, 2022, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022, as below :

(a) Ind AS 16 – Property, plant and equipment – The amendment clarifies that excess of net sale proceeds of items produced

over the cost of testing, if any, shall not be recognised in the profit or loss but deducted from the directly attributable costs

considered as part of cost of an item of property, plant, and equipment. The effective date for adoption of this amendment

is annual periods beginning on or after 1st April, 2022.

(b) Ind AS 37 - Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets – The amendment specifies that the ‘cost of fulfilling’

a contract comprises the ‘costs that relate directly to the contract’. Costs that relate directly to a contract can either be

incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (examples would be direct labour, materials) or an allocation of other costs that

relate directly to fulfilling contracts (an example would be the allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of property,

plant and equipment used in fulfilling the contract). The effective date for adoption of this amendment is annual periods

beginning on or after 1st April, 2022, although early adoption is permitted.

(c) Ind AS 103 – Business combinations – The amendment adds a new exception in Ind AS 103 for liabilities and contingent

liabilities.

(d) Ind AS 109 – Financial instruments – The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes when it applies the ‘10%’ test

in assessing whether to derecognise a financial liability. An entity includes only fees paid or received between the entity

(the borrower) and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the entity or the lender on the other’s behalf.

The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of these amendments.

Notes to the Standalone financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2022:

Managing Director and governed by

overall direction of Board of Directors of the Company.

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a

financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency

exchange rates, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable

to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and

loans and borrowings.

A. CReDIt RISK

Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter party may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage

this, the Company periodically assess financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current

economic trends, and analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set

accordingly.

The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant

increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis through each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase

in credit risk the Company compares the risk of default occurring on asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default

as at the date of initial recognition. It considers reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information such as:

i)

Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business

ii) Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty

iii) Financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty’s ability to meet

its obligations

iv) Significant increase in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same counterparty

The company catogarises financial assets based on the assumptions, inputs and factors specific to the class of financial

assets into High-quality assets, negligible credit risk; Quality assets, low credit risk; Standard assets, moderate credit risk;

Substandard assets, relatively high credit risk; Low quality assets, very high credit risk; Doubtful assets, credit-impaired.

Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectations of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a

repayment plan with the Company. The Company categorises a loan or receivable for write off when a debtor fails to make

contractual payments greater than one year past due. Where loans or receivables have been written off, the Company

continues engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are

recognized in profit or loss.:
