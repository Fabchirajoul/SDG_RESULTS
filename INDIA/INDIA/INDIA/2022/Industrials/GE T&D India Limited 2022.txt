valid claim is not received, the Company will proceed to transfer

the respective shares to the IEPF Account in accordance with

the procedure prescribed under the IEPF Rules.

SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)

Regulations, 2015 (“Listing Regulations”) mandate Companies

to credit the dividend to the Members electronically. Members

address or demise of any Member as soon as possible. Members

are also advised to not leave their demat account(s) dormant

for long. Periodic statement of holdings should be obtained from

the concerned Depository Participant and holdings should be

verified from time to time.:

Managing Director(s) and/or Wholetime Director(s) as

may be determined by the Board of Directors, the amount, proportion

and manner of such payment and distribution shall be as the Board

may, from time to time, decide, provided further that none of the non-

executive Directors shall, in any Financial Year, individually receive

an aggregate remuneration (excluding sitting fees) exceeding H 2.5

million (Rupees two million five hundred thousand only).

During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company incurred a loss in

terms of section 198 of the Companies Act, 2013 due to lower revenue

which resulted into lower recovery of fixed expenses, significant

increase in commodity prices leading to increased raw material cost

on firm price contracts and other cost escalations on projects. The

revenue of the Company has decreased by 12% as compared to year

ended March 31, 2021 due to lower backlog and book and bill orders

and delay in Customer projects.

The Companies (Amendment) Act, 2020 has amended the Section

149 (9) and Section 197 (3) of the Companies Act, 2013 permitting

remuneration to be paid to the Non-executive Directors / Independent

Directors in case of inadequacy or absence of profits.

Acknowledging the crucial role played by the Non-Executive Directors

including Independent Directors in bringing objectivity into the

functioning of the Board and improving its effectiveness, the Company

Law Committee in its Report recommended for compensating

Non-Executive and Independent Directors along with the Executive

Directors. In view of the said recommendations, Ministry of Corporate

Affairs, with effect from March 18, 2021, have amended Section

149 (9), Section 197 (3) and Schedule V providing for the companies

having no profit or inadequate profit to pay remuneration to the Non-

Executive Directors including Independent Directors.

The Non-Executive Directors including Independent Directors bring

relevant knowledge and expertise and provide required diversity in

Board’s decision-making process. The role played by the Directors

in Company’s governance and performance is very important for

sustainable growth of the Company. With the enhanced Corporate

Governance requirements under the Companies Act, 2013 and the

SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,

2015, (“Listing Regulations”) as amended coupled with the size and

complexity of operations of the Company, the role and responsibilities

of the Board, particularly Non-executive Directors (including

Independent Directors) has become more onerous, requiring greater

time commitments, attention and a higher level of oversight.

In view of the above, in terms of Section II to Part II of Schedule V

of the Companies Act, 2013 the Board of Directors at its meeting

held on May 20, 2022, as recommended by the Nomination and

Remuneration Committee, subject to approval of the shareholders,

approved payment of remuneration by way of commission of an

amount of H 1,150,000/- (Rupees One million one hundred and fifty

thousand only) to each of the independent directors, namely Dr. Kirit

S Parikh, Mr. Rakesh Nath, Ms. Neera Saggi and Mr. Sanjay Sagar,

for the financial year ended March 31, 2022, and thereafter, in the

event of inadequacy of profits, during financial years 2022-23 and

2023-24, approved payment of remuneration by way of commission

to non-executive directors upto H 10 Million (Rupees ten million

only) in aggregate, provided further that none of the non-executive

Directors shall, in any Financial Year, individually receive an aggregate

remuneration (excluding sitting fees) exceeding H 2.5 million (Rupees

two million five hundred thousand only).

In view of the amendments in the Companies Act, 2013 permitting

payment of remuneration to the Non-executive Directors including:

Managing Director & Whole-time Director subject to the approval

of Shareholders.

Regulation 17(6) of the SEBI Listing Regulations authorises the Board

of Directors to recommend all fees and compensation, if any, paid to

Non-Executive Directors, including Independent Directors and the

same requires approval of members in general meeting.:

Managing Director /

Chief Executive Officer assisted by an executive committee

from an overall business perspective, rather than reviewing

its products/services as individual standalone components.

Based on the dominant source and nature of risks and

returns of the Company, management has identified its

business segment as its primary reporting format.

2.2.18 Cash flow statement

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,

whereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects of

transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals

of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and

item of income or expenses associated with investing

or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating,

investing and financing activities of the Company are

segregated.

2.2.19 Recent pronouncements

MCA notify new standard or amendments to

the existing standards under Companies (Indian

Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to

time. On 23 March 2022, MCA amended the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules,

2022, applicable from 01 April 2022, as below:

a)

Ind AS 103 - Reference to Conceptual Framework: The

amendments specify that to qualify for recognition

as part of applying the acquisition method, the

identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed

must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in

the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting

under Indian Accounting Standards (Conceptual

Framework) issued by the Institute of Chartered

Accountants of India at the acquisition date. These

changes do not significantly change the requirements

of Ind AS 103. The Company does not expect the

amendment to have any significant impact in its

financial statements.

b)

Ind AS 16 - Proceeds before intended use: The

amendments mainly prohibit an entity from deducting

from the cost of property, plant and equipment

amounts received from selling items produced while

the group is preparing the asset for its intended use.

Instead, an entity will recognise such sales proceeds

and related cost in statement of profit or loss. The

Company is in the process of analysing and evaluating

the he Company does not expect the amendment to

have any significant impact in its financial statements.

c)

Ind AS 37- Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and

contingent assets: The amendment specifies that

the cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs

that relate directly to the contract’. Costs that relate

directly to a contract can either be incremental costs

of fulfilling that contract (examples would be direct

labour, materials) or an allocation of other costs

that relate directly to fulfilling contracts (an example

would be the allocation of the depreciation charge

for an item of property, plant and equipment used in

fulfilling the contract). The effective date for adoption

of this amendment is annual periods beginning

on or after April1,2022, although early adoption is

permitted. The Company is in the process of analysing

and evaluating the impact in its financial statements.:

Managing Director / Chief Executive Officer assisted by an executive

committee from an overall business perspective, rather than reviewing its products/services as individual standalone components. Thus, the

Company has only one operating segment, and has no reportable segments in accordance with Ind AS - 108 ‘Operating Segments’.
