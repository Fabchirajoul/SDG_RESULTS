Message from the Chairman

The pandemic continued for the second

year running in 2021, heightening economic

uncertainty across the world. Yet, your company

delivered strong financial performance across

its business segments.

The second half of the year saw activity in the

lending markets improve as demand increased,

and buoyancy in the capital market continued to

drive the need for insightful and robust research

and analytics. Digitalisation and transformation

agendas at global financial institutions also

spawned opportunities.

Our continued focus on client-centricity showed

meaningful impact, as underscored by rising net

promoter scores from our clients. Furthermore,

our domain-led IP offerings helped grow our

core areas, while new products and solutions

enabled us to enhance presence in client

segments. Investments in technology and talent

ensured business continuity and analytical

excellence.

CRISIL Ratings maintained its market leading

position and remained the preferred choice for

investors and issuers, thanks to its analytical

rigour. Global Analytical Centre continued to be

a strategic partner for S&P Global Ratings on its

analytical and transformation agenda.

Across the board, our business is growing

as the market responds to the strength of

our offerings. India Research witnessed a

surge in need for comprehensive data sets,

critical insights, and custom analytics. Global

Research and Risk Solutions gained momentum

on account of increasing demand for risk

transformation, sustainability, and buy-side

research. Global Benchmarking Analytics

expanded its suite of analytics and added new

clients globally. The Advisory business won

mandates from governments and multilaterals,

and the Business Intelligence and Risk Solutions

business increased its overseas client footprint.

I am particularly pleased to share that CRISIL

further strengthened its sustainability

credentials. In addition to offerings for global

markets, we launched a proprietary framework: Dear Shareholders,

I am particularly pleased to share that CRISIL further strengthened

its sustainability credentials. In addition to offerings for global

markets, we launched a proprietary framework to score listed

Indian companies on environmental, social and governance

(ESG) performance. I am confident that our suite of sustainability

solutions will enable investors, lenders, and corporates to redefine

their approach to sustainable value creation and risk management.

ESG risks and

conducted a materiality

our most relevant (or

“material”) reporting

topics from an ESG

perspective — which is

a broader standard than

that used in our financial

disclosures.

The universe of our

priorities within the

domains of E, S and

G has been derived

through a consultative

exercise, wherein

the priorities were

evaluated in order

of their importance

to our business and

our stakeholders.

We leveraged inputs

from stakeholder

engagements, surveys,

strategic processes,

peer benchmarking and

industry standards to

sharpen management

insight on material
