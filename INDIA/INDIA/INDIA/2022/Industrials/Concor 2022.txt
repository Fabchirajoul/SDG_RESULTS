LETTER FROM CHAIRMAN AND: MANAGING DIRECTOR

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

I would like to extend my sincere greetings and wishes for your good health and safety.

The year 2022 is a very special one for all of us, as our country has completed 75 years of its journey as an independent

and progressive nation. Over these years, India has emerged as the fastest-growing economy in the world and backed

by its committed workforce and robust democracy, it is expected to be among the top three economies globally over

the next decade.

Last year was a mixed bag, with COVID impacting the first quarter of the year. During the next two quarters, the

major economies had shown recovery and were moving towards growth with positive outlook. This optimism level

was short lived, as in the second half of the year, the headwinds of surging commodity prices, geopolitical conflicts,

disruption in trade and financial transactions deteriorated the prospects of economic growth. In spite of the turbulent

times, the Indian economy has slogged on to reach the pre-pandemic real GDP level of 2019-20. As per the

provisional estimates, real GDP growth of India in FY 2021-22 stands at 8.7%. Further, as per RBI, the Indian

economy is likely to grow at 7.2% next year.

Indian Railways registered an increase of 15% in the originating loading cargo from 1,233.22 million tonnes in 2020-

21 to 1,418.27 million tonnes in the year 2021-22. The originating containerized cargo transported by rail has

increased by 17.63% from 63.23 million tonnes in 2020-21 to 74.38 million tonnes in 2021-22.

In the challenging business environment, with the commitment and hard work of CONCOR family, your Company

managed to mark yet another year of outstanding performance. During the year 2021-22, CONCOR has handled

highest ever 4 million TEUs as against 3.6 million TEUs in the FY 2020-21, an increase of 12%. It transported 47.69

million tonnes of cargo volume by rail during the year showing 13% increase over previous year. Your Company has

achieved the highest ever revenue from operations of ₹7,594.45 Crores in FY 2021-22 as against ₹6,384.96 crores in

FY 2020-21, an increase of 19% and the net profit was ₹1,062.34 Crores in FY 2021-22 as against ₹503.33 crores in

FY 2020-21, an increase of 111%.

The Company has always followed the policy of rewarding its shareholders in line with its performance. During the

year two interim dividends of 80% (₹4 per share) and 40% (₹2/- per share) on equity share of ₹5 each were paid to

the shareholders and a final dividend of 60% (₹3/- per share) for the FY 2021-22 has been recommended for approval

of shareholders. With this, the total dividend payment for the year, will be amounting to ₹548.36 crores, which is

51.62% of net profit.

In the Union Budget of the year 2022, emphasis has been inter-alia laid on the development of Multi Modal Logistics

Parks (MMLPs), Roads, and Cargo Terminals. Therefore, the importance of the infrastructure and logistics industry

in the nation’s economic growth have been recognized and Government has taken many initiatives in this direction.

The Central Government’s Budget allocation for capital expenditure has been increased by 35% and in this regard,

significant support will also be provided to the State Governments. The work has started on the key pillars for

infrastructure development i.e. National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) and

PM Gati Shakti, which will go a long way for the sustainable development of the Country. The Government’s

initiatives for ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat', setting up target of 25,000 km of new highways, Gati Shakti Masterplan for

expressways, 100 new cargo terminals with Multi Modal Logistic Park and initiatives to connect urban transport to

railways, will give a big boost to logistics facilities across the Country. Further, development of the Unified Logistics

Interface Platform, which allows data exchange among stakeholders, will improve work efficiency in the logistics

sector by providing real-time information to all stakeholders and will improve our international competitiveness.

Further, it has been provided that the provisions of Sub-Sections (2), (3) & (4) of Section 178 regarding appointment,

performance evaluation and remuneration shall not apply to Directors of Government Companies.

was not in compliance with the provisions of SEBI (LODR) Regulations and DPE Guidelines on Corporate

Governance regarding composition of its Board as on 31.03.2022.

The Company has a well laid down procedure for decision making by the Board and its Committees. The

Board/Committee meetings are convened by giving appropriate notice, after securing approval of the Chairman of

the Board/Committee as the case may be. The Agenda notes are given to the Directors well in advance for the

meetings of the Board and Committees thereof for facilitating meaningful, informed and focused decision making at

the meetings. Sometime additional/supplementary agenda item(s) are also permitted. In order to address specific

urgent needs, meetings are also convened at a shorter notice. In case of urgency sometimes, resolutions are also

passed by circulation, which are later noted in the next Board/Committee meeting. The departmental heads/senior

management officials/experts are also invited to provide additional inputs or give presentations on the matters being

discussed in the meetings of the Board/ Committee of the Board. The Meetings of the Board of Directors are normally

held at Registered Office of the Company. The Board meets at least once in a quarter to review the quarterly

our auditor’s report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s

report.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any

form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other

information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is

materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other

information, we are required to communicate the fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial

Statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act,

2013 (“the Act”) with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair

view of the financial position, financial performance, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in

accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the accounting Standards specified

under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in

accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and

detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making

judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate

internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the

accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair

view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to

continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern

basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or

has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with:
