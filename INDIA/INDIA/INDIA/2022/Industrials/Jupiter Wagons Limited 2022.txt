FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT

In this Annual Report, we have disclosed forward-looking information to enable investors to understand our prospects and

take investment decisions. This report and other statements - written and oral - that we periodically make contain forward-

looking statements that set out anticipated results based on the management's plans and assumptions. We have tried

wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as 'anticipate', 'estimate', 'expects', 'projects', 'intends',

'plans', 'believes' and words of similar substance in connection with discussion of future performance.

We cannot guarantee that these forward-looking statements will be realised, although we believe we have been prudent in

making the assumptions. The achievements of results are subject to risks, uncertainties and even inaccurate assumptions.

Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialise or should underlaying assumption prove inaccurate, actual

results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Readers should keep this in mind. We

undertake no obligation to publicly update and forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future

events or otherwise

Managing Director’s Message

As you are aware that by virtue of promulgation of

the necessary orders by the National Company Law

Tribunal, Jupiter Wagons Limited (JWL) has become

the consolidated identity replacing the erstwhile

Commercial Engineers and Body Builders Co. Ltd.

in entirety.

JWL realises the need of the hour to play a

pivotal role in binding the nation by providing for

engineered resources which will contribute towards

mobilisation of commodities and communities across

the country.

In this perspective of mobility, the national

government has already instituted its plans and

schemes under National Rail Plan, Mission ‘3000

Million Tons’ in rail freighting and GATI SHAKTI

programme covering the completion of the freight

corridors project, Vande Bharat Express, Tejas

Express, Vista Dome Coaches, ‘Super Vasuki’ long

haul freight trains, High Capacity & High Speed

Wagons, Kisan Rail, Solar Powered Passenger

Coaches, new Signalling System etc., to bring about

a sea change in human comforts and expectations

throughout the country.

JWL has been resonating in synchronisation with

such modernisation initiatives and has therefore

aggressively oriented its engineering resources and

global footprints to install manufacturing facilities

in the railways, application-based commercial

vehicles, marine containers and electric urban

freight trucks, so on and so forth.

Looking into the prominent necessities as envisaged

by the national experts, JWL has ventured into

setting up of joint venture companies in the fields

of safety systems (High Speed Brake Systems

for passenger and freight), high speed track

components (Weldable CMS Crossing) and electric

powered freight trucks by way of bringing in global

technologies to India aligned with the Aatmanirbhar

Bharat and Make in India programmes.

Jupiter has marked its presence in the North

American Railway by consistently supplying

Explotion -Hardenable Cast Manganese Steel

Crossings, popularly called as Frogs in the USA,

both in as-cast and fully machined conditions. For

the item, Jupiter has acquired prestigious AAR

Certification ( Association of American Railroads).

INDIA SEES A RAY OF HOPE

The union ministry of railways plans to procure 90,000

wagons over the next three years at a cost of nearly

` 31,000 crores, providing a significant boost to the

domestic wagon manufacturing industry. The 90,000

wagon procurement plan is the largest in history and

it is nearly five times the number of wagons procured

by railways in a year. Indian Railways operates over

3,000,000 wagons on its network and is experiencing

a severe shortage of coal-carrying wagons due to

increased demand from thermal power plants during

the summer.

The government has been focusing on boosting

infrastructure and over the next few years, Indian

Railways is expected to come up with large contracts

to upgrade both passenger coaches and wagons. In the

long run, given the government's efforts to improve

the economy and its ambitious plans to improve

infrastructure, demand for freight wagons, commercial

vehicles and containers is expected to remain strong.

THE YEAR IN RETROSPECT

During the year, our revenue from operation

increased to ` 1,17,835.40 lakhs as compared to

` 99,575.02 lakhs in the previous year, a growth of

18.34%. Railway wagons and load bodies components

business continues to grow at a healthy pace and

new product containers also contributed to revenue.

We registered profit before tax and exceptional

items of ` 7,602.00 lakhs, which is 6.45% of revenue

from operation as compared to previous year profit

of ` 6,589.75 lakhs, a surge of ` 1,012.25 lakhs. We

currently have an order book of close to ` 4,000 crores

for wagons, primarily coming from Indian Railways

and some other private entities. The merger will result

in synergies between business operations, allowing for

more efficient cash management.

We want to be a complete mobility solutions provider.

We are foraying into the manufacture of metro

and high-speed trains in partnership with Spanish

firm Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles

(CAF). We will collaborate with them to establish

a manufacturing facility in India to produce metro

coaches, urban mass rapid transit systems and

mainline high-speed trains.

With the launch of 'Jupiter Electric Mobility' (JEM), we

recently entered the electric mobility market, focusing

on commercial EV vehicles. We have partnered with

EA GreenPower Pvt Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of

GreenPower Motor Company Inc. We hope to support

the technology assets of both organisations through

the JV with GreenPower by generating safety and

sustainability in the EV market. GreenPower is one of

the largest commercial EV manufacturers. We aim to

launch a seven-tonne vehicle by the start of the next

calendar year. With the introduction of 'Jupiter Electric

Mobility,' we hope to make a significant contribution

to vehicle electrification by reducing dependence on

fossil fuels as the source of energy and simultaneously

reducing the carbon foot-prints in urban/up-

country regions and improving upon conservation of

environment.

During the year, we have specifically focused on

upgrading the IT infrastructure. We have implemented

SAP to replace the legacy ERP system. We are also

in the process to upgrade the IT infrastructure with

necessary modern technology and cloud solutions for

the Company.

In fact, the Company has been in the forefront of

implementing Industry 4.0. The goal is to develop

processes and products by adopting the best practices

and to ensure long term sustainability.

Through a variety of alliances and partnerships we

have improved our ability to respond to opportunities,

enabling us to combine some of the most pioneering

technologies in the world with our extensive

infrastructure.

In the future, we will continue to build on our solid

foundation and accomplishments. We know where we

are headed and, to a large extent, how we are going to

get there. As we improve and implement our strategies,

we will incrementally advance our strategic framework

for long-term shareholder value creation.

11) RISKMANAGEMENT

The management and members of the Board

review the business periodically to identify

ongoing factors that affect the business and also

changes in external environment, which are likely

to impact the Company. The management has

foreseen certain risks and took steps to mitigate

the risks. The following are the key risks and the

mitigation approach.

Cyclicality of the commercial vehicle industry:

The demand for heavy vehicles is closely linked

to overall industrial growth and is vulnerable to

cyclicality in the commercial vehicle industry. In

addition to rationalizing the production capacities

(as already mentioned), the company is focusing on

increasing the revenue from other businesses such

as wagons, heavy fabrication for power plant, water

tankers, load bodies for automotive vehicle used by

defense and Containers.

Raw material costs: Steel accounts for major

portion of the raw material costs. The company

has centralized the steel procurement function

with the objective of leveraging the volumes to

get better prices and is focusing on other cost

control measures.

Competition: The Company depends on load body

business from certain OEM customers. These OEMs

have developed more than one supplier to minimize

their risk. There is risk of change in OEM policy of

with reference to suppliers. The company follows

a policy of working closely with select OEMs to

enhance its share of business. Further, the company

continues to focus on orders from certain dealers.

Irregular order flows from heavy fabrication

business: The Company will get affected in case

there are irregular order flows from capital goods

industries requiring heavy fabrication. However,

the Company’s plant is fungible and can be used for

the manufacture of other products.

Increase in interest rate/cost: Any increase in

interest rate will adversely affect the company.

The company is exploring ways and means to

The analysis of performance is explained below

a)

During the year revenue from operation increased

to ` 1,17,835.40 lakhs as compared to ` 99,575.02

lakhs in the previous year, a growth of 18.34%.

Railway Wagons and Load bodies components

business continues to grow at a healthy pace,

and new products containers also contributed

in revenue.

b)

Raw material cost has increased to 76.11% of

revenue as compared to previous year 74.48% of

revenue, mainly due to product mix and increase in

cost of steel and other steel components.

c)

Employee cost and other operating expenses

increased as compared to previous year, mainly

on volume growth and in line with increase in

sales volume. However, as percentage of revenue,

employee cost increased by 0.24%, primarily

due to yearly increments, higher staff welfare

expenses, and due to change in actuarial estimated

owing to change in discounting rates and other

operating cost decreased by 0.88%, mainly due to

operational efficiency.

d)

Consequent to above, the operating profit in terms

of % to revenue lowered to 9.69% from 10.68%

last year

e)

Finance cost has decreased significantly by

` 295.25 lakh (13.98%) as compared to previous

year, primarily on account of lower interest

rate on borrowings and greater efficiency in

treasury management.

6) BORROWINGS

As on 31-03-2022, the Company has outstanding

long-term debt of ` 4,225.36 lakhs, cash credit &

working capital demand loan of ` 9,377.57 lakh

and unsecured bill discounting liabilities (with

recourse) of ` 271.94 lakh. The average interest rate

of long-term debt was 13.00 % to 7.75 % per annum.

Considering the debt servicing requirement for

the year, the Company is reasonably confident of

meeting these, subject to severe and unforeseen

changes in situation.:

tighten its working capital in order lower working

capital finance.

Delay in execution of orders: Delays in execution

of orders (particularly orders obtained through

competitive tenders) can have a negative impact

on profitability. The Company continues to monitor

closely the execution of orders.

Dependence on Railways: IR being the major

customer for Wagons, any adverse impact on budget

allocation of Railways will impact the order flow.

The Company has mitigated this risk partly by

developing wagons for private operators.

12) INTERNALCONTROLSYSTEM

The Company has an established and comprehensive

internal control mechanism and management

structure in place across all locations and business

functions that ensure the Company’s assets

are safeguarded against all and any loss from

unauthorized use or disposal.

The documentation of Internal Control over

Financial Reporting is in place and the management

has undertaken effectiveness test of the system.

Internal Control systems are implemented:

a)

To safeguard the Company’s assets from loss

or damage.

b)

To keep constant check on cost structure and

process loss.

c)

To provide adequate financial and accounting

controls for preparation and reporting of

financial performance and state of affairs, in

accordance with Accounting Standards.

d)

To maintain proper accounting record and

statutory compliances.

The systematic implementation of Internal Control

Systems and policies has resulted in the use of funds

in the most efficient and appropriate manner.

Company, as per the Management Representation: Letter issued by the Company of even date.

We have also examined compliance with the applicable

clauses of the following:

(i) Secretarial Standards issued by The Institute of

Company Secretaries of India and approved by the

Central Government.

(ii) Listing Agreement pursuant to Securities and

and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015

entered into by the Company with BSE Limited and

National Stock Exchange of India Limited (both the

two stock exchanges are hereinafter collectively

referred to as the ‘Sock Exchanges’).

During the period under review the Company has

generally complied with the provisions of the Act, Rules,

Regulations, Guidelines, Standards, etc. mentioned above

subject to the observation that Mr. Prakash Yashwant

Gurav was chairman in total 6 (six) committees which

exceeded the prescribed limit of being a chairman in 5

(five) committees across all listed company as prescribed

under Regulation 26(1) of Securities And Exchange

Board Of India (Listing Obligations And Disclosure

Requirements) Regulations, 2015 from the period

5th April, 2021 to 7th July, 2021. However, Mr. Prakash

Yashwant Gurav in compliance with Regulation 26(1)

of Securities And Exchange Board Of India (Listing

Obligations And Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,

2015 has stepped down from the

letter of law but also from the Company’s

inherent belief in doing compliance the right way.

Over the years, the Company has complied with the

principles of Corporate Governance emphasizing

on transparency, empowerment, accountability

and integrity. These have helped the Company

to enhance its stakeholder values. The Company

has been demonstrating the highest Corporate

Governance principles since inception and is

striving to improve them continually by setting its

standard in line with the best Corporate Governance

practices in the world. It is, therefore, not merely

about enacting regulations and procedures but also

about establishing an environment of trust and

confidence among various stakeholders. Corporate

Governance is about commitment to values, ethical

business conduct and transparency thus ensuring

honest and professional business practices.

The Company’s policy on Corporate Governance is

based on the principles of full disclosure, fairness,

equity, transparency and accountability in the

various aspects of its functioning, leading to the

protection of the stakeholders’ interest and an

enduring relationship with stakeholders. The

Management’s commitment to these principles

is reinforced through the adherence of all

Corporate Governance practices embodied in the

regulations of SEBI (Listing Obligation & Disclosure

Requirements) Regulations, 2015. The Company’s

Corporate Governance philosophy is based on

maintaining transparency and a high degree of

disclosure levels. This philosophy of the Company

has been further strengthened with the adoption

of the Code of Conduct for Board of Directors

and Senior Management of the Company, Code of

Conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading and Code

of Practices and Procedures for Fair Disclosure of

Unpublished Price Sensitive Information

ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES

a.

Statement of compliance

The Company has prepared its financial statements

to comply in all material respects with the

provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act)

and rules framed thereunder, and the guidelines

issued by Securities and Exchange Board of India.

notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to

The financial statements have been prepared on an

except for the following assets and liabilities:

i)

Certain financial assets and liabilities that are

measured at fair value

ii)

The financial statements were authorised for

issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on 30

Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on

accrual and going concern basis under historical cost

convention except for certain financial instruments

and plan assets, which are measured at fair values

and accounting for business combination carried

out by the Company during the period (as more fully

explained in note 51). The accounting policies are

applied consistently to all the periods presented in

the financial statements.



Currentversusnon-currentclassification

All assets and liabilities have been classified as

current or non-current as per the Company’s

normal operating cycle and as per terms of

agreements wherever applicable which is period of

Company operates i.e., functional currency, to be

Indian Rupees (`). The financial statements are

presented in ` lakhs, which is Company’s functional

d.

Revenuerecognition

Sale of goods

Revenue arises mainly from the sale of goods.

To determine whether to recognise revenue, the

Company follows a 5-step process:

(i) Identifying the contract with a customer

(ii) Identifying the performance obligations

(iii) Determining the transaction price

(iv) Allocating the transaction price to the

performance obligations

(v) Recognising revenue when/as performance

obligation(s) are satisfied.

The Company considers the terms of the contract

and its customary business practices to determine

the transaction price. The transaction price is the

amount of consideration to which the Company

expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring

promised goods to a customer, excluding amounts

collected on behalf of third parties (for example,

indirect taxes). The consideration promised in

a contract with a customer may include fixed

consideration, variable consideration (if reversal is

less likely in future), or both. Revenue is measured

at fair value of consideration received or receivable,

after deduction of any trade discounts, volume

rebates, price concessions and incentives.:

BASISOFPREPARATIONANDSIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES

a.

Statement of compliance

The Holding Company has prepared its consolidated

financial statements to comply in all material

respects with the provisions of the Companies Act,

2013 (the Act) and rules framed thereunder, and the

guidelines issued by Securities and Exchange Board

of India. In accordance with the notification issued

by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the Group has

adopted Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)

notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to

time) under Section 133 of the Act.

The consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on an accrual basis using the historical

cost convention, except for the following assets

and liabilities:

i)

Certain financial assets and liabilities that are

measured at fair value

ii)

Defined benefit plans-plan assets measured at

fair value

The consolidated financial statements were

authorised for issue by the Group's Board of

Directors on 30 May 2022.

b.

Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on accrual and going concern basis under

historical cost convention except for certain financial

instruments and plan assets, which are measured at

fair values and accounting for business combination

carried out by the Group during the period (as more

fully explained in note 51). The accounting policies

are applied consistently to all the periods presented

in the consolidated financial statements.

Current versus non-current classification

All assets and liabilities have been classified as

current or non-current as per the Group’s normal

operating cycle and as per terms of agreements

wherever applicable which is period of twelve

months. Deferred tax assets and liabilities

are classified as non-current assets and non-

current liabilities.

c.

Basis of consolidation

Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured

entities) over which the Group has control. The

Group controls an entity when the Group is

exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from

its involvement with the entity and has the ability

to affect those returns through its power to direct

the relevant activities of the entity. The Group can

have power over the investee even if it owns less

than majority voting rights i.e. rights arising from

other contractual arrangements. Subsidiaries are

fully consolidated from the date on which control is

transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated

from the date that control ceases. Statement of profit

and loss (including other comprehensive income

(‘OCI’)) of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of

during the period are recognised from the effective

date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of

disposal, as applicable.

The Group combines the financial statements of the

Company and its subsidiaries line by line adding

together like items of assets, liabilities, equity,

income and expenses. Intercompany transactions,

balances and unrealised gains on transactions

between group companies are eliminated.

Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been

changed where necessary to ensure consistency

with the policies adopted by the Group.

Non-controlling interests, presented as part of

equity, represents the portion of a subsidiary’s

statement of profit and loss and net assets that is

not held by the Group. Statement of profit and loss

(including other comprehensive income (‘OCI’)) is

attributed to the equity holders of the Group and to:
