ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22:

Dear Shareholders,

The year gone by saw us sailing through

repeated Covid-19 waves, geopolitical

concerns, high input costs and elevated

inflation. We sailed through these

headwinds, because of the resilience

of our employees and our strong

relationships with customers. During

the year, the Kirlosar Group undertook a

refresh exercise for our brand and adopted

a new business vision of Limitless, which

will inspire us to push our limits farther to

create exceptional value for all.

Seeking opportunities

amid challenges

The fiscal year saw a rapid hike in raw

material costs. We optimised our input

costs by adopting leaner measures and

passing on our learnings to our partners.

Further on the raw material price hikes

were passed on to the customers in a

phased manner. This helped us retain our

margins and profitability levels.

Another challenge of mounting coal and

power costs was tackled through our

recently commissioned coke oven plant.

This plant takes care of most of our coke

and energy requirements.

Enhancing capacities

and capabilities

In spite of the pandemic, we have been

consistently maintaining our growth

trajectory. All the expansion projects are

moving as planned. These projects are

mainly focused on capacity expansion

and cost optimization in the existing

manufacturing plants.

During the year KFIL acquired around

51% stake in Indian Seamless Metal

Tube (ISMT) Ltd thereby taking the

management control of the same. This

acquisition is a strategic addition to

KFIL’s current product portfolio. The ISMT

products, seamless pipes and value-

added steel products have diversified our

existing product mix. We are very positive

about the prospects this business will

bring for us.

Financial performance

We delivered robust financial performance

in this fiscal year, near-term pressures

notwithstanding, the company has

maintained a 15% CAGR on the top line

and bottom line. Our revenues for the

standalone business grew by 77% with

42% growth in EBITDA. The net profit

stood at H 406 Crore for the year FY 2022.

Fuelling our growth aspirations

Going forward, we will continue our focus

on collaborating with our customers

in producing premium engine, vehicle

and tractor parts that are on par with

international standards. Our goal is to

become a billion-US dollar company and

we are advancing towards our goals with

renewed vigour.

The growth of an organisation can only

be achieved through the growth of its

people. To that end, we aspire to keep

motivating our people and developing

in-house competencies through diligent

training programs. I also want to take

this opportunity to thank our team for

their dedication and commitment to

create value for our customers and other

stakeholders.

Before I conclude, I must extend my

gratitude to our customers, partners,

community and shareholders for being a

critical part of our invigorating journey.

Regards,

Atul Kirloskar

In spite of the

pandemic, we have

been consistently

maintaining our

growth trajectory.

We are on schedule

for the expansion

projects planned so

far. These projects

are mainly focused

on capacity increase

and cost optimization

in the existing

manufacturing

plants.

Managing Director who makes strategic decisions.

Identification of Segments

The Company’s operating business predominantly

relates to manufacture of iron castings.

u) Government Grant

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair

value where there is a reasonable assurance that the

grant will be received and the Company will comply with

all attached conditions.

Government grants relating to income are deferred and

recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss over the

period necessary to match them with the costs that they are

intended to compensate and presented within other income.

140

Kirloskar Ferrous Industries Limited

A Kirloskar Group Company

ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22:

Managing Director being the Chief

Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to assess performance and

allocate resources. The standard also requires Management

to make judgments with respect to recognition of segments.

Accordingly, the Company recognizes Iron Castings as its sole

Segment.

Contingent liability

The Company has received various orders and notices from

different Government authorities and tax authorities in

respect of direct taxes and indirect taxes. The outcome of

these matters may have a material effect on the financial

position, results of operations or cash flows. Management

regularly analyses current information about these matters

and discloses the information relating to contingent liability.

In making the decision regarding the need for creating loss

provision, management considers the degree of probability

of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a

sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of loss. The filing

of a suit or formal assertion of a claim against the Company

or the disclosure of any such suit or assertions, does not

automatically indicate that a provision of a loss may be

appropriate.

Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key

sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that

have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to

the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next

financial year, are described below. The Company based its

estimates and assumptions on parameters available when the

financial statements are prepared. Existing circumstances

and assumptions about future developments, however, may

change due to market conditions or circumstances arising

that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes

are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

Defined benefit obligation

The cost of the defined benefit plans and other

post-employment benefits and the present value of the

obligations are determined using actuarial valuation.

An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions

that may differ from actual developments in the future.

These include the determination of the discount rate, future

salary increases, mortality rates and future post-retirement

medical benefit increase. Due to the complexities involved

in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit

obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.

All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate.

In determining the appropriate discount rate, management

considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies

consistent with the currencies of the post-employment

benefit obligations and extrapolated as needed along the yield

curve to correspond with the expected term of the defined

benefit obligation.

The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality

tables. Those mortality tables tend to change only at intervals

in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases

are based on the expected future inflation rates for the

country.

Further details about defined benefit obligations are provided

in the respective note.

Deferred Tax

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary

differences including the carry forward of unused tax credits

and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised

to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be

available against which the deductible temporary differences,

and the carry forward of unused tax credits are unused tax

losses can be utilized.

Useful lives of Property, plant and equipment

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment are dependent

upon an assessment of both the technical lives of the assets

and also their likely economic lives based on various internal

and external factors including relative efficiency and operating

costs. The depreciable lives are reviewed annually using the

best information available to the Management.

Estimation and underlying assumptions are reviewed

on ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised

prospectively.

The Commodity Price Risk is managed without any

hedging of commodities by the Company.

Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost :

The management believes that the fair values of non-current financial assets (e.g. loans and others), current financial assets (e.g., cash

and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and others excluding other derivative assets), non-current liabilities and current financial

liabilities (e.g. trade payables and other payables excluding derivative liabilities) approximate their carrying amounts.

38 Financial instruments risk management objectives and policies

The Company's activities exposes it to market risks, credit risks and liquidity risks. In order to minimise any adverse effects on the financial

performance of the Company , derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contract are entered to hedge the foreign

currency risk exposures. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as a trading or speculative purposes.

Government Grant

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair

value where there is a reasonable assurance that the

grant will be received and the Group will comply with all

attached conditions.

Government grants relating to income are deferred and

recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss over the

period necessary to match them with the costs that they are

intended to compensate and presented within other income.

When loans or similar assistance are provided by

governments or related institutions, with an interest

rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect

of this favourable interest is regarded as a government

grant. The loan or assistance is initially recognized and

measured at fair value and the government grant is

measured as the difference between the initial carrying

value of the loan and the proceeds received. The loan

is subsequently measured as per accounting policy

applicable to financial liabilities.
