CONTRACTS SECURED IN INDIA AND ABROAD

I am delighted to share with you the 46th Annual Report

of your Company for FY 2021-22, which has been yet

another year of impressive performance. It is a matter

of great pride that your Company has displayed a

good overall performance despite the pandemic led

adverse market scenario faced at the beginning of the

year. On a standalone basis, your Company has clocked

an all-time high total turnover of `7181 Crore (previous

year `5200.31 Crore) registering an increase of

38.09%; also on a consolidated basis, total turnover

registered a record increase of 37.76% in the history of

IRCON and stood at `7585.71 Crore (previous year

`5506.45 Crore).

Apart from recording the highest ever total turnover, we

have also recorded highest ever operating turnover of

`6910 Crore in FY 2021-22, as against `4956 Crore in

company are in varied sectors viz. railway electrification,

highway project, metro track works, workshops, airports

and renewable energy. Your company has also secured

Civil and Track works packages in the prestigious High

Ministry of Railways, eliminating award of contracts on

nomination basis, the range and value of new business

secured by the company is commendable and value of the

order book as on June 30, 2022 stood at `42,066 Crore

(approx.).

Your Company has more than 50 projects in its portfolio,

including 5 international projects in Bangladesh, Algeria,

Sri Lanka, Nepal & Myanmar. We continue to actively

participate in new projects across industry segments in the

domestic front to capture healthy profit margins. The

Company has forayed into the renewable power sector to

establish a 500 MW solar power plant through a joint

venture. With its endeavour to enhance its portfolio in

international market, the Company is aggressively pursuing

foreign projects funded through Line of Credit / other
