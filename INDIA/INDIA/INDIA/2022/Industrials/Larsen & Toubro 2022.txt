Dear Shareholders

Robust self-belief and resilience are the key to success in

times of uncertainty and challenge. This spirit has helped

India contend with an unprecedented pandemic and,

in rapid succession, a war in Europe with its attendant

disruptions. It is indeed creditable that amidst these

in times of challenge.

macroeconomic and geopolitical upheavals, India has

managed to stay the course in its quest for growth. Your

Company has also performed well while operating within

the given constraints. At this juncture, we wish to reiterate

our commitment to advance the interests of our country

and express our solidarity with the nation and

its leadership.

Business Scenario

FY 2021-22 was an economic roller coaster with the

impact of recurring bouts of COVID-19 and global disquiet

counter-balanced to some extent by Country’s economic

resilience. Regular government spending throughout

the year complemented by liquidity easing measures

by the Reserve Bank of India prevented the risk of an

economic meltdown and helped bolster the confidence of

households and private companies.

An improved borrowing programme for the Centre and

State Governments also meant that the spending proposals

envisaged in the Budget continued unhindered. Most of

the high frequency, mobility and service indicators gained

momentum as the easing of pandemic curbs saw demand

regaining lost ground before geopolitical tensions erupted

to set the clock back once again.

After years of stagnation, India witnessed a pick-up

in exports in FY 2021-22. Consequently, the economy

expanded at 8.7% in real GDP terms vis-à-vis a contraction

in the previous financial year.

India is expected to post top quartile growth among

emerging nations in the medium term. Challenges

hovering on the horizon include runaway oil prices, supply

chain disruptions and the US rate hikes affecting capital

flows into India. Despite these roadblocks, however, our

view is that the bold structural reforms carried out by

the Government in the last couple of years will pave the

way for improved quality of growth. A slew of incentive

schemes launched by the Government should stimulate

manufacturing and exports in our run up to becoming a

USD 5 trillion economy. Leveraging its expertise in high-

tech manufacturing, your Company is well-positioned to

take advantage of the opportunities as they unfold.

Managing Director of the Company for a period of

five years, with effect from July 1, 2017 upto and including

June 30, 2022.

On the recommendation of the Nomination &

Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors of

the Company at its Meeting held on May 12, 2022,

re-appointed Mr. S. N. Subrahmanyan (DIN: 02255382),

as Chief Executive Officer and: Managing Director of the

Company with effect from July 1, 2022, upto and including

June 30, 2027, subject to the approval of the members in

the Annual General Meeting.

Mr. S. N. Subrahmanyan, 62, is a civil engineer with post

graduate qualification in business management. He joined

L&T in 1984 starting off as project planning engineer

and was soon handpicked for senior responsibilities. He

is responsible for leading the Company’s considerable

business interests to new growth levels, riding on the

enormous benefits of digitalisation, big data, and predictive

analysis that he drives internally with exceptional zeal. He

places a premium on innovation, project management and

talent development, particularly in leadership roles.

Under his leadership, he has transformed L&T into a

Company that executes a wide range of projects at speed

and scale.

Apart from completing several challenging infrastructure

projects across verticals over the years, he has played a

crucial role in securing and managing EPC contracts for

the construction of four major international airports in

India at Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Delhi and Mumbai. Among

his list of accomplishments are the mandates to build

the tallest statue in the world – the Statue of Unity - and

the development of dedicated freight corridors that will

realign the dynamics of freight movement in the country.

The construction division is among the top 30 global

contractors and by far the largest construction organisation

in the country.

Largely responsible for establishing L&T Construction

as a significant EPC player in the Middle East,

Mr. Subrahmanyan has spearheaded and won several large

projects in Oman, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. The

Riyadh Metro project is one of the largest international

orders bagged by L&T thus far; while the Doha Metro, the

AL-Wakrah Road Project both in Qatar and the Abu Dhabi

Airport airside works have been won in the face of stiff

international competition. He has also led the spread into

Africa and L&T Construction is making its presence felt

especially in North and East Africa.

He holds positions of pre-eminence on various industry

bodies, construction institutions and councils. In February

2021, he was appointed

Managing Director for a period of

five years from July 1, 2022 upto and including June 30,

2027. During the period of this agreement and so long

The Power business of the Company is into

construction and commissioning of power

plants. Boilers/Turbines are a critical component

of the power plant and hence procurement

of boilers/turbines is in the ordinary course of

business for the Company.

LMB/LMTG is a joint venture between the

Company and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries

(MHI) and is part of the technical collaboration

in construction and commissioning of power

plants.

While bidding for a project, the technical

qualifications of MHI adds to the pre-

qualifications of the Company. The Company

is charged a price comparable with what LMB/

LMTG charges to its other customers. Hence the

transaction is at arm’s length.

The Company also avails infrastructure and

business support services with respect to boilers

and turbine generators from LMB and LMTG

respectively.

These entities operate from common

campus(es) across the country and expenses

related to the same are apportioned by the

Company to LMB and LMTG.

specifications. As far

as Indian projects

are concerned, the

b) Vigil Mechanism / Whistle Blower Policy:

The Company has a Whistle Blower Policy in

place since April 2004. The said policy was

modified in line with the requirements of the

Vigil Mechanism under the Companies Act, 2013

and subsequently in 2018 to include reporting

of instances of leakage of unpublished price

sensitive information as per SEBI (Prohibition of

Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018.

The Company has a Whistle Blower Investigation

Committee (WBIC) to manage complaints from

“Identified” Whistle Blowers. In addition, WBIC

considers “Anonymous” complaints which in

their judgement are serious in nature and require

investigation. The WBIC has five members viz.

Chief Financial Officer, Company Secretary,

Head-Corporate HR, Chief Internal Auditor and

a senior Finance and Accounts person from

business. The WBIC is responsible for end-to-end

management of the investigations, from the time

of receipt of complaints to bringing them to a

logical conclusion, keeping in mind the interest of

the Company. Suitable actions are taken against

employees, wherever investigation confirms the

allegations.

Employees are encouraged to report any acts of

unacceptable behaviour inconsistent with the

Company’s Code of Conduct, having an adverse

effect on the Company’s financials / image and

instances of sharing of unpublished price sensitive

information. An employee can report any such

conduct in oral or written form. Whistle-blowers

are assured by the management of full protection

from any kind of harassment, retaliation,

victimization, or unfair treatment.

Complaints under the Whistle Blower Policy

are received by the Corporate Audit Services of

the Company from various sources. The Chief

Internal Auditor reviews the same and after

screening the complaint, decides on the further

course of action which will include requesting

the complainant to provide further details,

internal investigation by the CAS department,

investigation by external agencies, wherever

necessary, opportunity to the defendant to

present his / her case, etc. Based on the findings

of the investigation, the Corporate Audit Services

takes the approval of WBIC for the action

recommended by them to be taken.

The WBIC is appraised periodically on the

complaints received, current status, actions

contemplated and closure of the cases. The

WBIC reviews the complaints and their progress.

Queries by the WBIC members are immediately

attended to by CAS and the implementation of

the recommended action are undertaken by the

respective HR/Accounts Departments.

The policy provides for adequate safeguards

against victimisation of persons who blow the

whistle and also provides for direct access to

the Chairperson of the Audit Committee. The

Audit Committee of the Company oversees the

implementation of the Whistle-Blower Policy.

The Audit Committee is periodically briefed about

the various cases received, the status of the

investigation, findings and action taken, if any and

a comprehensive update is provided semi-annually

which is presented and discussed at the Audit

Committee Meeting.

The Company has zero tolerance towards breach

of Code of Conduct and to this extent, the

Company has built a robust framework around

the Whistle Blower mechanism to actively address

all complaints received.

The Company also has a separate Whistle Blower

Policy for its vendors and channel partners. This

policy provides all stakeholders an opportunity

to report genuine concerns about unethical

behaviour, improper practices, misconduct, any

violation of legal or regulatory requirements,

actual or suspected fraud, without fear of

punishment or unfair treatment. The details

of the same are available on the Company’s
