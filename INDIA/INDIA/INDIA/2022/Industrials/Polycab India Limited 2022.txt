FY22 highlights

Evolving

through excellence.

Transforming

with focus.

At Polycab India Limited (Polycab), product and

process innovations have played a pivotal role in our

journey of delivering excellence and staying ahead

of the curve. An established player in the Indian

electricals space, we have raised the bar higher by

breaking new grounds with modern design, value

for money and high-quality products that are in

sync with the changing aspirations of customers

and shifting market dynamics. To fully unlock

potential and get closer to realising our purpose, we

have embarked on a multi-year transformational

journey aimed at taking our growth story to a higher

trajectory while emphasising on governance and

sustainability.

With a clear goal of surpassing ₹200 billion in sales

by FY26, we are focusing on diversification-led

growth and enhancing brand recall across product

categories. We aim to increase our direct presence

in lower tier towns as well as new countries globally,

while providing a diverse range of world-class

products to our channel partners, enabling them to

achieve long-term sustainable growth.

Customer-centricity, digitalisation, and a sharper

focus on environment, sustainability and governance

aspects will continue to drive our strategic decisions

over the long term.

Managing Director

empowers them through an environment

of constant learning and emphasis

on developing their capabilities in the

personal and professional spheres. This

is what makes us an employer of choice

for both experienced professionals and

fresh graduates. In a competitive talent

market, we have continued to differentiate

ourselves with a people-focused, purpose-

driven culture and cutting-edge career

development opportunities for employees.

As part of our transformational journey, we

are bolstering the organisation structure

by retaining and recruiting best-in-class

talent. We will champion our renewed

purpose of innovating for a brighter living

and be guided in our thoughts and actions

by our ‘i-POWER’ values that will help us

enrich the lives of everyone connected

with Polycab.

Winning with new products

We continue to map our portfolio against

evolving customer needs and the dynamic

market situation to craft a portfolio that

acts as a lever to promote our growth

ambitions. We have thus revised our

product pipeline. We are governed by

the New Product Development (NPD )

council to ensure that innovation remains

the fulcrum of our organisation’s growth.

Quality has always played an important

role in our brand salience, and we will

continue to strengthen this distinction.

Winning in markets

We leverage our wide and deeply

entrenched pan-India distribution network

to drive growth in existing and new

businesses. Our go-to-market initiatives

have enabled us to establish direct

presence in nearly twice as many towns as

last year. The new Emerging India vertical

will help us serve customers in semi-

urban and rural areas where availability

of high-quality products is a challenge.

We are also diversifying our channels

with the shifting demand centres.

Currently, over 600 Polycab products

are available on major e-commerce

portals. We took a bold structural step

to merge Heavy Duty & Light Duty

Cables verticals in order to unlock value

through cross selling opportunities and

operational proficiencies.

We also actively engage with influencers

consisting of electricians, architects,

interior designers and contractors. We

scaled up our digital capabilities through

the ‘Experts’ programme and increased

direct coverage of tertiary sales. We aim

to be the pioneers in the FMEG industry

in building a deep connect with its key

influencers, who will serve for us as a

critical competitive barrier.

Winning with technology

We have been at the forefront of

technology adoption and intervention,

which have helped us improve customer

experience and convenience. The

lockdowns tested the efficacy of our IT

infrastructure as well as digital platforms.

Digitalisation has been a core focus area

for us and we recently successfully piloted

the end-to-end digitalisation of front-end

sales across businesses in key markets.

Full-scale rollout of this measure is being

currently executed on a war footing. Over

the next few years, we intend to digitalise

our entire distribution ecosystem which will

help us reinvent our way of functioning.

The year also saw us implement Internet

of Things, Artificial Intelligence-Machine

Learning-led processes and advanced

analytics to simplify and automate our

processes. Our continued investments in

building capacities, deploying state-of-

the-art technologies, have supplemented

our robust R&D and seamless backend

integration, and strengthened our brand

position, enabling us to stay ahead of the

curve. We are striving to deliver on our

brand promise of establishing a connect

with the end consumer that lasts for

generations, and technology is a powerful

enabler in realising this vision.

Outlook

Our concerted drive across several

aspects, be it product innovation, supply

chain integration, cost optimisation and

others have strengthened our market

position across businesses. Although the

economic environment remains fraught,

given the recent challenges caused by

the pandemic, the long-term growth

opportunities remain favourable for us.

Rising incomes and changes in customer

behaviour have resulted in growing

customer preference for sustainable

products and brands that guarantee

quality. This has contributed to the

expansion of organised players like us.

For us, growth has never been about

numbers. As a responsible corporate

leader, we have remained aware of our

social responsibilities and have delivered

on them by creating opportunities for the

socially disadvantaged. We will continue

to promote this social objective while

endeavouring to deliver value to our other

stakeholders by growing responsibly. A

robust cash generation ability and a strong

balance sheet have sustained us through

the business cycles. I hope our growth

strategy, encapsulated in Project Leap, will

help us realise our long-term aspirations.

We continue to focus on Environment

Social and Governance (ESG) priorities.

The efficient use of water and energy from

cleaner sources and zero tolerance for

fatalities at our facilities continue to be our

primary focus areas.

Looking ahead

I would like to thank all our stakeholders,

including customers, investors, business

partners, and employees, for their

continued trust and support. We look

forward to another year of triumphant

performance, supported by our

unrelenting pursuit of excellence.

The standalone as well as the consolidated financial statement

have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting

Standards (Ind AS).

During the year PIL posted a consolidated turnover of ` 1,22,038

million rising by ` 34,116 million YoY from ` 87,922 million in

the previous year. The consolidated EBITDA (excluding other

income) and profit after tax stood at ` 12,626 million and

` 9,173 million as against ` 11,117 million and ` 8,859 million

in the previous year. FY22 was a year full of challenges, but

the Company achieved several significant milestones. Overall

top-line surpassed ` 120 billion clocking 17% CAGR in last

5 years. Exports became a sustainable ` 9 billion business

making Polycab, the largest exporter of cables and wires in

India. FMEG is now a ` 12 billion franchise. The business also

churned out record cash with negligible debt levels.

Although the year started with the second wave marked by

sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, however the impact on day-to-

day life as well business was relatively lesser than the first

wave on account of well calibrated lockdown and successful

vaccination drive. The economy saw a steady uptick from Q2

FY22 onwards. Macro indicators such as GST collections, E-way

bills, Index for Industrial Production (IIP), Core industries index

amongst others continued to scale new highs. Real GDP growth

in Q3 FY22 stood at 5.4% YoY on a positive base. Such favorable

macro-economic factors coupled with an accommodative

stance adopted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) resulted

in highest amount of fresh investment announcements seen

in last 15 years. Furthermore, policy reforms like National

Infrastructure Pipeline, Gati Shakti - National Master

Plan, Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, amongst

others, is likely to provide a strong impetus to public capital

investments as well as domestic manufacturing. Moreover,

we believe India’s immense consumption potential underlined

by favourable demographics, rising incomes, urbanisation and

technological advancements forms the bedrock of long-term

structural growth

Wires and Cables revenue grew strongly by 41% YoY to

` 1,06,953 million, accounting for 87% of total sales in FY22. A

combination of internal and external factors including strong

focus on execution, proactive investment in key areas like

distribution expansion, pricing actions, digitalization coupled

with governments strong focus on driving economic growth

and structural reforms have resulted in a healthy double-digit

volume as well as market share gains for Polycab in the wires

and cables segment. Unprecedented volatility in key input

costs and disruptions led by two waves of COVID pandemic

posed as key headwinds during the year. FMEG business

revenue stood at ` 12,544 million, as against ` 10,341 million

in FY21, posting a 21% YoY growth in sales led by strategic

interventions, distribution expansion as well as improving

demand environment. Over the past five years this business

has clocked 30% CAGR and healthy market share gains across

most categories, all the while enduring stiff competition and

pandemic led disruptions. The business contributed 10% to

consolidated top-line. The Company is committed to achieving

2x of industry growth and 12% annualized EBITDA margin in

this business by FY26.

The Company has seen significant inflation in almost all of

the raw materials used to manufacture wires, cables and

FMEG. Prices of key inputs swelled by 20% to 70%, on an

average, during the year. This was largely led by supply chain

disruptions, recovering demand following the pandemic,

various government policies and rise of clean energy

ecosystem. Copper prices were elevated on account of lower

Corporate information

Polycab India Limited (the “Company”) (CIN -

L31300GJ1996PLC114183) was incorporated as ‘Polycab Wires

Private Limited’ on 10 January 1996 at Mumbai as a private

limited company under the Companies Act, 1956. The Company

limited company under Section 43A(2A) of the Companies

Act, 1956, and the word ‘private’ was added in the name of

the Company with effect from 15 June 2001. Subsequently, the

and consequently, a fresh certificate of incorporation dated

29 August 2018 was issued by the Registrar of Companies,

National Capital Territory of Delhi and Haryana (“ROC”),

recording the change of the Company’s name to ‘Polycab Wires

Limited’. Thereafter, the name of the Company was changed

statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 and authorised

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

A) Basis of preparation

i.

Statement of compliance:

The Group prepares its Consolidated financial

statements to comply with the accounting

standards specified under Section 133 of the

Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian

Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended

from time to time. These Consolidated financial

statements includes Balance Sheet as at 31 March

2022, the Statement of Profit and Loss including

Other Comprehensive Income, Statement of Cash

flows and Statement of changes in equity for

the year ended 31 March 2022, and a summary

of significant accounting policies and other

explanatory information (together hereinafter

referred to as “Financial Statements”).

ii.

Basis of measurement:

The financial statements for the year ended 31

March 2022 have been prepared on an accrual

basis and a historical cost convention, except

for the following financial assets and liabilities

which have been measured at fair value or

amortised cost at the end of each reporting

period:

(a)

Derivative financial instruments

(b)

Certain financial assets and liabilities

(Refer note 41 for accounting policy

regarding financial instruments)

(c) Net defined benefit plan (Refer note 31

for accounting policy)

(d) Share Based Payments (Refer note 31 for

accounting policy)

Historical cost is generally based on the fair

value of the consideration given in exchange

for goods and services. Fair value is the

price that would be received to sell an asset

or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly

transaction between market participants at

the measurement date.

Accounting policies and methods of

computation followed in the financial

statements are same as compared with the

annual financial statements for the year ended

31 March 2021, except for adoption of new

standard or any pronouncements effective

from 01 April 2021.

The Group presents an additional balance

sheet at the beginning of the earliest

comparative period when: it applies an

accounting policy retrospectively; it makes

a retrospective restatement of items in its

financial statements; or, when it reclassifies

items in its financial statements, and the

change has a material effect on the financial

statements.

iii.

Basis of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements

comprise the financial statements of the

Parent Company along with its subsidiaries and

joint ventures as at 31 March 2022. Control is

Corporate information

Polycab India Limited (the “Company”) (CIN -

L31300GJ1996PLC114183) was incorporated as ‘Polycab

Wires Private Limited’ on 10 January 1996 at Mumbai as a

private limited company under the Companies Act, 1956.

The Company became a deemed public limited company

under Section 43A(1) of the Companies Act, 1956, and the

word ‘private’ was struck off from the name of the Company

with effect from 30 June 2000. Thereafter, the Company

was converted into a private limited company under Section

43A(2A) of the Companies Act, 1956, and the word ‘private’

was added in the name of the Company with effect from 15

June 2001. Subsequently, the Company was converted into a

public limited company, the word ‘private’ was struck off from

the name of the Company and consequently, a fresh certificate

of incorporation dated 29 August 2018 was issued by the

Registrar of Companies, National Capital Territory of Delhi

and Haryana (“ROC”), recording the change of the Company’s

name to ‘Polycab Wires Limited’. Thereafter, the name of

the Company was changed from ‘Polycab Wires Limited’ to

‘Polycab India Limited’, and a fresh certificate of incorporation

dated 13 October 2018 was issued by the ROC.

The registered office of the Company is Unit 4, Plot Number

105, Halol Vadodara Road, Village Nurpura, Taluka Halol,

Panchmahal, Gujarat – 389 350.

The Company is the largest manufacturer of Wires and Cables

in India and fast growing player in the Fast Moving Electrical

Goods (FMEG) space. The Company is also in the business of

Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) projects.

The Company owns 23 manufacturing facilities, located

across the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, and

U.T. Daman.

The Board of Directors approved the Standalone Financial

Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 and authorised

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

A) Basis of preparation

i.

Statement of compliance:

The Company prepares its Standalone Financial

Statements to comply with the accounting standards

specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013

read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015, as amended from time to time. These Standalone

financial statements includes Balance Sheet as at 31

March 2022, the Statement of Profit and Loss including

Other Comprehensive Income, Statement of Cash flows

and Statement of changes in equity for the year ended

31 March 2022, and a summary of significant accounting

policies and other explanatory information (together

hereinafter referred to as “Financial Statements”).

ii.

Basis of measurement:

The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022

have been prepared on an accrual basis and a historical

cost convention, except for the following financial assets

and liabilities which have been measured at fair value or

amortised cost at the end of each reporting period:

(a)

Derivative financial instruments

(b)

Certain financial assets and liabilities (Refer

note 38 for accounting policy regarding financial

instruments)

(c) Net defined benefit plan (Refer note 30 for

accounting policy)

(d) Share Based Payments (Refer note 30 for accounting

policy)

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the

consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received from sell an

asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction

between market participants at the measurement date.

Accounting policies and methods of computation

followed in the financial statements are same as

compared with the annual financial statements for the

year ended 31 March 2021, except for adoption of new

standard or any pronouncements effective from 01

April 2021.

The Company presents an additional balance sheet at

the beginning of the earliest comparative period when:

it applies an accounting policy retrospectively; it makes

a retrospective restatement of items in its financial

statements; or, when it reclassifies items in its financial

statements, and the change has a material effect on the

financial statements.

iii.

Classification of current/non-current assets and

liabilities:

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the Balance

sheet based on current/non-current classification. It

has been classified as current or non-current as per the

Company’s normal operating cycle and other criteria as

set out in the Division II of Schedule III to the Companies

Act, 2013.

Operating Cycle:

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition

of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and

cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve

months as its operating cycle for the purpose of current

non-current classification of assets and liabilities.
