GENERAL

INFORMATION:

Dear Shareholders,

The Board of Directors present the 26th Annual Report together with

the audited financial statements of the Company for the Financial

Year (FY) ended March 31, 2022.

Your Company, GMR Infrastructure Limited (“GIL”/ ”Company”), is a

leading global infrastructure conglomerate with unparalleled expertise

in designing, building, and operating Airports in India and overseas.

GMR Group is the largest private airport operator in Asia and one of

the largest globally with operational passenger handling capacity of

~105 million annually. The Group operates the iconic Delhi

International Airport, which is the largest and fastest-growing airport

in India. The Group also runs Hyderabad International Airport, a

pioneering greenfield airport known for several technological

innovations. The Group is also operating Bidar Airport in Karnataka.

With respect to international airports, the Group is operating the

architecturally renowned Mactan Cebu International Airport in Cebu,

Philippines, in partnership with Megawide. Expanding its overseas

footprint, GMR Group, in collaboration with Angkasa Pura II (AP II),

has recently bagged the development and operation rights of

Kualanamu International Airport in Medan, Indonesia.

in line with our strategy to churn assets and redeploy in high growth

opportunities, the Group has entered into definitive agreements to

divest its equity stake in GMR Megawide Cebu Airport Corporation.

The Group is currently developing three major greenfield airport

projects across India and Greece, which includes Airport at Mopa in

Goa, Airport at Bhogapuram in Andhra Pradesh and Airport at

Heraklion, Crete, Greece in partnership with GEK Terna. Goa and

Bhogapuram airports in India are poised to transform the economy

and landscape of the surrounding areas when ready. Crete Airport in

Greece will similarly play a significant role in the local economy of

the region.

Further, in a recent development with respect to Nagpur Airport,

where GMR had emerged as the highest bidder in March 2019 but

subsequently the bidding process was annulled by the authority in

March 2020, Hon’ble Bombay High Court quashed the award

cancellation: letter and directed the concerned authority to sign

concession agreement for Nagpur Airport with GMR. Hon’ble

Supreme Court too upheld the HC order.

As a pioneer in implementing the path breaking Aerotropolis concept

in India, GMR Group is developing unique airport cities on commercial

lands available around its airports in Delhi, Hyderabad, and Goa. GMR

Delhi Aerocity is a landmark business, leisure, and experiential district.

Similarly, GMR Hyderabad Aerocity is coming up as a new-age smart

business hub.

letter

and directed the concerned authority to sign concession agreement

for Nagpur Airport with GMR. In another relief to GMR, Hon’ble

Supreme Court too upheld the HC order.

All during the year, to cope with frequent turbulence in passenger

traffic numbers, our teams performed exceptionally not only in terms

of operational flexibility, but also in terms of financial resilience. As a

result of such efforts, we have on one hand, sustained the operational

aspects of the airport and maintained safe and efficient operating

conditions while, on the other hand, ensured financial sustainability

of the airport.

With respect to our airport construction projects, capacity expansion

projects at Delhi and Hyderabad airports are in full swing. Further,

significant progress has been achieved at our MOPA airport in Goa,

which is scheduled to start operations within this financial year.

While we continue to expand our footprint across India and other

geographies, various initiatives have also been taken towards

achieving excellence on the ESG front. Even during pandemic, we

continued to strive towards excellence. Recently, Delhi airport became

the first airport to run entirely on renewable power including hydro

and solar power. At Hyderabad airport, we commissioned a 5MW

capacity solar plant in addition to the already existing capacity. Our

flagship Delhi Airport is also setting new standards on the front of

environment safety and sustainability. While Delhi Airport has now

become Asia Pacific’s first Level 4+ (Transition) accredited airport

announced by ACI Europe Annual Assembly & Congress, Hyderabad

Airport was awarded a Level 3+ neutrality status. Further, Delhi Airport

received the Platinum Recognition in the Green Airports Recognition

run by ACI Asia Pacific in over 25 million passenger category, while

Hyderabad Airport received Gold recognition in below 25 MPPA

category.

In terms of Skytrax world airports ranking, Delhi Airport jumped

from rank 50 in 2020 to 45 in 2021 and further to rank 37 in 2022. On

the Airport Service Quality (ASQ) rating given by ACI, Delhi Airport

continued to score 5.000 for CY2021. Similarly, Hyderabad Airport

also improved its ranking from 71 in 2020 to 64 in 2021 and further

to 63 in 2022. On India basis, Delhi and Hyderabad Airports have

been ranked 1st and 2nd respectively. On the Airport Service Quality

(ASQ) rating given by ACI, Hyderabad Airport continued to score 5.00

for CY2021.

At GMR, our commitment to the cause of Nation building is through

creation of quality assets. We are proud to have been associated

with landmark infrastructure projects in India like Delhi Airport,

Hyderabad Airport etc. We will strive to continue developing more

such marquee infrastructure assets in service of the nation.

situation due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Initially, this resulted in near

wipe out of passenger traffic across airports in India and across most

parts of the world before a gradual opening up and recovery. In FY22,

the resurgence of COVID-19 led to the reset of traffic to the minimum:

letter of award and signed the concession

agreement in June 2020 for Bhogapuram Airport and is expected

to commence the project construction during the current

financial year.

The Company also received: Letter of Award for brownfield Dr.

Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport, Nagpur in March

2019. However, Mihan India Limited has cancelled the contract

in May 2020. In response, GMR Airports had filed petition

challenging the cancellation of contract. Hon’ble Bombay high

court quashed the award cancellation letter and directed the

concerned authority to sign concession agreement for Nagpur

Airport with GMR Group. Hon’ble Supreme Court too upheld

the HC order. Accordingly, the Authorities are expected to

execute the Concession Agreement at the earliest for the Nagpur

Airport with GMR Group.

letter dated January 22, 2020 received from Ministry of Finance Male’, Republic of Maldives (the “Ministry”), the

amount of tax assessed by MIRA relating to the final arbitration award is USD 0.59 crore and in the event of any tax payable by

GMIAL on the same shall be borne by whom the payment was settled to GMIAL, without giving any workings/ break-up for the

same. As such the Ministry has confirmed that GMIAL is not liable to pay for the tax assessed by MIRA on the final arbitration

award. GMIAL has obtained the statement of dues from MIRA on December 31, 2020, according to which GMIAL is required to

settle business profit tax amounting to USD 0.72 crore and fines on business profit tax amounting to USD 0.82 crore and GMIAL is

required to settle withholding tax amounting USD 0.29 crore and fines on withholding tax amounted to USD 0.44 crore (withdrawing

the interim tax liability claim of USD 0.72 crore).

In addition to that, GMIAL has obtained the statements of dues from MIRA on 28th October 2021 and as per the statement, GMIAL

requires to settle business profit tax amounting to USD 0.72 crore fines on business profit tax amounting to USD 0.81 crore,

withholding tax amounting to USD 0.29 crore and fines on withholding tax amounting to USD 0.44 crore. As per business profit tax

assessments issued by MIRA, GMIAL should pay tax on net income of the final arbitration award.

Considering the entire tax liability pertaining to the business profit taxes is relating to the Arbitration Award Sum, the management

of Group is of view that GMIAL will be able to successfully defend and object to the notice of tax assessments and accordingly, no

additional provision is required to be recognized in these consolidated financial statements. Further, in respect of the matters

pertaining to the withholding taxes and the fines thereon, Group, believes that since these pertain to the aforementioned matter

itself, the tax demand on these items is not valid and based on an independent legal opinion, no adjustments to the books of

account are considered necessary. Also refer (d) below.

The Hon’ble Orissa High Court vide Judgement in W.P. No.20463/

2018, in the case of Safari Retreats Private Limited, observed

that the GST provisions w.r.t input tax credit allowability in

respect of Civil work are not in line with the objective of the Act,

and accordingly, held that if an assessee is required to discharge

GST on the rental income, it is eligible to avail the Input Tax

Credit (ITC) of GST w.r.t. civil work. DIAL is engaged in rendering

output supplies which is in the nature of letting out space/

facilities to various airline operators and other parties/

concessionaires, in return for consideration, known by different

nomenclatures and are leviable to GST. Hence, DIAL has availed

the GST ITC in respect of the costs for civil work incurred as part

of the Phase 3A expansion project and regular operations, upon

application of the said judicial pronouncement. Further,

department has filed an appeal in Hon’ble Supreme Court of

India against the judgement of Hon’ble Orissa High Court.

Pending outcome of judgement of Hon’ble Supreme Court of

India, considering the judgement of Hon’ble Orissa High Court

and based on the opinion obtained by DIAL in this regard, the

Management is of the view that GST ITC in respect of such civil

work is eligible to be availed by DIAL.

Having regard to the same, GST ITC amounting to ` 754.78 crore

(March 31, 2021: ` 477.62 crore) has been claimed in GST return

and disclosed under balance with statutory / Government

authorities in consolidated financial statements. Also an

intervention application has been filed by DIAL before Hon’ble

Supreme Court of India in the matter of appeal filed by the

department against Judgement of Orissa High Court in the

matter.

Further a Writ Petition has also been filed by DIAL in the matter

before Delhi High Court on July 10, 2020, for ITC claim to be

allowed of GST in respect of the civil works i.e. works contract

service and goods and services received by DIAL for construction

of immoveable property used for providing output taxable

supplies. The writ was heard by the Hon’ble High Court on July

29, 2020 and issued notice to the respondents. Accordingly the

matter was heard on various dates. Next date of hearing has

been fixed on May 06, 2022.

Further GHIAL has also recognized input tax credit on civil and

related work aggregating to ` 451.21 crore (including ` 372.80

crore pertaining to earlier year) has been claimed in GST returns

Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022:

letter dated June 24, 2020 and October 15, 2020 has

stated that the contention of GHVEPL is unmerited and due

reasons have been conveyed, even though no substantial

information is provided on the basis of which such decision is

taken. In this regard, GHVEPL has obtained a legal opinion from

its Counsel handling NHAI matter in Honorable Delhi High Court

which has opined that with the majority findings of the Arbitral

Award in favour of GHVEPL, issuance of Notice dated May 8,

2020 and: letter dated June 24, 2020 / October 15, 2020 by NHAI

/ Regulator is in bad light and arbitrary. Legal Counsel opined

that NHAI being aware of the financial implications of the Notice

dated May 8, 2020 trying to somehow avoid quantifying and

making any payment of the claim to GHVEPL under Change in

Law. The Counsel further opined that, NHAI after having failed

in its series of coercive steps including the notices for recovery

of alleged Premium, suspension notice and notices in relation

to non-compliance of O & M requirements has, on May 8, 2020,

issued the Notice under Article 3.2.2 of the Concession

Agreement and that too in the middle of extensive arguments

in the aforesaid petitions before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court,

only to make GHVEPL to somehow give up its claims and avoid

determination of claims. GHVEPL on October 30, 2020 has issued

Notice of Dispute under Article 44.2 read with Clause 44.1.2 of

the Concession Agreement to NHAI for amicable settlement as

a first step in dispute resolution, which has been declined by

NHAI on December 4, 2020. Pursuant to the notice dated April

6, 2021, the Arbitrators have been appointed and the Arbitral

Tribunal has held its first hearing setting procedural timelines

for hearing the litigation. Legal counsel has opined that GHVEPL

has a fair chance of winning the arbitration proceedings and

has rightful claim for Change in Law for 25 years concession

period.

Further GHVEPL has also internally assessed the average daily

traffic for financial year 2024-25, the scheduled six-laning period

which indicates that average daily traffic at designated Toll Plaza

will exceed the Design Capacity that would require six-laning as

per Clause 29.2.3 of the Concession Agreement. In terms of the

internal assessment by GHVEPL where in the traffic flows were

estimated to increase to the levels which mandates six-laning

during the concession period and based on the opinion from

the legal Counsel, the management is of the view that the

withdrawal of the Six Laning of the project highway without any

reasoning is not a tenable action by NHAI / Regulator based on

which a notice for invoking Arbitration under clause 44 of the

concession agreement has been served upon on April 6, 2021.

The legal counsel has opined that GHVEPL is in good position

to assert for concession period of 25 years. Accordingly,

Standalone statement of cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2022:

letter dated April 17, 2018, proposed

to extend the EC granted to GBHPL for a period of 3 years, subject

to the final outcome of the matter pending before the Court.

Based on its internal assessment and a legal opinion, the

management of GBHPL is confident of obtaining the requisite

clearances and based on business plan and a valuation

assessment carried out by an external expert during the year

ended March 31, 2021, the management of the Company is of

the view that the carrying value of the investments in GBHPL by

GEL as at March 31, 2021 is appropriate. Also refer footnote 11

(i) (d) below.

10.

The Company through its subsidiary GMR Coal Resources Pte.

Limited (‘GCRPL’) had investments of Nil (March 31, 2021:

` 3,703.92 crore) in PT Golden Energy Mines Tbk (‘PTGEMS’), an

associate as at March 31, 2021. PTGEMS along with its

subsidiaries is engaged in the business of coal mining and trading

activities. The cost of investments is significantly higher than

the book value of assets of PTGEMS and includes certain future

benefits including Coal Supply Agreement (‘CSA’) of GCRPL with

PTGEMS whereby the Company along with its subsidiaries is

entitled to offtake stated quantity of coal as per the terms of

the CSA at an agreed discount other than profit from mining

operations. Though the shares of PTGEMS are listed on the

overseas exchanges, the management is of the view that the

quoted prices are not reflective of the underlying value of the

mines as in the past few years the shares have been very thinly

traded. Based on profitable mining operations, ramp up of

production volumes and other assumptions around off take at

a discounted price and trading thereof considered in valuation

assessment carried out by an external expert during the year

ended March 31, 2020, the management believes that the

carrying value of aforesaid investments in PTGEMS as at March

31, 2021 is appropriate. Also refer footnote 11 (i) (d) below.
