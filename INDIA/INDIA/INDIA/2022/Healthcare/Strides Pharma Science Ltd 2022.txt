Dear Shareholders,

I begin with the hope that this: letter finds you and your loved

ones at the top of your health

and spirits. In every way, the

global community, as well as

businesses, have waded through

a sea of change during the last

two years. With a sinister Covid

wave re-emerging in the country

at the beginning of the year,

widespread supply disruptions,

commodity price rises, and the

Russia-Ukraine conflict deepening,

FY 2021-22 was a challenging

year for several sectors, and the

state of affairs was no different

for the pharmaceutical industry

and for Strides. That said, we have

made exemplary efforts as an

organisation to stay resilient and

focused on a sharp bounce back

to cushion the business and add

more value with our offerings.

Making sound decisions

We witnessed unusual price

erosion and volume drops in

the US, leading to a significant

contraction in our gross margins.

The other regulated markets

delivered tepid growth due to

Covid-related disruptions. Our

Emerging Markets business

witnessed growth as the region

was not significantly impacted

by the challenges peculiar to the

regulated markets.

Despite a difficult year, we have

been seeing green shoots from Q4

FY 2022. As the Company’s founder

and promoter, I acknowledge

that we couldn’t deliver to our

potential. It is simple to rationalise

the challenges of the business

environment, however accepting

responsibility, fixing inadequacies,

charting a new course, and moving

forward are most important.

I am excited to return to Strides

in an executive role, and we

are committed to restoring the

Company to its former health. We

are working towards strengthening

our fundamentals and developing

strategies in response to the

changing pharmaceutical

landscape.

As we gear up for a faster recovery

in FY 2022-23, we have devised

a clear strategy that focuses

on our global product supply.

We implemented a number of

capability-building programmes to

help us improve our performance.

Furthermore, we have established

distinct strategic priorities for

each key market.

The US remains a key focus

market

We have seen improvement across

our businesses since Q4 FY 2022,

including the recovery of our US

business. We are progressing

further by integrating Chestnut

Ridge operations in the US, which

will help us achieve our target of

over $250 Million in revenue from

US operations in FY 2022-23. Given

that we have over 150 products

approved, we should be able to see

sequential growth in the US, giving

us room to grow the business from

there. We have plans to launch

around 20 products per year

from this fiscal. Our new domain

additions, which include controlled

substances, hormones, and

nasal sprays, will help accelerate

portfolio differentiation, thereby

driving growth.

Scaling up ORMs

Other regulated markets or ORM

is an important part of our growth

strategy, fuelled by our frontend in

key markets and IP-led B2B

partnerships in Europe, Australia,

and other parts of the world.

In these markets, our R&D

investments will fast-track growth

opportunities for the Rx and OTC

portfolios, as several new products

will be launched in FY 2022-23.

Market and portfolio

expansion in emerging

markets

Our emerging market business

includes African and institutional

or access market verticals.

The access market vertical has a

relatively lower margin, but it is

critical to reducing

under-recoveries at our

manufacturing sites, given the

volumes. Our cost leadership

and selective product portfolio

expansion will drive institutional

business growth. In Africa,

we are focusing on scaling up

our business by expanding our

geographic footprint in the region

and ensuring better penetration of

existing markets through portfolio

expansion.

Road ahead

While the operating environment

continues to evolve and

is ambiguous, we remain

optimistic and confident about

delivering significant value to our

stakeholders in the coming years.

We have made several changes

to our businesses, focusing on

growth, improving cash flows, and

debt reduction. In addition, the

focus will be on efficient inventory

management, improving capacity

utilisation, and optimal capital

allocation, thereby reducing

under-recoveries.

We will also optimise our

manufacturing network for better

outcomes and aggressively focus

on cost and debt reduction. We

plan to reduce our gross debt by

more than `1,000 crores in

FY 2022-23, targeting Net Debt to

EBITDA below 3x.

Finally, I would like to thank

everyone who has supported

Strides over the years. I reassure

you that we will continue to

uphold our core values of integrity,

collaboration, and efficiency

while creating sustainable value

for all stakeholders. I am excited

about the journey ahead, with

the Board’s guidance and the

advice and collaboration of

my management colleagues,

employees, partners, customers,

and all of our stakeholders.

Dear Shareholders,

At the beginning of the year, I

highlighted that market behaviour

continues to be very challenging,

with price and supply chain

disruptions adding to downswing

risks.

FY 2021-22 has not met our

expectations in terms of

performance across internal and

external parameters, with price

erosions, bloated cost structures,

and long Cash to Cash (C2C) cycles

resulting in negative operating

leverage/cash flows. Significant

negative operating cash flows

resulted in the ballooning of debt

and a downgrade in credit rating

by ICRA. We adopted several

liquidity measures, but the

nosedive in performance resulted

in poor ratios on the balance sheet.

For the first time, we reported

an operating PAT loss. While the

reasons can be attributed to many

factors, we will be better prepared

in the future for challenges to

come.

We have taken several corrective

actions, expected to reflect in

our results H2 of FY 2022-23

onwards. This includes measures

on PEG (Profitability - Efficiency

- Growth). Seamless execution/

superior governance will enable it.

Consistency and sustainability will

be the focus and will pave the way

for debt reduction and cash flow

generation. I would like to dwell on

a few of the targets.

From a revenue standpoint,

we have set ourselves the US

revenue target of US$250 Million

driven by several new launches.

We have initiated many cost

management programmes to gain

cost leadership in key molecules

and improve the gross margins.

On the workforce cost front,

we are focusing on right-sizing

the company and variable pay

programme to drive accountability.

From an operational cost point of

view, we are resetting the entire

cost base by reducing logistics

costs, enhancing governance and

tightening control on costs. All this

will lead to the focus on absolute

EBITDA growth and steady build-

up. The green shoots of all our

actions are visible as we get into

the new year with promise.

To sum up, the key priorities are as

follows for the next year:

• Daily governance and review

cadence is being strengthened

to avoid surprises

• We are institutionalising

all the important processes

implementing strong controls

• Cost management – Revisit

all costs and get back to

profitability

• Reset or exit some of the low

margin P&Ls, which do not

positively impact our margins

• Liquidity challenges need to

be addressed during the year.

Once growth returns, superior

operating leverage and working

capital efficiencies are the focus

areas

• Improve all metrics of

profitability/efficiency/growth,

including superior ROCE by Q4

FY 2023

• Engage actively with all

investors and restore confidence

through better demonstration of

performance

• Focus on launch of new

products from approved ANDAs

and get back to historical gross

margins

• Balance sheet strengthening -

Light balance sheet from

FY 2022-23

Consistency and sustainability

will be our mantra as we address

the issues of past and present, and

prepare ourselves for the future,

simultaneously. The conviction is

very high at this point of time as

we continue to work tirelessly to

rebuild the company. Long-term

growth and profitability will be our

focus going forward.

I thank all the internal and

external stakeholders for reposing

faith in our Company and look

forward to continued support.

Warm regards

Badree

Consistency and sustainability will

be our mantra as we address issues

of the present, past and future

simultaneously. The conviction is

very high at this point of time as we

continue to work tirelessly to rebuild

the company.

3.23 Recent accounting developments

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new

standard or amendments to the existing standards

under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules as issued from time to time. On March 23, 2022,

MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022, applicable from

April 1, 2022, as below

Ind AS 103 – Reference to Conceptual Framework

The amendments specify that to qualify for recognition

as part of applying the acquisition method, the

identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed

must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the

Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting under

Indian Accounting Standards (Conceptual Framework)

issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of

India at the acquisition date. These changes do not

significantly change the requirements of Ind AS 103.

The Company does not expect the amendment to have

any significant impact in its financial statements.

Ind AS 16 – Proceeds before intended use

The amendments mainly prohibit an entity from

deducting from the cost of property, plant and

equipment amounts received from selling items

produced while the company is preparing the asset for

its intended use. Instead, an entity will recognise such:

Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer tendered resignation in March 2022 which has been accepted

by the Board of Directors (the Board). As part of the terms of his remuneration, as approved in the Annual General Meeting dated 20

August 2020, he was entitled to certain amounts subject to fulfilment of certain service conditions. Consequent to his resignation

and before the completion of the specified service period, the Board decided to recover amounts due to the Company based on the

originally approved terms of his appointment. Accordingly, in line with the requirements of Section 197(9) of the Act, the Company

has recorded such excess remuneration of H 141.90 million paid as a recoverable balance as at 31 March 2022.

letter to the Group to test for the presence of Azide impurity(s) in Losartan.

The Azide impurity(s) are API process impurity(s), with the API manufacturer also receiving a similar: letter

from USFDA. The results confirmed the presence of Azide impurity(s) in the batches tested. As a result, the

group proposed to initiate a voluntary recall of specific batches which had the Azide impurity(s).

The Group has estimated the impact of the aforesaid recall and recorded a sales return provision for potential

refunds on return of the product. The Group has also estimated the costs of such recall and have provided

for all inventory of Losartan with the Azide impurity(s) as of 31 March 2022, amounting to H 353.47 million.

Subsequently the API process at the API manufacturer was optimized to address this issue and the product

was relaunched during the current year.

(c)

On August 4, 2021, the Group through its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into definitive agreements

with subsidiaries of Endo International Plc to acquire a portfolio of generic products along with the US

manufacturing site at Chestnut Ridge, New York. Pursuant to such acquisition, the management decided to

consolidate its existing operations with the acquired facility at Chestnut Ridge, New York to optimise future

operating costs.

Pursuant to the acquisition of Chestnut Ridge faciliy, the Group as a part of its cost improvement and capacity

optimization has divested the Florida facility. Accordingly, the Group has recorded an impairment loss

amounting to H 1,727.16 million.

Managing Director.

During the year, the Group pursuant to its assessment that the business has now evolved from its incubation

stage and to align to the decision to demerge certain parts of its business, implemented operational changes in

how its CODM evaluates its businesses, including resource allocation and performance assessment. As a result

of the aforesaid change, the Group now has two operating segments, representing the individual businesses

that are managed separately. The Groups’s new reportable segment are as follows; “Pharmaceutical” & “Bio-

pharmaceutical”. The Group has restated segment information for the historical periods presented herein

to conform to the current presentation. This change in segments had no impact on the Group’s historical

consolidated statements of profit and loss, balance sheets or statements of cash flows.
