Corporate Overview

Financial Statements:

Managing Director effective February,

2022. Vivek brings extensive industry experience, and I am

confident that the Company will continue to progress under

his leadership.

We must acknowledge the perseverance, determination, and

efforts of our people in keeping patients’ needs first. Your

management team has been instrumental in driving the

organization to achieve its aspiration.

DRIVING INNOVATION THROUGH

CO-CREATION

During the year, we continued our portfolio expansion

journey and launched 10 differentiated products in the

market to meet increasing healthcare needs. This consistent

portfolio expansion is well-aligned to our strategy to be

present in key therapeutic areas.

We continue to leverage on actionable insights through

meaningful engagement with our stakeholders as a large

number of them are using digital platforms to manage health.

Our engagement with the doctors to deliver value-driven,

science-based content continued even during the pandemic.

This demonstrates our agility in the face of adversity.

We also increased our efforts to provide greater access to

our high-quality medicines to people across India this year

through a dedicated team working in rural areas, and this

will remain our focus going forward.

DEVELOPMENT AND WELL-BEING OF OUR EMPLOYEES

Our employees are our strength, and their health and

well-being remain our top priority. During the year, employee

assistance programs were amplified to support employees

and their families. In addition, wellness initiatives were

rolled out during the year, both at plant and head offices,

CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

STAYING TRUE

TO OUR PURPOSE

which focused on the financial, mental, emotional, and

physical health of employees. Abbott’s continuous investments

in the training and development capabilities of its people is a

key element for our long-term sustainability.

CARING FOR THE COMMUNITY

We remained committed to robust community interventions,

aimed at building scalable and sustainable solutions to solving

social problems.

In partnership with SEWA, we expanded the access to quality

and affordable non-communicable disease care among low-

income communities. Through a combination of physical

clinics, telemedicine services, community health workers

and electronic medical records, the program serves patients

across 27 districts in 3 states. We also collaborated with SEWA

to educate its 2.1 million members on COVID-19 prevention,

detection and treatment. As a science-based company, we

worked with Smile Foundation to promote STEM (Science,

Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) learning, health

education and sports among children from under-served

communities across 6 schools in and around Mumbai. Our

health clinics have enabled access to diagnosis and mass

awareness about various diseases through qualified doctors.

In partnership with AmeriCares, we are upgrading 40

Primary Health Centers to Health & Wellness Centers across 5

States in India.

COMMITTED TOWARDS A HEALTHIER FUTURE

Making the lives of patients better is at the heart of everything

that we do. For more than 130 years, Abbott worldwide, has

built its reputation by doing what’s right for the people we

serve. We will continue this journey of creating value and

enriching the lives of our stakeholders through innovation and

growth. With a single-minded focus on ensuring access and

affordability, our initiatives are aimed at adding significant

value to society and the ecosystem around us. We will remain

empathetic while improving sustainability.

Delivering consistent performance has its own responsibilities

- and we intend to pioneer and deliver so that we outperform

the market year on year. The branded generics market has

always been competitive, and it will be critical for us to

leverage on our legacy and trust amongst our customers.

Our achievements are testament to our belief. Our broad

portfolio and innovative strength will allow us to be

well-positioned in our commitment to make important

contributions to the health of people in India.

On behalf of my fellow Board Members, I express sincere

thanks to all our partners for their unwavering support, to

our employees for their continued passion and commitment,

and to all our shareholders for your continued trust

and confidence.

Warm regards,

Annual Report 2021-22:

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE

MAKING CONTINUOUS

HEADWAY IN ENRICHING

THE ECOSYSTEM

Dear Members,

It’s a privilege for me to lead the Abbott India Limited team.

We are known for our legacy products, innovative solutions,

and patient-centric initiatives across the care continuum. I am

excited to further build on this trust and innovation.

FY 2021-22 was yet another great year for us. We have

delivered impressive results with 14.1% growth in revenue

and 15.6% in net profits over the previous year. The agility of

the Company and our ever-evolving business model ensured

that we were able to tackle the dynamic environment with

minimal disruptions in our production or distribution.

Our focus on entering new therapies will continue and we

will bring new and innovative products and offerings to the

market. This is critical to our aim to transform healthcare for

people in India.

RESILIENT TO CHANGE

What separates us from the rest is our business model that

helps us remain tough and competitive. Our consistent

performance is a testament to the fact that we have been able

to overcome most of the recent disruptions. Our leadership

and unwavering success stems from the strong legacy brands

and the robust infrastructure in place.

As the operating environment around us changed, we

leveraged on multi-channel engagement and digital tools

to ensure that our connect with stakeholders was not

affected. Our field force is equipped with e-detailing tools

and therefore, communication with healthcare professionals

remained seamless.

To ensure that we can leverage channel diversification for

effective reach, we have also increased our focus on alternate

channels – such as modern trade pharmacy chains, and

e-pharmacies. Moving forward, we will continue to pioneer

new ways of engaging with all our stakeholders – doctors,

patients, distributors and institutions.

EVER-EVOLVING WAYS

It is a rapidly evolving healthcare environment, and there

is a spotlight on the importance of good health. At Abbott

India, we have made a choice to move from creating

medicines to creating holistic healthcare solutions that

address the entire continuum of care. We have brought

in synergy in our efforts that concentrate on pill plus

offerings, and are leveraging on economies of scale

to ensure the very best for our patients. Considerable

insights and strategic thought help us bridge the gaps in

the care continuum which includes generating awareness.

For example, Epilepsy is a much-misunderstood condition,

where there are several myths and taboos leading to

underdiagnosis and treatment. We spearheaded an

innovative messaging and content-led campaign, “E for

Epilepsy”, in an endeavor to shift the belief system and

bring to light facts about the condition.

Our ‘D Strong Active Life’ campaign launched last year also

saw considerable traction and we continued to strongly

engage with consumers. Pioneering efforts in the insomnia

category saw the launch of the first online, self-screening

sleep score tool in India that helps reduce the time taken to

consult a doctor for sleep disturbances. We also launched

two unique products, PreservGest, which is a micronized

progesterone, and Arachitol Gummies, vitamin D and

calcium gummies in the multi-speciality medicine portfolio.

Our Vaccine division continued patient education

initiatives to ensure patients with comorbidities who

are at higher risk for influenza, have adequate relevant

information. We look forward to expanding the portfolio

beyond the current set of vaccines and target segments.

The Women’s Health portfolio, led by the globally trusted

Duphaston, weathered competition challenges quite

well. The team continues to work on building advocacy

with peer-to-peer experience sharing and evidence

dissemination. The Tender, Love & Care, patient support

program launched last year evolved further, helped the

parents-to-be. Our presence in new focused segments

such as menopause saw traction for raising awareness

in the form of a unique multilingual menopause patient

awareness program “Pausetive Talk” through doctors for

their patients.

Your Company’s strong presence in the Gastrointestinal

space was further strengthened with the success of

Digeraft. In this portfolio, we also launched a unique

pre+probiotic, Florachamp, to help restore gut balance.

Our strategies in this portfolio continue to evolve as we

ensure that our business plans match the momentum of

the growth of our brands.

I am proud to say that our Consumer Health portfolio, led

by Digene, has continued its growth trajectory over the

last few years. The team has also evolved packaging to

cater to single serve, on-the-go needs and launched Digene

and Cremaffin stick packs this year. The metered pain

relief spray, Brufen Power spray, launched last year has

gained momentum in many markets.

What also makes me happy and #AbbottProud is that along

with differentiated campaigns and growing offerings to

our patients, we have continued to invest in our people to

ensure that they are equipped with relevant capabilities

and resources. Our training team has best-in-class learning

programs. As we shifted to virtual learning last year, we are

now able to provide 100% digitized content.

We remain committed to building a diverse workforce and

creating an inclusive working environment for people to excel.

In this quest, we have continuously launched initiatives and

spearheaded programs that ensure that our efforts are in

the right direction. We had over 370 employees joining the

Abbott India family last year with a close to ~50% increase in

diversity representation.

There has been an increasing focus on ESG parameters across

the world. As a part of the global mandate, we endeavor to

maximize responsible resource usage and reduce our carbon

emission. We have a holistic approach across our initiatives,

and efforts are made to curtail adverse environmental

impact. We continued our commitment to reducing the gap in

accessing quality healthcare. We upheld the highest level of

governance measures, ensuring complete transparency and

conformance to ethical standards.

ENRICHING THE QUALITY OF LIFE

Together, we have learnt from the challenges and supported

each other to ensure that we delivered as a team. We have

achieved a lot in FY 2021-22, even though it was not an easy

year. Yet there is much to be done. Our task is to build on the

momentum and deliver results. We are focused on helping

people and the communities we serve. We are an important

player in the area of healthcare, and we must step up even

further with this responsibility. Our culture, values, and our

one Abbott mindset fostering collaboration, will ensure that

we continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth. The

scale and diversification of our products and solutions will

further help us in this ambition.

I would like to thank our customers and shareholders for

the trust they have placed in us. Thank you for your loyalty

and support.

We remain Abbott Proud.

Conservation of Energy, Technology Absorption and Foreign Exchange Earnings and Outgo

[In compliance with the provisions of Section 134(3)(m) of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 8 of the Companies

(Accounts) Rules, 2014]

A. Conservation of Energy

Following energy and water conservation measures were

undertaken during the year :

i.

Energy conservation measures :

•

Sleep Mode activation for Air Handling

Units (AHUs)/Ventilation units for Non-

Critical areas :

Air

Handling

Units

(“AHUs”)

installed

in offices, secondary packing areas and

ventilation unit for PMS areas, are put on

the sleep mode during non-working hours by

running on slow speed with help of Variable

Frequency Drives (“VFDs”). This resulted in

energy saving of 29,384 KWH during the year

2021-22.

•

Use of heat pump for hot water generation in

Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning

(HVAC) :

Hot water is required for circulation through

AHUs coils for achieving the required

RH condition in manufacturing areas. The heat

pump is the latest technology implemented on

site for hot water generation which is further

used in HVAC for achieving the RH condition.

The pump is extracting heat from return

chilled water of chilled water coil of AHUs

and transferring same heat into the return

hot water of hot water coil of AHUs thereby

increasing the temperature, which plays a

critical role in achieving the RH conditions.

This

new

technology

eliminates

the

conventional method of generating heat from

the boiler, reducing fuel consumption by 507

Tonnes. The heat pump has proven to be a

cost/energy saving project even though it has

its own power consumption.

•

Dual fuel for DG set :

The site has 3 Diesel Generator (DG) sets

installed which are operated with HSD

(High Speed Diesel) fuel. The dual fuel is the

technology implemented for two DG sets and it

is the first installation in entire Goa, to operate

DG with dual fuel i.e., HSD and PNG (Piped

Natural Gas). The Dual fuel project is a cost

saving project along with footprint reduction.

ii.

Water conservation measures :

Reduction in Tanker Water consumption :

The site is supported by three sources of water

i.e., tanker, raw water and treated wastewater.

The tanker water is used only for de-minirelized

plant/purified water system water generation.

Raw water and treated wastewater are used for

all other purposes in the plant. Earlier, there

was more dependence on the expensive tanker

water, which has now reduced by approximately

two tankers every day leading to a cost saving of

` 4,01,040/annum.

iii. The steps taken by the Company for utilizing

alternate sources of energy - Nil

iv. The Capital Investment on Energy Conservation

Equipment - None

B.
