FROM THE OFFICE OF JOINT: MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

I HOPE THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES ARE SAFE AND WELL.

WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH TWO YEARS OF CHALLENGING TIMES

POSED BY THE PANDEMIC. THE IMPACT CONTINUES TO BE FELT

WITH SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS AND A SHARP INCREASE IN

ENERGY, LOGISTICS AND OTHER INPUT COSTS. THE COLLECTIVE

EFFORTS BY THE MEDICAL FRATERNITY, GOVERNMENTS AND

VARIOUS ORGANISATIONS HAVE ENABLED THE RETURN TO

NORMALCY EVEN AS WE REMAIN VIGILANT. AS A RESULT, FY 2021-

22 WITNESSED A FASTER-THAN-EXPECTED DEMAND RECOVERY.

GLOBAL AND INDIAN ECONOMIES RECOVERED WITH A GROWTH

OF 6.1% AND 8.2% RESPECTIVELY IN FY 2021-22.

W

ITH the micro-environment

becoming more volatile, complex

and uncertain, organisational

resilience is becoming an increasingly

significant part of the business model.

Concord Biotech Limited (CBL) has

established a structured approach

to becoming more resilient. This

approach is supported by robust

business processes. This has enabled

CBL to deliver excellence to all its

stakeholders.

COVID has been one such disruptive

force that compelled organisations to

respond swiftly. Many changed their

business operations and processes

and some even had to make

paradigm shifts in business models.

As the world recovers, geo-political

tensions and energy and commodity

costs are expected to add inflationary

pressures to the global economy.

Despite the operational headwinds

posed by the pandemic in FY22, we

at Concord Biotech continued to

take proactive steps to protect our

employees, maintain a continuous

supply of key drugs for patients across

our core markets and ensure long-

term business sustainability.

Operational performance

I feel FY22 was a satisfying year

against the backdrop of the multiple

waves of the pandemic and its impact

on various sectors and enterprises.

The pharmaceutical sector on

the whole did well as medicine

consumption leapfrogged.

In FY22 our revenue from the

domestic market was H339.19 crore

from the US it was H131.45 crore and

from the Rest of the World, it was

H242.28 crore representing 47.33%,

18.44% and 34.23 % of our total

revenue respectively.

As of March 31st, 2022, we have 163

personnel at our R&D Unit which

constituted 13.81% of our permeant

employees.

We spent H25.85 crore in FY22 on

our R&D activities. For APIs, our R&D

activities focus on fermentation

technology including strain

improvement, Media optimisation,

process development, process

scale-up, Technology transfer at

the commercial scale & Process

Improvement. For formulations, our

R&D activities focus on formulation

development including immediate

and extended release oral solids,
