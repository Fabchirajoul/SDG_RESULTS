Performance Evaluation of the Board and the Directors

Pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 17 of the Listing Regulations, the Board’s Annual

Performance Evaluation was conducted for all Board Members as well as the working of the Board and its Committees.

This evaluation was led by the Chairman of the N&R Committee with specific focus on the performance and effective functioning

of the Board. The Board evaluation framework has been designed in compliance with the requirements under the Companies Act,

2013 and the Listing Regulations, and in consonance with the Guidance Note on Board Evaluation issued by SEBI. The Board

evaluation was conducted through a questionnaire having qualitative parameters and feedback based on ratings.

Evaluation of the Board was based on criteria such as composition and role of the Board, Board communication and relationships,

functioning of Board Committees, review of performance and remuneration payable to Executive Directors, succession planning,

strategic planning, etc.

Evaluation of Directors was based on criteria such as participation and contribution in Board and Committee meetings,

representation of shareholder interests and enhancing shareholder value, experience and expertise to provide feedback and

guidance to top management on business strategy, governance and risk, understanding of the organization’s strategy, risk and

environment, etc.

The performance evaluation of the Chairman and the Executive Directors was carried out by the Independent Directors. The

performance evaluation of the Independent Directors was carried out by the entire Board.

It was observed that the Board, as a whole, is performing as a highly effective and cohesive body. It was also observed that the

Board’s Committees are functioning effectively in accordance with their defined charters/ terms of reference.

The evaluation process also confirmed the high governance standards being set by the Board and the constructive relationship

between the Board and the Management. The Board took notice of the outstanding leadership and the work done by the

employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board was also appreciative of management’s efforts in gaining market share in

the Centres of Excellence through various initiatives despite a very challenging environment.

In order to further strengthen the effectiveness of the Board and its key Committees, it was agreed that the focus should be

more on familiarising the Board members on emerging and future trends in healthcare & sustainability initiatives and accordingly

structure the relevant presentations, trainings and orientations. The Board’s suggestions to further augment its effectiveness

have been noted and taken up for implementation.

Progress on the recommendations from last year’s evaluation was also discussed and reviewed. During the period under review,

as a result of the previous evaluation’s results, it was noted that the Board engaged more with the Company’s leadership team

Notes

(i)

In respect of the company , relating to the proceedings pending before the relevant income tax authority for the assessment years 2009-10 to

2016-17, it is of the opinion that no additional provision for tax expense is considered necessary in the financial statements.

(ii)

In respect of Apollo Health & Lifestyle Limited, The Honorable supreme Court, has passed a decision on February 28, 2019 in relation to

inclusion of certain allowances in “Basic wages” for the purpose of determining contribution to provident fund under the Employees’ Provident

Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. The Group is awaiting further clarifications from the judiciary/department in this matter in order to

reasonably asses the impact on its financial statements, if any. Accordingly, the applicability of the judgement to the group, with respect to the

period and the nature of allowances to be covered, and the resultant impact on the past provident fund liability, cannot be reasonably ascertained,

at present.:
