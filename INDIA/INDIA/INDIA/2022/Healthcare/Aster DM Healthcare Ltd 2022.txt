Corporate Overview:

Managing Director for her consideration.

Bottom-up and Emerging Risk

Identification

Bottom-up risk identification processes

are carried out on a regular basis to identify

‘key risks’ to which we are currently

exposed or may be exposed in the future.

Before being assessed for materiality, the

risks identified are categorised according

to the risk categories and definitions laid

out, such as Operational Risk, Information

Security Risks, Compliance Risks, and so

on. A process for identifying emerging risks

is also in place to identify risks to which

we may be exposed but which are not

yet quantifiable or completely reflected in

bottom-up risk assessments.

Risk Management Committee

(RMC)

All risks have controls and actions identified

to mitigate and reduce the risks. Action

plans are being tracked and key risks are

reported to the RMC along with mitigation

controls and actions on a quarterly basis.

The action plans are driven to closure to

ensure risks and potential impacts are

mitigated and/or cause least damage to

the organisation.

In addition, key risks are discussed on a

monthly basis with business leaders and

updated on a quarterly basis for reporting

to the RMC. Risk trends and Key Risk

indicators are captured in the quarterly

reporting to the RMC that help understand

risk movements The Risk Management

process is reviewed by the RMC at least

on an annual basis. This involves risk

identification, assessment, controls

identification, mitigation and continuous

monitoring.

Communication of risks

Risk awareness sessions and risk induction

are carried out frequently for existing as

well as new staff. In addition, Risky times a

bi-monthly newsletter covers a topic each

month to promote a risk culture within the

organisation and provide an opportunity

for staff to raise concerns. In addition,

there is a dedicated whistleblowing line

and communication (posters and emails)

frequently to remind staff of the hotline

available and to flag risk issues.

External Policy review

•

Reviewed and contributed to the draft Health Data Protection

and Confidentiality policy issued by DHA.

Risk reviews and management

•

Risks and controls are reviewed monthly with the Executive

Directors, CEOs, and COOs across various business verticals.

•

Board Risk Committee is held on a quarterly basis to review the

top risks of the organization.

Enclosed below is a summary of the top risks for Aster DM

Healthcare as agreed and approved at the Executive Risk

Committee along with the potential impact and appetite, and

our mitigation strategies.

Risks

Mitigation

Information and

Data Security

Risks

At Aster we have a low-risk appetite for a security

breach in which significant amounts of confidential

data affecting our patients, customers, employees, or

shareholders, and/or proprietary information has been

compromised that can result in regulatory notification,

monetary fines, indemnity, and reputational damage.

The organisation remains committed to its IT

transformation strategy to ensure the robustness

of systems across the landscape. With this in mind,

several IT controls are in place to ensure that patient

data isn’t compromised. Engaged with third party

agencies for enhancement of overall security posture

of the organization.

People Risks

The growth of the Company is highly dependent on its

ability to acquire a talented workforce. The expertise

and engagement of employees drives organisational

success. Inability to acquire such talent can significantly

impact the Company’s operations. As our largest area

of expenditure, we have a medium risk appetite for

pursuing outcomes that lead to more efficient and

economic people outcomes.

The Company continuously works to improve its work

environment to retain a pool of trained medical and

non-medical professionals with a low-risk appetite

for any deviation from the Aster Code of Conduct and

Ethical Governance Standards.

Note 1 : The Company has received income tax assessment orders for AY 2014-15 & 2015-16 wherein the assessing officer has raised

net demand of INR 20.08 crores (net of taxes paid amounting to INR 4.28 crores) on account of disallowance of Foreign Tax Credit

claimed as per provisions of Section 90/90A of Income Tax Act 1961 and the disallowance under section 14A. The Company had

provision in the books pertaining to the AY 2014-15 & 2015-16, amounting to INR 2.48 crores.The Company has also received

income tax demand order of INR.0.18 crore for AY 2012-13 where in assessing officer denied legal and professional fee and business

promotion expenses. The Management believes that the position taken by it on the matter is tenable and hence, no adjustment has

been made on the financial statements. The Company has filed an appeal against the demand received.

Note 2 : The Company has obtained duty free / concessional duty licenses for import of capital goods by undertaking export obligations under

the EPCG scheme. As at 31 March 2022, the export obligations remaining to be fulfilled amounts to INR 12.80 crores (31 March

2021: INR 17.86 crores). In the event that export obligations are not fulfilled, the Company would be liable to pay the levies. The

Company’s bankers have provided bank guarantees aggregating INR 3.80 crores (31 March 2021: INR 24.55 crores) to the customs

authorities in this regard.

Note 3 : On 23 April 2018, the Government of Kerala issued an order revising the minimum wages of medical and nursing staff. The order

mentions that the changes would be effective retrospectively from 1 October 2017. Since the legislation was issued in April

2018, Management has started paying the revised salary with effect from 1 April 2018. The Company filed an appeal against the

retrospective application of this order with the High Court of Kerala which has issued an interim stay order on 26 July 2018. The Writ

Petition WP (c) No. 25109/2018 challenging the retrospective effect of minimum wage order passed by the Government of Kerala is

pending before the Hon’ble High Court of Kerala in hearing list. Based on the stay order and legal advise, Management believes that

their position will be upheld and therefore has not provided for the incremental cost for the period October 2017 to March 2018.

Note 4 : On 28 February 2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has delivered a judgment clarifying the principles that need to be applied in

determining the components of salaries and wages on which Provident Fund (PF) contributions need to be made by establishments.

Basis this judgment, the Company has re-computed its liability towards PF from the month of March 2019 and has paid PF as per

Supreme Court judgement. In respect of the earlier periods/years, the Company has been legally advised that there are numerous

interpretative challenges on the application of the judgment retrospectively. Based on such legal advice, the Management believes

that it is impracticable at this stage to reliably measure the provision required, if any, and accordingly, no provision has been made

towards the same. Necessary adjustments, if any, will be made to the books as more clarity emerges on this subject.

Note 5 : The Company has reviewed all its pending litigations and proceedings and has adequately provided for where provisions are required

and disclosed as contingent liability where applicable, in its financial statements. The Company does not expect the outcome of these

proceedings to have a materially adverse effect on its financial position. The Company does not expect any reimbursement in respect

of the above contingent liabilities.

Note 6 : The Company has given bank guarantee in respect of certain contingent liabilities listed above.

Note 7 : The Company does not have any long-term commitments or material non-cancellable contractual commitments/contracts, including

derivative contracts for which there were any material foreseeable losses.
