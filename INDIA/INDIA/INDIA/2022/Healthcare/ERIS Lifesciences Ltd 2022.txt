Annual Report 2021-2022

One more year has gone by and we have turned 15 years old. We

have made rapid strides since our humble beginnings to

nd

metamorphosize into India’s 22 largest domestic formulations

company. With the Power of Empathy and the Truth of Science as

our shining beacons, we continue to scale greater heights in our

quest to enable patients towards better health and lifestyles.

The biggest area of focus for FY 22 has been to expand the business

and create a growth platform for the next 10 years. The era of patent

expirations and exciting new product launches in Oral Anti-Diabetes

begins in FY 23 and we expect to gain prominent market positions in

the new product launches. We entered the INR 3,500 crore market for

Insulin and Analogues in Jan 2022 through an equity partnership with

MJ Biopharm in Jan 2022. This initiative further underscores our

commitment as a serious stakeholder in managing the diabetes

burden of the nation. We launched Xsulin, our brand of human insulin

in Feb 2022. We expect to follow this up with Glargine, a key insulin

analog in CY 2023 and Liraglutide, a GLP1 Agonist in CY 2024. Our

Oral Anti-Diabetes and Insulin franchises were further strengthened in

FY 22 by our technology solutions consisting of Blood Glucometers,

Continuous Glucose Monitors and HbA1C Monitors.

We entered the INR 11,000+ crore Dermatology segment in May

2022 through the acquisition of a 100% equity stake in Oaknet

Healthcare. Eris’ Specialty Franchise gets a signicant impetus with

this acquisition. Oaknet enjoys near 100% coverage of ~11,000

Dermatologists across India with a 60% penetration. With a

specialty component of 43% and a strong platform in Medical

Dermatology, Oaknet provides us with a robust growth platform in

Dermatology as well as Cosmetology. In line with our Strides and

Zomelis acquisitions, we are condent that the Oaknet transaction

will create long-term value for our shareholders.

We expanded our presence in Women’s Healthcare by entering the

~INR 650 crore Dydrogesterone market growing at over 50% p.a.

through the launch of our brand Drolute in Q4 of FY 22. This

underscores our commitment to invest and grow in Women’s

Health as a key new therapy for Eris.

With all these expansionary initiatives, Eris is now present in 87% of

the INR 55,000 crore Indian Chronic Care Market, with a leading

4.

Average percentile increase already made in the salaries of employees other than the managerial personnel in the last financial year and its comparison

with the percentile increase in the managerial remuneration and justification thereof and point out if there are any exceptional circumstances for

increase in the managerial remuneration:

The percentile increase in the managerial remuneration has been 21.97% which is higher than the change in the remuneration of employees other than

constituting managerial remuneration which register an increase of 8.87%. The change in the remuneration of field staff is made as per their sales

performance as per a documented increment structure uniformly applied to the field staff. The managerial function is concerned with more critical

issues which influence and determine the survival, continued growth, and the business direction for the company. The managerial talent is scarce and

hence its retention is even more important. Managerial personnel form executive management and remain accountable to all the stakeholders of the

company for business performance as well as corporate governance and therefore need to demonstrate balance of judgement and mature decision

making in the backdrop of fast changing and increasingly complex industry landscape. These reasons justify the higher increase in the managerial

remuneration.

It is hereby affirmed that the remuneration paid is as per the Company’s Remuneration Policy.
