Driven by its values,

of possibilities and

reimagine patient care,

across the globe. With

extensive collaborative

networks within the

healthcare ecosystem,

Managing Director’s Statement

Dear Shareholder,

AstraZeneca India in the year 2021

was about a lot of things! If I were to

provide you a glimpse, it would be

a combination of some compelling

solutions, for the people by the

people!

Last year, we were on a path of

recuperation from the effects of life-

threatening COVID-19 virus. Like

most people around the world, our

colleagues faced some extremely

challenging situations at home,

which had a rub-off effect at work

as well. But, being an organisation

that keeps patients at its core, we

saw many heroes who took on the

challenge and innovated in several

ways to ensure that there is a

continuity in the supply of life-saving

medicines for patients. There was a

point when we heard fantastic stories

of commitment almost every day

from our employees, who discovered

balance in those adverse times and

stood out with their contribution.
