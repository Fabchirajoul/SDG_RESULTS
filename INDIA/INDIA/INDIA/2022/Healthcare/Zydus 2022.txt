Forward looking statement: In this Annual

Report, we may have disclosed forward

looking information to enable stakeholders

to comprehend our prospects and take

informed decisions. This report and other

statements – written and oral – that we

periodically make, contain forwardlooking

statements that set out anticipated results

based on the management’s plans and

assumptions. We have tried wherever

possible to identify such statements

by using words such as ‘anticipates’,

‘estimates’, ‘expects’, ‘projects’, ‘intends’,

‘plans’, ‘believes’ and words of similar

substance in connection with any

discussion on future performance. We

cannot guarantee that these forward

looking statements will be realised,

although we believe we have been prudent

in assumptions. The achievement of

results is subject to risks, uncertainties

and even inaccurate assumptions. Should

known or unknown risks or uncertainties

materialise, or should underlying

assumptions prove inaccurate, actual

results could vary materially from those

anticipated, estimated or projected. We

undertake no obligation to publicly update

any forward looking statements, whether

as a result of new information, future

events or otherwise.

* Board of Directors at its meeting held on May 20, 2022 changed the nomenclature of Corporate Social Responsibility

Committee to Corporate Social Responsibility & ESG Committee.:

Dear Shareholders,

I am happy to share an

important milestone with

you, which makes FY22

an epochal year for the

organisation. Zydus, which

has been conventionally a

pharmaceutical company

has now evolved into an

innovation-driven life

sciences organization.

This represents a giant leap for our

company in terms of its aspirations,

positioning and desired impact.

This evolution has been reflected in a

change in our logo and visual identity

- a differentiation from the past, a

contemporariness in the present and a

relevance for the future.

This deepens our commitment

to innovation, patient-centricity,

knowledge, responsiveness and

inclusiveness.

This transformational journey was as

necessary as it was timely. Disease

patterns are changing. As per an

estimate, around 40,000 diseases

remain therapeutically unaddressed.

Research costs are rising. Regulatory

approvals are becoming more

stringent. Generics margins are

declining. There is a premium on the

need to reinvent, restructure and

reimagine.

At the reimagined Zydus, we possess

differentiated capabilities to succeed.

We have demonstrated capabilities in

the identification of the right vacant

spaces with potential; we possess the

capability to develop a molecule right

from proof-of-concept to the market

with speed and agility.

The time has come to catch the right

wave and move into an ocean of

possibilities. The products we are

working on are directed towards large

addressable markets with potential

annual revenues of $100 mn to $500

mn. We possess a competence in

small molecules and biologics, marked

by a capacity for measured risk taking,

perseverance and prudent investing.

What the new normal warrants is

more of the different. We will continue

to add specialized talent that is

mentored at every step. We will

continue to make larger investments

in facilities benchmarked around

the demanding standards of global

regulatory agencies. We will embrace

a larger scale of challenges and take

a wider range of product bets. We

will continue to focus on rigorous

execution capabilities that bring

products to markets just when they

are needed.

We intend to do all this without

diluting the essence of Zydus.

We will continue to care for all

our stakeholders. We will deepen

our commitment to care for the

marginalized through programmes

directed at the creation of health

care educational infrastructure that

are sustainable on their own without

seeking financial recourse to our

parent company.

The complement of these initiatives

is likely to create a research-based

life sciences company that generates

more than 50% of its revenues from

new products. I am optimistic that this

transformation will enhance margins,

cash flows, respect and shareholder

value.

Remaining restlessly entrepreneurial

in the face of a new emerging world,

I will continue to navigate Zydus

strategically, catalyse our innovation

journey, mentor young scientists and

focus on the creation of an innovation

hub within that one day becomes the

pride of the world.
