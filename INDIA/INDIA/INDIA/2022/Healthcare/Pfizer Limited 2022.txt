Managing Director, FITT

The need of the hour is to focus on the high burden of diseases the country is experiencing. It is through

innovations in screening, pathology and disease management, mortality rates and costs of terminal care, can be

effectively targeted. I appeal to all the start-ups focusing on Digital Health and Oncology to contribute towards

continues as the President of the Organization of

2021. Pfizer also continued as the Co-Chair of the Pharma

Committee of the US India Business Council (USIBC).

a)

Engagement through associations and direct

advocacy:

Your Company undertook direct advocacy and also

engaged with different government stakeholders

through industry associations such as the OPPI, FICCI,

PhRMA, USIBC and US India Strategic Partnership

Forum (USISPF) on several important policy level

issues which have a direct impact on the business.

Prominent issues which were advocated include

the National List of Essential Medicines, Public

Procurement Order, Drugs and Magic Remedies

(Objectionable Advertisement)

Act,

authorised

import and trade of patented medicines in India,

strengthening of Intellectual Property eco-system,

inclusion of innovative therapies under Government

Programmes among others. Your Company continued

to participate and play an active role in leading the

dialogue with relevant government stakeholders

and contributing recommendations on the above-

mentioned policy level issues.

b)

Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya

Yojana (AB-PMJAY):

Your Company has continued to engage with the

National Health Authority (NHA), government entity

responsible for implementation of AB-PMJAY, for the

inclusion of innovative therapies in the Health Benefit

Packages of AB-PMJAY. Further to our engagements

for inclusion and funding models for pricing of these

therapies, NHA has released consultation paper on

the structured process for submission of proposals for

inclusion under the Health Benefit Packages. Pursuant

to the industry’s engagement, the NHA has also

decided to constitute a Health Technology Assessment

unit that will take up all proposals of inclusion of new

technologies and therapies in the program – a positive

move that will provide a structured pathway for such

new therapies to be offered to AB-PMJAY beneficiaries.

NHA has shown interest in engaging with the industry

and explore possibilities that would institutionalise

decision making and pricing process for inclusion of

innovative therapies for the AB-PMJAY beneficiaries.

c)

Adult immunisation:

Your

Company

strongly

believes

that

adult

immunization

against

vaccine

preventable

pneumococcal disease should be taken up on a large

scale. Most Indian & Global healthcare societies

recommend priority immunization against pneumonia

for those who at risk such as the elderly and those

having co-morbid conditions, especially patients with

high-risk conditions of opportunistic infections like

sickle cell disease and HIV patients. Your Company

has been front ending the discussion on the need for

undertaking adult immunization with both the central

and the state governments. We have partnered with

the US -India strategic Partnership Forum for a series

of round tables to engage with key stakeholders from

the government policy makers, healthcare experts,

insurance companies, NGOs, patient groups, public

and private sector health facilities to not only raise

awareness about the need for adult immunization

but also make recommendations which could lead

to the development of a comprehensive policy at

the national level for adult immunization. We also

continue to explore other avenues for inclusion of

adult immunization in specific government programs

such as National Programme for Health Care of the

Elderly (NPHCE), National AIDS Control Organisation

(NACO) and State programmes for Sickle Cell Disease

patients.:
