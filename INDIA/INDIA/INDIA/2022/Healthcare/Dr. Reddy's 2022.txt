Your directors are pleased to present the

38th Annual Report of the Company for

the year ended March 31, 2022.

The FY2022 saw several challenges with

respect to multiple COVID‑19 waves,

heightened geo‑political tensions and

increase in commodity prices. These

factors have impacted almost every

organization and your Company was no

exception. However, our teams stood up

to these challenges and ended the year

on a winning note with growth across

most of our businesses and higher

profits, while continuing to serve our

patients across the globe.

Merger of Dr. Reddy’s Holdings Limited into Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited

The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on 29 July 2019, had approved the amalgamation of Dr. Reddy’s Holdings Limited (“DRHL”), an

entity held by the Promoter Group, which holds 24.83% of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited into the Company (the “Scheme”). This Scheme

was subject to the approval of shareholders, stock exchanges, the National Company Law Tribunal, Hyderabad Bench (“NCLT”) and other

relevant regulators as per the provisions of Section 230 to 232 and any other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.

The Scheme would lead to simpliﬁ cation of the shareholding structure and reduction of shareholding tiers. The Promoter Group cumulatively

would continue to hold the same number of shares in the Company, pre and post the amalgamation. All costs, charges and expenses relating

to the Scheme were borne out of the surplus assets of DRHL. Further, any expense, if exceeding the surplus assets of DRHL, would be borne

directly by the Promoters.

During the ﬁ scal year ended 31 March 2020, the Scheme was approved by the board of directors, members and unsecured creditors of the

Company. The no-observation letters from the BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Limited were received on the basis of no

comments received from Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”). The petition for approval of the said Scheme was ﬁ led with the

Hon’ble NCLT, Hyderabad Bench.

The aforementioned Scheme was approved by the NCLT, Hyderabad Bench vide its Order dated 5 April 2022. Subsequently, the Company

ﬁ led the NCLT order, with the Ministry of Company Aff airs on 8 April 2022 (‘Eff ective Date’). Pursuant to the Scheme of Amalgamation and

Arrangement as approved by the NCLT, an aggregate of 41,325,300 equity shares face value of ` 5 each held by DRHL in the share capital of

the Company have been cancelled and an equivalent 41,325,300 number of equity shares of face value ` 5 each have been allotted to the

shareholders of DRHL. There is no change in the total equity shareholding (Promoter/Public Shareholding) of the Company, on account of the

allotment/ cancellation of equity shares pursuant to the approved Scheme.

The Scheme also provides that the Promoters of the Company will jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company,

its directors, employees, offi cers, representatives, or any other person authorized by the Company (excluding the Promoters) for any liability,

claim, or demand, which may devolve upon the Company on account of this amalgamation.

letter dated 30 April 2014

that the Company had violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the “CPSA”) and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (the “PPPA”) and

that the CPSC intended to seek civil penalties. Speciﬁ cally, the CPSC asserted, among other things, that from or about 14 August 2008

through 1 June 2012, the Company sold prescription drugs having unit dose packaging that failed to comply with the CPSC’s special child

resistant packaging regulations under the PPPA and failed to issue general certiﬁ cates of conformance. In addition, the CPSC asserted

that the Company violated the CPSA by failing to immediately advise the CPSC of the alleged violations. The Company disagrees with

the CPSC’s allegations.

Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) began to investigate a sealed complaint which was ﬁ led in the United States

District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) related to these same issues (the “FCA

Complaint”). The Company cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation. The DOJ and all States involved in the investigation declined

to intervene in the FCA Complaint. On 10 November 2015, the FCA Complaint was unsealed and the plaintiff whistleblowers, who are

two former employees of the Company, proceeded without the DOJ’s and applicable States’ involvement. The unsealed FCA Complaint

relates to the 6 blister pack products originally subject to the investigation and also 38 of the Company’s generic prescription products

sold in the U.S. in various bottle and cap packaging.

The Company ﬁ led its response to the FCA Complaint on 23 February 2016 in the form of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim

upon which relief can be granted. On 26 March 2017, the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss, dismissing the FCA Complaint

and allowing the plaintiff s one more chance to reﬁ le this complaint in an attempt to plead sustainable allegations.

On 29 March 2017, the plaintiffs filed their final amended FCA Complaint, which the Company opposed and during the three months

ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff s ﬁ led a petition with the Court

requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

The parallel investigation by the CPSC un der the CPSA and the PPPA was referred by the CPSC to the DOJ’s offi ce in Washington, D.C.

in April 2016, with the recommendation that the DOJ initiate a civil penalty action against the Company. The CPSC matter referred to the

DOJ relates to ﬁ ve of the blister pack products.

On 18 January 2018, the Company and the DOJ entered into a settlement of the action and agreed to a consent decree providing for

a civil penalty of US$5 million (` 319), and injunctive relief. The settlement was without adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and the

Company has not admitted any violations of law pursuant to this settlement.

During the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff s

subsequently ﬁ led a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice,

and that request was denied.

In June 2018, the plaintiff s ﬁ led their Notice of Appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. During the three months ended September 2018,

the plaintiff s and the DOJ settled and thus this appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff s then ﬁ led an application for recovery of attorneys’ fees

from the Company under the “alternative remedy doctrine”. The Company made opposing ﬁ lings to this and in response the plaintiff s

withdrew their application.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the FCA Complaint is not probable. Accordingly, no

provision has been made in these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.:

letter to inform Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc.

that, in light of the information which had been provided, no further information would be requested at such time in response to this

subpoena.

Subpoenas from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”)

On 6 July 2016, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. received a subpoena from the DOJ (Anti-trust Division) seeking information relating to the

marketing, pricing and sale of certain of our generic products and any communications with competitors about such products. On 15

May 2018, another subpoena was served on Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. by the DOJ (False Claims Division) seeking similar information.

The Company has been cooperating, and intends to continue to fully cooperate, with these inquiries.

Civil Investigative Demand from Civil Division of the DOJ

On 15 May 2018, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Civil Division of the DOJ, enquiring whether

there have been any violations of the U.S. False Claims Act. This query arose from allegations that generic pharmaceutical manufacturers,

including us, have engaged in market allocation or price ﬁ xing agreements, or paid illegal remuneration, and caused false claims to be

submitted in violation of the U.S. False Claims Act. The Company has been cooperating, and intends to continue to fully cooperate with

the DOJ in responding to the demand.
