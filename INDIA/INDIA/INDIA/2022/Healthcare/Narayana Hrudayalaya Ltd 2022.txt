Certificate from the Statutory Auditors relating to the

Company’s Stock options/Restricted Stock Units:

Dear Shareholders,

It is an honour to report the performance of your Company for

fiscal year 2021-22. The FY 2021-22 began with the enormous

devastation experienced during the second pandemic wave.

The magnitude of the humanitarian catastrophe, which affected

the lives and livelihoods of countless people, rocked the nation’s

consciousness, and as a top healthcare service provider, the

experience was overwhelming. So, let me begin by expressing our

deepest sympathies to everyone affected. We stood in solidarity

with those individuals and committed ourselves to defending and

bolstering our communities in the face of the devastation unleashed

during that time. I would want to thank the efforts and sacrifices

made by our entire workforce during this extremely difficult time. A

particular word of thanks to the frontline workers who risked their

lives to protect us all while displaying extraordinary valour and

compassion. We will be eternally grateful for their dedication and

support, which is the foundation of the institution and its legacy at

NH, of which we are all extremely proud.

We are pleased to have

recorded the highest ever

consolidated profitability

with EBITDA of INR 6,881

mn (YoY growth of 227.7%)

translating into EBITDA

margin of 18.6% and PAT of

INR 3,421 mn reflecting a

PAT margin of 9.2%.

All through the period, we made significant investments in

manpower, medical infrastructure, and essential supplies to

guarantee that our patients received uninterrupted service. We

are grateful to the numerous Indian and international corporations

who assisted us in expanding our network’s critical care bed

count. As you are aware, as part of our aim to make healthcare

accessible to all, our hospitals started administering vaccines

at cost of procurement. We also partnered with a number of

NGOs and global corporates to sponsor free vaccines for the

underprivileged, and we were proud to lend our support to India’s

much-lauded national immunisation programme.

Regulatory thrust to nurture healthcare ecosystem

While the gaps in the nation’s healthcare infrastructure were

exposed during the period in question, we would also like to take

The Company commenced operations in its Ahmedabad unit on May 3, 2012. As of March 31, 2022, the Group is yet to achieve the

above timelines. The Group based on its past projects with government and other authorities believes that the terms/ conditions of

grant of leasehold land at concessional rate would be renegotiated and no liability or adjustment to recorded assets is required as

at March 31, 2022.:

letter dated April 24, 2015.

Since this land is given in lieu of land allotted at Bagrana, NHPL has requested JDA that the land at Govind Pura Ropada to be valued

the same as it was during the time of allotment of land in Bagrana in March 2008.

As at March 31, 2022, NHPL has paid C 54.44 million (March 31, 2021 : C 54.44 million) to JDA and accrued the balance payable

of C 53.39 million (31 March 2021 : C 47.45 million). NHPL would capitalize this amount along with any other payment once NHPL

gets the land registered in its name. As at March 31, 2022, NHPL has assessed the status of the advance paid and on grounds of

prudence has recorded a provision for the above advance amounting to C 54.44 million. The Company continues to engage with JDA

for resolution of the above.
