The management assessed that fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, book overdrafts and

other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these

instruments.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a

current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.:
