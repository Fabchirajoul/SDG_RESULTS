Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE: Dear Shareholders,

I am happy to write to you on the completion of a good year

with strong performance across multiple parameters.

FY22 witnessed robust top-line and EBITDA growth

with global revenues crossing the US$ 5 billion mark and

adjusted net profit surpassing the US$ 1 billion mark for

the first time in Sun Pharma’s history. All geographies did

well, recording double-digit growth, while profitability

improved despite rising costs.

Normalcy is returning to economic activities globally.

Patient visits to doctor clinics are improving and new

product launches are gaining traction.

Our global consolidated revenues grew by 15.6% to

` 384 Billion while EBITDA grew by 23.6% to ` 101 Billion

with EBITDA margins expanding by 170bps to 26.5% over

the previous year. Adjusted net profit (excluding exceptional

items) was up by about 29% to ` 76 Billion.

Excluding exceptional items, ROCE improved by 288bps

to 16.4%, ROIC by 306bps to 21% while ROE improved by

256bps to 15%.

The contribution of our global specialty business has nearly

doubled from 7% of consolidated revenues in FY18 to

about 13% in FY22.

Operational performance

For FY22, India formulation sales were at ` 127 Billion, up

23% and accounted for about 33% of overall revenues.

Excluding the contribution of COVID products, the

underlying business performed well, with about 20%

growth over the previous year.

Our India business outperformed the average industry

growth, driven by our leading presence in chronic segments

coupled with our strong brand equity with doctors. As per

AIOCD AWACS March 2022 data, our market share increased

to 8.34% on MAT basis from 8.17% in the previous year.

As per SMSRC data for February 2022, Sun Pharma ranks

No. 1 by prescriptions with 11 different classes of doctors.

We continued our new launches momentum with 77 new

product introductions in India.

The India field force expansion undertaken in FY21 met

with good success and the new field force achieved its

targets ahead of time.

Revenues in the US grew by about 13% to ` 114 Billion

and accounted for approximately 30% of our consolidated

revenues for FY22. Specialty sales in US continued to gain

traction. While the generics business continued to face

price erosion, we were able to partly compensate it through

new launches and an efficient supply chain.

Our subsidiary, Taro, recorded about 2% growth in overall

revenues to US$ 561 Million. During the year, Taro

acquired Alchemee (formerly The Proactiv Company)

from Galderma, including the Proactiv® brand for acne

treatment. The acquisition further strengthened Taro’s

OTC dermatology portfolio.

Our Emerging markets (EM) sales grew by 16% to ` 67 Billion

and contributed about 18% of our consolidated revenues.

In local currency terms, large markets like Russia, Brazil and

Romania recorded strong double-digit growth. Post the close

of the financial year, Sun Pharma expanded its OTC presence

in Romania by acquiring UractivTM OTC portfolio from

Fiterman Pharma. It is the number one brand in its category

and the portfolio comprises food supplements including

minerals, vitamins and adjuvants; cosmetics and medical

devices used for maintaining urinary tract health.

Our sales in the Rest of World (RoW) markets grew by 11%

to ` 54 Billion and contributed about 14% to consolidated

revenues. Growth was driven by higher sales in Western

Europe and ramp-up in Ilumya sales in Australia and Japan.

Odomzo also gained traction in RoW markets.

Research & Development (R&D)

Our R&D investments were approximately ` 22 Billion, at

5.8% of overall sales. During the year, we filed approximately

200 formulation dossiers globally. We continued our R&D

efforts to develop differentiated generics and innovative

specialty products. Some of the clinical trials for our

specialty products got delayed during FY22 due to the

pandemic but are expected to gradually normalise in FY23.

We have multiple R&D centres and a strong R&D team

which enables development of new products for various

markets globally. We remain disciplined in identifying

future R&D projects for the US generics market and the

focus is on developing complex products. Investments for

developing the long-term specialty pipeline are expected to

continue and R&D investments are expected to increase as

clinical trials for specialty products gain traction.

letter observations issued

in May 2014. The Company is awaiting a re-inspection of the facility by the USFDA to resolve the import alert. The

contribution of this facility to Company’s revenues was negligible.

4

The USFDA, on January 23, 2014, had prohibited using API manufactured at Toansa facility for manufacture of

finished drug products intended for distribution in the U.S. market. Consequentially, the Toansa manufacturing facility

was subject to certain provisions of the consent decree of permanent injunction entered in January 2012 by erstwhile

Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd (which was merged with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd in March 2015). In addition,

the Department of Justice of the USA (‘US DOJ’), United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey had

also issued an administrative subpoena dated March 13, 2014 seeking information. The Company continues to fully

co-operate and provide requisite information to the US DOJ.

5

The December 2019 USFDA inspection of Halol facility was classified as Official Action Indicated (OAI). The

Company was in continuous communication with the USFDA to resolve the outstanding issues and was awaiting a

re-inspection by USFDA to resolve the OAI status. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions,

the re-inspection was delayed. In April-May 2022, the USFDA inspected the Halol facility and issued Form-483 with

10 observations. The Company will be submitting a comprehensive response, including the corrective actions to be

undertaken for addressing the observations, within the stipulated time to the USFDA.

6

In September 2013, the USFDA had put the Mohali facility under import alert and it was also subjected to certain

provisions of the consent decree of permanent injunction entered in January 2012 by erstwhile Ranbaxy Laboratories

Ltd (which was merged with parent company in March 2015). In March 2017, the USFDA lifted the import alert and

indicated that the facility was in compliance with the requirements of cGMP provisions mentioned in the consent

decree. The Mohali facility continues to demonstrate sustainable cGMP compliance and has completed the 5-year

post certification provisions as required by the consent decree. The Company continues to receive approval of

applications, manufacture and distribute products to the U.S from this facility.

7

In accordance with Ind AS 108 “Operating Segments”, segment information has been given in the consolidated

Ind AS financial statements, and therefore, no separate disclosure on segment information is given in these

financial statements.

During the year, the Company has acquired additional 11.28 % stake in Zenotech Laboratories Limited (Zenotech), a

subsidiary of the Company, from Daiichi Sankyo Company Ltd. for a total consideration of ` 53.23 Million pursuant to

a share purchase agreement. Post this acquisition, the Company’s shareholding in Zenotech has increased from 57.56

% to 68.84 %.
