Dear Shareholders,

Last year, the COVID-19

pandemic caused a

major upheaval globally.

Today, we can look back

at the past three years

and applaud the efforts

of the pharma and

healthcare industry to

tackle COVID-19, which

continues to affect many

countries even today.

The social and economic

impact on people and

communities globally has

been devastating. In the

midst of all the disruption,

science has provided us

with solutions to combat

COVID-19 through

diagnostics, vaccines,

therapies. Fortunately,

humanity is winning the

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

As I look back at the last

few years, I marvel at the

revolutionary changes

across the globe especially

in the healthcare industry.

From individuals taking

ownership of their well-being,

leading to a conscious shift

from illness to wellness, to

the latest innovations that

create new digitally-driven

medical solutions, the new

developments are embracing

personalised focus in

healthcare while reforming and

reshaping the industry to a

new beginning. This new world

order, built on the foundation

of collaboration, backed by

scientific advancements and

driven by data, will result

in making healthcare more

accessible and affordable.

Our Purpose, Our True North

Cipla is an organisation built on the

foundation of care. Your Company is not

merely making medicines, it is saving lives

and ensuring good health and well-being.

This is the OneCipla credo that runs deep

within our culture and we will strive to

practice and reinforce it and build deeper

engagement for the organisational values

amongst all stakeholders.

This has been a momentous period

for all of us as your Company was

bestowed with the ‘Company of the

Year’ 2021 award by Business Standard.

Another well-deserved recognition, our

Executive Vice-Chairperson, Samina

Hamied was conferred with ET’s marquee

‘Businesswoman of the Year’ 2021. Our

practices were recognised as Cipla secured

The world we live in today is radically

impacted by climate change and

irresponsible consumption leading to

resource scarcity. This is the time to act

responsibly and embed sustainability into

the way of doing business. In alignment with

our purpose, we at Cipla, have relentlessly

worked to enrich lives of the communities

landfill, green chemistry and well-being of

employees and partners and have already

made significant progress. We articulated

our ESG framework as Championing

Climate Positivity| Accelerating

Community Well-being | Raising the Bar

on Governance | Enhancing Access and

Affordability that is aimed at defining our

approach towards each of the following

components — Environment, Social,

Governance, and developing a holistic

sustainability roadmap for the future.

Cipla was recognised among the top 30

companies under the Indian Corporate

Governance Scorecard 2021 and ranked

as one of the most sustainable companies

in the Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging

Markets Index. Cipla also won the

prestigious Frost & Sullivan and TERI’s

Sustainability 4.0 Award 2021 as ‘Challenger

in Mega Large Business Pharma Sector’.

These accolades reiterate our passion and

commitment towards our planet.

A Momentous Year

In FY 2021-22, we made significant

progress across all our strategic priorities

whilst navigating challenging external

environment. We continued the strong

momentum across India, US and other

key markets, while continuing investments

in portfolio and several other growth-

linked initiatives. The cost re-imagination

initiatives, supply consistency and rigour

on the operational excellence helped

sustain healthy metrics across markets.

I am happy to share that your Company

recorded the highest revenue and

achieved several major milestones in the

One-India and US businesses. One-

India business is now tracking close to

H 10,000 crores mark. Our strong brand

equity amongst patients and physicians
