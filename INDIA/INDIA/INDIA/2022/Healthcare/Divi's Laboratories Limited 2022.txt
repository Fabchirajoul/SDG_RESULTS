Divi’s has remained resilient

to adversities during the

year and continuously

leveraged its agile business

model to mitigate risks in

a mindful manner with a

purposeful performance

strategy.

Over three decades, we have delivered

sustainable growth, anchored on our core

competencies of trust, technology and

teamwork.

During the year, revenue of Divi’s

surpassed a Billion-dollar mark, making

us one of the few companies reaching

this milestone in the small molecule API

segment. This is amidst the volatility and

uncertainty in raw materials, challenges

in logistics, energy crisis and geopolitical

tensions.

We continue to maintain strategic

relationships by fulfilling all commitments

to our customers, business partners and

other stakeholders.

Our efforts to create a future-ready

enterprise have included Capacity

Building, Backward Integration, Green

Chemistry and, most importantly,

Sustainable Operation.

Resilience to

adversity.

Committed

to holistic growth.:

Managing Director’s

Perspective

I would like to thank everyone

at Divi’s for their unwavering

commitment in response to

Covid-19 pandemic and serve

our customers through these

challenging times. The resilience

of our business model will enable

us to emerge stronger and ensure

reliability in an ever-changing

dynamic world.: Dear Shareholders,

The financial year 2021-22 began on

a subdued note owing to repeated

attacks of the pandemic, taking a

severe toll on lives and economies.

As the world navigated through the

pandemic, the escalation of geopolitical

strife

compounded

the

crisis

and

brought numerous other challenges

in the form of strained geopolitical

and trade relations, a runaway inflation

and

unprecedented

volatility

in

commodity costs.

In the face of such flux, the industry

showed

resilience

and

adaptability,

ensuring continuous supply of medicines

to help patients gain access to their

medication.

The

pandemic

has

accelerated

significant change in the healthcare

ecosystem, making it more adaptable

and innovative in order to withstand

unexpected challenges and capitalise on

the opportunities.

In this uncertain operating environment,

our focus remained on the health

and safety of our people, ensuring

uninterrupted supply of our products

to meet the evolving demand of our

customers and our business needs. This

has strongly positioned us as a reliable

supplier to the global pharmaceutical

companies.

The year in review

The year had been challenging with

several headwinds and against this

backdrop, our results for the year

demonstrate our execution prowess,

agility, strategic clarity and the strength of

supply chain.

Our core investment for the past two

years

on

debottlenecking,

capacity

expansion and backward integration

strength

helped

us

achieve

scale

and de-risk external starting material

dependence. Our agile business model

and stable supply chain ensured minimal

business disruption and uninterrupted

supply to our customers across the

globe.

The commitment and determined efforts

of the entire Divi’s family helped us live up

to the name of a reliable supplier of API’s.

As a global leader of API’s, we have always

accommodated the sudden increase

in market demands quickly. We have

also sucessfully completed the capacity

expansions that we have taken up during

the year.

Keeping our Green

commitment

During the year FY2022, apart from

creating additional capacities for our

pipeline products and new capacities

for emerging custom synthesis projects,

we have also upgraded our utility

infrastructure,

which

also

includes

environment management.

We

strive

to

create

brand

value

by

adopting

sustainable

practices

and implementing Green chemistry

principles.

As an industry leader and a responsible

enterprise, we served the communities

around our manufacturing facilities in

several ways by enhancing the village

infrastructure, providing safe drinking

water, empowering women and improving

public healthcare.

Future focused – Agile, consistent

and reliable

As we enter a new financial year, we are

better prepared to handle the evolving

demand, continuous market volatility and

an uncertain economic environment.

At Divi’s, we aim to exceed the internal

benchmark so that we can consistently

deliver value to our customers, and also

perform as a dependable supplier.

Our focus will remain on Continuous

process innovation and Green chemistry

implementation to further establish Divi's

as a strong sustainable organisation and

deliver value added performance.

I would like to take this opportunity and

thank our employees for their consistent

effort to deliver the best results despite the

challenges. I thank all the stakeholders for

reposing their trust in us, which has made

Divi’s a reliable brand.

We will continue to strive for leadership

through chemistry and be the most

reliable supplier of high-quality API’s while

creating value for all our stake holders.
