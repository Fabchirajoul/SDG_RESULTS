Dear Shareholders,

We are happy to announce a successful conclusion to

FY22. Dr. Lal PathLabs maintained its track record of

being india’s leading diagnostics lab chain, providing

the best quality diagnostic services to patients in an

affordable and accessible manner.

in a significant development during FY22, we

strengthened our presence in the fast-growing region

of Western india by the acquisition of suburban

Diagnostics, mumbai. While this will vastly improve

our business in this region, the objective is to leverage

the expertise of both the companies to deliver

accurate diagnostics with better patient experience.

thus the acquisition of suburban Diagnostics will

help us establish a strong base in the high-growth

region of Western india, in-line with our strategy.

also, our hub-and-spoke business model, spread

across india has been very effective and efficient in

helping us reach and penetrate deeper. With our

well-established regional reference Labs in North

and east india giving us healthy increment in patient

volumes. We also remain on track to acquire smaller,

FroM tHe

CHairMaN’S DeSK

unbranded labs across the country through our

subsidiary PathLabs unifiers Private Limited.

the year FY22 was marked by sharp recovery in the

non-CoViD business post two successive CoViD-19

waves. the year began with a nation-wide lockdown

being imposed on account of the second wave of the

CoViD-19 pandemic, which was more severe than

the first one. the morbidity and mortality from this

Delta virus were more this time. after the second

wave receded, the caseloads stayed well under

control until December due to the rapid vaccination

drive, when the new and fast-transmitting omicron

variant started spreading. however, fortunately, it was

not very resurgent and died down soon after. Dr. Lal

PathLabs remained at the forefront, providing quality

and efficiency in CoViD and allied testing throughout

the year, and especially during these two periods.

one key change that we witnessed since the onset of

the pandemic, was that home collections and online

bookings were the most preferred options used

by the patients.

the scope for growth in the indian healthcare

industry, especially the diagnostics industry is

considerable. india continues to have a significantly

lower healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP

as compared to many other nations. moreover, the

shift of market share from the unorganized to the

organized sector in the industry has been rapid since

the onset of the pandemic. to reap the benefits of

this trend, Dr. Lal PathLabs has been making use of

technology to improve efficiency and experience of

services for the patients.

the shift in industry trends, wherein the market share

moving from the unorganized to the organized sector

has accelerated. Consumers prefer the assurance of

quality and efficiency offered by a branded, pan-india

player, something that unorganized players cannot

offer. also, post the pandemic, people have become

more attentive to their health. by consistently

addressing these concerns, Dr. Lal PathLabs has

maintained its position as a leading diagnostics player

in india with growing presence in newer regions.

Government of india (Goi) has announced various

initiatives and has also increased spending across

several schemes, so that healthcare benefits reach:

MaNaGiNG DireCtor: Dear Shareholders,

in the pandemic, we have all experienced a once in

a lifetime event. my earnest wish is that all of you

and your loved ones have kept safe and continue

to do so. 2021-22 began on a very challenging

note, where the country was gripped by an intense

expression of CoViD-19.

While there was little predictability on operating

parameters, we made it an endeavour to organize

for effectiveness and enhance the convenience

to patients. testing for Covid-19, at scale, when

the industry had never done such a thing before,

was a litmus test for what we in the organized

space stand for. being cognizant of the underlying

requirement

for

illness

or

prescription-based

testing, emphasis was given equally to processing

non-CoViD samples, which too marked an ebb and

flow in line with the restriction on movement by

way of lockdowns. the brand focused on building

availability of testing infrastructure as required for

both CoViD and non-CoViD, enhancing accessibility

through emerging channels like home collection

and streamlining interactions online. Patients have

recognized what a brand can do and have had the

opportunity to experience the service standards

that we adhere by.

as a nation, while we are marking what is possibly

the final chapter of the pandemic, i can share certain

trends as they have become apparent to us. Firstly, we

have seen a continual build up in the trend of home

collection of samples. as a proportion, this sits at

~12% today relative to 5-6% pre-pandemic. We have

responded by doubling down on training for seamless

brand experience at home and towards making the

entire process efficient. the second observation i wish

to share is that we have seen a marked improvement

in samples coming from the franchisee partners,

both at the walk-in level post the lockdowns and from

institutional avenues throughout. We have always

believed in strengthening the spokes within our

hub and spoke operation and have been investing in

creating the right process flows to enable that.

third, we have seen the contribution from ‘swasthFit’,

our bundle test offering, increasing. true to its premise,

the program allows the patients and consulting

doctors to benefit from comprehensive analysis of

underlying data. During the pandemic especially,

during the successive phases of it, we saw an evolving

combination of allied tests emerging. the system was

geared to aid the communities through more focused

testing of the relevant parameters.

and lastly, what we have observed at the outset, that

non-CoViD marks a far larger opportunity and that

one should not lose sight of it. all of our network and

infrastructure build outs have supported that.

the year 2021-22 was also a milestone year for another

reason. We successfully completed the acquisition

and integration of suburban Diagnostics, which you

will know is a mumbai-centered brand in Western

india. our premise was clear, where we are seeking

to augment and facilitate significant growth in the

geography. Whereas at the outset the contribution

share from this region has multiplied, i am aware that

there is lot of work to be done. We wish to drive both

brands, leveraging credentials as leading healthcare

providers in full-service diagnostics.

meanwhile, through PathLabs unifiers we continue to

create meaningful clusters of growth across the south

managing Director

and West. our bengaluru regional reference lab and

the hub-labs we are creating in the rest of the country

are proving to be gateways to accelerated sampling.

as the year progressed, the organized industry within

diagnostics saw new participation from dedicated

players. We welcome these developments as together

we can serve the country better. Dr Lal also continues

to partner and ally with online aggregators in an effort

to build an online platform for sample collection.

investments have also been directed at enhancing

digital footprint, both at operational back end and

the front end, where a positive impact can be felt

by the patients. We are similarly taking a scientific

temperament towards introducing latest technologies

in testing in order to enhance convenience while

rendering superior and more accurate outcomes.

to share some statistics, we derived 34% shared

contribution from the Delhi-NCr region and 28%

from rest of North india, followed by 15% from east,

14% from the West, 7% from the south and 2% from

international & others. these will re-balance as we

progress. We have served 27.3 mn patients during

the year 2021-22, including of course the surge

in sampling due to the pandemic, which in turn

came in at 66 mn.

revenues for the year showed 32% increase, on

consolidated basis including suburban Diagnostic

contribution. Normalized Pat improvement of 25%

was recorded. ‘swasthFit’ drew in 18% contribution

to revenues in the year. as a trend, this segment

should record further pick-up, guided by increased

awareness of wellness and health awareness brought

in by the pandemic.

in a rolling effort, we enhanced our network reach.

Year on year we saw 46 labs getting added, 1,026

patient service centers and 1,352 pick-up points.

a roadmap for the year ahead

in the past we brought about greater alignment

to our mission and structured our Csr initiatives.

our flagship programs have seen growth and scale

to more regions across the country. our roadmap

ahead is to:

• build scale in our flagship programs

• increase our geographical footprint in more tier ii

& tier iii regions

• Create more inclusiveness in target communities

by continuing to enrol and place more women

candidates.

• Create a structured corporate volunteering

program such that the tacit knowledge within

the parent organisation can be used to effectively

benefit the lesser endowed segments of the

society.

We have excelled as a key player in the diagnostic

delivery sector for over 70 years. the large body of

knowledge and technical capabilities in healthcare

needs to be spread to the hinterland so that rural

india has access to modern healthcare diagnostics. it

is towards this end that the Lal Pathlabs Foundation

continues to progress, every step of the way.

i thank all our partners in Government, institutes,

NGos, other organisations and community at large

for traversing alongside on our journey of proving

healthcare access to the country.:
