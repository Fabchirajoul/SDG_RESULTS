Managing Director's review

Preparing to emerge stronger

At Aurobindo Pharma

we remain committed to

becoming one of the most

sustainable organisations

in the pharmaceutical

industry. We are diligently

working towards the goals

set for reducing carbon

emissions, replacing

traditional fuel sources with

renewable energy, mindful

management of water and

waste and conservation of

biodiversity.: Dear Shareholders,

The challenges caused by the Covid

pandemic during FY21 continued

into FY22 and some new challenges

got added. The start of the Russia-

Ukraine war in Q4 FY22 set the stage

for all-round commodity price volatility

which significantly affected margins and

profitability in our key product segments.

However, the diversified spread of our

product portfolio and the vast number

of markets that we operate in helped

to minimize and mitigate the extent of

negative impact, and we were successful

in maintaining an EBITDA margin of 18.7%

despite these headwinds.

We have a very strong presence in the

US market, which accounts for almost half

of our formulations revenues and houses

the largest number of our manufacturing

facilities, outside of India. However, this

business was one of the hardest hit

this year due to increasing competition

on pricing of formulations vis-à-vis

unprecedented rise in input materials.

Our Europe business, on the other hand,

grew at a steady pace of around 10-15%

as did our growth markets in countries like

Canada and Brazil. We have completed

the development of our injectables

manufacturing facility in the US and expect

a good pick up in demand realizations

from that region in the coming years.

SHIFTING GEARS,

REALIGNING PRIORITIES

Two challenging years, back-to-back,

have helped us to put our priorities into

perspective. We will be shifting gears

and realigning our business over the

chain difficulties faced this year with

sourcing from China only underlines

the importance of having a diversified

sourcing base and for import substitution.

DEVELOPING NEW MARKETS,

BALANCING DOMESTIC AND

GLOBAL DEMAND

The domestic market too promises strong

growth in the therapeutic areas and our

team has been reviewing all existing

and emerging possibilities. As India’s

GDP growth outstrips most other global

economies, we will be able to cater both

domestic and international demand.

We have been consistently growing our

presence in the China market, which is

one of the largest healthcare markets

in the world other than also being a

dominant supply base. We are creating an

oral formulation facility in China and plan

to fulfil our international demand apart

from domestic contribution. We began

local manufacturing in that country from

January 2022 and aim to shift 30 products

from India into China. Of these, two have

been approved and we expect another

10-15 products to receive their approvals

in this year. We also intend to transfer a

few products from Europe to the China

facility. With a total target of reaching 40

products in China, if we are successful in

realizing our plans then there should be

significant accretion to both our topline

and bottomline spreads.

TAKING THE R&D ROUTE TO

CREATE DIFFERENTIATED

PRESENCE

Our long history in the pharma industry

has its roots in our R&D strength. The

nine R&D centres that we run today

are supported by a pool of world-class

talent, and highly trained regulatory

and intellectual property teams. We are

building a diversified portfolio of finished

dosage forms in orals, liquids, topicals,

biosimilars, nasal, and parenteral products

targeted at the global markets, and

in FY22 our primary R&D focus was

complex parenteral products. Our long-

term goal envisions a shift to a higher

mix of branded products within the

categories where we have a dominant

presence. An array of distinctive brands

will enable us to make our own space

and to shift from the crowded generics

market, with a better command over

profitability and user segments. Our

new product development capability

along our manufacturing flexibility and

very large geographic presence would

act as force multipliers. In FY22, our

R&D investment towards future pipeline

growth totalled `15,814 million, with

a significant share going towards the

biosimilars pipeline.

COMMITTED TO ESG AND

CREATING A BETTER FUTURE

FOR ALL

At Aurobindo Pharma we remain

committed to becoming one of the

most sustainable organisations in

the pharmaceutical industry. We are

diligently working towards the goals

set for reducing carbon emissions,

replacing traditional fuel sources with

renewable energy, mindful management

of water and waste and conservation

of biodiversity. Adoption of sustainable

packaging techniques and practices for

controlling material wastage steadily

increased over the year, as did our

efforts to keep ‘greening’ our supply

chain. We have successfully built

capabilities to generate solar power, and

during the year 43,000 MWh of solar

energy were generated and consumed.

In our concerted attempts to control

and eradicate ‘beyond-the-fence’

water pollution, and reduce the AMR

burden, we have started retreating the

wastewater generated during product

manufacturing at API manufacturing

facilities, with the goal of reusing the

treated wastewater.

8

Annual Report 2021-22

near- to medium-term – continuing with

some of our focus areas and reducing

dependence on the rest. Our strong

background in generic formulations has

created an overdependence on raw

material procurement, input prices and

logistical performance – all of which are

factors beyond our control. Unpredictability

in any of these dimensions can potentially

corrode overall growth. We are keen to

moderate this impact over time.

We will continue to drive our injectables

business where we envisage strong

growth and healthy margins, and a working

model that premiumizes value addition.

Our biosimilars portfolio growth has been

gaining steady momentum, and in FY22,

we filed two oncology biosimilars with the

European Medicine Agency. Additionally,

three more are at Phase 3 licensure clinical

trials stage, of which one is expected to

complete these trials by early FY23. As

we build our biosimilars pipeline, we are

optimistic about the new revenue streams

starting in the next 1-2 years.

Closer home, we have been working

consistently on the opportunities

unleashed by the government’s Production

Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme with the

penicillin and allied areas throwing up

some very attractive prospects. We have

initiated building capacities in these areas

and invested this year ₹2,677.7 million and

the total capital for this project is expected

to be around ₹18,500 million to ₹19,000

million which will help us to significantly

enhance our backward integration, make

our production value chain more resilient

and improve control over costs and

sustainable profit margins. The supply

The dynamic, competitive landscape that

the pharma industry operates in requires

our people to be fully equipped to handle

the emerging challenges so that patient

safety, product quality and compliance

remain of the best standards. It is equally

important to balance employee health,

wellbeing, career advancement needs and

personal growth with the organizational

needs. At Aurobindo Pharma, we make the

best career development opportunities

available through our diverse suite of

learning and development activities.

Commitment towards the society underlies

what we do everyday and our work with

our adjacent communities reflects our

social purpose. Prevention of malnutrition,

control and eradication of disease

amongst rural communities, sustainable

agriculture, womens’ empowerment are

some of the social development areas that

we are involved in as we attempt to do

our bit towards a healthier society and a

sustainable planet.

As we look forward to a year that promises

to be different from the one we have left

behind, we are preparing ourselves for

the many opportunities that are getting

uncovered. Disease, inequity in access to

health, reducing resources are issues that

keep our purpose fresh and relevant. There

are miles to be covered, for challenges are

always opportunities in disguise and we

are more than ready for it.
