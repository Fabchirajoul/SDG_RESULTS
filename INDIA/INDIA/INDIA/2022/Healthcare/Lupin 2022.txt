08 Chaiman’s: Letter

10 Vice

Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present to you Lupin’s FY22 Integrated

Report.

Each year begins with new aspirations and a positive outlook

for the future. As we started FY22, coming out of the first

year of the COVID-19 pandemic, amidst all the wins and

challenges that we had seen, we knew that we had done our

part towards our long-term goal of becoming leaders in the

products, therapies and markets in which we operate. In

FY22, through new lockdowns, new variants, and multiple

other challenges, we as a Company and a team remained

resilient and agile – continuing to deliver on our mission and

focused on our goals.

On the business front, Lupin’s India business has consistently

outperformed the Indian pharma market as the business

continues to expand its presence in chronic therapies.

We have grown our market share in key therapy areas of

interest including Respiratory, Diabetes, Cardiology and

Gastrointestinal diseases. In addition, this year we launched

Lupin Diagnostics – this launch aligns with our commitment

to Building Better Health, and places Lupin on the path

towards becoming a holistic healthcare player.

Our U.S. business encountered headwinds from rising

competition, declining prices and input cost pressures.

Despite this, we maintained our ranking as the third-largest

company in the U.S. in terms of prescriptions, increasing

volumes by 9.71%. We remained focused on the ramp-up of

our inhalation business while continuing to work towards

achieving market leadership in our key therapy areas.

Chairman’s: Letter

This year, we invested 8.7% of sales into Research and

Development. Our key wins included receiving USD 50 Mn

for achieving key NCE milestones on our partnered MEK

program, 19 ANDA and 8 DMF filings, as well as the approval

of important global institution sale products.

Commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility runs deep

in Lupin. While we have focused on improving “Livelihoods”

in our villages of focus for over three decades, with the

launch of our new “Lives” pillar, our CSR initiatives will be

now be equally focused on diseases of national importance,

in line with the WHO framework for healthcare delivery.

Our emphasis is on high impact programs in the areas of

Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, COPD and Asthma, all of

which are also in line with Lupin’s therapeutic expertise.

Within this report, we have placed strong emphasis on

the implementation of Environmental Social Governance

initiatives. The report summarizes our present position on

several important issues for us as an organization and is

reflective of our goals and targets going forward. On the

Governance front we are committed to the highest ethical

and responsibility standards and practices.

One of Dr. Desh Bandhu Gupta’s favorite quotes was,

“Whatever the human mind can conceive and believe, it can

achieve”. It is of great pride to me that every Lupinytt has

displayed this entrepreneurial spirit and is committed to

together taking our great legacy ahead.

Warm regards,

Manju D. Gupta

Letter: Dear Shareholders,

Over the last two years, we have seen the COVID

pandemic not only as a hurdle to be overcome but

also as an opportunity to build on our adaptability

and resilience. Through this, we look forward to an

enriching and transformational journey that will lead

to long-term growth through leveraging our strong

foundation and global reach, evolving our generics

business and expanding our product portfolio.

It was gratifying to see several promising

developments in the past fiscal such as the

satisfactory inspectional classification for our Goa

plant by US FDA, the launch of Lupin Diagnostics, the

acquisition of the Anglo-French Drugs & Industries Ltd

brand portfolio in India as well as the acquisition of

Southern Cross Pharma in Australia.

On the manufacturing front, we did well to serve

our customers through maintaining continuity of

supplies despite multiple COVID-19 waves through

the year. Our digital transformation initiative at our

manufacturing sites, Accelerated Digital & Analytics

Performance Transformation (ADAPT), is enabling us

to leverage next-gen technologies such as advanced

analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning

to deliver top-notch quality, productivity and cost-

efficiencies.

Whilst the business challenges in the U.S. in the form

of greater competition continue to erode prices for

generic products, we are working on several initiatives

to mitigate this impact and lay the foundation for a

more resilient future. We have also had success as in

now achieving two milestones for our MEK inhibitor

(New Molecular Entity) program that we had out-

licensed, and good growth in India and other markets,

which are reflective of the talent and underlying

commitment of our people. In India, especially the

chronic side of the business, we continue to grow

faster than the market.

Coupled with the focus on high growth markets,

I am convinced that the company’s evolution as a

leading complex generics player will position us very

differently.

We are working on several initiatives across the

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) space

and are committed to rapid progress: for instance,

through the Environment lens, we aim to reduce our

environmental impact by working with our suppliers

to lower their environmental footprint. Further, we

are committed to making our company a great place

to work for our employees, as we are to fair dealings

with other stakeholders and communities. On the

Governance front, we are reaffirming our commitment

to uphold the highest ethical and responsible

standards in everything we do, with an effective

management framework in place to ensure that we

stay on track.

We stand by DBG’s vision and his commitment to

progress through empowering our people, responsible

leadership, and focus on innovation even as we evolve

in a transforming world.

Kamal Sharma

Vice-

Letter: Dear Shareholders,

We are delighted to present our Integrated Report for FY22,

showcasing our wins, challenges, and the promise of what the

future holds in store.

Our founder, Dr. Desh Bandhu Gupta (DBG), laid the

foundation for the ethos that has remained the driving force

at Lupin. This has ensured resilience and positive momentum

despite challenges and roadblocks.

We are currently focused on a three-pronged strategy to

achieve our organizational objectives:

• Building on the strong foundation in our core business

and consolidating our geographic footprint

• Evolving our generics business to complex generics and

maximizing our generics portfolio globally to further the

cause of affordable medicines

• Focusing on cost reduction/rationalization initiatives to

strengthen our foundation and drive efficiencies for the

future

During the year, we have made good progress and achieved

good business outcomes in several geographies like India,

Australia, the Philippines, Canada, Mexico and Germany; but

at the same time, we continued to encounter substantial

headwinds in our U.S. and API businesses. On the U.S. front,

business conditions continue to be tough with intensifying

competition, eroding margins and a rapidly commoditizing

oral solid dosage business. We have however started to

realize benefits of complex platforms like inhalation in the

U.S., which constituted over 25% of our revenues during the

year. Likewise, in the aftermath of the pandemic, demand for

acute therapy products especially cephalosporins receded

considerably, affecting the performance of our API business.

In India, Lupin continues to evolve faster than the market

with the business growing 1.2 times the market growth rate.

Our Chronic segments (respiratory, cardiology and diabetes)

which are nearly 65% of our India business, registered strong

double-digit growth and grew faster than the top 3 players in

the Indian market. India formulation sales for FY22 were INR

60,042 Mn, up 13.9% as compared to INR 52,712 Mn in FY21;

and accounted for 38% of Lupin’s global sales.

Even as we expanded our product portfolio into under-

represented therapies, we continued to focus on cardiology,

diabetes, and respiratory to further consolidate on and

grow faster than the market in these therapeutic areas.

Following the successful acquisition of the Anglo-French

brand portfolio, we are also enhancing our presence in

the Nutraceuticals/Vitamins space. In FY22, our India OTC

business surpassed the INR 100 crore milestone in revenues,

registering a growth of 17%.

Keeping our patient’s holistic healthcare needs in mind, we

have also expanded into the field of Diagnostics. We believe

that this would be synergistic to our existing India business,

providing doctors broader solutions for the patients we serve.

The Diagnostics arena is very fragmented, and we believe that

there is tremendous long-term potential for a trusted, quality

play in this field.

Lupin continues to be the 3rd largest pharmaceutical player

in both the U.S. generic market and U.S. total market by

prescriptions (IQVIA MAT March 2022). Our North America

sales for FY22 were INR 57,556 Mn compared to INR 55,520

Mn in FY21; and accounted for 36% of Lupin’s global sales.

This year, our current U.S. portfolio, largely dominated by

oral solids, came under significant pricing pressure. We have

in recent times taken several initiatives to optimize costs.

These measures are being further enhanced with renewed

vigor across the entire value chain to rationalize our overall

cost structure and restore the health of our U.S. business. In

complex generics that are a crucial part of our future growth,

we made significant progress in Inhalation with Albuterol

recording 20% generic market share and successful launch of

Brovana generic.

With our pipeline evolving to more complex generics across

inhalation, injectables and biosimilars, we believe that we

are well positioned to drive growth while strengthening our

position as a trusted, quality organization serving the cause of

affordable medicines.

Our EMEA sales for FY22 were up 6.3% to INR 13,592 Mn as

compared with FY21. NaMuscla®, the first licensed medicine

to treat symptomatic myotonia in adult non-dystrophic

myotonia patients continues to be a growth driver. In addition,

we entered into alliances for Fostair Gx and Tiotropium,

ensuring that we have complete regional commercial

coverage to maximize our inhalation portfolio across Europe.

In the U.K., the ramp-up of Luforbec has continued, while we

increase our focus on the delivery of the future pipeline to

ensure continued success.

In our Growth Markets, the impact of COVID was felt most

sharply in Brazil. Philippines recovered sharply after eroding a

fair bit in the past year and is poised for greater growth in the

future.

In Australia, we completed the acquisition of Southern

Cross Pharma; this will materially grow our presence in the

Australian market. In Canada, we continue to deliver strong

performance, driven by our lead brand Zaxine, as well as our

growing internal generics portfolio.

In FY22, we closed an alliance with Foncoo Pharmaceutical

Co. in China to commercialize our CNS medications, allowing

us to continue our mission of offering affordable and

accessible healthcare to the world.

From a pipeline perspective, we continue to evolve our

complex generics platforms and build a truly valuable

portfolio of products catering to markets across the world.

On the Inhalation front we have already seen the benefit of

generic Albuterol MDI and the Brovana authorized generic

in the U.S., both contributing meaningfully to revenues and

the bottom line. We are making steady progressing on our

next major U.S. inhalation introduction with Tiotropium DPI,

as well as making progress on other pipeline programs.

During the year, we made progress on Respimat with the

TTP partnership that has given us access to this complex

inhalation platform. Pipeline products, such as biosimilar

Ranibizumab and Aflibercept are progressing well. Our NCE

efforts in oncology are going strong; during the year we

received USD 50 Mn milestone from Boehringer Ingelheim

under our partnership, we made progress on our NCE

oncology pipeline and are well positioned to monetize/

partner the pipeline to bring much needed solutions for

unmet medical needs.

Inflationary pressures for essential raw

materials and intermediates further

exacerbated some of the business

challenges during the year. We hope to

start seeing these pressures recede in FY23.

In FY22, we had three US FDA site re-

inspections and we are pleased to say

that our Goa facility was upgraded to a

satisfactory VAI status. This allows us to

introduce new product from this site.

Our people are our biggest strength, and

the Lupin team is committed to overcome

the current challenges and emerge a

stronger, more innovative and efficient

organization.

Since 1988, the Lupin foundation has been

striving to improve society by improving

livelihoods, empowering rural people,

creating employment opportunities,

improving health and quality of life, and

developing basic infrastructure. In FY22,

on DBG’s birth anniversary, we introduced

the Lives pillar as part of our CSR focused

on improving health in the communities we

serve, and going forward, our activities will

concentrate equally on Livelihood

and Lives.

We are on the path of executing well

on our strategy, anchored by portfolio

evolution, differentiation and efficiency.

We are committed to deliver long-term,

sustainable growth in revenues and

profitability. Carrying forward DBG’s legacy,

we are continuing his mission of universal,

affordable, high-quality healthcare, and are

committed to the cause of Building

Better Health.

Corporate Overview

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to share our second

Integrated Report with you. At Lupin we are

committed to the wellbeing of society at large and

ensuring that we provide great quality products to

our consumers at affordable prices. The last two

years have been challenging for the world at large as

a result of the pandemic — however, we at Lupin had

to also contend with headwinds in some major parts

of our business. These tough times have made us

more resilient and more determined to overcome the

challenges around us and come out much stronger

as a company. There is now a lot more vigour

and rigour behind initiatives to maximize growth,

enhance profitability and reduce costs across the

entire value chain – efforts that would make us a lot

more efficient, agile and fit for purpose.

Last year, we articulated our initiatives around the six

capitals that are embedded in the ESG framework.

This year, we would be happy to share with you our

progress on each of the pillars in the subsequent

chapters. Our materiality assessment framework is in

line with our philosophy to make the world a better

place to live, and embraces steps to give back to

nature, communities at large and most importantly

to our various stakeholders. This document reflects

the confidence that the organization has a strong

value ethos and a governance framework that places

emphasis on delivering strong financial performance

whilst not losing sight of the larger goals brought

out by the ESG framework.

Our Performance in FY22

We went past the INR 16,000 crore mark for the first

time in five years thanks to strong business growth

across key geographies.

However, both the topline and bottom line in the

U.S. were marred by strong headwinds. Intensifying

competition, double digit price erosion in our U.S.

generics portfolio, inflationary pressures across

all our inputs caused tremendous stress for the

generics industry in general. The U.S. being a large

part of our overall business, the impact on the overall

business was quite high.

Amidst all of the negatives in the U.S., there were

several remarkable developments — we continue

to build a strong inhalation generics business with

the ramp-up of Albuterol market share to 22.8% in

Q4 FY22 and the launch of the Brovana authorized

generic which together supported the U.S. business

to register almost 3% growth.

The India business continues to shape our growth

story in many ways. We maintained our 6th rank2 in

the India Pharma Market and improved our overall

market share. With the re-opening of the economy,

our sales force was able to better physically connect

with the doctors and the trade. In the meantime,

the pandemic had also enabled us to become

more digitally savvy to provide a better customer

experience.

Commitment

to value

creation and

sustainable

growth

Our materiality assessment framework

is in line with our philosophy to make

the world a better place to live, and

embraces steps to give back to

nature, communities at large and most

importantly to our various stakeholders.

options granted.

• Exercise Price: Exercise Price is the face value of share or such other price as determined by the

Remuneration and Compensation Committee.

• Expected Volatility: The historical volatility of the stock till the date of grant has been considered to

calculate the fair value of the options.

• Expected Option Life: Expected Life of option is the period for which the Company expects the

options to be live. The minimum life of a stock option is the minimum period before which the options

cannot be exercised and the maximum life is the period after which the options cannot be exercised.

• Expected dividends: Expected dividend yield has been calculated as an average of dividend yields for

four years preceding the date of the grant.

• Risk-free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate on the date of grant considered for the calculation

is the interest rate applicable for a maturity equal to the expected life of the options based on the

zero-coupon yield curve for Government Securities.
