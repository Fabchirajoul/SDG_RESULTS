Managing Director’s message

24 Governance at Sanofi India:

Dear Shareholders,

It is indeed a privilege for me to

present to you our first Integrated

Annual Report for FY 2022. Given

the nature of our business and our

close to seven decades of existence

as a socially responsible and ethical

organisation, your Company has

earned both respect and trust of

doctors and people across India.

Therefore, demonstrating the highest

levels of corporate governance is a

logical step towards further improving

transparency in our interactions

with stakeholders.

While the world battles geo-political

tensions and economic stress caused

by untamed inflation and supply

disruptions, India continues to

demonstrate admirable resilience and

a growth-focused policy environment.

The Covid-19 pandemic brought

about a tectonic shift in the way

people view health and overall well-

being. To bridge the gaps in health

infrastructure and make quality

healthcare affordable to all, the

Government of India has prioritised

its efforts towards strengthening the

country’s healthcare ecosystem. This

provides enormous opportunities

to make a difference to more than

a billion lives. Sanofi India is well

positioned to capture some of these

opportunities while staying true to its

commitment for a healthier India.

The focus on sustainability challenges

continues unabated with climate

change becoming a global and

national task at hand. At Sanofi, our

purpose ‘To chase the miracles of

science to improve people’s lives’

provides an impetus to us, as the

Board, to have a stronger focus on

ESG (Environmental, Social, and

Governance) matters.

As you know, the DNA of your

Company is intrinsically ethical,

responsible and process-driven.

With increasing awareness about

ESG, we are adopting newer ways to

have an integrated business strategy,

that generates long-term value for

our stakeholders. Our programmes

for planet mobilisation, diversity,

equity & inclusion, social impact and

employee well-being, now include

impact measurement so that we can

assess how well we are doing against

these. Inspired by Sanofi’s global

ESG strategy, Sanofi India undertook

a materiality survey to establish a

baseline in our very first Integrated

Annual Report for 2022 last year.

Along with the details of the financial

out-turn, you will find comprehensive

disclosures on various ESG topics in

this report.

As you will recall, in June 2022 your

Company had a change in leadership

with Rodolfo Hrosz taking over the

reins as the new: Managing Director.

Rodolfo brings with him a wealth of

experience spanning commercial,

marketing, and general management

roles across various multinational

companies. He joined Sanofi in 2017

as General Manager of the consumer

healthcare business in Brazil and

led its transformation, starting from

setting up the business unit to helping

it become a significant growth

contributor and a digital acceleration

benchmark within the Sanofi Group.

With his leadership, your Company

has already refreshed its strategy

with a renewed focus on growth and

improving operational efficiencies.

The entire team is motivated to

unleash the potential of your Company

for the next phase of its development.

Your Company will mobilise energies,

increase agility and capitalise on the

emerging opportunities that lie ahead

to improve more lives across the

country, and simultaneously, minimise

the potential environmental impacts of

our activities and products throughout

their life cycle.

Before closing, I would like to record

my gratitude to all our customers,

employees, business partners,

regulatory agencies and all other

stakeholders for their contribution

in our progress during 2022 and

seek their continued support in our

onward journey.

Also, my sincere thanks to each one of

you for your unstinted support in our

progress so far and look forward to

your continued endorsement for all we

do in the times ahead.

Best wishes,

Aditya Narayan

Managing Director’s message

Serving a universe

called ‘India’: Dear Shareholders,

1.4 billion people across India are

bound together in a shared pride of

being part of a young nation that is a

rising superpower.

The country’s rich diversity makes

chasing the miracles of science to

just challenging, but also promising.

In the vastly transformed post-

pandemic world, healthcare is

expected to continue experiencing

significant growth, as health and

wellness become a greater priority for

individuals and governments.

Managing Director, this

Committee helps us keep track of our

performance through periodic reviews.

The Committee also emphasises on

the alignment of focus areas as per

the global context, evolving statutory

frameworks and the local risks.

HSE management system

As part of management systems,

we have implemented Environment

Management Systems

(ISO 14001:2015), Energy

Management Systems (ISO

50001:2018) and Occupational Health

and Safety Management Systems (ISO

45001:2018). Our HSE Management

System is based on the 'Plan – Operate

– Monitor – Improve' structure. This

is equivalent to the management

approach known as Plan-Do-Check-

Act or PDCA cycle. Our HSE policy

is part of engagement to carry out

our activities in conformity with our

values. Policy establishes a dynamic

framework for HSE management on

continual improvement and protection

of environment and our employees

and relevant stakeholders. Our

policy’s main areas include preventing

pollution, protecting natural resources,

and reducing energy usage. Effective

management of resources like raw

material, water, waste management,

and energy conservation are material

to us, and we are working towards

their efficient use. Our commitment

towards fight against climate change

reflects in all our strategic decisions

and actions. Our HSE management

system assesses and manages the

environmental aspects and impacts

on our operations. This system

comprises a management plan as well

as Standard Operating Procedures

(SOPs) defined by Sanofi Global to

identify and mitigate environmental

risks. We periodically review the HSE

management plan and policies to

ensure responsiveness to the changing

environmental and social risks

and demands.

We carry out internal as well as

external audits to monitor our HSE

performance and compliance as

per regulatory requirements. We

also carry out periodical internal

as well as external audits of HSE

management system.

We have developed processes to

ensure that employees are properly

trained on environmental topics

and specific missions. Our parent

Company, Sanofi, has a Health, Safety

and Environment (HSE) training

academy which aims at developing

core expertise and competencies in

relation to applicable regulations,

scientific and technological advances

in the framework of HSE missions.

1,683

Employees who were provided

training on environmental

aspects across Goa and Mumbai

offices in FY 2022

Precautionary approach

We follow a precautionary approach

towards minimising our operational

impact on the environment. We

have applied robust best-in-class

technology for the manufacturing

of medicines and vaccines to limit

our environmental and ecological

footprint. At our Goa site, we have

implemented Health Safety and

Environment (HSE) Management

systems to monitor and address any

concerns that arise or may arise as a

result of our operations.

Climate change

Climate change is undoubtedly one

of the greatest global concerns.

Going beyond healthcare, we

care for the planet by reducing

the environmental impacts of

our products and activities, while

strengthening our resilience in the

face of climate change. This risk

related to climate change poses

severe challenges to business and

the economy. Currently, climate

change is a major element in defining

our environment-related decisions

and prompting us to focus on

promoting cleaner technologies

and innovations.

Sanofi has joined the ‘Race

to Zero’ initiative, a global

commitment to Net Zero carbon

emissions by 2014. We are

working towards three goals set

by Sanofi Global:

− Build the road to carbon

neutrality by 2030 and Net

Zero by 2045

− Limit our environmental

footprint and adopt

circular solutions

− Improve the environmental

profile of our products

The Indian economy is projected to record a relatively

healthy Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of

6.1% (Source: IMF) in FY 2023 and is showing signs

of moderation.

GDP growth is expected to decline to 5.7% in FY 2024, as

exports and domestic demand growth moderate. Inflation

will slow private consumption but moderate along with

improved global conditions, to accelerate growth to 6.9%

in FY 2025. The key drivers for medium-term growth are

increasing public sector expenditure on infrastructure,

supply-side and financial reforms (GST and better tax

compliance, bankruptcy court, bad bank, etc.), India’s

digital architecture that includes the universal payment

systems, nationwide identification framework, distribution

of welfare schemes, healthcare official data stack intended

to solve social, inclusion needs, and logistics and favourable

demographics are expected to set the economy on the path

of recovery.

Retail inflation prints peaked in September 2022 and have

since begun to ease, helped by favourable base effects.

Inflation is expected to remain sticky in the coming months

before gradually rolling off in 2023-24 as growth slows

and input price pressure abates. The USD/C s expected to

consolidate between 80 and 84 over the next two years.

Industry update

The Indian pharmaceutical industry has been growing at

an average of ~10% over the past five years. The industry

growth was severely impacted in 2020 owing to the

COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, however, the growth reached

spiked to 18%, with higher sales in acute care therapies

and COVID-related medicines. In 2022, the industry grew

by 6.5%, adding nearly C 12,000 crores of incremental

sales. The demand for acute therapies increased, while

most chronic therapies like diabetes and cardiovascular

treatments remained relatively steady.

The IQVIA Prognosis Report (2022) projects that the Indian

pharmaceuticals market is expected to grow at a CAGR

~9.2% (+/-2%) between 2021-26 and reach a market size

of C 2,951 billion by 2026. Acute therapies will continue

to drive growth, along with an increase in the incidence of

non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Improvements in the

drug registration process will make India more attractive for

the early launch of innovative drugs. The rapid expansion

of the e-pharmacy sector, expansion of co-marketing

agreements, coupled with the introduction of new OTC

regulations will also be a growth driver till 2026.

~H 3,000 billion

Projected size of Indian Pharmaceutical

Market by 2026

India advantages

Growth in partnerships and co-marketing

agreements: Partnerships and co-marketing agreements

between Indian and foreign companies are expected to

increase, reflecting benefits for both originators and local

partners. Such alliances will drive rapid and broader market

penetration for new brands while increasing sales for more

established products.

Expansion of e-pharmacy and chain businesses:

E-pharmacy sales, which were already rising rapidly, saw

a strong surge in demand during the second wave of the

pandemic, registering more than 25% growth in 2021. The

rapid growth of the sector is encouraging investments

from large businesses, and consolidation of smaller players;

however, it will lead to increased competition and pressure

on drug prices.

Increase in health insurance coverage: The central

government’s Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan

Arogya Yojana (ABPMJAY) health insurance scheme will

drive healthcare access, affordability and improve health

outcomes over the forecast period. The ‘Aap Ke Dwar

Ayushman’ campaign, to facilitate door-to-door beneficiary

mobilisation, identified over 40 million people under

the scheme.

Low cost of production: The presence of various generic

drug companies is a major factor for India to establish a

leadership position in the global pharmaceutical sector.

Furthermore, India provided for ~40% of the generic

demand in the United States and 25% of all medicine in

the United Kingdom. India is the world's largest supplier of

generic medications, accounting for ~20% of the worldwide

supply by volume and supplying about half of the global

vaccination demand. This is based on India Brand Equity

Foundation’s Pharmaceutical Industry Report published in

March, 2022.
