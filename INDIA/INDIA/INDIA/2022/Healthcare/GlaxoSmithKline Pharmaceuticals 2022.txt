Dear Shareholders,

In 2021-22, the Indian economy

continued to face sustained headwinds

due to the pandemic and other external

environment factors. However, the

silver lining is that economic activity

has gradually started to edge towards

normalcy. According to International

Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts, India

is expected to be amongst the fastest

growing economies in 2022 and your

Company continues to remain at the

forefront of serving the healthcare needs

of the country.

While the impact of the pandemic

continued to mean we operate in a

highly dynamic operating environment,

your Company focused on sharpening

commercial execution and cost discipline

for our key brands. Your Company’s

established portfolio made market share

gains, particularly in the anti-infectives

and pain therapeutic areas which have

been crucial in the fight against Covid.

Your Company remains no.1 in the

vaccines self-pay market and maintained

leadership in dermatology. During the

year, Iodex and Ostocalcium brand

trademarks in India were transferred to

GlaxoSmithKline Asia Private Limited for

`1,649 crores and this income formed

part of the profits from discontinued

operations. Accordingly, the Board was

pleased to recommend a dividend of

` 90 per share which included a special

dividend of ` 60 per share.

Your Company launched Trelegy Ellipta,

India’s first single inhaler triple therapy

(SITT) in a once-daily regime for chronic

obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

patients. Your Company is now gearing up

for the launch of the shingles vaccine in

the coming year. This vaccine will provide

an option for patients who are vulnerable

to this painful disease.

Continuing to play a part as a responsible

corporate citizen, your Company launched

a flagship community initiative, ‘GSK

Scholars’. This programme enables

meritorious, but financially disadvantaged

students, to study medicine from

government medical colleges. Under this

scholarship, a sum of up to `1,00,000 will

be granted every year, over a four- and a

half year period, to cover the academic

expenses incurred for the MBBS

programme. Through this programme your

Company aims to make STEM education

more accessible in the country.

Your Company is a place where

outstanding people thrive. Your Company

provides an inclusive work environment

in which it develops talent, rewards great

performance and protects its people. For

the fourth time in a row, your Company

was recognised as one of the 100 Best

Companies for Women in India 2021 by

Working Mother and Avtar, a diversity,

equity and inclusion solutions firm. Your

Company was also voted as one of India’s

Best Workplaces in Health & Wellness

2021 by Great Place to Work Institute.

I remain excited about the future of

your Company as we prepare for a step

change in growth and performance while

embracing new ambitions for patients

and shareholders. On behalf of all Board

members, I would like to extend my

sincere gratitude to employees for their

commitment and shareholders for your

continued trust.

Regards,

R. S. Karnad

GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited | Annual Report 2021-22:

Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to inform you that your

Company has adapted to a challenging

milieu to continue to deliver on its

ambition for patients and value for

shareholders. During the year, your

Company made significant progress

towards improving the health of people

in India. In 2021, that included nearly a

billion doses of medicines and over 4.5

million doses of vaccines (source: IQVIA).

Your Company is poised to deliver a step-

change in growth and positively impact

the health of millions through the General

Medicines, Vaccines and Specialty

portfolios to get #AheadTogether of

disease.

Topline growth was driven by some of

the category-leading General Medicines

brands such as Calpol and Augmentin.

Your Company’s continued leadership in

Dermatology, despite physical distancing,

was propelled by focus brands. Your

Company maintained leadership in the

Vaccines self-pay market and continued

to allow severe asthma patients to

breathe easy with Nucala.

Apart from engaging Healthcare

Professionals (HCPs), your Company

initiated disease awareness campaigns

that featured the likes of MS Dhoni,

former captain of the Indian cricket team,

Kareena Kapoor Khan, leading Indian

actress, and Neha Kakkar, a playback

singer.

The pandemic posed a multitude of

challenges. With patient outcomes

at stake, your Company responded

with agility and determination to rise

to these challenges. Your Company’s

pharmaceutical manufacturing team

worked round the clock to fulfil the rise

in demand for our key brands. This effort

ensured that patients continued to have

access to important medication during the

pandemic.

Your Company’s business strategy

focused on building a resilient product

portfolio, aligned with manufacturing

capabilities and HCP engagement

enhanced by adoption of digitalisation and

emerging technologies. Strengthening

your Company’s vaccine product portfolio

formed a significant part of our approach.

The launch of Fluarix Tetra transformed

the flu vaccine category in the country,

with very high rates of recommendations

by HCPs. Despite not being a first mover

in this vaccine category, your Company

has successfully gained the position of

a market leader.

Your Company has been continuously

bolstering digital capabilities and virtual

brand presence through focused

investments. During the pandemic, your

Company’s field force remained active

on the ground by effectively using digital

channels, to engage remotely with

HCPs. The digital infrastructure ensured

that touch points could be increased

through enhanced use of tele-calling and

webinars coupled with the adoption of

digital platforms such as Veeva Engage

and the HCP Persona Tool.

The resilience and commitment of your

Company, the robustness of the operating

models and the product portfolio driven by

our focus brands is conducive to growth

and unlocking shareholder value.

Your Company strives to maintain an

inclusive workplace, which is supported

by a strong culture of progress and

belonging, with 91% of our employees

responding positively to our annual

culture survey.

As your Company embarks on a journey

of navigating another exciting year of

robust growth, I would like to extend my

heartfelt gratitude to all our investors,

employees and shareholders.

letter dated 20th/24th August,

1998 from the Central Government demanding an amount of

` 4,40.80 comprising ` 1,42.74 in respect of prices relating

to Salbutamol formulations during the period April, 1979 to

December, 1983 with interest thereon amounting to ` 2,98.06

upto 31st July, 1998. The Company had been legally advised

that the demand of ` 1,42.74 is not sustainable and it, therefore

follows that the interest demand also cannot be sustained. The

total demand has been challenged by the Company in a Writ

Petition filed in the Bombay High Court. The Bombay High

Court has granted an interim stay of the demand, subject to the

Company depositing 50% of the principal amount. Accordingly,

the Company has deposited an amount of ` 71.50 with the

Government on 3rd May, 1999. This is a normal interim order

passed by the High court in such matters and does not in

any way reflect upon the merits or otherwise of the case. The

amount will be refunded if the Company succeeds at the final

hearing of the matter. The Government’s application in the

Supreme Court praying that this writ petition be transferred

to the Supreme Court from the Bombay High Court was not

allowed and the Company’s writ petition will now be heard by

Managing Director of the Group has been identified

as CODM and he is responsible for allocating the

resources, assess the financial performance and

position of the Group and makes strategic decisions.

The Group has identified one reportable segment

“Pharmaceuticals” based on the information reviewed

by the CODM. Refer note 52 for segment information

presented.

t)

Provision and contingent liabilities

A provision is recognised if as a result of a past

event, the Group has a present obligation (legal or

constructive) that can be estimated reliably and it is

probable that an outflow of economic benefits will

be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are

recognised at the best estimate of the expenditure

required to settle the present obligation at the balance

sheet date. If the effect of time value of money is

material, provisions are discounted using a current

pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks

specific to the liability. The increase in the provision

due to passage of time is recognised as an interest

expense.

A contingent liability exists when there is a possible

but not probable obligation, or a present obligation

that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of

resources, or a present obligation whose amount

cannot be estimated reliably. Contingent liabilities do

not warrant provisions but are disclosed unless the

possibility of outflow of resources is remote.

u) Discontinued operations and non-current

assets held for sale

Discontinued operation is a component of the

Company that has been disposed of or classified as

held for sale and represents a major line of business.

Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified

as held for sale if their carrying amount is intended to

be recovered principally through a sale (rather than

through continuing use) when the asset (or disposal

group) is available for immediate sale in its present

condition subject only to terms that are usual and

customary for sale of such asset (or disposal group)

and the sale is highly probable and is expected to

qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one

year from the date of classification.

Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as

held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying

amount and fair value less costs to sell.

v) Business Combination

Common control business combination is accounted

using the pooling of interest method where the

Company is transferee. Assets and liabilities of the

combining entities are reflected at their carrying

amounts and no new asset or liability is recognised.

Identity of reserves of the transferor company is

preserved by reflecting them in the same form in

the Company’s financial statements in which they

appeared in the financial statement of the transferor

company. The excess between the amount of

consideration paid over the share capital of the

transferor company is recognised as a negative

amount and the same is disclosed as capital reserve

on business combination.

The financial information in the financial statements in

respect of prior periods is restated from the beginning

of the preceding period in the financial statements

if the business combination date is prior to that

date. However, if business combination date is after

that date, the financial information in the financial

statements is restated from the date of business

combination.

standard or amendments to the existing standards.

There is no such notification which would have been
