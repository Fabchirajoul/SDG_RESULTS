Letter in

March 2019. The Company is engaging with the

agency and is taking help from consultants to resolve

the Import Alert at the earliest and ensure cGMP

compliance.

As of March 31, 2022, the business had 13 commercial

products in the US, 15 in Canada, 29 in Europe, and

32 in RoW. Additionally, we filed a total of 98 ANDA

filings in US, 39 in Europe, 24 in Canada and 42 filings

in other RoW countries so far. Additionally, we have

received 62 ANDA approvals in the US, 33 in Europe,

23 in Canada and 40 in RoW markets.

Revenue during the year stood lower due to the

impact of Import Alert, pricing pressure in the US

market, lower Remdesivir sales in H2’ FY 2022, and

one-time impact of voluntary withdrawal of some

sartan products in Q2’ FY2022. The total revenue

from this business in FY 2022 was H11,569 million as

compared to H14,763 million in FY 2021.

Our aim is to enhance our focus on the key ROW

markets and on India market, wherein we foresee

significant growth opportunities. Currently, we have

obtained approvals in the key markets of Asia and

Africa— including South Africa, Philippines and

Malaysia, and a number of these approved products

are already commercialised. In Latin America, Middle

East, and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)

markets, our growth will be driven by new filings and

new product launches in key markets, including UAE,

Chile and Brazil.

Further, we continue to expand our operations

in Europe, which has been a consistent revenue

contributor for our global business over the year. UK

continues to be a key growth market where we have

established our subsidiary and are strengthening

our team and product portfolio. We have built a

strong base with more than 35 customers in Europe

and we are continuously strengthening our product

portfolio with them. Similarly, we have established our

subsidiary in UAE, which would focus on expanding

operations in Middle East as part of our growth plan.

Our businesses in Canada and Australia are expected

to see significant growth based on new launches and

new partnerships.

In our Generics business, we are witnessing pricing

pressure in some of the product categories in the US

market.

Managing Director (CCMD) and the Corporate

Committee.

To improve the controls in operations, we have

established, for each line of business, the concept

of financial decision-making through operational

committees. The entire purchase, credit control

and capital expenditure decisions are taken jointly

in committees. The key roles of these business

committees are as under:

z Supply Chain Committee, which ensures high-

quality purchases at economical cost and

maintains reliability of supplies from reputed

suppliers with long-term relationships. This

committee includes CEO, CFO, Head of Supply

Chain and the relevant BU (Business Unit)/

Functional Head.

z Capex Committee, which ensures cost reduction

with proper negotiation and monitors time and

cost overrun. This committee includes CEO, CFO,

Head of Project, Head of Supply Chain and the

relevant BU Head/ Functional Head.

z Credit Committee, which evaluates the credit risk

and approves the maximum credit, which can be

provided to a customer. This committee approves

the credit limits at the beginning of the year and

is empowered to make changes as and when

required. This committee includes CFO and the BU

Head.

z Business Performance Committee, which reviews

the business performance on a monthly basis. This

committee includes CEO, CFO, Functional Heads

and the relevant BU Head.

In addition, to maintain periodic review and control,

we have a structured weekly meetings between the

corporate team and the business leadership team.

Through this meeting, the corporate team keeps

itself abreast of the latest business developments and

guides the business team to undertake mid-course

corrections, if required. This meeting also provides a

forum for obtaining the relevant approvals required

from the corporate team as per Delegation of

Authority. Participants at this meeting are Chairman/

CCMD from the Corporate side, CEOs and CFOs from

the business side.

Further, a detailed quarterly review of the business

performance with the Chairman/CCMD and the

corporate committee is organised to identify any

gaps in performance and to consider mid-course

corrections.

well-being amongst employees. We launched #JubilantCares - an

(CCMD) of the Group are responsible for allocating resources

and assessing performance of the operating segments, and

accordingly, identified as the chief operating decision maker.

Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, which are common

to the enterprise as a whole and are not allocable to segments

on a reasonable basis, have been treated as “unallocated

revenues/ expenses/ assets/ liabilities”, as the case may be.

(v) Foreign currency translation

(i)

Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the

Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary

economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the

functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements

are presented in Indian rupee (H), which is also the Parent

Company’s functional currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional

currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the

transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from

the settlement of such transactions and from the translation

of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign

currencies at balance sheet date exchange rates are generally

recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign

currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date

when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on

assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of

the fair value gain or loss. For example, translation differences

on non-monetary assets such as equity investments classified

as FVOCI are recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI).

(iii) Group companies

The results and financial position of foreign operations (none

of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy)

that have a functional currency different from the presentation

currency are translated into the presentation currency as

follows:

•

Equity share capital and opening other equity are carried

at historical cost.:

Managing Director of the Parent Company have been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker

(CODM) as defined by Ind AS 108 “Operating Segments”. Operating Segments have been defined and presented based on the regular review

by the CODM to assess the performance of each segment and to make decision about allocation of resources. Accordingly, the Group has

determined reportable segments by the nature of its products and services, which are as follows:

a.

Pharmaceuticals: (i) Specialty Pharmaceuticals comprising Radiopharmaceuticals (including radiopharmacies) and Allergy Therapy

products; (ii) Contract Development and Manufacturing Operations (CDMO) comprising Contract manufacturing of Sterile Injectables

and Non-Sterile products (CMO) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs); and (iii) Generics comprising Solid Dosage Formulations;

iv) India Branded Pharmaceuticals;

b.

Life Sciences Ingredients#: i) Specialty Intermediates ii) Life Sciences Chemicals and iii) Nutritional Products;

c.

Contract Research and Development Services: Drug discovery and development services as well as clinical data software and

service solutions; and

d.

Proprietary Novel Drugs: Patient-focused biopharmaceutical business working to address unmet medical needs in oncology and

autoimmune diseases.

The Group prepares its segment information in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the

consolidated financial statements of the Group as a whole.

No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.

Common allocable costs are allocated to each segment according to the relative contribution of each segment to the total common costs.

Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities which relate to the Group as a whole and not allocable to segments on reasonable basis have been

included under ‘unallocated revenue / expenses / assets / liabilities’.

Finance costs and fair value gains and losses on certain financial assets are not allocated to individual segments as the underlying instruments

are managed on a Group basis.

Borrowings, current taxes, deferred taxes and certain financial assets and liabilities are not allocated to the segments and have been included

under ‘unallocated assets / liabilities’.

Information related to each reportable segment is set out below. Segment results (profit/(loss) before interest and tax) is used to measure

performance because management believes that this information is most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective segments

relative to other entities that operate in the same industries.
