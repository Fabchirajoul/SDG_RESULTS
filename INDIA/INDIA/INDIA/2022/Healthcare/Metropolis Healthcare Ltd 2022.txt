dear Stakeholders,

The world has been volatile in 2021-22. Looking back at

the past two years, we all have witnessed tumultuous

times due to the Covid-19 pandemic. After the three waves

of the pandemic, the Indian economy is finally reviving

with a positive trend in all macro indicators. This shows

that the country is on the path of growth. Further, large-

scale vaccination drives and rising economic activity have

collectively boosted public morale. The Indian Government

has also contributed to the country’s growth story through

various policies and budgetary allocations.

We are becoming a self-

reliant world-class pathology

services provider driven by

robust R&D, technological

capabilities, and industry

experience.

The diagnostic companies have rapidly expanded to

respond and maintain pace with the increasing demand

for testing volumes. Additionally, an increased emphasis,

seriousness and awareness of personal health are equally

responsible for providing diagnostics industry with an

opportunity to expand and facilitate the best solutions in

the non-Covid-19 testing segments.

When it comes to Covid-19 and identifying the variants

of concern, the technology used for sequencing matters

the most. Several labs across the country have upgraded

to cater to this growing need and serve the nation at this

crucial time. Another big shift has been the fact that these

services have been brought to homes, thereby reducing

infection chances further. The turnaround time has also

been brought down to bare minimum and special testing

packages have also helped ensure familial health without

burning a hole in people’s pockets. On the other hand, non-

Covid-19 testing volumes have seen a surge, where regular

check-ups have gained popularity – assuring to help the

nation, one individual at a time.

The Indian diagnostic industry has been rapidly evolving

over the years and has emerged to be the key component

of the healthcare segment. As a scientific-driven healthcare

we are enhancing diagnostic

value with innovative testing

to bring greater trust and

confidence to healthcare. And

by co-creating new values with

our stakeholders, we strive to

contribute to the development

of healthcare and the healthy

lives of people.

Metropolis Healthcare Ltd

dear Shareholders,

Since the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) broke

out in 2020, mutant strains have continued to emerge,

and it is unclear when the pandemic will abate. Covid-19

tested us yet again in 2021, and we once again rose to

the challenge. We met the pandemic head-on with our

evolved strategies. Amid this ongoing crisis, many people

are doing their utmost to protect and maintain the essential

health services and systems. I offer my heartfelt thanks to

everyone working on the front lines of this pandemic.

The Indian Diagnostics sector has been one of the

fastest-growing service segments in the Indian

healthcare space. With India witnessing three waves of

the Covid-19 pandemic and the fact that people with

existing comorbidities were at a higher risk of dying from

the pandemic, there was a phenomenal rise in demand

for diagnostic testing. Emerging self-care trends have

been driving a large number of people to go for preventive

checks on a periodical basis. This phenomenon is likely to

continue over a longer period of time as people become

more cautious and increasingly receptive to the need to

have regular health examinations. With this change in

consumer behaviour, the ease of getting diagnostic tests

done from home has also improved significantly with

trained technicians coming for home sample collections,

with better coverage and turnaround time.

The rigors of the pandemic environment have helped

highlight all the strengths that make us such an enduringly

successful company. The continual shifts and disruptions

to normal business patterns — supply chain functioning,

fluctuating demand, workplace operations — require

companies to be resourceful and adaptable, with the ability

to anticipate, improvise, and draw on deep reserves of

experience, relationships, and know-how. Our over four

-decade-long heritage and experience with the right blend

of values have underpinned our efforts in tackling these

issues.
