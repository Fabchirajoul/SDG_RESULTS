DEAR SHAREHOLDERS

1: Dear Shareholders,

The past couple of years have been one of the most challenging and uncertain times experienced across the globe due to the

Covid 19 pandemic. As we continue to emerge out of this phase, we hope all of you and your loved ones continue to be safe and

well.

Thanks to the vaccination of over a billion people, the impact of the pandemic (except in China) was mitigated. Our own country

has done quite well to contain the Covid-19 virus thanks to the sensible approach of our people, resulting in more than 1,800

million vaccinations. Kudos to the sheer determination of our Central and State Governments, and to the efforts of our doctors and

health workers. While this should not result in complacency in following health safety protocols, thankfully day-to-day life is moving

towards normalcy.

Further real estate and housing segment continues to witness strong demand and is well supported by tailwinds from the

fundamental demand drivers. Structural recovery in housing demand should continue with a sustained demand momentum led

by increasing urbanisation, improving affordability, positive consumer sentiments and growing aspirational needs. Consolidation

amongst larger and credible brands continues to be a key trend in the real estate and housing segment, primarily driven by

increasing consumer confidence towards such brands, significantly improved balance sheets and strong ability to provide high

quality, safe and sustainable ecosystems.

During FY 2021-22, as you are aware, the Company issued Convertible Warrants to the Promoter and Investors (Non Promoters)

to raise capital to the tune of approx. Rs. 1,544 crores upon full conversion of the warrants into equity shares. The main objective

of the capital raising by the Company was to strengthen its financial position and to meet working capital requirements. The capital

raising exercise now places your company amongst the top 10 capitalized Real Estate companies in India and with a very minimal

debt of equity ratio. The management intends to make the Company debt free on standalone basis going forward. The Company

is pleased to announce that during the year construction activity was resumed on the project X BKC with Adani GoodHomes Pvt.

Ltd. being appointed to manage and supervise the construction and implementation of the project. The construction activity on the

projects viz., Prestige Liberty Tower, BKC 101 was commenced during the current year. The Group made a payment of more than

Rs.850 crores towards various premiums to statutory authorities for securing the entire FSI for projects where the construction

work has commenced during the year. In addition to this, during the fiscal 2021-22, the Hon’ble Supreme Court allowed appeal of

one of the subsidiaries of the Company and pursuant to the above decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, freehold vacant land

admeasuring approx 22,000 sq. mts, situated in village Sahar, adjoining ITC Grand Maratha Hotel, Andheri (East), Mumbai is now

available for development by the said wholly owned subsidiary company. Also, one of the partnership firm, where the Company

is a 1/3rd partner, was awarded Letter of Acceptance from Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) for construction of

4000 homes which is a significant event as this line of business is expected to add substantially to the Company’s future earnings.

We thank customers, shareholders, employees and all stakeholders including new investors who have subscribed to the Convertible

Warrants for their continued trust and support and being an unshakable pillar of strength in our pursuit of relentless commitment

to our core values.

We wish that all of you stay safe and well !
