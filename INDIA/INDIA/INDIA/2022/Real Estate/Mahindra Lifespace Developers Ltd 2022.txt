Mr. Arvind Subramanian: Managing

Dear Stakeholders

The home has taken renewed

importance in recent times, as the

aftermath of COVID-19 established

the importance of a familiar and safe

space. While the purchase of a new

home is often perceived as the delivery

of a physical structure, in reality it is

the starting point of a new life journey.

Similarly, new factories and offices are

markers of a change in the trajectory of

the business. At Mahindra Lifespaces,

we have always viewed our purpose,

strategy, and culture as instruments

to create sustainable value through

crafting spaces that seek to constantly

satisfy evolving customer preferences.

This year, our first Integrated Report

brings to the fore our shared values

and furthers our new brand promise,

‘Crafting Life’.

Today, we have a built portfolio of over

30 million sq. ft. of completed, ongoing

and forthcoming residential projects

across six Indian cities; and over

Sustainability is embedded

into our projects right from

land acquisition through

design, planning, construction,

and operations.

MD & CEO: Dear Stakeholders

I am pleased to present to you our

first Integrated Report highlighting

the key milestones and significant

developments over the past financial

year. This Integrated Report

showcases business practices that we

are confident will result in continued

healthy business and operational

performance and significant beneficial

social and environmental impact.

Shrugging of the impact of a severe

second wave of COVID at the start

of the year, FY 2021-22 has been a

year of strong growth at Mahindra

Lifespaces across our residential

and industrial businesses. Taking

inspiration from our vision and values,

we embarked on a journey to introduce

a new brand promise – “Crafting Life”.

Taking a long-term view on design and

development, we remain committed

to crafting sustainable, resilient, and

vibrant spaces, that deliver positive

outcomes over a long term. The

integrated reporting process was

initiated within Mahindra Lifespaces in

FY 2020. It helps investors understand

the performance of the Company

across the six capitals and materiality

of ESG issues, providing a fuller picture

of the way in which we create value.

Adopting integrated thinking is helping

us prepare better for the future.

We will continue to drive

innovation in and shape India’s

built environment.

Annual Integrated Report 2021-22

Managing Director & CEO

Year in brief

Despite the ever-present shadow of the

pandemic, India’s real estate sector

witnessed marked improvement in

consumer sentiment and business

confidence as the year progressed.

Historically low interest rates combined

with enhanced household savings

bolstered affordability in the residential

segment. Some states provided

support to the sector in the form of

development cost and duty waivers.

These demand and supply side

actions, taken together, provided

a much-needed fillip to pre-sale of

apartments in all major cities. With

the shifting geo-political tides and

redesign of global supply chains,

manufacturing investment in India also

witnessed an upswing.

Timely investments in talent, process

and technology of the past few years

helped Mahindra Lifespaces deliver

superior performance on all operational

and financial parameters over the year

gone by. We are proud to have taken

important strides, clocking record

pre-sales and leasing in the Residential

and Industrial Parks businesses

respectively. This accomplishment has

been underpinned by differentiated

products, high-quality infrastructure,

disciplined sales and an improved

customer experience.

Strategic thrust

We are committed to accelerating

growth in our residential business.

Our strategy in this business is

built on four key pillars – design

differentiation, a technology-enabled

scalable sales model, rapid and

high-quality construction and optimal

cost, and orchestrating an enhanced

living experience. We will continue to

serve the affordable and mid-market

segments, as we seek to deepen

our footprint in the chosen cities of

Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru. In our

IC & IC business, our strategy will

be to offer multiple destinations to

prospective customers with plug-and-

play infrastructure and ease-of-doing-

business. We believe our born-green

industrial parks should be the pre-

eminent choice for forward-thinking

multinational and domestic companies

seeking to expand their manufacturing

presence in the country.

Net Zero plan

Sustainability is a core part of

our product differentiation and is

woven into projects right from their

conception. Being India’s first real

estate company to have approved

Science-Based Targets (SBTi), we aim

to become carbon neutral as a part

of our commitment to the Mahindra

Group’s 2040 Carbon Neutrality

Goals. As part of this commitment, we

have taken a pledge to develop only

Net Zero (energy, waste, and water)

buildings by 2030, a full 20 years

ahead of the Paris agreement.

Moving forward

Our residential land acquisitions

over this past year, with a combined

development potential of 3.08 million

sq. ft. and an estimated Gross

Development Value of around ` 3,800

crore sets us up well for growth over

the coming years. We are building the

organizational muscle for significant

growth in the residential business

and gearing up for multiple launches

across our priority markets. Similarly,

our leasing pipeline for the industrial

segment also continues to be strong.

With both business engines poised

to fire over the coming years, we are
