Economic Overview

India is set to remain the fastest growing economy in

the world as per the World Economic Outlook by the

International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Indian economy,

braving the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing

geopolitical tensions that led to global inflation, posted

8.7% GDP growth in FY22 as against a GDP contraction of

6.6% witnessed in FY21. The GDP growth for Q1 FY22 was

20.3%, for Q2 FY22 was 8.5%, for Q3 FY22 was 5.4% and

for Q4 FY22 was 4.1%.

Though FY22 started with the economy grappling with

the after-effects of a second COVID-19 wave, strong

government policies of the past two years coupled with

a successful nationwide vaccination programme helped

to keep the economy afloat. India remained the fastest

growing economy in the world despite COVID-related

disruptions. Demand saw a quick revival post opening up

of the economy. However, the last quarter witnessed the

impact of the third wave caused by the Omicron variant

and geopolitical conflicts between Russia and Ukraine.

Rising international commodity prices is the biggest risk

emanating from the conflict, as Russia and Ukraine are

global suppliers of key commodities.

In FY23, recovery in India’s domestic macros was resilient

to risks arising from global developments for a significant

time before supply-side challenges and inflation spikes

globally, started dampening consumption and investments

in the economy led by growing domestic inflation. The

unprecedented high global commodity and energy prices

due to the ongoing geopolitical situation led to a spike in

retail inflation, hitting an eight-year high of 7.8% in April

2022, which poses risk to near-term economic growth. In

response, the Monetary Policy Committee raised the repo

rate by 40 basis points, the first-rate hike after August

2018, to tame the rising inflation.

Despite near-term challenges, in FY23, as per IMF,

the economic growth rate is expected at 8.2%, almost

two times faster than China’s 4.4%. Lower base effect,

successful vaccination drive and offtake of government

programmes spurring investments and activity are

considered to fuel the growth. Strong fiscal, monetary and

budgetary interventions are expected to keep India on

track to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025.

2. Industry Overview

The Indian real estate sector is one of the most globally

recognised sectors comprising four subsectors – housing/

residential, retail, hospitality and commercial. The growth

in the corporate environment and the demand for office

space as well as urban and semi-urban accommodations

have a strong influence on the growth of the sector.

In India, the real estate sector is the second-highest

employment generator, after the agriculture sector. It is

also expected that this sector will incur more non-resident

Indian investment, both in the short term and long term.

Bengaluru is expected to be the most favoured property

investment destination for NRIs, followed by Ahmedabad,

Pune, Chennai, Goa, Delhi and Dehradun.

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the real

estate market. The residential sector was the worst hit

as strict lockdown measures across major cities in India

impacted housing sales since home registrations were

suspended and home loan disbursement was slow.

However, the sector is in a recovering phase due to an

increase in house sales, new project launches, and

increasing demand for new office and commercial spaces.

The growth is supported by increasing industrial activities,

rapid urbanisation, improved income levels and strong

policy support by the government with policies such as

the Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA) and the Benami

Transactions Act. The government is also providing a boost

to affordable housing construction, interest subsidy for

home buyers, service tax exemption, Dividend Distribution

Tax (DDT) exemption, PR for foreign investors, etc.

Since the onset of the pandemic, the real estate sector

navigated the turbulence with herculean efforts supported

by government intervention. The residential real estate

market recovered quickly once the restrictions were

lifted. The residential market’s Q2 FY22 performance

was significantly better than that in Q1 FY22. There was

a surge in demand, especially for branded homes. At

the same time, improving vaccination rates and strong

hiring in Information Technology and other sunrise

sectors supported consumer sentiments and financial

preparedness. As a result, the resurgence in housing sales

became a widespread phenomenon across cities and

product segments. The big players also reconfigured their

supply pipeline to deliver projects in the affordable, mid-

segment and premium segments to tap the opportunities

arising from the low-interest rate regime and homebuyers’

desire to avoid construction-related risks. India’s residential

sector saw a significant rise in pre-sales in FY22, with

developers looking at more project launches and land

acquisitions. With the recovery in volumes, developers

took calibrated price increases to contain inflation. Price

increases mostly started in Q3 FY22 and then accelerated

in Q4 FY22 led by escalating construction costs further

exacerbated by geopolitical tensions.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

36:

Managing Director’s evaluation was based

on the key aspects of his role, leadership qualities, commitment,

strategic and financial planning, communication, engagement

with the Board, compliance etc. The performance evaluation

of the Independent Directors was carried out by the entire

Board. The performance evaluation of the Chairman, the Board

as whole and the Non-Independent Directors was carried out

by the Independent Directors at their separate meeting held

during the year.

The Independent Directors have expressed satisfaction at

the robustness of the evaluation process through online, the

Board’s freedom to express its views on matters transacted at

the Meetings and the openness and transparency with which

the Management discusses various subject matters specified

on the agenda of meetings.

The consolidated Board evaluation report was provided to the

Chairman of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee

o

6,78,541 equity shares under Employee Stock Option

Scheme, 2017.

Company has increased from 21,09,13,636 equity shares of

`10/- each to 23,02,62,643 equity shares of `10/- due to the

aforesaid allotment of equity shares during the financial year.

During the year under review, the Company has not issued

OPERATIONAL REVIEW:

Your Company is a leading real estate developer in South India,

based in Bengaluru. With a vast experience of around four

decades in building landmark structures across residential,

commercial and hospitality sectors, the Company has garnered

exceptional customer trust and brand equity in the real estate

space. The operations of the Company can be classified into

two main segments:

a)

Income from construction and development of Real Estate

Projects

b)

Lease Rental Income from Office and Retail Assets

PROPOSED PROJECTS:

The group proposes to launch 10.37 mn. sq. ft. in the financial

year 2022-23. This will comprise of 8.34 mn. sq. ft. of residential

space and 2.03 mn. sq. ft. of commercial space.

COMPLETED PROJECTS:

The outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic globally and in India has

caused significant disturbance and slowdown of economic

restrictions imposed on travel etc.

While severity of the disease due to COVID-19 has reduced

because of increased vaccination, as immunity may wane over

a period of time, there is a risk of further waves and emergence

of highly transmissible and more virulent variants.

Your Company has estimated the future cash flows for the

COVID-19 pandemic and does not foresee any adverse impact

on its ability to continue as going concern and in meeting its

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference

to the standalone financial statements of Brigade Enterprises

Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2022 in conjunction

with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the

Company for the year ended on that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial

Controls

The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing

and maintaining internal financial controls based on the

internal control over financial reporting criteria established

by the Company considering the essential components of

internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of

Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued

by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the

“Guidance note”). These responsibilities include the design,

implementation and maintenance of adequate internal

financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring

the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including

adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its

assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the

accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the

timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required

under the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”).

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s

internal financial controls with reference to these standalone

financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our

audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards

on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to

the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls,

both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we

comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the

audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate

internal financial controls with reference to these standalone

financial statements was established and maintained and if

such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit

evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls

with reference to these standalone financial statements and

their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial

controls with reference to these standalone financial

statements included obtaining an understanding of internal

financial controls with reference to these standalone financial

statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness

exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating

effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement,

including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement

of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud

or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is

sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit

opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with

reference to these standalone financial statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference

to Standalone Financial Statements

A company’s internal financial controls with reference to

these standalone financial statements is a process designed

to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of

financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial

statements for external purposes in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial

control with reference to these standalone financial statements

includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the

maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately

and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the

assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation

of standalone financial statements in accordance with

generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts

and expenditures of the company are being made only in

accordance with authorisations of management and directors of

the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding

prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition,

use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a

material effect on the standalone financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With

Reference to Standalone Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls

with reference to standalone financial statements, including

the possibility of collusion or improper management override

of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may

occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation

of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone

financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk

that the internal financial control with reference to standalone

financial statements may become inadequate because of

changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with

the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects,

adequate internal financial controls with reference to these

standalone financial statements and such internal financial

controls with reference to these standalone financial statements

were operating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on the

internal control over financial reporting criteria established by

the Company considering the essential components of internal

control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the Institute of

Chartered Accountants of India .

provided the order giving effect in this regard.

c. Other Litigations:

(i) The Company has paid land advances of ` 3,860 lakhs that are under litigation. The underlying loans and advances

are considered as good and recoverable based on legal evaluation by management of ultimate outcome of

legal proceedings.

(ii) Apart from the above, the Company is also subject to certain legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in

the ordinary course of business, including certain litigation for commercial development or land parcels held for

construction purposes, either through joint development arrangements or through outright purchases. These cases

are pending with various courts and are scheduled for hearings. After considering the circumstances and legal

evaluation thereon, the management believes that these cases will not have an adverse effect on the standalone

financial statements.

Note: The Company does not expect any reimbursement in respect of the above contingent liabilities and it is not

practicable to estimate the timing of the cash outflows, if any, in respect of aforesaid matters and it is not probable that an

2017-18 and has settled the same. Subsequent to the year end, the Income tax authorities have acknowledged the

payment and provided the order giving effect in this regard.

c. Other Litigations:

(i) The Group has paid land advances of ` 3,860 lakhs that are under litigation. The underlying loans and advances

are considered as good and recoverable based on legal evaluation by management of ultimate outcome of the

legal proceedings.

(ii) The Group has received a legal notice from a vendor demanding payment of compensation of `1,214 lakhs for

procuring maximum permissible Floor Space Index for development of land parcels procured from such vendor. The

Group does not expect any payment in respect of the aforesaid obligation/ claim and it is not probable that an outflow

of resources will be required to settle the same and hence, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial

statements in this regard.

(iii) Brigade Hotel Ventures Limited ('BHVL'), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company has been discharging

property tax in respect of its hotel properties. In this regard, BHVL has received a demand notice from the municipal

authority assessing the property tax for certain hotel property for the period FY 2011-12 to FY 2021-22 resulting in

demand of Rs.9,222 lakhs (including interest and penalty) and BHVL has paid Rs.1,956 lakhs under protest. BHVL has

filed a writ petition before the High Court of Karnataka, which is pending hearing. Based on legal evaluation, BHVL is

reasonably confident of a favorable outcome in respect of the aforesaid matter and no further provision is considered

necessary by the management.

(iv) The Group has filed an arbitration case against one of the vendors of the Group for non performance under its

commercial agreement with the vendor and has encashed the performance guarantee issued by the vendor. In

response to the above, the vendor has filed a counter claim against the Group demanding the refund of forfeited

guarantee and additional amount on account of the loss faced by the vendor due to termination of the contract. The

Group is reasonably confident of a favourable outcome in respect of the aforesaid matter based on the management’s

evaluation and the legal opinion obtained by the management. Accordingly, no provision is made in this regard in the

consolidated financial statements.

(v) Apart from the above, the Group is also subject to certain legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in

the ordinary course of business, including certain litigation for commercial development or land parcels held for

construction purposes, either through joint development arrangements or through outright purchases. These cases

are pending with various courts and are scheduled for hearings. After considering the circumstances and legal

evaluation thereon, the management believes that these cases will not have an adverse effect on the consolidated

financial statements.

Note: The Group does not expect any reimbursement in respect of the above contingent liabilities and it is not

practicable to estimate the timing of the cash outflows, if any, in respect of aforesaid matters and it is not probable

that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the above obligations/claims.

Message from the Chairman: Dear Stakeholders,

I am delighted to share our Sustainability Report for the financial year 2021-22 on the topics material to

our organization and sector. The Sustainability Report is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

Standards and stepping up we have also included sector-specific disclosures relating real estate sector.

The report also covers the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) requirements of the

Securities and Exchange Board of India which is voluntary for the financial year 2021-22.

02

The financial year 2021-22 was operationally a good year as compared to the previous year which was impacted

due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are excited to share that we have a strong pipeline of ongoing projects

equivalent to 17.4 Mn sq ft. All the business segments performed well. The residential business segment

performance was remarkable, achieving the highest ever pre-sales of 4.72 Mn sq. ft with a sale value of INR

30,227 Mn in FY22, an increase of 2 % from FY21. The Leasing and Hospitality business segments performed

better as compared to the previous financial year.

Brigade Group posted a revenue of Rs. 3,066 crores for FY 22 as against Rs. 2,010 crores in the previous year,

an increase of 52%. The Earnings before Depreciation, Interest, Tax and Amortization (EBITDA) of Rs. 833

crores in FY22 as against Rs. 532 crores in the previous year, an increase of 56%. The profit after Tax and

Minority Interest of Rs. 83 cores as against Rs. 46 crores loss in the previous year.

This economic recovery is incomplete without assuring our stakeholders about our commitment to safe-

guarding the environment, having best practices for employees and workers, and making a positive contribution

to our local communities. Through the Brigade Foundation, we continue to serve society in the areas of health

& education, and the groundwork for skill development has begun. Our team delivered remarkably, continuing

to bag the ‘Great Place to Work for the 12th consecutive year. Our board diversity remains among the highest

in the industry and we continue to find new ways to engage our employees. Our excellent safety performance

continued in the financial year and implementing ISO 45001 has helped keep safety as one of the top agendas.

Climate Protection and Water Conservation are the need of the hour.

Brigade started its reliance on renewables early on and we are continuing to enhance renewable power sourcing

for all verticals. Similarly, several projects this year are helping drive the importance of water conservation for

our team and our customers.

Looking forward, I see FY23 as a year that will have fresh starts and much of the dust will settle in the markets

that will enable us to take up new projects and continue to excel in the operational and financial performance

in all our business segments. During this year, we would be able to understand our stakeholder concerns a bit

more deeply and focus on specific areas that can help us look into the future. The focus on ESG is advancing

and efforts are made to move towards a more inclusive and resilient organization by leaping into the future

with sustainable initiatives.

I take this opportunity to thank all our stakeholders for their continued overwhelming support and for being a

part of our growth journey.
