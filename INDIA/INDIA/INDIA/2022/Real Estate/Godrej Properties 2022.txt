NOTE 1

I. COMPANY OVERVIEW

Godrej Properties Limited (“the Company”) having CIN:

L74120MH1985PLC035308 is engaged primarily in the

business of real estate construction, development and

other related activities. The Company is a public limited

company incorporated and domiciled in India having its

registered office at Godrej One, 5th Floor, Pirojshahnagar,

Eastern Express Highway, Vikhroli, Mumbai - 400079. The

Company’s equity shares are listed on The Bombay Stock

Exchange Limited (BSE) and The National Stock Exchange

of India Limited (NSE).

II. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND MEASUREMENT

a. Statement of compliance

The Standalone Financial Statements of the Company

have been prepared in accordance with the Indian

Accounting Standards (IND AS) as per the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 notified under

the Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) and

the relevant provisions and amendments, as applicable.

The Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for

the year ended March 31, 2022 were authorised for issue

by the Board of Directors on May 03, 2022.

b. Functional and presentation currency

These Standalone Financial Statements are presented

in Indian rupees, which is also the functional currency of

the Company. All financial information presented in Indian

rupees has been rounded to the nearest crore, unless

otherwise stated.

c. Basis of measurement

These financial statements have been prepared on

historical cost basis except certain financial instruments,

defined benefit plans and share based payments measured

at fair value.

d. Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the Standalone Financial Statements

in conformity with IND AS requires the use of estimates,

judgements and assumptions considered in the reported

amounts of assets and liabilities (including contingent

liabilities) and the reported income and expenses during

the year. Management believes that the estimates

made in the preparation of the financial statements are

prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ from

those estimates. Any revision to accounting estimates is

recognised prospectively in current and future periods.

Information

about

critical

judgments

in

applying

accounting policies, as well as estimates and assumptions

that have the most significant effect to the carrying

amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial

year, are as follows:

•

Evaluation of satisfaction of performance obligation for

the purpose of revenue recognition

Determination of revenue under the satisfaction of

performance obligation necessarily involves making

estimates, some of which are of a technical nature,

concerning, where relevant, the timing of satisfaction of

performance obligation, costs to completion, the expected

revenues from the project or activity and the foreseeable

losses to completion. Estimates of project income, as well

as project costs, are reviewed periodically. The Company

recognises revenue when the Company satisfies its

performance obligation.

•

Evaluation of net realisable value of inventories

Inventories comprising of finished goods and construction-

work-in progress are valued at lower of cost and net

realisable value. Net Realisable value is based upon the

estimates of the management. The effect of changes,

if any, to the estimates is recognised in the Standalone

Financial Statements for the period in which such changes

are determined.

•

Useful life and residual value of property, plant and

equipment and intangible assets

Useful lives of tangible and intangible assets are based on

the life prescribed in Schedule II of the Act. In cases, where

the useful lives are different based from that prescribed in

Schedule II of the Act, they are based on internal technical

evaluation. Assumptions are also made, when the Company

assesses, whether an asset may be capitalised and which

components of the cost of the asset may be capitalised.

The estimation of residual value of assets is based on

management’s judgment about the condition of such

asset at the point of sale of asset.

•

Recognition and measurement of defined benefit

obligations

The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is

determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key

actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in

salary escalation and attrition rate. The discount rate is

determined by reference to market yields at the end of

the reporting period on government securities. The period

to maturity of the underlying securities correspond to

the probable maturity of the post-employment benefit

obligations.

completed during the month of February 2021. Based upon receipt of Possession Receipts of Land handed over

Evaluation of satisfaction of performance obligation for

the purpose of revenue recognition

Determination of revenue under the satisfaction of

performance obligation necessarily involves making

estimates, some of which are of a technical nature,

concerning, where relevant, the timing of satisfaction of

performance obligation, costs to completion, the expected

revenues from the project or activity and the foreseeable

losses to completion. Estimates of project income, as

well as project costs, are reviewed periodically. The effect

of changes, if any, to estimates is recognised in the

consolidated financial statements for the period in which

such changes are determined.

•

Evaluation of control

The Group makes assumptions, when assessing whether

it exercises control, joint control or significant influence

over entities in which it holds less than 100 percent of

the voting rights. These assumptions are made based

on the contractual rights with the other shareholders,

relevant facts and circumstances which indicate that the

Group has power over the potential subsidiary or that joint

control exists. Changes to contractual arrangements or

facts and circumstances are monitored and are evaluated

to determine whether they have a potential impact on the

assessment as to whether the Group is exercising control

over its investment.

•

Evaluation of net realisable value of Iinventories

Inventories comprising of finished goods and construction-

work-in progress are valued at lower of cost and net

realisable value. Net Realisable value is based upon the

estimates of the management. The effect of changes, if

any, to the estimates is recognised in the consolidated

financial statements for the period in which such changes

are determined.

•

Useful life and residual value of property, plant and

equipment and intangible assets

Useful lives of tangible and intangible assets are based

on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the act. In cases,

where the useful lives are different from that prescribed

in Schedule II, they are based on internal technical

evaluation. Assumptions are also made, when the Group

assesses, whether an asset may be capitalised and which

components of the cost of the asset may be capitalised.
