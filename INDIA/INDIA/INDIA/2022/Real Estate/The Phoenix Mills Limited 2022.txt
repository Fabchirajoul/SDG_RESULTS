Dear Shareholders,

In a world of continual transformation, only those

equipped with resilience have the ability to transform

a challenge into an opportunity. An uncertain

macro-environment for the second year in a row

notwithstanding, we stayed on the growth track with

a commitment to maintaining our position as India’s

largest retail-led, mixed-use asset developer and

operator. Our resilient financial performance also

kept us motivated to move ahead with determination

and continue to deliver excellent outcomes. We are

leveraging the robustness of our business model

and staying true to our values and ideals to shape a

better tomorrow.

Key developments of the year

With the virulence of the COVID-19 virus fading,

consumer spending picking up and retail as well as

leisure facilities reopening, monthly consumption

at all our malls moved back to pre-COVID-19 levels

by the end of FY22. As we enter Q2 of FY23, the

trajectory remains strong and resilient. With a

strategy to ‘build back better’, we responded with

newer ways of working and impressive displays

of innovation to capitalise on the opportunities

presented to us.

During the year under review, we achieved a gross

retail leasing of over 4 msft across our existing and

upcoming malls; and clocked residential sales of

~H 3,500 million. Our office portfolio also showed

remarkable resilience, as we ended the financial year

with a commercial income of ~H 1,580 million. The

hospitality portfolio, which was highly impacted by

the pandemic, witnessed a remarkable comeback

during the year with consistently high occupancy

levels and improved ARRs across our properties.

In a significant development, we raised ~H 34,330

million of equity in an environment of fluctuating

investor confidence. We strengthened our

association with our existing partner, Canada

Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments),

by partnering with them on two new projects during

the year. Our first partnership was for a Greenfield

retail mall development in Kolkata, while the

second was for a Greenfield, office-led, mixed-use

development project at our flagship asset Phoenix

Palladium in Mumbai. Additionally, PML and CPP

Investments also committed to contribute additional

equity to the existing retail platform Island Star Mall

Developers Pvt. Ltd (ISML) during the year.

Further in June 2021, we announced the formation of

a retail-led, mixed-use platform with GIC, Singapore’s

sovereign wealth fund. PML contributed two of its

100% owned operating malls (Phoenix MarketCity

Pune & Phoenix MarketCity Mumbai) and existing

commercial offices (Art Guild House, Centrium

and Phoenix Paragon Plaza) in Phoenix MarketCity

Mumbai to the platform as its equity contribution and

GIC has invested H 15,110 million in a combination of

Primary & Secondary between June 2021 to June

2022 to acquire a 33% stake in this platform. This

transaction has created liquidity at the PML level

as well as the platform level. Our partnership with

CPP Investments and GIC is a strong testament to

investor confidence in our Company.

The year was also important as we remained

balanced and prudent in our use of leverage. During

the year, we focused on optimising the cost of

debt across our assets, which helped us lower our

borrowing costs by 87 basis points during the year to

an average cost of ~7.30% per annum. Our gross debt

levels have remained steady despite an intensive

ongoing capex due to our strategy of funding the

capex largely through equity. Our gross debt is

down from H 45,731 million in FY20 to H 43,795 million

in FY22. Our net debt at group level is down from

H 42,632 million in FY20 to H 18,803 million in FY22.

We ended the year with strong liquidity position of

H 24,992 million. Additionally, we have commitments

to receive H 9,670 million as investments from our

various transactions with CPP Investments.

In May 2022, in line with our strategy to consolidate

our asset holdings, we acquired the remaining 50%

stake in Phoenix Marketcity, Chennai for a total value

of H 9,360 mn. Funded through internal accruals and

cash on balance sheet, the acquisition helped attain

sole ownership in one of the largest malls in India,

We are leveraging the

robustness of our business

model and staying true to our

values and ideals to shape a

better tomorrow.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

THE PHOENIX MILLS LIMITED:

Letter

Demonstrating Tenacity

that Inspires Progress: Dear Shareholders,

A satisfying journey in many ways, despite

turbulence and uncertainty – this sums up FY22

for The Phoenix Mills Limited. Driven by sustained

focus on maximising long-term intrinsic value for all

our stakeholders, we continued through the year to

find transformative pathways amid a tough macro-

economic environment and rising geo-political

issues.

Change brings opportunity to those who grasp

them. I am happy to report strong resilience and

robust performance on strategic, operational

and financial fronts, which led us farther on our

spectacular and sublime journey of becoming India’s

leading, mixed-use, real estate developer.

The COVID-19 crisis had dramatically disrupted

the sector in the past two years as it impacted

consumer sentiments and changed their behaviour

paradigm. However, the long-term structural growth

in the Indian retail industry will continue to benefit

brick-and-mortar retailing, fuelled by favourable

demographics, rising urbanisation, a growing

middle-class segment, and increasing consumerism

trends. With the Indian retail sector being the fastest

growing in the world, we foresee continued strong

performance as organised retail penetration rises

and population density remains high.

Towards an even better future

The future we imagine is the future we create.

Today, our vision is on creating iconic city centers,

experiential multi-use or mixed-use development

centers across urban India, with retail at the core,

and with offices and hotels as our complimentary

assets. Our portfolio of world-class assets give

us a powerful edge and facilitate us in delivering

unprecedented outcomes.

We are currently in an exciting phase of building

a future-ready company, which is founded on

responsible growth and value creation. We remain

well placed today, underpinned by the nature of

our business and strong return ratios. As we move

ahead in this symbiotic journey of collective, long-

term growth and progress, our priority will be to

achieve a balanced mix of growth and profitability,

and sustenance of existing market and wallet share,

led by our astute and far-sighted vision of a new and

empowered tomorrow.

Residential business delivered strong performance,

with gross sales of H 3,415 mn in FY22. Lower

housing finance interest rates, preference for larger

houses and ready-to-move-in inventory at prime

locations helped drive better sales velocity during

the year. The strong sales momentum continues in

the current financial year as well.

For Hotels, the pace of recovery continues to be

strong, and we believe the worst is now behind us.

At our flagship property, The. St. Regis, Mumbai,

revenues were higher by 19%, occupancy was higher

by 3 percentage points and ARRs were higher by

10% than their pre-COVID-19 levels. With resumption

of foreign travel, domestic travel picking up fiercely,

and corporate events and social functions kick-

starting following the pandemic, our projection is

that FY23 will be a year of massive bounce back

within the hotel industry.

Shifting gears in line with changing times –

new initiatives

Over the years, our constant endeavour has been to

bring the best of F&B concepts to our mall patrons

and offer them unique experiences with diverse

food choices. To be able to better deliver on this, we

took a strong and strategic call to re-enter the F&B

business. The launch of 8 new F&B brands is at the

planning stage and will be operationalised by FY24.

Through this, we will own F&B outlets in various PML-

owned malls, few of which are already operational

now. I take immense pride in sharing with you that

our new F&B venture Ishaara, a restaurant chain that

employs staff with hearing impairment, has recently

won an award for being the ‘Best Employer for

Persons with Disability’ by The National Society for

Equal Opportunities for the Handicapped.

Keying in the role of digital engagement in the lives

of the younger generation, we recently launched

the Phoenix Nhance app and Phoenix Gift Cards.

Phoenix Nhance is a reward programme, which helps

our customers earn reward points for shopping at

any PML mall across the country. It also offers great

convenience to our customers on the web, android

and iOS to plan their visits, access offers, purchase

event tickets and receive updates on brand-related

information, pre-book their parking at the mall

amongst others.

Phoenix Nhance was rolled out across 6 malls, and

in a significant achievement, over 6 lakh customers

positive future growth in the forthcoming years.

After all, a healthier bottom line is what every

organisation strives for and maintaining an active

focus on managing financial debt is a critical factor in

reaching that goal.

Today, we are equipped with a robust balance sheet

and have extremely supportive and strong partners

backing us. Our growth depends on our ability to

buy land at the right location and at a fair price,

helping us create unique destinations across India.

Our strong, in-house business development team

continues to evaluate the right opportunities in the

selected micro-markets to deploy growth funds and

generate superior returns over time.

Going forward

At PML, retail is at the heart of everything we do,

and will continue to be the driving force behind

our future growth and endeavours. While our retail

and other assets are back on track and reflecting

improved consumption levels post-COVID-19, we

remain cautious of the impending risk on the back of

such contingencies, going forward. Our experience

since March 2020 has led us to diversifying our risks,

mitigating the potential drop in cash flows, and

strategically reducing our increased dependency

on retail as an asset class, and retail rentals as our

primary income.

With backing from a huge and capable Operations

and Project Management team, and our strong and

supportive financial partners (equity and debt),

we maintain strong and healthy relationships with

our retailers too. This gives us the confidence and

the direction to initiate and explore other asset

classes, such as residential and warehousing, on an

opportunistic basis. Currently, we are contemplating

the idea of diversifying our risk across these asset

classes by undertaking select pilot projects and

enhancing our presence in the key markets of India,

albeit with limited capital deployment.

Environmentally-conscious development

As a responsible company, we engage in numerous

initiatives to minimise our environmental footprint

across water conservation, energy efficiency and

waste management fronts. As we continue to build

an even more sustainable and positive future, we

remain equally conscious of our commitments to the

environment, social and governance, and our larger

sustainability-related goals.

The key to our eco-consciousness and the endeavors

therein is a result of the continued support of our

stakeholders. We have adopted multiple initiatives to

sensitise our stakeholders on the adverse effects of

wastage of natural resources.

Reducing our impact on the environment that we

operate within is a conscious journey that we have

embarked on, and we have started taking firmer

steps towards this goal. We transitioned towards

securing power from green sources (solar energy

and wind energy) across the operational asset

portfolio in cities with supportive government

policies. We have installed EV charging stations

across our malls to ensure that our stakeholders

with energy-efficient vehicles feel at home. An

increased use of green energy, reduction in the use

of water and electricity, recycling of waste, and

decarbonisation, among other strategic initiatives,

remain our immediate focus to further the ESG

commitment within the organisation.

We are also working towards building spaces,

which consume less energy, and are more water

efficient. Our endeavour is to receive USGBC

LEED certification for all of our upcoming mall and

office projects. We are also working to achieve

USGBC LEED certification for the operational retail

portfolio in the coming years.

In conclusion

Over the years, we have invested significant capital

towards building of marquee assets, which are in

the process of getting operationalised. This will

boost our revenue potential and improve return

ratios. These factors are likely to augur well for

our future performance, ensuring strong organic

growth of the existing portfolio, operationalisation

of new malls and offices, and good momentum

across hotels and the residential business.

Before closing, I would like to extend my

sincere gratitude to our employees for their

persistent hard work and support. I also take

this opportunity to thank our retailers, partners,

bankers, consumers and our shareholders for their

unwavering trust and confidence in us during the

challenging times of the past. And we look forward

to your unflinching support in the exciting times

ahead.

Warm Regards,

payment of remuneration to Independent Directors

1) Corporate Information:

The Company is a public limited company domiciled

in India and is incorporated under the provisions

of the Companies Act applicable in India. The

registered office of the company is located at 462,

Senapati Bapat Marg, Lower Parel, Mumbai – 400

013.

The Company is engaged in the development and

leasing of commercial and retail space. The principal

place of business is at High Street Phoenix, 462,

Senapati Bapat Marg, Lower Parel, Mumbai – 400

013.

These financial statements were approved and

adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company

in their meeting held on 24th May, 2022.

2) Basis of preparation of financial

statements:

The Financial Statements have been prepared

to comply in all material aspects with Indian

Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015, as amended.

The significant accounting policies used in preparing

financial statements are set out below in Note

3 of the Notes to Financial Statements. Except

for the changes below, the Company has applied

accounting policies consistently to all the periods

presented.

Standards Issued but not Effective

On March 23, 2022, the Ministry of Corporate

Affairs (MCA) has notified Companies (Indian

Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022.

This notification has resulted into amendments in

the following existing accounting standards which

are applicable to company from April 1, 2022.

i)

Ind AS 101 – First time adoption of Ind AS

ii)

Ind AS 103 – Business Combination

iii) Ind AS 109 – Financial Instrument

iv) Ind AS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment

v)

Ind AS 37 –Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and

Contingent Assets

vi) Ind AS 41 – Agriculture

Application of above standards are not expected

to have any significant impact on the company’s

financial statements.

3) Significant Accounting Policies:

a)

Functional and presentation of currency:

The financial statements are presented in Indian

Rupees, which is the Company’s functional currency

and all amounts are rounded to the nearest rupees

in lakhs.

b)

Basis of measurement:

The Financial Statements have been prepared on

historical cost basis, except the following:

• Certain financial assets and liabilities which are

measured at fair value.

• Defined benefit plans – plan assets measured at

fair value.

• Share Based Payments measured at fair value.

c)

Use of Estimates :

The preparation of the financial statements requires

management to make estimates, judgements and

assumptions that affect the reported balances

of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent

liabilities as on the date of financial statements and

reported amounts of income and expenses during

the period. Uncertainty about these assumptions

and estimates could result in outcomes that require

a material adjustment to the carrying amount of

assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

The key assumptions concerning the future and

other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the

reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing

a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of

assets and liabilities within the next financial year

are described in Note.4. The Company based its

assumptions and estimates on parameters available

when the financial statements were prepared.

Existing circumstances and assumptions about

future developments, however, may change due to

market changes or circumstances arising that are

beyond the control of the Company. Such changes

are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

d) Property, Plant and Equipment:

Freehold land is carried at historical cost. Capital

work in progress, and all other items of property,

plant and equipment are stated at historical cost

net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated

impairment losses, if any.

Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly

attributable to the acquisition of the items. Such

cost includes the costs for long-term construction

projects if the recognition criteria are met.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s

carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset,

as appropriate, only when it is probable that future

economic benefits associated with the item will

flow to the company and the cost of the item can

be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any

component accounted for as a separate asset is

derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and

To the Members of

THE PHOENIX MILLS LIMITED

Report on the Consolidated Financial

Statements

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated

financial statements of The Phoenix Mills Limited

(hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) and

its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries

together referred to as “the Group”) and its associates

which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31st

March, 2022, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit

and Loss, including Consolidated Other Comprehensive

Income, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and

the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for

the year then ended, and notes to the Consolidated

Financial Statements, including a summary of significant

accounting policies and other explanatory information

(hereinafter referred to as “the Consolidated Financial

Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and

according to the explanations given to us and based

on the consideration of reports of other auditors on

separate audited financial statements and on other

financial information of the subsidiaries and associates,

the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give

the information required by the Companies Act, 2013

(“ the Act”) (as amended) in the manner so required

and give a true and fair view in conformity with the

Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) specified under

Section 133 of the Act and other accounting principles

generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the

Company as at 31st March 2022, its profit including other

comprehensive income, its cash flows and the statement

of changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards

on Auditing (“SAs”) as specified under Section 143(10) of

the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are

further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the

Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section

of our report. We are independent of the Company in

accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute

of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with

the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit

of the consolidated financial statements under the

provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder,

and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in

accordance with these requirements and the ICAI‘s Code

of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained

by us and other auditors is sufficient and appropriate

to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated

financial statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters (‘KAM’) are those matters that, in

our professional judgment, were of most significance

in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

for the financial year ended 31st March, 2022. These

matters were addressed in the context of our audit of

the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in

forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a

separate opinion on these matters.

Independent Auditor’s Report

Key Audit Matter

Response to key audit matter

Revenue Recognition - License Fees & Other

Operating Services

(Refer Note ‘29’ and Para ‘3.14’ of significant

accounting policies)

Holding Company owns Phoenix Palladium at

Mumbai and earns revenue by giving units on

leave and licence basis. Revenue comprises

of licence fees, variable licence fees, service

charges, parking fees etc. These are accounted

as revenue as per the revenue recognition

policy described in significant account policies.

Considering leave and licence contracts with

numerous customers having varied terms and

considering the varied type concessions /

waiver / relief granted to retailers for lockdown

and subsequent period considering the

restrictions imposed due to Covid-19 pandemic,

we have identified recording of revenue as Key

Audit Matter.

Our Audit procedures to assess the appropriateness of revenue recognised

included the following

•

Obtaining an understanding of and assessing the design, implementation

and operating effectiveness of the Company’s key internal controls over

revenue recognition process.

•

Testing a sample of contracts, addendum / waiver / concession letters

agreed with retailers and testing the revenues recognised with respect

thereto by agreeing information back to agreed terms.

•

Testing the controls over the licensee’s sale data collated for the purpose

of recognising variable revenue share on sample basis.

•

Assessing the adequacy of company’s disclosure with respect to revenue

recognised.

Corporate Information

The Phoenix Mills Ltd (“PML” or ‘’Parent’’) is

domiciled and incorporated in India and its shares

are publicly traded on the National Stock Exchange

(‘NSE’) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (‘BSE’),

in India. The registered office of the company is at

462, Senapati Bapat Marg, Lower Parel, Mumbai –

400013, Maharashtra, India.

Group is engaged in operation and management

of mall, construction of commercial and residential

property and hotel business in India.

These financial statements were approved and

adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company

in their meeting held on 24th May, 2022.

2. Basis of Preparation of Financial

Statement

The Financial Statements have been prepared

to comply in all material aspects with Indian

Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015, as amended.

The significant accounting policies used in preparing

financial statements are set out below in Note 3 of

the Notes to Financial Statements. Except for the

changes below, the Group has applied accounting

policies consistently to all the periods presented.

3. Significant Accounting Policies

3.1. Basis of Measurement

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been

prepared on an accrual basis and under the historical

cost convention except following which have been

measured at fair value:

• Defined benefit plans – plan assets measured at

fair value

• Certain financial assets and liabilities that are

measured at fair value.

• Share based payments measured at fair value

The Consolidated Financial Statements are

presented in Indian Rupees (“in lakhs“), which is the

Group’s functional currency and all amounts are

rounded to the nearest rupees in lakhs

3.2. Basis of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group

incorporate the financial statements of the Parent

Company and its subsidiaries and associates. The

Parent Company has control over the subsidiaries

as it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns

from its involvement with the investee; and has the

ability to affect its returns through its power over the

subsidiaries. Generally, there is a presumption that a

majority of voting rights result in control. To support

this presumption and when the Group has less

than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an

investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and

circumstances in assessing whether it has power over

an investee, including the contractual arrangement

with the other vote holders of the investee, rights

arising from other contractual arrangements, the

Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

and the size of the Group’s holding of voting rights

relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings

of the other voting rights holders. The Company

re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee

if facts and circumstances indicate that there are

changes to one or more of the three elements of

control.

An associate is an entity over which the Group has

significant influence. Significant influence is the

power to participate in the financial and operating

policy decisions of the investee, but has no control

or joint control over those policies.

Consolidation Procedure:

a)

Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity,

income, expenses and cash flows of the parent

with those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose,

income and expenses of the subsidiary are

based on the amounts of the assets and

liabilities recognised in the Consolidated

Financial Statements at the acquisition date.

b)

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when

the Parent Company obtains control over the

subsidiary and ceases when the Parent Company

loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically,

income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired

or disposed off during the year are included in

the consolidated statement of profit or loss and

other comprehensive income from the date the

Parent Company gains control until the date

when the Parent Company ceases to control

the subsidiary.

c)

Profit or loss and each component of other

comprehensive income are attributed to the

owners of the Parent Company and to the

non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive

income of subsidiaries is attributed to the

owners of the Parent Company and to the

non-controlling interests even if this results in

the non-controlling interests having a deficit

balance.

d)

Adjustments are made to the financial

statements of subsidiaries, as and when

necessary, to bring their accounting policies

into line with the Group’s accounting policies.
