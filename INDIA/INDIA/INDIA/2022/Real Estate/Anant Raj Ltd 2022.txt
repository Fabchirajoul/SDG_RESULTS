Dear Shareholders,

Wish you well.

With the blessings of Lala Anant Ram

Sarin and Smt. Raj Kumari Sarin, we

are delighted to present our FY 2021-22

annual report.

FY 2021-22 has been an extraordinary

year after the initial disruptions due to

COVID. There has been immense positivity

and euphoria ever since.

The Indian economy in every sense

exhibited its strong fundamentals and

its growing status in the world. A lot of

credit goes to the Indian Government for

the incredible work in keeping the Indian

economy buoyant alongside effectively

handling the social crisis associated

with COVID-19. Rapid inoculation of

majority of India’s eligible population

along with sustained fiscal and policy

interventions improved consumer and

market sentiments. Adequate measures

were undertaken which drove ease of doing

business. Interestingly, the government’s

focus on making India self-reliant and

addressing pressing issues like climate

change and energy security have opened

many new opportunities.

Together, these efforts have propelled

economic engine, resulting in a solid 8.7%

GDP growth in FY 2021-22 and has a stage

for multiple years of accelerated growth

towards the USD 5 trillion GDP goal.

The impact of economic revitalisation

was broad-based and evident across all

sectors including real estate. The year

saw

positive

momentum

in

both

construction and transacting activities.

While the residential segment was up

since the last year, the current fiscal

saw the commercial segment bustling as

companies started returning to office and

economic activities picked.

Amidst this positivity, an interesting

trend is also shaping India’s construction

landscape. The country’s accelerated focus

on digitalisation and manufacturing self-

reliance has unleashed mega opportunities

for

world-class

Data

Centers

and

Warehouses. Additionally, the strong

intent to address climate change has also

created demand for Green buildings.

Rejuvenating to resurge

We strongly believe that Anant Raj is

well-positioned to play a catalyst role

in the new real estate boom, especially

in the NCR where we operate. Few

developments will make this happen.

One, we have already extended our

capabilities beyond residential, office,

commercial and hospitality segments to

Data Centers and Warehouses where we

are actively pursuing alliances to scale

competencies.

FY 2021-22 HAS BEEN

AN EXTRAORDINARY

YEAR AFTER THE INITIAL

DISRUPTIONS DUE TO

COVID. THERE HAS BEEN

IMMENSE POSITIVITY AND

EUPHORIA EVER SINCE

Ind AS 16- Property, plant and equipment:

The amendment clarifies that excess of net sale proceeds

not be recognised in the profit or loss but deducted

from the directly attributable costs considered as part

of cost of an item of property, plant and equipment.

The effective date for adoption of this amendment is

contract comprises the ‘costs that related directly to the

either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract

(examples would be direct labour, materials) or an

allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling

contracts (an example would be the allocation of

depreciation charge for an item of property, plant and

equipment used in fulfilling the contract). The effective

date for adoption of this amendment is annual periods

beginning on or after April 1, 2022, although early

adoption is permitted.

The amendments are extensive and the Group
