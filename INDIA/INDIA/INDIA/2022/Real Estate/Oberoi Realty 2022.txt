CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT (CONTD.):

letter of allotment and when control

of the goods or services are transferred to the customer, at an amount that reflects the consideration

(i.e. the transaction price) to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods

or services excluding any amount received on behalf of third party (such as indirect taxes). An asset

created by the Group’s performance does not have an alternate use and as per the terms of the

contract, the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed till date. Hence

the Group transfers control of a good or service over time and, therefore, satisfies a performance

obligation and recognises revenue over time. The Group recognises revenue at the transaction price

(net of transaction costs) which is determined on the basis of agreement or: letter of allotment entered

into with the customer. The Group recognises revenue for performance obligation satisfied over time

only if it can reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance

obligation. The Group would not be able to reasonably measure its progress towards complete

satisfaction of a performance obligation if it lacks reliable information that would be required to

apply an appropriate method of measuring progress. In those circumstances, the Group recognises

revenue only to the extent of cost incurred until it can reasonably measure outcome of the performance

obligation.

The Group uses cost based input method for measuring progress for performance obligation satisfied

over time. Under this method, the Group recognises revenue in proportion to the actual project cost

incurred (excluding land and finance cost) as against the total estimated project cost (excluding land

and finance cost).

In a Joint development arrangement (JDA) wherein the land owner provides land and in lieu the Group

transfers certain percentage of constructed area, the revenue is recognised over time using cost based

input method of percentage of completion. Project costs include fair value of such land received and

this fair value is accounted for on launch of the project.

The management reviews and revises its measure of progress periodically and are considered

as change in estimates and accordingly, the effect of such changes in estimates is recognised

prospectively in the period in which such changes are determined.

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the

customer. If the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays

consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration

that is conditional.

NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTD.)

Managing Director/Chief Financial

Officer evaluates the Group’s performance based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segment. Accordingly information

has been presented along these segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statement are consistently applied in

individual segment to prepare segment reporting.

B.

The above Cash Flow Statement has been prepared under the Indirect Method, as set out in Ind AS 7 Statement of Cash Flows.:

letter of allotment and when control

of the goods or services are transferred to the customer, at an amount that reflects the consideration

(i.e. the transaction price) to which the Company is expected to be entitled in exchange for those

goods or services excluding any amount received on behalf of third party (such as indirect taxes). An

asset created by the Company’s performance does not have an alternate use and as per the terms

of the contract, the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed till

date. Hence the Company transfers control of a good or service over time and, therefore, satisfies a

performance obligation and recognises revenue over time. The Company recognises revenue at the

transaction price (net of transaction costs) which is determined on the basis of agreement or: letter of

allotment entered into with the customer. The Company recognises revenue for performance obligation

satisfied over time only if it can reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of

the performance obligation. The Company would not be able to reasonably measure its progress

towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation if it lacks reliable information that would

be required to apply an appropriate method of measuring progress. In those circumstances, the

Company recognises revenue only to the extent of cost incurred until it can reasonably measure

outcome of the performance obligation.

The Company uses cost based input method for measuring progress for performance obligation

satisfied over time. Under this method, the Company recognises revenue in proportion to the actual

project cost incurred (excluding land and finance cost) as against the total estimated project cost

(excluding land and finance cost).

In a Joint development arrangement (JDA) wherein the land owner provides land and in lieu the

Company transfers certain percentage of constructed area, the revenue is recognised over time using

cost based input method of percentage of completion. Project costs include fair value of such land

received and this fair value is accounted for on launch of the project.

The management reviews and revises its measure of progress periodically and are considered

as change in estimates and accordingly, the effect of such changes in estimates is recognised

prospectively in the period in which such changes are determined.
