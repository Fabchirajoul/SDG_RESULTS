We have a diversified projects portfolio

comprising complex projects that

require sharper focus on strategy

and execution across the length and

breadth of our country. Our committed

teams and visionary leadership at the

helm enable us to deliver projects at

desired pace and precision.

We believe, India’s infrastructure

growth story is now at a sweet spot,

with the government’s mega push on

infrastructure building, especially in

roads, railways and metro, where we

enjoy a visible presence. We are also

diversifying, beyond roads, into other

infrastructure segments, and our non-

roads revenue segments is likely to

grow significantly in the coming years.

We are aiming for the quality growth

that encompasses all stakeholders,

protects the environment and creates

long-lasting value for the nation.

At GRIL, we are

committed to be

a part of India’s

infrastructure

growth story,

because we believe

infrastructure is a

value multiplier for

the economy and

society.:

dear Shareholders

After an extended period of

unprecedented global crisis,

uncertainty and unfortunate

loss of lives and livelihoods,

the Indian economy is showing

signs of strong recovery.

The Indian Government’s

focus on vaccinations along

with continued assistance

to businesses and people at

grassroot level have immensely

supported the revival of

economic activities.

Ever since the successful

completion of our first project,

we have steadily grown in

terms of size and geographic

presence, while also diversifying

our business segments.

Our focus is to continue the

same going forward.

Propelling value-accretive growth:

dear Shareholders

The Indian economy gradually picked

up momentum and the world economy

started awakening from the pandemic-

induced inertia. The Government of

India and state governments continue

to invest in infrastructure creation or

upgradation, especially in road and

railway projects, where we enjoy

a visible presence, respect and

experience. Our high level of expertise

puts us in an competitive position

amongst others in the industry.

PERFORMING WITH FOCuS

During the year under review, we

reported a resilient performance.

Our consolidated revenue from

operations grew by 7.83% from

` 8,458.34 Crores in FY 2021-22 from

` 7,844.13 Crores in FY 2020-21. In

FY 2021-22, our consolidated EBITDA

stood at ` 1,802.06 Crores and our

consolidated Profit after Tax was

` 831.91 Crores compared to ` 954.82

Crores in FY 2020-21.

We have been in the infrastructure

space for over 25 years and we have

built a strong reputation for On-time

or before-time completion of projects.

Our deep technical grounding,

strong execution capabilities

and higher backward integration

enabled us to deliver over 8 projects

during the fiscal.

We are maintaining prudent bidding

discipline with a focus for the

projects being bid under HAM

model while trying to keep a balance

with EPC projects

The consistent growth in our order

book has resulted from continued

focus on road projects and our

ability to successfully bid and win

new projects. Our experience in

execution of road projects, technical

capabilities, timely performance,

reputation for quality construction,

strong financials as well as the price

competitiveness of bids have enabled

us to make a mark for ourselves as

an important infrastructure sector

player with diverse capabilities in the

infrastructure space.

We have low execution costs,

which is partly attributable to

our integrated operations and

investment in technology. Further,

the scale of our operations provides

us with a significant advantage in

reducing costs and sustaining our

cost advantage.

Our operational efficiency (including

maintaining quality, minimising costs

and ensuring timely completion of

our projects) depends largely on the

expertise honed by our employees.

We are consistently upskilling our

teams with the evolving industry best

practices to create an empowered

workforce. We offer our engineering

and technical personnel a wide range

of learning opportunities by providing

them with an opportunity to work

on a variety of large and complex

construction projects.

dIVERSIFICATION STRATEGy

We are targeting the following

infrastructure segments: a) railways:

projects involving earthwork, track

linking; b) Metros: civil engineering

work and c) power transmission

business (participation in tariff based

competitive bidding).

STRATEGIC STEP

Since road construction projects

typically have a long gestation period.

In order to enhance our capacity

and participate in new upcoming

projects and recycle capital, we are

in the process of sponsoring an

Infrastructure Investment Trust.

We have sponsored and settled a

Trust viz. Bharat Highways InvIT

(the InvIT), an trust established in

accordance with the provisions of

the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 and the

same proposed to be registered

with the Securities and Exchange

Board of India as an infrastructure

investment trust. We will also act

as the Project Manager of the InvIT.

As part of the proposed transaction,

we propose to transfer our equity

shareholding in certain HAM assets.

As consideration for such transfer, we

will receive units of the InvIT and/ or

cash consideration.

We believe, that our strategic initiative

will not only free up capital but will

also create value for our shareholders

WAy FORWARd

I take this opportunity to thank our

clients who continued to repose

confidence in our ability, our banks

who have continued to support us

with timely funding, our shareholders

who have stayed with us, as well

as our business associates and

employees who have persevered to

grow the Company. It would not have

been possible for your Company to

come thus far without your timely and

valuable contribution.
