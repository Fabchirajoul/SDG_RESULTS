Dear Stakeholders,

I write to you at a time when the country

is slowly coming out of the crisis created

by the pandemic, and with the hope that

growing adaptation and vaccination will

allow us to return to a pandemic-free

future. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely

affected most sectors of the Indian

economy, leading to a sharp plummeting

of domestic demand and exports with few

notable exceptions, where high growth

was observed. As a result of lockdowns

and other restrictive measures imposed

to control the spread of the pandemic,

demand declined while lack of opportunities

to spend, particularly on contact-intensive

services, increased the quantum of forced

savings. The country faced the situation

stoically, confident in the hope of an early

return to the growth trajectory.

As a technology-driven organisation and the

most significant financial infrastructure and

service provider in India, the Company’s

primary business is being the Registrar

and Transfer Agency to Asset Management

Companies. During the year, a buoyant

secondary market served to reduce risk

perceptions by retail investors and ensured

a robust year for mutual fund operations.

The Mutual Fund industry witnessed

all-round highs across most key metrics.

Your Company continues to be an integral

part of the finance industry and plays a key

role in the mutual fund ecosystem. We are

well-positioned for leading the advancement

in the industry. In my view, the Mutual Fund

industry is poised for stronger growth.

New-age fintech solutions have provided

ease of access and enhanced participation

by individuals in stock markets and mutual

funds, which is expected to increase

with greater allocation of their savings

being invested into equity markets and

mutual funds.

On the business front, your Company

continued to operate a hybrid work model,

developed at the start of the pandemic

for most part of the year. This model has

worked successfully, and employees of

the organisation and clients have adapted

to this structure, as can be inferred from

higher productivity, improved collaboration

and work relationships besides employee

satisfaction. It has enabled the Company

to ensure the health and well-being of

its employees, and service support for

its customers.

Despite the adverse conditions prevailing

during FY 2021-22, the Company continued

to focus on its growth through multiple

avenues. It commenced working as

Registrar and Transfer Agent for Franklin

Templeton Mutual Fund. It launched

CAMS WealthServ, a customisable digital

solution designed to ease and expedite

the onboarding of High Networth Individual

investors on the Alternative Investment

Fund (“AIF”) and Portfolio Management

Service (“PMS”) platform and set up an

office in GIFT City.

The Company made significant progress

in the implementation of the Account

Aggregator (“AA”) platform, to create

technology solutions for the AA industry

and set up the Central Recordkeeping

Agency for National Pension System, which

have become operational. A subsidiary of

the Company designed and launched an

innovative policyholder traceability solution

for the insurance industry. The Company

in association with another player,

developed and launched MFCentral, India’s

first industry-wide all-in-one investment

management platform.

The Company’s core value is putting

customers first and at the centre of

everything. This mindset is reflected in

the results of a customer satisfaction

survey conducted among our clients,

which revealed 93% of satisfied and highly

satisfied investors.

The Company delivered positive

commercial outcomes during the year

while reporting strong financial results and

operational performance. The Company

has successfully managed multiple large

New Fund Offers for Mutual Fund houses

smoothly and efficiently. Besides deep

appreciation from clients, our competent

management has helped to establish our

expertise and operational excellence in

the industry. The Company’s appointment

as the RTA by Zerodha AMC for its

upcoming mutual fund business is a clear

endorsement of the CAMS brand salience.

Looking ahead, your Company is making

strong efforts to enhance its leadership

position in the mutual fund industry,

AIF PMS segment and to focus on new

business lines.

On behalf of the Board of CAMS, I would

like to thank MF investors, distributors and

all the customers who avail our services

for making us the industry leader. My

heartfelt gratitude to all the employees of

CAMS Group for their resilience and hard

work which has enabled the Company to

deliver in the most difficult circumstances.

I would also like to thank our shareholders

who have reposed their faith in us and the

Directors on the Board for their support and

active participation in the governance of the

Company.

Warm Regards,

Managing Director

MD’s Message: Dear Shareholders

I am pleased to present to you the

34th Annual Report of the Company. The

FY 2021-22 was challenging in view of the

crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic

that seriously disrupted economies and

industries worldwide. Faced with the

pandemic challenges, the Company

ensured employees’ well-being and safety

besides successfully meeting productivity

targets, by adopting a hybrid work culture

as done in the previous year. We stayed

on course to ensure that our customers

and investors were least impacted by

social restrictions as we continued to safely

provide high fidelity services.

Operational Excellence

The Company’s preparedness with the

Work from Home model ensured that all

key deliverables to clients were met

during the year without any disruption.

FY 2021-22 will go down in the Company’s

history as a landmark year with assets,

transactions, Systematic Investment Plan

(“SIP”) and New Fund Offers (“NFOs”)

touching historic highs. We maintained

high quality standards and efficiency in

processing highest fund mobilisation from

mega NFOs, 415.90 million transactions

and the Company successfully went live

with its 17th Asset Management Company

(“AMC”) client Franklin Templeton Mutual

Fund on July 19, 2021. This was the

largest migration (in terms of assets under

management, folios and investors base) in

the Mutual Fund (“MF”) industry.

Firmly focused on client convenience, we

have used technology and innovatively

evolved smart strategies to unravel

pockets of manual intervention within MF

operations, that were known to cause

delays and pressure employees. We

implemented several initiatives during

the year to redesign and reinvent these

processes in asset management to make

them happen without human intervention.

Many of these initiatives that went live

during the year, enabled the Company to

improve its delivery standards. We also

supported the mutual fund industry

with implementation of several high

impact regulatory changes. As in the

past, the Company participated in

various regulatory and policy initiatives

on enhancing investor convenience and

introducing technological innovations.

Customer Satisfaction

The Company’s philosophy as reflected

in its mission statement – ‘Our Mission…

Your Growth’– mirrors our core value of

serving customers, including investors,

distributors, clients, employees, and

every other stakeholder. This mindset that

drives our service efficiency, has invoked

deep appreciation from our customers,

as revealed by the results of our annual

customer satisfaction survey. Involving

participation by ~22,000 respondents, the

survey showed that 93% of the respondents

rated their service experience with the

Company as ‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’.

Our market share, as measured by Average

Assets under Management (“AAUM”)

serviced by us as a percentage of industry

AAUM was ~69% as of March 2022. As

a market leader, the Company’s mutual

fund clients include the top five asset

management companies as well as ten of

the fifteen largest mutual funds.

We have further consolidated our

leadership position for the alternatives

segment viz. Alternative Investment

Funds and Portfolio Management with our

technology-backed full-stack digital and

fund administration services. We were the

first RTA in India to commence operations

at GIFT City.

Our payments aggregator business

expanded to serve large NBFCs & Insurers

besides introducing new services such as

UPI and UPI Autopay for Mutual Funds.

Driving Digital Growth

Enabling clients’ business growth is core to

CAMS’ value proposition, and engineered

through superior technology solutions

for new products, development of new

services, creation of brand-new digital

conveniences, besides executing sales and

leading campaigns backed by business

analytics and call centre support. The

MF industry is also witnessing a pivotal

moment of digital disruption. Paper-based

transactions have steadily declined over the

past three years, even as the shift to digital

and electronic modes of operation have

was also introduced to recognise Star

Employees for exemplary contribution

on a quarterly basis.

Rewards & recognition

Rewards and recognition are key

to driving employee motivation.

Employees were bestowed with spot

awards, best manager, PACE awards

and quarterly best function awards

consistently through the year. Further,

employees were also felicitated for

their contributions in various projects.

Successful execution

of the largest employee

transition amidst

We successfully went live with

17th AMC client Franklin Templeton

Mutual Fund (FTMF) on July 19,

2021. This was the largest transition

(in terms of AAUM, folios and

investors base) in the MF industry.

However, the process involved

a mammoth staff re-badging

exercise across 15 months during

the pandemic. We successfully

overcame all challenges involving

attendant complexities in the

migration process, operating

model, remote training on CAMS

systems and processes, WFH

enablement and setting up of

Hyderabad back office in the midst

of mobility constraints. In the final

three months, aligned to the gradual

relaxation by the authorities, we

ensured employees started getting

back to office initially through

rostering and later through a

shift mechanism.
