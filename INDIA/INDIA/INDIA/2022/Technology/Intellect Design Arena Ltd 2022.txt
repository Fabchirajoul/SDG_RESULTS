Letter to Shareholders: Dear Shareholders,

Over the last two years, there has been a pattern of

pleasant coincidence around the timing of this letter.

The Annual IBS Sales League Table ratings, based on

the number of successful deals, were being released

around the same time. Intellect has been winning #1

Ranking in the key Banking verticals – Retail Banking

and Corporate Banking. In June 2021, our third key

vertical - Insurtech joined this Club, winning the #1

Rating. As is done in Sports, the natural expectation

was to look for a “hat trick” at this juncture. We

precisely achieved that this year – we have won the

#1 Rating for both Retail – six times in a row - and

Corporate Banking – thrice in a row as well as for

Insurtech – twice in a row, apart from adding Retail

Lending to the list now. Having won the pole

position in these 4 products, we have also been

ranked #2 in Digital Banking and in Private Banking/

Wealth Management. These apart, we have also won

the #1 position in Global Leadership in terms of

Product Breadth and #2 in terms of Geographic

spread, apart from emerging #1 – as a Regional

Leader for ASEAN region.

A consistent endorsement from such an independent

external rating exercise, is a strong validation of our

growth, our success across Product lines and

geographies and a gratifying evidence of our increasing

Brand power.

FY22 PERFORMANCE

FY21 had, as I wrote in my last communication, proved

to be a signiﬁcantly successful year for Intellect

despite the impact of the pandemic, with substantial

improvement in proﬁtability and cash flows apart from

revenue growth. I am glad to report that FY22 built

further on the strong foundation laid towards proﬁtable

growth in FY21. Our revenue growth further accelerated

to 27% over FY21 to INR 19,187 Mn. Our License linked

revenues – License plus Maintenance (AMC) plus

Subscription / SaaS revenues - a metric that is very

pertinent for an IP led organisation such as Intellect -

moved upto nearly 57% of revenues against 54.25% in

the prior year. This was supported by a strong growth

in our Subscription and SaaS (Software as a Service)

revenues by 112% over the year ago. Our annual

recurring revenues also moved up to about 38% of

revenues against 32% in FY21, pointing that an

increasing share of our revenue is derived from stable,

repeatable streams. We registered 35 Wins in FY22

including 13 transformational platform wins. More than

the numbers, the nature of deals won, the rigour of the

evaluation processes, the logos acquired and the

sophisticated competition against which these were

won - all of these collectively prove the ‘depth’ and

‘edge’ of our Technologies, Products and Platforms.

On proﬁtability, the increase in our Gross margins

outpaces revenue growth – moving up by 30% against

year ago, against the revenue growth of 27% - driven by

the quality of revenues, increased salience of IP led

revenues and design thinking led delivery efﬁciencies.

With no compromise on our Research spending as well

as Market investments, our Earnings before Interest,
