Chief Executive Officer &: Managing

Dear Stakeholders,

Our maiden Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for FY'22 (“BRSR”) is enclosed as part of the Annual Report. We engaged

Ernst & Young Associates LLP (“EY”), a third party to perform an independent assurance on the BRSR. The Independent Assurance

Statement by EY is also enclosed as part of the Annual Report.

HCL Technologies is built on the values of innovation, entrepreneurship, humanity and a people-centric culture. Aligned to this culture, this

year, the Board of Directors decided to have a specific focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) aspects. Accordingly, the

role of the Diversity Committee was widened to overview the ESG related matters. In view of the enhanced role, the name of the Diversity

Committee (constituted in the Year 2016) was changed to ESG & Diversity Equity Inclusion Committee (“ESG & DEI Committee”).

Our philosophy has always been about incorporating the right practices to ensure a sustainable present and future. We have taken a

holistic approach to Sustainability – we are working to hold ourselves to high standards and we are helping our clients and partners

achieve their goals. Our ESG strategy is grounded in three pillars:

ACT – We understand that impact starts with us. We will act in a responsible manner and ensure we use every resource efficiently to

garner the maximum value.

PACT – Our relationships go beyond a formal contract with our stakeholders. Our pact with our stakeholders is to provide the maximum

value in the most sustainable manner.

IMPACT – We focus on creating sustainable impact through all our initiatives and activities.

Drawing from this philosophy, we have revisited our material ESG topics. Engaging with our stakeholders and using a risk and responsibility

lens, we were able to prioritize 12 material ESG topics which you can find listed inside this report. To monitor the progress the Company

is making across these material topics, we have also finalized the metrics that will be monitored and tracked. We also see the demand for

technology and digitalization in the journey to a sustainable future and in this direction, we are creating solutions along with our partners

and clients.

The Board of Directors has approved a set of short-medium and long-term goals and targets on ESG, which are included in this report.

We are pleased to confirm that our climate change targets are validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to be aligned with

the 1.5°C pathway.

As global citizens, we have a collective responsibility to the natural ecosystem and society we live in. Creating and sustaining harmony is

important for any organization’s growth and encompasses dimensions other than simply generating revenues. The ESG ratings bestowed

on us are a validation of our efforts and helps us both benchmark and course correct. During the year, we have received several accolades

and recognitions which we consider as encouragement to continue our efforts to create more impact.

We look forward to receiving your feedback.
