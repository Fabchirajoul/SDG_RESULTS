Letter to Shareholders

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to report that for the financial year ended March 31, 2022,

your Company posted a consolidated revenue of ₹ 52.2 billion. Consolidated net profit for the financial year was

₹ 18.9 billion, an increase of 7% over the previous financial year.

Our customer footprint continues to be diverse in terms of scale and geography as we cater to the needs of the global

multinational banks, small to large regional banks, as well as specialized banks and financial services companies.

Maintaining a growth momentum throughout the financial year, your Company acquired new customers across all

business areas - Corporate Banking, Retail Banking, Modern Risk and Finance, and Financial Crime and Compliance

Management. Simultaneously, we have also been growing business from our existing clients through targeted cross-

selling and upselling. Our continued investments in building organic SaaS solutions are now starting to bear fruits.

This year, we signed our largest-ever multi-year SaaS deal with a tier-1 US bank.

The banking and financial services industry has been witnessing a rapid transformation, with banks and financial

institutions redefining their operating and deployment models to keep pace with technological disruptions. Our razor-

sharp focus on innovative, market-leading technology, business solutions, and service offerings empowers financial

institutions to deliver better financial services to their clients. Our solutions are built on our technology blueprint of an

agile and adaptive architecture, with innovation built in for faster business outcomes. We can offer options of cloud or

on-premise deployment based on the customers’ preferences. This year, we introduced the Embedded Finance for

Transaction Banking solution that enables banks to provide a personalized digital banking experience—with seamless

payments, collections, holistic working-capital management recommendations, and virtual account management—

built on a modern, data-rich cloud foundation that is integrated seamlessly with the clients’ ERP systems. We are

leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and advanced analytics to tackle financial

crime and comply with evolving regulations.

Your Company continues to lead the industry analyst recognitions. We retained our leadership position in this year’s

Gartner - Global Retail Core Banking Annual Survey. IDC MarketScape recognized us as a leader in worldwide end-

to-end corporate banking. Our successful shift to banking based on microservices was corroborated by Gartner who

acknowledged that “Oracle’s number of exposed microservices is the highest across the vendors”. Asia Risk Awards

recognized Oracle for the best asset-liability management solution and Risk Data Repository of the year. Regulation

Asia awarded Oracle’s anti-financial crime solutions high distinction for Know Your Customer (KYC), Onboarding,

PEPs, and Sanctions Screening capabilities.

Continuing its support in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, your Company concentrated its CSR efforts in the

last two years on providing pandemic-related relief to the community, including, but not limited to, delivering critical

medical supplies and services, supporting vaccination drives, and providing essential services to those impacted by

the pandemic. Internally, the Company directed its resources towards supporting the employees and their families

during the critical pandemic period, including by helping arrange critical medical facilities and resources such as

vaccination drives.

Your Company continues its mission to empower financial institutions to deliver better financial services through

innovative, market-leading technology and business solutions. As the global demand expands, we are well placed to

respond to the market demands in the coming years.

On behalf of the Board of Directors and Management of Oracle Financial Services Software, I would like to thank

you for your support. In the coming year, we will continue to work towards surpassing your expectations from the

Company and aim to set and achieve newer and more challenging targets.

Regards,

S Venkatachalam
