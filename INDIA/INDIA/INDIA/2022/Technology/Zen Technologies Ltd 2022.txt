(I IN CRORE)

In this Annual Report, we have disclosed forward-looking information

to enable investors to comprehend our prospects and take informed

investment decisions. This report and other statements - written and

oral - that we periodically make, contain forward-looking statements

that set out anticipated results based on the management’s plans

and assumptions. We have tried wherever possible to identify

such statements by using words such as ‘anticipate’, ‘estimate’,

‘expects’, ‘projects’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’, and words of similar

substance in connection with any discussion of future performance.

We cannot guarantee that these forward-looking statements will be

realised, although we believe we have been prudent in assumptions.

The achievement of results is subject to risks, uncertainties and

even inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or

uncertainties materialise or should underlying assumptions prove

inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated,

estimated or projected. Readers should bear this in mind. We undertake

no obligation to publicly update any forward- looking statements,

whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Forward looking Message

Zen has achieved all of

its success by focusing

intensively on R&D, and in

recent years it has invested

significantly in anti-drone

technology. During the year,

the Company received

orders that validated Zen’s

technology and product

and was a testament to its

superior R&D capabilities.

At Zen Technologies, we are aware

of what the future of defence looks

like and are prepared to take up the

challenge head-on.

However, Zen is far from

done. It raised funds in

FY22 to further strengthen

its R&D capabilities enhance

its product offerings, and

expand its geographical

presence.

The Company has and will

continue to scout for ideas it

can explore and give meaning

to, leveraging its innate

ability to turn those ideas

into concrete reality. The

Company hopes to continue

on this trajectory to unlock

greater milestones in the

years ahead.:

Dear Shareholders,

“We understand

and acknowledge

the need to invest

in our business to

take it to the next

level. Therefore our

two primary focus

areas this year have

been strengthening

our R&D and

export presence.”
