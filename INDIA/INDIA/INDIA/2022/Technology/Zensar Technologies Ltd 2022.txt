Integrated Annual Report 2021-22:

Dear Shareholders,

Ajay S. Bhutoria

Chief Executive Officer and: Managing

Managing Director

By the numbers: Our record

revenue growth

Fiscal Year (FY) 2021-22 was one of

record revenue growth — a year in

which our offerings continued to win

the trust of our clients across industry

verticals and geographies. The year-

over-year (YoY) growth percentages

below signal our success in the last FY:

Our banking vertical: 62.0%

Our insurance vertical: 5.9%

Our consumer services

vertical: 26.4%

Our hi-tech and manufacturing

vertical: 8.3%

United States: 12.7%

Europe: 24.7%

Africa: 17.4%

Think Velocity. Think Zensar.

We updated our brand identity to

reflect our new go-to-market strategy

and vision — our first brand refresh in

two decades. While marking our new

experience-led engineering strategy,

our refreshed identity underscores

our strong foundation of innovation,

customer-centricity, and award-

winning people-first culture.

Think Velocity is the cornerstone of

our brand, and it acknowledges that

change is complex. Transformation

is about more than accelerating

the adoption of digital solutions.

In fact, speed and growth are not

synonymous. A visionary enterprise

needs velocity, which translates to

speed with clear direction. When a

business is thinking velocity, it can

be both nimble and precise, applying

speed with direction to create tangible,

effective results.

Focusing on the future: Our

enterprise velocity survey

As a part of our Think Velocity

brand relaunch, we conducted our

inaugural Enterprise Velocity Survey,

capturing the thoughts of more than

300 business leaders of some of

the best-recognized global brands

across industries and geographies.

The findings show that many leaders

(97% of respondents) are thinking

proactively in terms of velocity. They

recognize that transformation requires

more than quickly identifying and

Corporate Overview

Board of Directors / Leadership Team:

letter and

spirit

We are a people-first organization,

and in this regard, we take an

all-inclusive approach toward

our efforts to ensure security

of all our infrastructure assets

and safety of employees. The

office infrastructure, equipment,

information resources, computer

systems, network resources,

and human assets are of vital

importance to us.

It is imperative that effective and

efficient security procedures are

followed within the Company’s

facilities, and in its operations

to ensure that information and

resources are available to only

users, who require them.

At Zensar, we have deployed

‘ZenWelcome,’ a visitor

management system that provides

restricted and card-based access

pass to office premises.

We continuously monitor our

premises via CCTVs and track

authorized movement of employees

and visitors inside the building

premises and entry/exit points,

including the emergency exits.

COVID-19 protocols and other

relevant procedures are strictly

followed at all Zensar campuses.

Our employees and external

visitors are briefed to follow

COVID-19 appropriate behavior

when in office premises, and

full vaccination (both doses) is

mandatory to gain access inside

the premises. Temperature checks

and hand sanitization facilities are

maintained at entry points and all

common locations.

With increasing demand for talent

and the need for improvement in

fulfilment, we have chosen our

satellite centers as one of the key

measures to accomplish our skill

and resource requirements. This

approach has been influenced

by the acceptance of work from

anywhere (WFA) as a viable

sourcing option.

Our satellite office in Kolkata is a

pioneering step in this direction.

Apart from being the biggest IT Hub

in the eastern region of India, Kolkata

is home to renowned educational

institutions and universities,

providing access to a large pool of

quality human resources.

The presence of around 500 IT and

ITeS companies operating in the

state, along with the support of the

State Government are key drivers

for the selection of Kolkata for our

first satellite office.

Moreover, Kolkata has one of the

lowest attrition rates across all

metros, and the availability of talent

Enhancing overall

productivity and

performance

is consistent with our demand

identified in the areas of core

engineering, data management,

analytics, and testing.

The office is housed in an Indian

Green Building Council (IGBC)

Platinum-rated green building

and has all adequate facilities,

including parking. We undertake

adequate initiatives for waste,

water, and energy management.

The building complies with NBC

2005 for planning and adheres to

all conditions set by the SPCB. It

also implements the 3Rs (reduce,

reuse, and recycle) policy in

diverse ways.

CEO and: Managing

Managing Director

and Chief Executive Officer, with representation from

relevant functions within the organisation and from global

regions through the formation of Emergency Response

teams. These Emergency Response Teams have now

partnered with Delivery and Business enabling functions

to implement Return to Office (RTO) plans, which include

location preparation and team segregation to allow a

phased re-opening of workplaces, to aid associates in

getting back to office in the “new normal”. In preparation

for our RTO efforts, Zensar aims to have only a 100%

vaccinated workforce working from premises.

Seating and desks in Delivery Centres are sanitised

regularly and seating plans are designed in such a manner

to maintain social distancing between associates. To

address specific customer and project requirements

and associate availability, managers have been provided

with the flexibility to decide the schedule for their team

members. In this process of RTO, it is ensured that

Customer service continuity and quality of service is

maintained at highest standards.

Special Note- Emerging Risks

Geo-Political Conflict Risk

In view of geo-political unrest in some regions, we at

Zensar have been cognizant of the potential risks and

the importance of customer service continuity. We have

assessed and hardened our financial and cyber-security

controls considering potential increased risks arising

from such developments.

As a multinational company, we do have delivery

capabilities from not only India, but several European

countries (e.g., Poland, Austria, Germany), the United

States, South Africa, Columbia, Canada and Mexico.

Hence, we will have flexibility to accommodate movement

of work to remain compliant with applicable laws and

sanctions regimes. With the understanding that such

conflict is unpredictable, our senior management and

special response team proactively continue to monitor

related legal, and compliance matters to mitigate risk

and to ensure business continuity.
