DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

I WRITE TO YOU AT A TIME WHEN

MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS. ON THE

BACK OF SUCCESSIVE WAVES OF THE

PANDEMIC, COMES THE FALLOUT

OF A PROTRACTED WAR IN EUROPE

THAT HAS THROWN SUPPLY CHAINS

OUT OF GEAR AND SENT RIPPLES

ACROSS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

IT SPEAKS OF OUR ORGANIZATION’S

INNATE RESILIENCE THAT WE HAVE

BEEN ABLE TO FACE UP TO THESE

CHALLENGES WHILE SUSTAINING

BUSINESS CONTINUITY.

YOUR COMPANY’S

INNOVATION-LED R&D

FOCUS AND THE ABILITY

TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS

EMERGING CUSTOMER

DEMAND IN AN AGILE AND

INNOVATIVE MANNER HAS

REAFFIRMED ITS LEADERSHIP

IN THE GLOBAL ER&D SPACE.

Managing Director’s Message: DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

THESE ARE EXCITING TIMES.

DESPITE SOME MAJOR HEADWINDS,

WE ARE WITNESSING A SURFEIT

OF OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE

WORLDWIDE TECHNOLOGY

LANDSCAPE. I AM SURE THAT YOU

WILL CONTINUE TO REPOSE YOUR

FAITH IN LTTS AS WE ENGINEER

SUSTAINABLE GROWTH JOURNEYS FOR

THE BENEFIT OF OUR CUSTOMERS,

SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AND ALL

KEY STAKEHOLDERS.

Over the last fiscal, LTTS has maintained and strengthened

its leadership of the global ER&D space. As the industry

bellwether in India, we have expanded and deepened the

range of our activities across existing industry verticals, and

are exploring new technology areas, including the exciting

domain of the Metaverse.

I feel that when combined with our core innovation

capabilities and Engineering DNA, these emerging

technologies will prove to be a major driver for our continued

success as an organization. Our belief in a technology-driven

future is reaffirmed in our Six Big Bets – Electric Autonomous

and Connected Vehicles, 5G, AI and Digital Products, Digital

Manufacturing, MedTech, and Sustainability. Each of these

strategic growth areas have helped shape and consolidate

our focus over the past year, enabling us to deliver profitable,

sustainable, and inclusive growth.

Our technology-led vision, combined with by our

“Six-Dimensional Glide Path” framework, has helped LTTS

build on its successes and prepare for the future.

Industry Leading Growth: Transforming ER&D

Paradigms

We delivered a strong performance with revenues increasing

by 20% in constant currency terms to $ 880 million in FY22.

The growth was broad-based with all five segments growing in

double-digits. Operational performance also showed an equally

strong improvement with EBIT margin increasing to 18.3%

in FY22 versus 14.5% in FY21. Together, this led to a 44%

increase in PAT to ` 9,570 million.

The LTTS Board declared a final dividend of ` 15.0 per share,

which is in addition to one special and one interim dividend

of ` 10 per share each, totals to ` 35 per share for FY22,

implying a dividend pay-out ratio of 39% for the year.

As the worldwide prospects for the ER&D industry continues

to exhibit a robust upward trajectory, our strategy of

6 Dimensions and 6 Big Bets continues to deliver impressive

results. I feel that this is an opportune moment to continue

to outshine our past performance, with market outlook

looking better than ever.

Managing Director’s Message

Technology Quotient: Redefining the Landscape

At the start of the FY, we announced our six Big Bets.

Each of these strategic growth areas were the focus of

targeted technology investments during the year – both

in terms of new infrastructure and talent – helping deliver

industry-leading growth across the board. Our results for the

fiscal validate the potential of the emerging technologies

space, a trend that will only strengthen with time.

Your Company remains committed towards driving a culture

which encourages learning, ideation, experimentation, and

solutioning. This can be witnessed in our portfolio of 868

patents, an impressive 33% jump during the year. We are

promoting and expanding on this focus on driving innovation

across the organization as LTTS moves towards strengthening

its position in the global technology landscape.

We recently concluded TECHgium®, our flagship

open-innovation program for engineering students.

Designed to promote nationwide engineering talent

and knowledge, it received a record participation from

over 30,000 students from across 444 premier institutes.

The vibrant enthusiasm our young engineering students, who

presented stellar innovations across our Big Bet technology

domains, once again reaffirms my faith in our ability to

engineer sustainable growth leveraging technology

and talent.

Customer Centricity: Delivering Unprecedented

Success Journeys

Customer centricity continues to be a guiding light, and we

are constantly evaluating our delivery and quality parameters

for identifying and leveraging new areas of improvement.

At LTTS, our focus remains on gathering regular periodic

feedback from our customers and taking the improvement

measures to drive the next frontiers of customer delight.

Our deep engagement paradigms and focused

multi-geography engagement measures have helped us

strengthen, deepen, and expand our global partnerships,

translating into several marquee deal wins. The $ 100 million

e-VTOL aircraft project and the $ 45 million EV engagement

are some instances of the robust customer relationships that

we have developed and continue to nurture over the years.

With travel opening up and our customers increasingly

willing to meet in person, we have reinitiated in-person

contacts with our customers across geographies. All relevant

safety and health measures are being followed in each of

these cross-continent meetings as the world achieves a return

to pre-pandemic normalcy. I remain confident that we will

continue to drive and strengthen our customer-centric vision

with every passing day.

People Engagement: Driving Talent

Transformation Journeys

During the year, we undertook a major exercise involving

a redefinition of our outlook through a revitalized Vision,

Mission, and Value Statement. The journey is a testament

to our commitment towards the continued success of our

people as we grow as an organization – “engineering a

sustainable tomorrow through technology and innovation.”

We have initiated the creation of Value Walls across our

centers, each one reflecting the inherent spirit of creativity of

our employees.

‘Rendezvous,’ another key engagement and transformation

initiative during the year involved five volunteer teams under

the personal direction of a senior LTTS leader. The teams

worked tirelessly in addition to their existing responsibilities

to redefine the workplace and incorporate the expectations

of our employees. I am grateful for the commitment shown

by these teams in helping us build the LTTS of the future.

We are committed to continue developing LTTS as a great

workplace. Our evolving work paradigms and all-round

support for delivering enhanced outcomes even during

the pandemic bear testimony to our vision for driving a

transformative people engagement paradigm. This has

been recognized across several leading industry forums and

panels, who have applauded our efforts and initiatives in this

direction.

LTTS continues to undertake several measures to further

strengthen the foundations of our people-driven growth

trajectory, expanding to over 20,000 employees at the close

of the fiscal. This has involved onboarding about 3,000

fresher engineers from across premier institutes in the

country, and I am happy to welcome them to the LTTS family.

Sustainable Operating Model: Leveraging our

Core Strengths

To deliver on our promise of a sustainable operating model

that can transform our business paradigm and ensure

industry-leading growth, we need to ensure the right balance

of talent and skillsets across the organization.

In this direction, our Global Engineering Academy (GEA)

has made its mark as an integral enabler of our engineer

fraternity. The GEA, a one-of-its-kind initiative, is engaged in

training and equipping our young workforce with the latest
