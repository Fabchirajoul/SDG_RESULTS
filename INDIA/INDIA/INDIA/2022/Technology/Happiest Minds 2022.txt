Annual Report 2021-22

Dear Stakeholders:

We hope you are doing well and keeping safe.

It’s been a little over two years since the outbreak of COVID and through this

time each one of us has been directly or indirectly affected. But, with vaccines

and a better understanding of how to handle it, we have emerged stronger

and resilient. It is our hope that the ensuing times bring in good health and

prosperity to all.

Executive Board’s: Letter

Joseph Anantharaju

Executive Vice

letter in the

Annual Report 2020-21, during the

pandemic, three technology themes

had evolved: People Centricity, Location

Independence, and Resilient Delivery.

These three continue to be at the core of

discussion for business users, decision

makers and CXOs. While certain aspects

of these themes have been mastered,

enterprises continue to try, evaluate,

test, and deploy technology solutions

that can meet and enhance the needs of

their teams, customers and stakeholders.

This provides a long runway for Happiest

Minds to partner with its customers

in

their

strategic

digital

roadmap.

Today, Internet of behavior, Distributed

Cloud & AI Engineering continue to

evolve and are still work-in-progress for

many enterprises.

We foresee that enterprises will have

three strategic imperatives to focus on –

Growth, Digitization and Efficiency

1. Growth

Leveraging

technology

trends

to

maximize value and create IT force

multipliers

to

win

business

and

market share by

a. Enhanced People Engagement: The

world in the foreseeable future will

be hybrid and remote working must

be enabled for more use cases

like real-time collaboration, AR /

VR and metaverse. Delivery model

must be reconfigured to embrace

distributed services

b. Enhanced Customer Engagement:

Combining Customer Experience

(CX),

Employee

Experience

(EX),

User

Experience

(UX)

and

Multi-experience

(MX)

to

drive

greater

customer

and

team

confidence,

satisfaction,

loyalty, and advocacy

c. Implementing

self-managing

physical or software systems that

learn from their environments

and can dynamically modify their

own algorithms to adapt to new

conditions in the field like humans

d. Developing

systems

and

applications

that

learn

about

objects or content by analyzing

their

data

and

using

it

for

creating realistic, original, and

brand-new artefacts

2. Digitization

IT and business staff as a team-in-

fusion collaborate and drive innovation

to rapidly digitize business by

a. Composable

Application

architecture

which

allows

implementing new features up

to 80% faster which reduces risk

of losing market momentum and

customer loyalty significantly

b. Implementing Decision Intelligence

architecture to understand and

engineer how decisions are made

c. Rapidly

identifying,

vetting,

and

automating

as

many

processes as possible

d. An

integrated

approach

for

operationalizing AI models to

generate three times more value

from AI efforts

We foresee that

enterprises will have three

strategic imperatives

to focus on – Growth,

Digitization and Efficiency

Dear Stakeholders,

The disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in FY 2020-21

augmented multiple challenges across the world. Happiest Minds’

mission of making our people and customers happiest, enabled

us to not only limit the extent of disruption in our operations, but

also support the communities we operate in. We quickly adapted

to newer ways of working and pioneered innovative solutions

for our customers, employees, and communities. Our resolve

to emerge stronger by improving our market, operational and

financial performance made us realize a remarkable IPO in

September 2020. We have demonstrated continuous and

industry-leading Y-o-Y sequential revenue growth over each

quarter in FY 2021-22.

This report elaborates

our approach, and the

value Happiest Minds

has delivered across the

continents, even during

these unprecedented

disruptive times.

Message from the President

We quickly adapted to newer ways

of working and pioneered innovative

solutions for our customers, our teams,

and our communities.

With respect to the License Agreement entered in June 2018 between the Company and a customer, for providing software

services, the customer terminated the agreement claiming non-satisfactory delivery of services and damages of ` 623 Lacs.

The customer has also initiated arbitration proceedings which the Parent Company is currently contesting and is of the view

that the claim is not tenable and accordingly no adjustments are made in the financial statements.

c)

There are numerous interpretative issues relating to the Supreme Court (SC) judgement on PF dated February 28, 2019.

The Group will update its provision, if any, required, on receiving further clarity on the subject.

d)

The Group is also subject to certain other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary conduct of its business.

While the Group currently believes that such claims, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on

its financial position, cash flows, or results of operations, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties,

and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. Were an unfavourable final outcome to occur in any one

or more of these matters, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, reputation, financial

condition, cash flows, and results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable.

letter dated February 1, 2022 citing no contravention

of Section 67(3).

b)

With respect to the License Agreement entered in June 2018 between the Company and a customer, for providing

software services, the customer terminated the agreement claiming non-satisfactory delivery of services and

damages of ` 623 Lacs. The customer has also initiated arbitration proceedings which is the Company is currently

contesting and is of the view that no that claim is not tenable and accordingly no adjustments are made in the

financial statements.

c)

There are numerous interpretative issues relating to the Supreme Court (SC) judgement on PF dated February 28,

2019. As a matter of caution, the Group has taken cognizance of the matter on a prospective basis from the date of

the SC order. The Group will update its provision, if any, required, on receiving further clarity on the subject.

d)

The Company is also subject to certain other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary conduct

of its business. While the Company currently believes that such claims, individually or in aggregate, will not have a

material adverse impact on its financial position, cash flows, or results of operations, the litigation and other claims

are subject to inherent uncertainties, and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. Were an

unfavourable final outcome to occur in any one or more of these matters, there exists the possibility of a material

adverse impact on the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations for

the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable.
