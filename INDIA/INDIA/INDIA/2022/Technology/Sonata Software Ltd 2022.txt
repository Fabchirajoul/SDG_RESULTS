Trainings and Workshops

Sonata - GBW announced the launch of their new initiative – ‘The

Year of Wellbeing 2022’ to bring awareness about wellbeing and

mental health to employees. There was a need to connect better

and learn from each other to counter the massive shift in work-

place culture and isolation that the pandemic brought in its wake.

The year-long program will have sessions covering physical fitness,

mental health, stress management, mediation and mindfulness.

Huge number of Sonatians are investing time in upskilling and

training. We had over 2000 Sonatians completing the BCI on LMS

and over 40 managers taking the FLEX modules. NASSCOM’s

FutureSkills Prime aims to give access to the latest skills in the

industry to create digitally skilled future ready work force. The

courses are curated by technology evangelists and industry experts.

Going forward, our L&D teams will work on further curating these

to our specific needs.

The Sonata-GBW Christmas & EOY Virtual Celebration event

brought together participants across our regional offices. Service

Recognition Awards were given out and some fun activities were

planned alongside.

This year, we welcome double the number of freshers from

campuses, across all competencies. Over 300 freshers went

through a power- packed training for three months developing

their skills on full stack.

Sonata’s internal Digital Learning Management System has made

it possible for all to upskill anywhere, anytime. Proud to have over

75% Sonatians accessing around 640 courses, curated learning

journeys, as per the needs of the competencies. Our Digital Unified

Program is an initiative to build & develop Digital talent across all

roles in the company to improve flexibility / fungibility of talent.

Projects have appreciated the outcome of the program and are

able to use talent optimally.

Virtual events, all-hands meets and on-boarding continued

in FY2021-22 in our endeavor to keep the teams aligned and

engaged. Virtual all-hands provided scope for sharing business

updates and celebrate employee achievements & milestones.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES (CSR)

We remain committed to our support to our sustainability

partners in order for them to meet their goals. We believe that

all sustainable goals are integrated. Action in one area will affect

outcomes in others, development must balance social, economic

and environmental sustainability.

Sense International India (also known as Sense India) is the

only national-level organization supporting needs-based

services which help children and adults with deafness/

blindness to overcome their challenges. Sonata pledges

support to Sense India's noble objective. Proud to have our

teams help in building their website and amplifying outreach.

Sonata partnered with Disom - The Leadership School'

program under FMRA (Friends of Moral Re-Armament) to

improve Leadership among the Rural communities who

hail from economically, socially and politically marginalized

backgrounds that involves extensive travel for a truly

immersive and experiential learning. The cohort, along with

the core team, would be undertaking the travel and this has

helped them to explore many places, and meet people with
