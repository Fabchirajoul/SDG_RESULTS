OUTLOOK

The rapidly changing environment that was the backdrop to many world events in the past couple of years, continues to remain so event

at present. In these two years of the global pandemic, the world has witnessed the consequences of the most widely shared economic

crisis on record and a robust recovery the very next year, marking the highest growth rate in more than four decades according to the

UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects 2022 report. With the emergence of new COVID variants across the globe becoming

a routine, it is heartening that modern medicine, vaccinations and technology have largely helped to decouple and mitigate the link

between mobility and economic growth. While the road to complete economic recovery remains fragile, people and organizations have

adapted to life with the virus, bolstered by the effectiveness of vaccines with ease of living and technology enabled working, resulting

in more resilient economies. While we can expect economies to shift from stimulus spending and policy supports, potentially resulting

in a slower pace for global growth in 2022, a recent report from McKinsey however suggests that the growth will still be faster than the

pre-pandemic levels.

As we step into the third year of the pandemic, the urgent priorities for organizations have seen a marked shift. While 2020 was the year

of adapting to the ‘new normal’ and 2021 was seeking crisis-led opportunities, today, most enterprises are navigating persistent labor

market and supply-chain challenges in the technology decade or ‘techade’ they find themselves in. According to McKinsey, 2022 will

witness more “enterprises capitalizing on sophisticated provider offerings, including customized industry solutions and advances in

digital technology, such as AI, analytics and machine learning.” This analysis is echoed by NASSCOM’s latest report which states that

while enterprises focused on short-term digital transformation projects that had to be implemented rapidly in 2020, the focus in 2021

and beyond has been on larger initiatives with longer time frames while investing in emerging technology segments. It has become

increasingly clear that all businesses will have to reinvent themselves as digital-first businesses to survive in the new world.

The new realities of this world have led to a recalibration and reimagining of your Company’s purpose in the world – To be the Driver

in the Driverless car – where next-gen design, architecture and engineering services deliver scalable and sustainable software and

technology solutions to global enterprises. From this reinvigorated purpose, your Company has renewed its commitment to nurture

and empower employees by fostering a Hi-Tech, Hi-Touch and Hi-Trust environment as part of Mphasis’ value proposition to all of

its stakeholders. The pandemic has more than ever before cast a spotlight on the importance of growth in a sustainable way which is

fundamental to our strategy. With the global pandemic enhancing our role as a leading technology partner, our responsibility of being a

committed corporate citizen, required us to further our formal Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) journey.

Having made strategic bets in next-gen technologies early on, your Company was able to capitalize on the maturity of these investments

to seek out crisis-led opportunities when it mattered the most. Through the pandemic, your Company remained agile, quick to adapt

and willing to go the extra mile for its clients and other stakeholders. With your Company’s help, enterprises were able to accelerate their

digital journeys thereby cementing Mphasis’ position as a preferred technology partner for many clients. As enterprises accelerate the

adoption of digital business and seek more direct digital routes to connect with their customers, the industry’s future growth will be driven

by three factors - growth of the tech services market, shift toward a subscription model of consumption and tech spends originating from

new areas. This has resulted in a tech investing super cycle which is likely to last for the next three to five years. Acceleration in tech

adoption is a great tailwind, but it brings with it a higher risk of obsolescence. For your Company, however, it represents an opportunity

to engineer a better future by partnering with enterprises and enabling all stakeholders to move forward together.
