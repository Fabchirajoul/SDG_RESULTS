Managing Director & CEO, is

the chair of the CSR Committee and is responsible

for the integration of sustainability and climate

risks and opportunities into the overall corporate

strategy. He reviews the performance, progress

and implementation of Sustainability policies and

initiatives and briefs the Committee on Sustainability

and climate-related agenda, issues, and performance

of the Company. In coordination with the Sustainability

Council, he reviews the inclusion and disclosure of all

material topics in the report.

Tech Mahindra Sustainability Council includes the

CFO, CPO, CSO, and Heads of Legal and Corporate

Services. They formulate the Sustainability vision,

strategy, and plan of action in alignment with the

Sustainability Charter and Roadmap of the Company.

They review progress on the Company’s sustainability

and climate change agenda each quarter and

approve the annual budget and expenditure. They

ensure that we remain configured to the sustainability

charter and comply with applicable regulations,

voluntary standards and norms and performance

in relevant aspects of sustainability. They are the

decision-makers who can influence the permeation of

our sustainability agenda within the organisation.

Mr. Sandeep Chandna, the Chief Sustainability

Officer (CSO), is responsible for the overall

implementation of the sustainability and climate

change strategy and initiatives and also for

developing budgets and plans for sustainability and

climate change. He reports to the: Managing

Managing Director

and Chief Executive Officer. The team interfaces with

account management, finance and the quality teams

actively to get customer-level inputs. Internally, there

are well-defined teams to drive each of the key focus

areas of the customer-centricity office. Customer

satisfaction metrics are used to identify detractors

as well as passive customers, for which root cause

analysis is performed to develop specific action plans

for such accounts. Account performance metrics from

delivery teams and finance are used to identify the

right interventions for account escalations where the

CCO partners with all stakeholders for rapid closure.

One of the primary functions of the customer-

centricity office is to manage customer escalations

from across touchpoints, to then identify and ensure

that critical cases are expedited through appropriate

channels. We use a four-level categorisation

mechanism to rate and channel escalations. The first

two levels are generally resolved by the business unit,

with the ability to involve the CCO if required. In the

event of delays, the CCO proactively gets involved to

aid the faster resolution. CCO tracks the high priority

customer escalations to closure.

The CCO interfaces with customers or account

managers to assure them about the escalation

and develop specific action plans, with all service

delivery stakeholders. Customers’ buy-in is taken

and modifications are made as appropriate and

then tracked across milestones to ensure the

execution of the action plan. The key takeaway from

each escalation in terms of learning and the

requisite adaptations are made systematically

across all accounts.

The CCO team tracks milestones and ensures the execution of the action plan.

33 CODE OF SOCIAL SECURITY, 2020

The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits received the Presidential assent

in September 2020. The effective date from which the changes are applicable is yet to be notified. The

Company will evaluate and will give appropriate impact in the financial statements in the period in which the

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited

letter dated January 7, 2009 Mr. B. Ramalinga Raju, the then Chairman of erstwhile Satyam,

stated that the Balance Sheet of erstwhile Satyam as at September 30, 2008 carried inflated cash

and bank balances, non-existent accrued interest, an understated liability and an overstated

debtors position. Consequently, various regulators/investigating agencies such as the Serious Fraud

Investigation Office (‘SFIO’)/Registrar of Companies (‘ROC’), Directorate of Enforcement (‘ED’),

Central Bureau of Investigation (‘CBI’) had initiated investigations on various matters and conducted

inspections and issued notices calling for information including from certain subsidiaries which have

been responded to.

In 2009, SFIO initiated two proceedings against erstwhile Satyam for violations of Companies Act,

1956, which were compounded.

Further, ED issued show-cause notices for certain non-compliances of provisions of the Foreign

Exchange Management Act, 1999 (‘FEMA’) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Realisation,

Repatriation and Surrender of Foreign Exchange) Regulations, 2000 by the erstwhile Satyam.

These pertained to

a)

alleged non-repatriation of American Depository Receipts (‘ADR’) proceeds aggregating to USD

39.2 Million; and

b)

non-realisation and repatriation of export proceeds to the extent of foreign exchange equivalent

to ` 506 Million for invoices raised during the period from July 1997 to December 31, 2002.

These have been responded to by the erstwhile Satyam/the Company, the Company has not

received any further communication in this regard and with the passage of time, the Company

does not expect any further proceedings in this regard.

As per the assessment of the Management, based on the forensic investigation and the information

available, all identified/required adjustments/disclosures arising from the identified financial

irregularities, were made in the financial statements of erstwhile Satyam as at March 31, 2009.

Considerable time has elapsed after the initiation of investigation by various regulators/agencies

and no new information has come to the Management’s notice which requires adjustments to

the financial statements. Further, as per above, the investigations have been completed and no

new claims have been received which need any further evaluation/adjustment/disclosure in the

books of account.

B.

Proceedings in relation to ‘Alleged Advances’

Erstwhile Satyam had, in the past, received letters from 37 companies seeking confirmation by way

of acknowledgement of receipt of certain alleged amounts by the erstwhile Satyam (referred to as

‘alleged advances’). These letters were followed with legal notices claiming repayment of the alleged

advances aggregating to ` 12,304 Million together with damages/compensation @ 18% per annum

till the date of repayment. The erstwhile Satyam had not acknowledged any liability and replied to the

legal notices stating that the claims are not legally tenable.

Subsequently, the 37 companies filed petitions for recovery against the erstwhile Satyam before the

City Civil Court, Secunderabad (Court), of which one petition has been converted into suit and balance

36 petitions are at various stages of pauperism/suit admission.

The Hon’ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh in its Order approving the merger of the erstwhile

Satyam with the Company, held that in the absence of Board resolutions and documents evidencing

acceptance of unsecured loans, i.e. alleged advances, by the former Management of the erstwhile

The Group has identified business segments as reportable segments. Accordingly, Information Technology (IT) Business

and Business Processing Outsourcing (BPO) has been disclosed as business segments. Geographical information on

revenue and business segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to

which the revenue is otherwise recognized.

Segregation of assets (except trade and other receivables), liabilities, depreciation and other non-cash expenses into

various business segments has not been done as the assets are used interchangeably between segments and the

Company is of the view that it is not practical to reasonably allocate liabilities and other non-cash expenses to individual

segments as the same will not be meaningful.

Information on reportable segments for the year ended March 31, 2021 along with comparatives is given below:

Managing Director: Managing

Managing Director (management) are responsible for the information in the Board of Directors’

report. The other information comprises information in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our

auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the information in the Board of Directors’ report.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Board of Directors’ report. The purpose

is to consider if there is material inconsistency between the Board of Directors’ report and the financial statements or our

knowledge obtained in the audit, or whether the Board of Directors’ report otherwise appears to be materially misstated. We are

required to report if there is a material misstatement in the Board of Directors’ report. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Based on our knowledge obtained in the audit, it is our opinion that the Board of Directors’ report

•

is consistent with the financial statements and

•

contains the information required by applicable legal requirements.

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the

Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for such internal

control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going

concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements use the going concern basis of

accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance

is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a

material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually

or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these

financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout

the audit. We also:

•

identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design

and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to

provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one

resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of

internal control.
