and diverse set of customers. Make technology available

faster, more efficiently and in a highly optimised value chain to

reduce or eliminate technology friction. We value the power of

partnerships immensely to bring meaningful and sustainable

digital shifts that offer quick response to dynamic market

changes, deliver better customer experiences, and improve

operational efficiency.

It is perhaps in order to mention that business growth has

been largely investment and consumption led. Governments

and private corporates across the world have been making

significant investments towards infrastructure development

and implementing automation to ensure that they are

optimised and have a competitive advantage. Most of these

technology investments have been in data centre, cloud,

subscriptions, applications like ERP and CRM, customer

experience, sales automation, customer analytics and cyber

security among others. Going forward, we expect to witness

further investments in new-age technologies, such as Artificial

Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Internet of

Things (IoT), Robotics and 5G-based applications.

At the same time we have observed significant shifts in what

customers buy, where they buy from and how. So a pretty

profound shift in buying behaviour. Now customers research

on-line and buy off-line and vice versa. This is a true omni-

channel world where we have to trace the discontinuous

journeys of customers and it puts a premium on digital sales

channels. Another shift is that instead of paying for products

and services upfront as a capital cost they have transitioned

to subscription based purchases. It allows them to use the

product or service for the duration of their requirements

without having to worry about perpetual ownership and costs.

Aware of these dynamic realities, we have strategically

focused on transforming our business model from traditional

to a flexible, customer choice model. While our transformation

journey began pre-Covid, the implementation has definitely

been catalysed by the pandemic-induced challenges.

Our omni-channel approach allows us to cater to the

evolving customer preferences. In the coming times, we will

continue to focus on integrating new-age technology with

improved tracking analytics to ensure a better understanding

of consumer behaviour patterns. Our efforts to leverage global

capabilities and operating as One Redington will help establish

thought leadership, build consistent best practices, share

talent and improve efficiency for break out success in every

one of our locations.

It is with great responsibility that I share with you that we have

embedded sustainability as a strong pillar of our strategic

go forward approach. We are sharpening our Environment,

Social and Governance (ESG) practices across functions

guided by global best practices and our Board of Directors.

Our commitment to sustainability and our social conscience is

at the core of our actions and decisions as we move towards

achieving the ambitious targets we have set for ourselves.

Your support and encouragement are critical to your

company’s success. The Board and the executive leadership

recognize their responsibility towards delivering value for

your investment in us. I feel privileged to report that your

Board has recommended a total Dividend pay-out of 40.30%

of consolidated profits amounting to Rs.6.60/- per share.

I wish to express my appreciation for the support that we

continue to receive from our banking and financial community.

You are an important stakeholder in our continued success.

Our Auditors provide us with invaluable advice and I thank

them for their support.

Our diversified and highly experienced Board of Directors

are a source of great strength for us and I deeply appreciate

the collaboration and guidance that I receive from the richly

qualified and knowledgeable members of our Board. On

behalf of my Board and my team members, I wish to thank

you, our shareholders and all other stakeholders, for the

trust and confidence that you continue to repose in us.

I would also like to express my gratitude and appreciation

towards Mr. Raj Shankar, former Vice Chairman and Managing

Director, for his effective stewardship of the Redington Group

over the past decade. His tireless efforts in building a strong

and capable Redington will hold us in good stead.

We are in the midst of Shaping Our Future to become a most

admired organisation in the world. An organisation that is built

on excellent capability, great culture and authenticity. By all

counts it promises to be an exciting, meaningful and fulfilling

journey for each of our stakeholders.

On the back of an extremely successful past, we are just

getting started!

Best wishes,

Rajiv Srivastava: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

Let me take a moment to express my deep gratitude, on

behalf of the Redington India team, to our shareholders,

channel partners, brand partners, customers and the larger

ecosystem for your continued support during the recent

challenging times. We are privileged to have your association

and take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to your

long-term growth.

The previous year FY21 saw us deliver on our performance

despite major headwinds brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The pandemic continued to unleash uncertainties during FY22

and ushered a time of great humanitarian crisis in the early

part of the year. The learnings of FY21 proved pivotal at this

time, as we leveraged the strong support of our stakeholder

ecosystem and limited the impact on business continuity in

FY22. However, the combination of Covid and other geopolitical

events resulted in severe supply constraints across categories

and created an uncertain business environment through

the year.

On the other hand, continued thrust on digitalisation, cloud

adoption and mainstreaming of Work-from-Home and

Learn-from-Home were significant demand-side tailwinds

for many of our verticals.

In this scenario, we consolidated on our FY21 performance to

deliver exceptional growth in both revenue and profitability

in FY22. Significantly, the growth was powered by

businesses cutting across Consumer, Enterprise, and Solar

verticals. We have leveraged our business diversity and the

opportunities, to manage growth and business cycles well.

The linearity in business is a testament to the overall discipline,

hygiene, and high level of engagement of every Redingtonian in

the business.

We witnessed several key business drivers being aligned

to our advantage in FY22. These include upswing in

demand for Consumer PCs in H1 and Commercial PCs in H2

of FY22, investment-led demand for Enterprise Infrastructure,

the broader shift in IT spends towards Capex-to-Opex /

as-a-Service driving demand for Cloud and demand for

renewable energy, among others.

These broader trends were well capitalized to deliver a

consecutive year of robust Revenue growth of 19% and a

PAT growth of 100% for the year for the India business.

These results are the reflection of several initiatives underway

at Redington. Significant among these is the capacity building

in the organisation. We continue the thrust on building

capabilities and skill sets and augmenting our resources and

leadership team. We are proud to have on board senior leaders

who bring a wealth of expertise, experience, and relationships

across the ecosystem.

The year also saw significant strides on the Digital

Transformation initiative at Redington. The launch of our

Digital Platform is the gateway to many exciting opportunities

for partnerships and value building for our channel and

brand partners.

As part of our capacity building and streamlining of

operations, we have invested in a centralised shared

services infrastructure, the Centre of Excellence, bringing

together best practices and world-class technologies.

This initiative would bring about greater resource alignment

with business outcomes for our customers, channel partners

and brand partners.

The year also saw us leverage the strengths and best

practices of Redington’s global organisation. The launch of

CloudQuarks – the Cloud Management Portal – in India reflects

this approach.

As we step into a new growth phase, we are confident of the

partnerships, the capabilities, and the initiatives that we have

put in place. The opportunities and the possible new business

models promise an exciting journey for Redington and all our

stakeholders in the years ahead.

I thank you again for your continued patronage and wish you

the best.

Redington (India) Limited | Annual Report 2021-22:

Dear Shareholders,

It was the year 2000 when Redington established itself across

Middle East and Africa and since then, we have built a robust

engine to facilitate seamless technology adoption across

emerging economies in the region. As of FY22, we were

directly present in 22 emerging economies across Middle East

Africa with a team of over 1900+ professionals comprising

32 nationalities. We also have strong partnerships that

represent the end-to-end of the technology ecosystem.

Our presence in the Middle East and Africa region comes

with its own set of challenges. Besides global issues such as

Covid-19 and supply constraints, we also faced currency risks

where some currencies devalued significantly in the region.

Despite the challenges, we delivered a growth of 6% with

the highest ever growth in profits. Our efforts to establish

ourselves as the preferred partner has won us recognition

from the various brands distributed by us. While we continue

to be the leading distributor for PCs, our growth in Cloud

technology has been positive.

The progress we have made is the result of our committed

teams. As always, we continue to focus on driving engagement

and promoting an environment that is conducive to our

people’s well-being. It gives me great pleasure to share that

Redington has been rated as ‘Great Place to Work for 2022’.

FY23 presents a wide headroom for growth as innovation in

tech continues to evolve . Our mission is to bring technology to

the world seamlessly. While on the consumer side, we sense

headwinds with rise in food and fuel prices driving prices

down and leading to a decline in demand, in the enterprise and

commercial side, we see more enterprises moving to the cloud,

and cyber security requirements driving more spends.

We are building capabilities to address the changing consumer

and evolving enterprise technology requirements. We will

optimise our existing infrastructure across Middle East and

Africa to drive growth from emerging and mature categories.

We see more channel partners using our digital platform

for their business. Also, our cloud delivery and management

platform for partners and customers, CloudQuarks, will

continue to help drive growth in our cloud business.

The African continent is expected to have 72 cities with over

1 million people and 3 megacities by 2025 .We have been

present in parts of Africa since 2007 and, we believe, it’s the

right time to scale our presence across more countries in the

region. We will evaluate both organic and inorganic strategies

for expansion considering macro-economic trends and the

flexibility available to operate.

We are also organising ourselves better to change with the

changing market requirements. There are various initiatives

being conducted within the organisation to drive internal

efficiencies and promote data-driven decision making. We will

be implementing various programs for attracting, retaining

and nurturing talent across the region.

Overall, we are aligned to the different market dynamics in

the region and are continuously evolving as the technology

landscape evolves in different parts of the region, where we

are present. We are excited to leverage the opportunities

ahead of us as we look forward to another great year for

Redington in Middle East and Africa.

Redington (India) Limited | Annual Report 2021-22:

Dear Shareholders,

Technological development has always accelerated throughout

the known history of humanity and has been the pioneer of

social development. The technological development we have

experienced in the last 20 years has occurred much faster than

the development experienced throughout the history of the

world and in a way that affects our lives much more deeply.

Especially in the last two years, together with Pandemic,

we have witnessed unbelievable speed of the digitalization

of our lives and transformation of our world to a Digital

New World.

Digital lifestyles have become our daily reality in every

aspect of our lives, whether business, private or social. It is

an obvious fact that this change will continue to accelerate

with the further development of 5G, artificial intelligence, IoT

and similar technologies in the coming periods. It is obviously

creating lots of new opportunities and growth areas for

your company.

The concept of Digitalization of Life emerges when many

technologies work together and in mutual interaction. IoT and

Automation Systems, Mega Data and Artificial Intelligence

Systems, Cloud Based Technology Solutions, mobile network

solutions that connect them all, and young minds who bring all

these technologies together and adapt them as digital solutions

to different areas of life.

Since our establishment as Arena in 1991, we have undertaken

the task of bringing all technology products and solutions that

Turkey needs to our country and distributing them together

with our business partners, while on the other hand, with

the innovations we have implemented such as Bulutum.com,

Paynet FinTech, IoT & Automation Solutions and the intellectual

leadership we have assumed. We believe that we have made a

significant contribution to Turkey’s technological development.

In FY22, as Arena, we have acquired a value-added distributor

for smartphone and next generation accessories, “Brightstar

Turkey”. Brightstar Turkey was established in 2009 for the

purpose of distribution of all Telecommunication products and

services- particularly smart phones and accessories and has

the privilege to have a distribution contract with Vodafone

Turkey (Vodafone) since then.

Brightstar is a strong value-added distributor with a market

share of approximately 10% in the Turkish smartphone market,

with strong corporate roots, which we anticipate will be a

very good fit with us both in terms of business model and

culture. The combination of the deep and close relations of

Brightstar with Vodafone and with the biggest vendors in the

industry and Arena’s current product and services portfolio

creates lots of opportunities in the age of digital solutions.

Our acquisition of Brightstar, which includes the world’s most

important smartphone and new generation smart accessory

manufacturers (such as Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Oppo,

Xiaomi…) in her portfolio and has a very high potential sales

channel as Vodafone Turkey’s distributor, is the most important

acquisition in the Turkish technology distribution market in the

last 10 years.

New generation technologies such as Big Data Analysis,

Artificial Intelligence Systems, IoT and Automation Systems,

Cloud Solutions, and Network Systems that provide 24/7 high-

speed connection to the services offered by these technologies

are emerging as the most important technology components

that enable the digitalization. 5G, just at this point, will form the

main backbone of Digitalization. We strongly believe when the

technology product and service portfolios and experiences of

Arena and Brightstar and the 5G services to be provided by

Vodafone Turkey are combined, an overwhelming digitalization

platform will emerge. Our main goal in this acquisition is to

bring this platform to life and to be the main value-added

distributor that provides end to end all the integrated

technologies and solutions needed for the digitalization

of our customers and our country. We also believe it is a

great opportunity for us to generate new businesses for our

stakeholders in respect of application, software, and services

to be brought by the coming 5G technology.

On the backing of this acquisition as well as other initiatives

underway at Arena, we continued our growth trend and

delivered USD 718 Million in revenue & USD 9.3 Million PAT

for Arena business.

In addition to the digitalization trend, environmental

problems increasing day by day give both individuals and

all institutions the task of contributing to the sustainability

of our World. As Arena, we have determined our task at this

point as contributing to the transformation of Turkey’s energy

production into renewable clean energy sources through

technological transformation, and we started our work in this

field with our Arena Renewable Energy Technologies initiative.

Our mission as Arena; with a creative, target-oriented, fun

and ethical working culture, to deliver the latest technological

products and solutions needed for Digitalization and

Renewable Clean Energy production to every corner of our

country, to lead the creation of new digital solutions using

these technologies, to contribute to the technological and social

development of our country and deliver the expected returns

to our shareholders.

Redington (India) Limited | Annual Report 2021-22:

Dear Shareholders,

As we all have witnessed, over the last two years, Covid-19

pandemic has changed the world and industries dramatically.

Not only social and healthcare behaviour but also business

behaviour of people and companies has gone through a

paradigm shift to adapt to the new era we are entering.

The first phase of this shift which took place in FY21 was

individual consumer behaviour transformation that shaped

the online and offline shopping experience and habits. In FY22,

enterprise customer behaviour was a game-changer and the

shift in this area has accelerated due to continued investments

in technology.

In the year 2021, the company also witnessed a significant

transformation owing to our corporate rebranding as

Redington Turkey leading to an evolution in the company

mindset, culture and growth business model amidst all

our stakeholders – vendors, resellers and enterprise end-

customers.

Industry wide shifts in the model of distribution from

conventional distribution to a solution-based distribution

enabled by As-a-Service model will remain our key to success.

Redington Turkey will also benefit from the resulting shift from

Capex to Opex through adoption of this model.

Despite tough market conditions, Redington Turkey has

recorded a year on year growth of 18% in Net Revenue through

our persistent investments & efforts in scaling up distribution

& adoption of new age technologies such as Cybersecurity,

Analytics, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI),

Augmented Reality (AR) and Cloud solutions.

As for FY23, further investments in Cybersecurity, Cloud, AI

and IoT solutions together with 5G-influenced technologies will

continue to be key. As we build on our One Redington approach,

increased synergies from adoption of Cloud Marketplace

platform CloudQuarks & global best practices will continue

to flow in & support the strategy to change the game of Value

Distribution in the Turkish landscape.

As part of Redington Group, we will move into a new growth

phase enabled by global efforts in the areas of organic,

inorganic, geographical and services growth, over the next

years. Our positioning, as an integral part of this growth plan

will be instrumental in the next phase of our growth journey.

The Company has an operating branch in Singapore. The

Company, its subsidiaries and associate operate in India,

Middle East, Turkey, Africa, and South Asian countries.

2. Basis of preparation of standalone financial

statements

a.

Statement of compliance

The standalone financial statements of the Company

have been prepared in accordance with the Indian

Accounting Standards (Ind AS) to comply with the

requirements prescribed under section 133 of

the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) read with the

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as

amended from time to time.

b.

Functional currency and presentation currency

The standalone financial statements are presented

in ‘Indian Rupees’ (INR), which is the currency of the

primary economic environment in which the Company

operates (the functional currency). The functional

currency of the Company’s branch in Singapore is

United States Dollar (USD).

All financial information has been rounded off to the

nearest Crores unless otherwise indicated.

c.

Basis of measurement

The standalone financial statements have been

prepared on an accrual basis under the historical cost

convention except for:

Items

Measurement basis

Certain financial assets and

liabilities (including forward

contracts)

Fair value

Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR)

Fair value

Defined benefit liability

Present value of defined

benefit obligation

d.

Use of estimates and judgements

Estimation of uncertainties relating to the global

health pandemic from COVID-19

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared

COVID-19 to be a pandemic. As the world recovers from

the impact of the pandemic gradually, the Company

continues to adopt measures to curb the spread

of infection to protect the health of its employees

and ensure business continuity. The Company has

considered internal and external information and has

performed analysis based on current estimates by

assessing the recoverability of assets including trade

receivables, inventories, and other current / non-

current assets (net of provisions established) and

the impact on its leases for any possible effect on the

standalone financial statements.

The Company has also assessed the impact of this

whole situation on its capital and financial resources,

profitability, liquidity position, internal financial

controls etc., and is of the view that based on its

present assessment; the impact of COVID-19 does not

materially affect the standalone financial statements

of the Company. The Company will continue to closely

monitor any material changes to future economic

conditions due to the ongoing pandemic.

Other estimates and judgements

The preparation of the standalone financial statements

in conformity with Ind AS requires the management

to make estimates, judgements and assumptions

considered in the reported amount of assets, liabilities

(including contingent assets and contingent liabilities),

the reported income and the expenses during the year.

The management believes that these estimates,

judgements, and assumptions used in the preparation

of the standalone financial statements are prudent

and reasonable.

Future results could differ from these estimates and

the differences between the actual results and the

estimates are recognised in the periods in which the

results are known/materialise. Estimates, judgements,

and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an

ongoing basis.

Key sources of judgement and estimation uncertainties

at the date of the financial statements, which

may cause a material adjustment to income and

expenditure or the carrying amounts of assets and

liabilities, are in respect of revenue recognition, useful

lives of property, plant and equipment, income taxes,

stock appreciation rights, inventory obsolescence,

original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) supplier

programs and impairment of financial assets have

been discussed here.

Managing Director who is the Chief Operating Decision

Maker for the Group.

The reported operating segments



Engage in business activities from which the

Group earns revenues and incur expenses



Have their operating results regularly reviewed

by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to

make decisions about resources to be allocated

to the segment and assess its performance, and



Have discrete financial information available

p.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalent comprise of cash on hand and

at banks including short-term deposits with an original

maturity of three months or less, which are subject to

an insignificant risk of changes in value. Other bank

deposits which are not in the nature of cash and cash

equivalents with a maturity period of more than three

months are classified as other bank balances.

Other bank balances comprise amounts which are

restricted in nature held as margin money against

guarantee, balances held in unpaid dividend bank

accounts and unspent CSR accounts.

q.

Cash Flow Statement

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,

whereby consolidated profit for the period is adjusted

for the effects of transactions of non-cash nature, any

deferrals or accruals of operating cash receipts or

payments and item of income or expenses associate

with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows

from operating, investing and financing activities

of the Group are segregated based on the nature of

the transactions.

r.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing

the consolidated profit or loss attributable to equity

shareholders of the Company by the weighted average

number of equity shares outstanding during the year.

Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing

the consolidated profit or loss attributable to equity

shareholders of the Company as adjusted for dividend,

interest and other charges (net of any attributable

taxes) relating to the dilutive potential equity shares,

by the weighted average number of equity shares

considered for deriving basic earnings per share

and the weighted average number of equity shares

which would have been issued on the conversion of

all dilutive potential equity shares.

Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only

if their conversion to equity shares would decrease

the net profit per share from continuing ordinary

operations. Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed

to be converted as at the beginning of the period, unless

they have been issued at a later date. The dilutive

potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds

receivable had the shares been actually issued at

average market value of the outstanding shares.

Dilutive potential equity shares are determined

independently for each period presented. The number

of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares

are adjusted for share splits / reverse share splits and

bonus shares, as appropriate.

s.

Dividend to shareholders

Final dividend distributed to equity shareholders is

recognised in the period in which it is approved by

the members of the Company in the Annual General

Meeting. Interim dividend is recognised when approved

by the Board of Directors at the Board Meeting. Both

final dividend and interim dividend are recognised in

the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.

t.

Derivative financial instruments

The Company and its Indian subsidiaries use

foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its

risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations

relating to certain firm commitments and highly

probable forecast transactions. No derivative financial

instruments are used for speculative purposes.

Forward contracts are initially recognised at fair

value on the date the contract is entered into and are

subsequently re-measured to at fair value at each

reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised

in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

u.

Fair value measurement

Some of the Group’s accounting policies and

disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for

both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell

an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly

transaction between market participants at the

measurement date in the principal or, in its absence,

the most advantageous market to which the Group has

access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects

its non-performance risk.

The Group has an established framework with respect

to the measurement of fair values. Fair values are

categorised into different levels in a fair value

hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation

techniques which are as follows:



Level 1 fair value measurements are those

derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active

markets for identical assets or liabilities.



Level 2 fair value measurements are those

derived from inputs other than quoted prices

included within Level 1 that are observable for

the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices)

or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).



Level 3 fair value measurements are those

derived from valuation techniques that include

inputs for the asset or liability that are not based

on observable market data (unobservable inputs)

v.

Borrowing cost

Borrowing costs are interest and other costs (including

exchange differences relating to foreign currency

borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an

adjustment to interest costs) incurred in connection

with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly

attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset

which necessarily take a substantial period of time to

get ready for their intended use are capitalized as part

of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are

recognised as an expense in the period in which they

are incurred.

w. Financial instruments

Recognition and initial measurement

Trade receivables and debt securities issued are

initially recognised when they are originated. All other

financial assets and financial liabilities are initially

recognised when the Group becomes a party to the

contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured

at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly

attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial

assets and financial liabilities (other than financial

assets and financial liabilities at fair value through

profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair

value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as

appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs

directly attributable to the acquisition of financial

assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit

or loss are recognised immediately in the Consolidated

Statement of Profit and Loss.

Classification and subsequent measurement

Financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as

measured at

i.

Amortised cost

ii.

Fair value through profit and loss

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if

it meets both of the following conditions and is not

designated as at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss

(FVTPL):

i.

The asset is held within a business model whose

objective is to hold assets to collect contractual

flows; and

ii.

The contractual terms of the financial asset give

rise on specified dates to cash flows that are

solely payments of principal and interest on the

principal amount outstanding.

All financial assets not classified as measured at

amortised cost as described above are measured at

FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets.

On initial recognition, the companies in the Group

may irrevocably designate a financial asset that
