Board of

Dear Stakeholders,

I want to begin by acknowledging a historic milestone – Wipro

crossed $10 billion in revenue this year. Congratulations!

From this vantage point, it seems impossible to believe that

Wipro was founded as a tiny oil mill in Amalner, Western India,

in 1945. No one could have predicted that one day, it would

morph into a global technology company with a presence

across 66 countries, employing over 240,000 people. I feel

humbled by the progress we have made in our 75-plus years,

but also immensely proud that we accomplished this while

remaining completely committed to our values.

1945 was an extremely difficult year for the world. World war II

had just ended, and a large part of the world lay in ruins. India

was still under colonial rule and facing an uncertain future.

Chairman’s: letter to stakeholders

The post-war world, though, saw one of the greatest periods

of economic expansion in human history.

Today, we find ourselves at another crossroads. The pandemic

is not yet over. Inflation is soaring. An armed international

conflict is underway. The global economy is facing an

uncertain future, and we are staring at a huge climate and

energy crisis.

And yet I remain optimistic. Because I believe that grave crises

carry within them seeds of great possibilities. The fact that

we had a Covid vaccine within a year of the outbreak, and that

two-thirds of the world population has already received at

least one dose of the vaccine, is testament to that belief.

Driven by the pandemic, all of us –individuals, and businesses

– have discovered new ways to work together at scale with

technology. Demand for digital, cloud, data, and cybersecurity

letter to stakeholders: Dear Stakeholders,

Fiscal year 2022 (FY’22) was the year we started to reap the

benefits of our transformation strategy and began to move

the needle in every single benchmark we set for ourselves.

At the end of the year, we became a $10 billion company and

recorded our fastest-ever revenue growth in absolute terms.

Further, we ended the year with the most robust pipeline ever.

Despite an extraordinarily challenging labor market, we added

new talent at a record pace, reaching a global employee pool

of over 240,000.

These results are reflective of the success of our bold growth

strategy, our singular focus on creating value for clients, and

most importantly, the unwavering dedication of our people.

As we look to the year ahead, we are watching the conflict

in Europe, mounting economic headwinds, and the rising

inflation rates and emerging food shortages across the globe.

We strongly believe in the power of technology in solving

some of our most intractable problems and galvanizing the

human spirit.

We expect technology investments to only grow in importance

in the coming years, as businesses continue to turn to

cloud-based technologies and digital tools to enable an

increasingly dispersed global workforce, as well as to enhance

enterprise agility and speed of innovation to better prepare for

the future.

Managing Director

Living our purpose and

continuing our commitment to

our employees, communities, and

environment

Wipro has always operated with a strong commitment to

our values and purpose, conducted business responsibly,

and stood by the principles of democracy, justice,

and equality.

As one of the only companies that gives back two thirds

of its earnings to its communities, our shared sense of

purpose is one of the main drivers of our success.

Most recently, shaken by the armed conflict in Europe,

many of our employees in countries neighboring Ukraine

personally joined relief efforts, providing food and shelter

for thousands of displaced people. We also partnered with

Project HOPE to raise funds to support their emergency

response team and partners in providing critical medical

supplies and assistance to refugees.

Climate change has become the greatest challenge

of our era, posing a grave threat to our well-being,

livelihoods, food and physical security, as well as our

future development.

We have long acknowledged the negative impact

of climate change on our society and incorporated

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles

into our business. As a founding member of Transform

to Net Zero, we are fully committed to reducing our

emissions to zero by 2040.

We recognize that the climate challenge is greater than

us and requires collective action. We are now taking

our learnings and applying our long-term experience

in sustainability to help businesses define their ESG

missions and reach higher standards. In the past year,

we started creating a portfolio of sustainability solutions

to accelerate how we help our clients address climate

change and define optimal transitions to net zero.

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Managing Director is

a professional CEO who is responsible for the day to day

operations of the Company. Of the seven Non-Executive

Directors, six are Independent Directors, free from any

business or other relationship that could materially

influence their judgment. In the opinion of the Board, all the

Independent Directors are independent of the management

and satisfy the criteria of independence as defined under

the Companies Act, 2013, the Listing Regulations and the

NYSE Listed Company manual.

The Board is well diversified and consists of two women

The Board meetings are normally scheduled over two

meet amongst themselves exclusively. In line with Para 4

of Schedule B of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading)

and board meeting is as narrow as possible, and Wipro is

subsequently to the Board for their approval. In addition,

Managerial Personnel, corporate actions, review of internal

and statutory audits, details of investor grievances, specific

cases of acquisitions, important managerial decisions,

material positive/negative developments, risk management

initiatives including cyber security along with mitigation

As a system, in most cases, information to Directors is

submitted along with the agenda papers well in advance

of the Board meeting. Inputs and feedback of Board

Members are taken and considered while preparing agenda

allocated for discussions and deliberations at the meeting.
