The Infosys

leadership team

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Chairman's message

performance, from upskilling and reskilling people, to

investing in leadership development to prepare the firm

for the challenges of tomorrow.

In all this, we are united by a common purpose – to amplify

human potential and create the next opportunity for

people, businesses and communities. From actively

shaping the evolving future of work for our employees to

empowering more people to meaningfully participate in

the digital future; from implementing sustainability in all

our campuses, to shaping carbon offset projects in the

community; and by retaining the trust of all stakeholders

through sound corporate governance – we care deeply

about it all. Our shared sense of purpose gives us all

the emotional fuel to put our best foot forward on

every dimension.

The future – full of uncertainties – is not something that

any of us can claim to predict. Rising interest rates, the

situation in Ukraine, the lingering impact of COVID in many

parts of the world, the disruption of supply chains, all

accompanied by mounting costs and increased volatility,

is confronting corporate leaders with complexities and

challenges that are only just being understood. At the

same time, digital acceleration is creating tremendous

new opportunities for differentiation and gaining market

leadership. Infosys is a trusted navigator for our clients as

they seek to create value from technology-led innovation

and business transformation. We know that we have never

had as much potential as we do right now, to leverage our

expertise to benefit our clients and the broader society.

This opportunity that lies before us – to make an indelible

mark with our digital prowess, our empathy for clients,

our investment in employees and a renewed sense of

purpose - is greater than it has ever been. This gives us

great optimism about the future and equally puts great

responsibility on us to make that future happen.

Chairman

As Dickens said, “It was the best of times, it was the worst

of times”; The pandemic tested us all severely. At Infosys,

we responded with alacrity and demonstrated exceptional

resilience in dealing with an unprecedented calamity.

Even as the world experienced chaos and disruption,

we delivered our highest annual growth in a decade.

We responded as One Infosys.

Our CEO, Salil Parekh, a big champion of the One Infosys

approach, brought together all the capabilities and

intellectual capital of Infosys to create value and make

a disproportionate impact for our clients. This required

company-wide orchestration of our strengths, deep

collaboration amongst our leaders and synergizing of all

our business units and service lines. Salil has delivered

industry leading performance for the Company, and it is in

the interest of the Company and its stakeholders to secure

the continuity and stability of the current leadership. I am

delighted that the Board has unanimously recommended

to the shareholders to approve the reappointment of Salil

Parekh as Chief Executive Officer and: Managing Director,

till March 31, 2027.

The imperative to bring all our assets and capabilities

to every client interaction required us to reimagine our

own digital infrastructure, which we have done with

the ‘Live Enterprise’ approach over the last few years.

The digital transformation happening across industries,

accelerated by the pandemic, also meant that we needed

to strengthen our own offerings, along with deepening

our understanding of the latest technology trends.

For example, the continuous investments we are making in

Infosys Cobalt™-led cloud solutions is differentiating us as

we assist our clients to become more agile and responsive

in this new paradigm of how enterprises use technology.

Our people-first collaborative culture – staying invested

in talent, even as we scale our workforce globally to

capitalize on expanding market opportunities – is integral

to the One Infosys approach. We have been striving for

this culture to permeate our entire talent strategy – from

aligning incentives to ensuring learning outcomes and

Winning in the crucible of our times

“We are united by a

common purpose –

to amplify human

potential and create

the next opportunity

for people, businesses

and communities.„

Nandan M. Nilekani

Managing Director

Dear Shareholder,

Financial year 2022 was an outstanding year for the

Company, our clients, our employees, and our shareholders.

We have had the fastest growth, close to 20%, in 11 years.

We are gaining market share. Our digital work is now almost

60% of all that we do, growing at about 40%.

Our digital capabilities are comprehensive and of immense

value for our clients. Our Cobalt™ cloud capabilities

are market-leading across infrastructure-as-a-service,

platform-as-a-service, and software-as-a-service. Our Equinox

platform is attracting more digital retail businesses and

delivering leading omni-channel experiences for them.

We continue to build our data, analytics, AI, cybersecurity,

and IoT expertise. Our automation capabilities are

industry-leading and poised to support our clients as they

look at ongoing efficiency and productivity improvements.

We are continuing to build deeper relationships with our

clients and growing the trust they have in us. The number

of client relationships with revenues of more than

US$ 100 million a year are at 38. And client relationships

accounting for more than US$ 50 million per year are at 64.

Our large deal momentum continues with 94 large deals

totaling US$ 9.5 billion for the year.

As a consequence of our deep capabilities and the trust

of our clients in us, we have emerged amongst the fastest

growing companies in the industry and the fastest growing

technology services brand globally.

Our engagement with employees continues to strengthen.

Over 140,000 new employees joined us last year, with over

80,000 of them coming directly from colleges. Our learning

platform has enabled 39 million hours of skilling during

the year. We continue to bring our employees expanded

opportunities for career acceleration and development

through promotions and bridge programs. We ended

the year with over 300,000 employees. Over 39% of our

employees are women. Our focus is on building a diverse

workforce with a strong leadership pipeline.

Our One Infosys approach enables all our capabilities and

employees to work for the benefit of our clients and support

them in their digital transformation agenda. We see this as

being a key differentiator in how we engage with our clients

and across the company.: Letter to the Shareholder

“Our One Infosys

approach enables all

our capabilities and

employees to work

for the benefit of our

clients and support

them in their digital

transformation agenda.„

The profiles of Board members encompassing details of

nationality, age, date of (re)appointment, tenure on Board, term

ending date, shareholding, Board memberships in Indian listed

companies, committee details as per Regulation 26 of the Listing

Regulations and areas of expertise are given in the Governance

chapter of the Integrated Report. There are no inter-se

relationships between our Board members. The Company

does not have any pecuniary relationship with any of the

non-executive directors.

The Board has six committees – audit committee, nomination

and remuneration committee, stakeholders relationship

committee, risk management committee, corporate social

responsibility (CSR) committee and ESG committee. All

committees comprise only independent directors, one of whom

is chosen as the chairperson of the committee. The Company

also has a cybersecurity risk sub-committee, which is a sub-

committee of the risk management committee comprising solely

of independent directors.

Board meetings

Scheduling and selection of agenda items for Board

meetings

The tentative dates of Board meetings for the next fiscal are

decided in advance and published in the Annual Report as part

of Shareholder information. The Chairman and the Company

Secretary propose the agenda for each meeting, along with

explanatory notes, in consultation with the CEO & MD, and

distribute these in advance to the directors. Every Board member

can suggest the inclusion of additional items in the agenda.

The Board meets at least once a quarter to review the quarterly

results and other items on the agenda. Additional meetings

are held when necessary. Independent directors are expected

to attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and the AGM.

However, with the Board being represented by independent

directors from various parts of the world, it may not be possible

for all of them to be physically present at all meetings. Hence,

we provide video / teleconferencing facilities to enable their

participation. Committees of the Board usually meet the day

before the Board meeting, or whenever the need arises for

transacting business.

The Board members are expected to rigorously prepare for,

attend and participate in Board and applicable committee

meetings. Each member is expected to ensure their

other commitments do not materially interfere with their

responsibilities with us.

Meeting of independent directors

For the Board to exercise free and fair judgment in all matters

related to the functioning of the Company as well as the Board,

it is important for the independent directors to have meetings

without the presence of the executive management.

Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder

mandate that the independent directors of the Company shall

hold at least one meeting in a year, without the attendance of

non-independent directors and members of the Management.

Even before the Companies Act, 2013 came into effect, our

Board’s policy mandated periodic meetings attended exclusively

by the independent directors.

During the year, the independent directors met four times. At

such meetings, the independent directors discuss, among other

matters, the performance of the Company and risks faced by

it, the flow of information to the Board, competition, strategy,

leadership strengths and weaknesses, governance, compliance,

Board movements, succession planning, human resource

matters and performance of the executive members of the

Board, and the Chairman.

Also, the Board’s policy is to have separate meetings regularly

with independent directors to update them on all business-

related issues and new initiatives. At such meetings, the executive

directors and other members of the senior management share

points of view and leadership thoughts on relevant issues.

letter.

These, do not, however, affect our conclusions regarding the Report. Based on our review and procedures performed and in line with the

boundary, scope, and limitations as described above, we conclude that:

Reasonable Assurance:

The selected non-financial sustainability disclosures which have been subjected to reasonable assurance procedures as defined under

the scope of assurance, are fairly stated, in all material aspects, and are in line with the reporting requirements of the GRI Standards.

Limited Assurance:

Nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that the sustainability data and information subject to limited assurance,

as per the scope of assurance mentioned above, presented in the Report is appropriately stated, in material aspects, and in line with the

reporting requirements of the GRI Standards and SASB Standard for Software & IT Services.

Independence

The assurance was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including professionals with suitable skills and experience in auditing

environmental, social, and economic information as per the requirements of ISAE 3000 (Revised) and ISAE 341O standards .

Our work was performed in compliance with the requirements of the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which

requires, among other requirements , that the members of the assurance team (practitioners) be independent of the assurance client,

in relation to the scope of this assurance engagement, including not being involved in writing the Report. The Code also includes

detailed requirements for practitioners regarding integrity, objectivity, professional competence , and due care, confidentiality,

and professional behavior. KPMG has systems and processes in place to monitor compliance with the Code and to prevent conflicts

regarding independence. The firm applies ISQC-1, and the practitioner complies with the applicable independence and other ethical

requirements of the IESBA Code.
