(i) Others

a)

UPL Limited (UPL) a customer of erstwhile Gujarat Gas Company Limited(now known as Gujarat Gas Limited) had ëled a

complaint before Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) against erstwhile GGCL alleging charging of tariﬀ

illegally under the City Gas Network Distribution Agreement entered into between the Parties and ëled claim of approx. ` 7,698

Lacs. e matter was decided against the Group by PNGRB vide its Order dated 20Ǹ October, 2014. e Group had preferred

an appeal at Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) against the afore mentioned PNGRB Order.

APTEL has delivered ënal judgement on 10Ǹ March, 2021 in favor of the Group by setting aside the afore mentioned PNGRB

Order, and has recorded that invocation of HAPI tariﬀ by PNGRB for the negotiated arrangement between the parties was not

only against the: letter and spirit of regulations deëning tariﬀ zone but also tantamount to rewriting of contract.

UPL has preferred an appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the order of APTEL dated 10Ǹ March, 2021.

Presently, the matter is pending before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.

b)

Erstwhile Gujarat Gas Company Limited and Erstwhile GSPC Gas Company Limited (Now collectively known as Gujarat Gas

Limited “GGL”) had signed Gas supply agreement with Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPCL) for purchase of

Re-gasiëed liqueëed natural gas (RLNG). As per the provision of said agreement, GGL has to pay interconnectivity charges to

GSPCL for the supply and purchase of RLNG at Delivery point which is charged to GSPCL by their supplier i.e. PLL Oﬀ takers

(GAIL India, BPCL, IOCL).

PNGRB had vide its order dated 13Ǹ September, 2011 and the majority members of PNGRB (three member panel of Board)

had vide its order dated 10Ǹ October, 2011 held that GAIL had adopted Restrictive Trade Practices by blocking oﬀ direct

connectivity to GSPCL and further, directed Respondents (PLL Oﬀ takers -GAIL India, BPCL, IOCL) to immediately give

direct connectivity to GSPCL at Dahej Terminal.

e PLL Oﬀtakers (GAIL) ëled appeals against the said PNGRB orders before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL).

On 23 February, 2012 APTEL had issued an interim order for shifting the Delivery Point from GAIL-GSPL Delivery Point to

GSPL-PLL Delivery Point. On 18Ǹ December, 2013 APTEL issued its judgment and required GSPCL to pay the amount of the

diﬀerence between ` 8.74/MMBTU (exclusive of Service Tax) – earlier connectivity charges and ` 19.83/MMBTU (Exclusive of

Service Tax) – HVJ/DVPL Zone-1 tariﬀ to GAIL for the period from 20Ǹ November, 2008 to 29Ǹ February, 2012.

GSPCL has ëled an appeal against the APTEL’s above referred judgment before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (GSPCL vs.

GAIL & Others, Civil Appeal No. 2473-2476 of 2014) and the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India had passed the Interim Order

on 28Ǹ February 2014. e Court has stated that the ends of justice would be met if as a matter of interim arrangement, the

appellant is directed to pay interconnectivity charges at the rate of ` 12.00 per MMBTU (exclusive of Taxes). e Group has

already provided and paid interconnectivity charges at the rate of ` 12.00 per MMBTU (exclusive of Taxes).

GGL has not received any bill / demand note for the amount over and above ` 12.00 per MMBTU from supplier till date. As the

ënal liability would only be determined post the ënal order of the court, quantiëcation of any amount as contingent liability in the

interim is inappropriate due to the uncertainty involved and hence the same is not mentioned / disclosed in the ënancial statement.
