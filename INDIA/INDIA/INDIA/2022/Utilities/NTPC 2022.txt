‘GREEN INITIATIVE‘

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

The global energy landscape is currently facing severe challenges. While resumption of economic activity and the revival of

investment have driven demand, supply has been challenged by availability issues and logistics bottlenecks. Globally, the fuel

prices have increased significantly, and this has made Energy Security the topmost priority for every nation.

The country faced an unprecedented coal crisis last year which continued this year as well. Domestic coal supply has not kept pace

with the required demand, leading to increased need for importing coal. Further, the abnormal increase in LNG and imported coal

prices have led to decrease in power generation from these sources which has increased the gap between demand and supply.

This led to substantial increase in the electricity generation costs which reflected in the all-time high levels of Market Clearing Prices

in the Power Exchange.

Your Company has been carefully monitoring the fuel supply situation and has taken corrective actions on a continuous basis to

ensure energy security for the country by ensuring reliable fuel supplies. This has been done by arranging maximum possible coal

supplies from domestic sources, ramping up coal production from captive mines and sourcing imported coal to ensure that no

station is starved of fuel.

The developments across the globe are expected to accelerate the energy transition plans of every nation. As part of your

Company’s energy transition programme, along with renewable energy sources, we have started working on storage technologies

and discussions are underway for adding Nuclear capacity as well. We are also working with NITI Aayog and have signed a

Statement of Intent for preparing our “Net Zero” plan in line with the country’s commitment.

On the business front, FY 2021-22 was another transformative year for your Company. We have improved our generation share and

rolled out important initiatives that will ensure continued success in the future.

Robust growth despite supply chain disruptions:

The Company’s generation crossed the 350 BUs mark for the first time and recorded an all-time high generation of 360 BUs,

registering a growth of 15% as compared to the country’s generation growth of 8% in the same period. This means, we generated

almost 1 BU on an average every day. Further, in FY 2022-23, till Q1, your Company has generated 104.42 BU, registering a growth

of 21.7% year-on-year and the coal stations operated at over 80% PLF.

In the current fiscal, your Company achieved the 100 BUs generation mark in 88 days which is the best achievement till date.

We have registered the highest single day generation of 1245 MUs on June 10, 2022. These numbers indicate that the growth is

substantial and is likely to continue going forward.

Your Company achieved capacity addition of 3372 MW and commercial capacity addition of 4032 MW. Further, 172.52 MW

renewable capacity has been added in FY 2022-23 till date taking NTPC group installed capacity to 69,134.2 MW.

Coal production from the captive mines stood at 14.02 MMT for FY 2021-22, registering a growth of 27%. Mining operations started

at one more mine, Chatti Bariatu and the captive coal production target for FY 2022-23 has been set as 26 MMT. This will help

ensure fuel security for your Company’s power stations.

Despite numerous challenges, considerable acceleration in your Company’s growth momentum in the recent past encourages me

to assure you that the Company will continue to grow and prosper despite the issues emerging on the global and national business

horizons.

Renewables – Growth engine for future:

On the renewables front, we won bids totaling 3265 MW in FY 2021-22 and

commissioned 502 MW of new capacity. With this, the total renewable capacity

won through competitive bidding has reached 7562 MW and total renewable

commissioned capacity crossed the 2 GW mark.

It is pertinent to mention that your Company has commissioned India’s largest floating

solar plant at Ramagundam in Telangana. With this, we have achieved commissioning

of 222 MW of floating solar projects and another 40 MW is under construction. These

indicate we are progressing well on the renewables side along with the conventional

business.

We have formed a new Company, NTPC Green Energy Limited (NGEL) under which: Letter to Shareholders

of economy led to unprecedented demand and

consumption of electricity. During the period August

to September, share of coal-based generation has

increased from about 62% in 2019 to 66% in 2021.

As a consequence, total coal consumption during

Aug-Sept, 2021 has increased by about 18% in

comparison to corresponding period in 2019. This led

to a gap between coal supply and coal requirement

of various power plants in the country. To tide away

the coal crisis emanating out of coal shortage as per

directions of MoP & CEA vide letters dated 30.8.2021,

11.10.2021 and 12.10.2021, and Minutes of Meeting

-

Your Company has long-term Gas Supply Agreements

(GSAs) with GAIL for supply of Administered Price

Mechanism (APM) gas and Non-APM gas, which

for continuation of coal production from 3 pits, South

(and its extension), West & East. Tendering of Talaipalli

South pit & Talaipalli West pit have already been done.

The mine could not be declared commercial within two

years from commencement of coal production due to

contractual / legal issues with the MDO. NTPC has informed

the issues of MDO to Ministry of Coal and Ministry of

Power and requested for their support. Issuance of fresh

NIT for appointment of MDO is in progress. The delay in

declaration of COD will be appropriately taken up with
