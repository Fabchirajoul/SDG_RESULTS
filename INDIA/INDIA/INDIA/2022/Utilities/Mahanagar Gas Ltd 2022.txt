Other financial assets

The Company maintains exposure in security deposits, reinstatement charges receivable, cash and cash

equivalents and term deposits with banks and corporates.

In case of security deposits and reinstatement charges, majority of which are given to Municipal authorities

(which are government controlled entities) towards pipeline laying activity, the credit risk is low. However,

historically the company has experienced a delay/ non receipt of these amounts and hence allowances have

been taken into account for the expected credit losses of these security deposits and reinstatement charges.

In case of bank /corporate fixed deposits regular quotations for interest rate are invited and based on best

offered rate the bank deposits are placed with banks/corporates having reasonably high net worth. Exposures

of deposit placed are restricted to limits per bank/corporate as per policy and limits are actively monitored by

the Company. We understand that the credit risk is very low to moderate for such deposits.

The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of each class of financial assets as

disclosed in note 4,5,8,9,10 and 11.

(ii) Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will find it difficult in meeting its obligations associated with its financial

liabilities on time.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the

availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due

and to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Company’s treasury

maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under cash and cash equivalents, bank fixed deposits,

corporate fixed deposits and mutual funds.:

letter dated 30th

December 2021, requesting their intervention and advised the OMCs to adhere to the guidance provided by the

MoP&NG. Pending settlement, the liability is provided to the extent considered appropriate by the Company.

inch Kilo Meters) and the Company had submitted Performance Bank Guarantee of H 10,520.00 Lakh dated March

19, 2015, to the PNGRB. Show cause notice dated July 23, 2018, was given by the PNGRB for shortfall in periodic MWP,

asking the Company to explain why penalty should not be levied for the interim MWP target shortfall. The Company

submitted catch up plan vide: letter dated August 2, 2018, and revised catch up plan vide letter dated November 15,

2019, was submitted to PNGRB seeking extension till September 30, 2021. Post outbreak of COVID-19, the Company had

requested PNGRB in April 2020 to extend the timeline for achieving the revised catch-up plan for MWP of Inch-Kms

till March 31, 2022. The PNGRB, sought information on COVID-19 lockdown in July 2020 from the City Gas Distribution

companies and has issued public notice dated November 5, 2020, extending the MWP timeline due to COVID-19

lockdown for various Geographical areas, where extension of 251 days for Raigad was granted. The Company

has appraised PNGRB vide letter dated February 9, 2021, with ground level challenges faced in Raigad and has

requested for extension up to March 2022. The Company had already achieved the cumulative number of Domestic

connections as per PNGRB MWP target as of March 31, 2020, and inch km targets in January 2022 and accordingly, no

provision is deemed necessary in relation to the bank guarantee issued to the PNGRB.

matter is finally heard and decided by the MERC, MSEDCL shall desist from taking any coercive action against the

Company and continue to supply electricity. Company has obtained a legal opinion for such demand and basis the

legal opinion received, believes that it has a strong case and does not expect any outflow of resources.
