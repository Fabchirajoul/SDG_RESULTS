Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer: Dear stakeholders,

I am pleased to present my

strategic overview.

There is an optimism about the

prospects of India’s transmission

and distribution sectors as well as

our position in each of them.

India’s transmission sector

continues to be one of the most

attractive stories coming out of

the country’s power sector. This

optimism is based on a tectonic

shift in the country’s power

generation space, which is driving

a restructuring and rethinking of

the country’s power transmission

segment. The world’s movement

towards renewable energy and

distributed generation pockets

will warrant new transmission

lines and networks. The advent

of the general network access

(as in the advanced countries)

will need a strengthening of

the transmission network to

enhance the responsiveness of

customer needs. The outcome of

this tectonic shift is that India’s

mature power transmission space

is now being seen as nascent and

sunrise, dotting the cusp of an

unprecedented opportunity for

companies that are experienced,

competent and prepared.

India’s power distribution sector

is also positioned at an inflection

point. Most power distribution

companies in the country have

been long-standing but illiquid.

Due to their inability to invest

in infrastructure and last mile

connectivity, they appear ill-

equipped to address the sweeping

transformation in lifestyles

across the nation. It is becoming

increasingly evident that the only

visible stumbling block in the

country’s growth journey is its

power distribution sector, which

is proving incapable of growing or

modernising its network. Besides,

the inadequacy of the last mile of

India’s power value chain could

compromise the entire sectoral

stability, putting a premium on

its urgent reform at the State

level. This reality, while presently

depressing, provides a basis for

probable privatisation. This could

be the mother of all reforms in the

Chief Executive Officer).

Structured teams support

the CEO in discharging this

function. An Apex ESG and

Sustainability Committee is a

body of all functional leaders

and operating site leaders,

chaired by the CEO. One level

below the Apex Committee is

an ESG Working Group (ESG-

WG), a cross-functional team

guided by the Chief Sustainability

Officer. For energy, quality,

environmental and other business

aspects, ATL’s management

systems are benchmarked as

per ISO standards. Management

representatives from different

systems support the CEO

in consistent performance

improvement.

The Company has adopted

internationally renowned

frameworks and standards to

align its ESG disclosures. During

the reporting year, the Company

disclosed its climate change

and risk management measures

on the CDP platform. Besides,

ATL disclosed the performance

of material issues as per GRI

Standards and Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs).

ATL mapped disclosures in line

with TCFD recommendations

and UNGC principles in the ESG

section of the Integrated Report

and a dedicated Sustainability

Report.

ATL comprises a systematic

process of materiality

assessment for reporting and

public disclosures. This includes

a process of stakeholder

identification and engagement

guided by GRI and ISO standards.

An inside-out view of material

issues is calibrated with periodic

stakeholders’ engagement and

prioritised reporting.

Various initiatives for

improvements across all ESG

pillars are identified by the

working group. During the year

under review, the Company

implemented a Clawback Policy

and made additional public

disclosures in line with the

expectations of prominent ESG

evaluation agencies comprising

S&P Global, Dow Jones

Sustainability Index, Morgan

Stanley Sustainability Index and

Sustainalytics.

ATL defined targets in line with

Sustainable Development Goals

(SDGs). SDG-13 for Climate Action

is one of the goals adopted by

ATL. The target for GHG emissions

reduction was in line with

India’s Nationally Determined

Contribution (NDC), disclosed

by the Company in terms of a

reduction in GHG per unit of

revenue. A Sensitivity Analysis

helped in assessing the climate

change-related risks inherent in

ATL’s operations. The organisation

conducted a climate scenario-

based analysis using IPCC’s RCP

climate risk and impact to its

Group Industrial Relations team in collaboration with our BU-HR Team and the Group HR Technology Team

has developed an online grievance redressal mechanism for our on-roll employees which will be available

for use through our Oracle HRMS Portal. This system is christened as the “Adani Employee Grievance

Management System”.

Adani Employee Grievance Management System has been designed with the following intent:

 To provide employees a fair and objective system to raise issues and complaints without any bias.

 To have in place a formal grievance procedure that supports employees to raise their concerns/grievances

without the fear of any negative repercussions.

 To instill within our employee’s the belief that their concerns will be taken seriously and handled fairly

and transparently. This will in turn help to bolster staff morale and maintain levels of productivity.
