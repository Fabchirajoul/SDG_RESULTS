Letter of Intent (‘LOI’)

by Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (MSEDCL) in respect of LOI earlier issued by MSEDCL to enter into

a power purchase agreement with STPL and withdrawal of the petition filed before Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory

Commission (MERC) by STPL, as set forth in such note, indicate the existence of material uncertainty that may cast

significant doubt about the STPL’s ability to continue as a going concern. The management is of the view that going

concern basis of accounting for STPL is appropriate owing to the mitigating factors mentioned in the aforesaid note

and that no adjustments are necessary to the carrying value of the assets, including property plant and equipment of

STPL aggregating to ` 775,798.08 lakhs as at 31 March 2022 as included in the accompanying Consolidated Financials

Statements.

However, in the absence of sufficient evidence for the aforesaid assessment performed by the management including

the uncertainty over the outcome of ongoing discussions with the lenders to secure firm and unconditional commitment

for providing working capital loans /bank guarantees required for executing the PPA, we are unable to obtain sufficient

appropriate evidence to comment on the appropriateness of going concern assessment of STPL by the management

or adjustments, if any, that may further be required to be made to the carrying value of the assets, including property

plant and equipment of STPL as at 31 March 2022 and the consequential impact thereof on the accompanying

consolidated financial statements.

letter dated 29 January 2013 raised a demand of

` 23,218 lakh on Company for payment of irrigation restoration charges @ ` 1 lakh per hectare as per Government

Resolution (GR) dated 6 March 2009 instead of ` 0.50 lakh per hectare as provided in circular from Water Resources

Department, Government of Maharashtra dated 21 February 2004. The Company had paid ` 11,657 lakh (@ ` 0.50

lakh per hectare) and filed a Writ Petition with the Hon’ble Bombay High Court on 13 February 2013 challenging the

validity of demand so raised by WRD. The Mumbai bench of Hon’ble Bombay High Court vide its Order dated 3 August

2015 transferred the matter to the Nagpur Bench. The Nagpur Bench vide its order dated 5 May 2016 has partly

allowed the petition and declared that demand at revised rate i.e. as per GR dated 6 March 2009 from the petitioner is

illegal and unsustainable. As per Nagpur Bench order, the rate prescribed in the GR dated 6 March 2009 is applicable

prospectively from 1 April 2009 and is not applicable in case of the Company to whom water allocation was finalized

on 12 December 2007.

Pursuant to this, Maharashtra State Government filed a Special Leave Petition (“SLP”) before the Hon’ble Supreme

Court of India. The Hon’ble Court after hearing parties granted time to the Company to file its Counter Affidavit. The

counter affidavit has been filed by the Company. The Water Resource department has to file its Rejoinder Affidavit.

The Company is supplying power to Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) based on

two power purchase agreements (PPAs) for supply of 1200 MW (450 MW + 750 MW respectively) of power for the

coal linkages would be available to meet the fuel requirements. However, adequate coal supply was not made available

which adversely impacted cost as Company had to source fuel from alternate sources to meet the shortfall of coal

supplied under FSA with coal supplier. The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved mechanism where

after Ministry of Coal amended the National Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP) and communicated its decision to allow

pass through of the incremental cost of procuring coal from alternative sources to meet the shortfall in supply of

domestic coal under coal linkage.

The Company filed a petition before Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (‘MERC’ or ‘the Commission’) in
