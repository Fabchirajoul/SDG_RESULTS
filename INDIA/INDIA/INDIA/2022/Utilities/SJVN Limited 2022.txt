Directors for the year 2021-22 are presented for your approval. Also, I take this opportunity to share with you the company’s performance,

position and future prospects.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR 2021-22

Dear Friends,

Economies around the world that were still weathering the setbacks of global pandemic, have once again been, severely impacted by the

ongoing Russia-Ukraine War. However, with your unstinted support and the efforts of the employees with strategic intent to ensure sustained

growth, your company managed to deliver steady performance. Emerging from the recent turbulent times, our projects are back on track and we

are taking extraordinary measures to re-coup the progress that was adversely impacted in last two years.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE: Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pride to share with our shareholders that during financial year 2021-22, we have maintained the outstanding performance from

our Power Stations. Surpassing the total Design Energy of 8705 Million Units, our Power Stations generated 9208 Million Units of

energy.

I am also glad to inform that your company has earned Rs 43 crores as incentive under Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM) from Nathpa

Jhakri & Rampur Hydro Power Stations in the financial year 2021-22. This incentive earning is in addition to the revenue earned from power

generation.

Company’s flagship power stations, namely NJHPS & RHPS achieved the Highest Ever Monthly Generation of 1217 MU and 336 MU

respectively in July, 2021 pushing the Company’s aggregate Monthly Generation to a Record High of 1580 MU during the same month.

Dear Shareholders,

th

st

24 May 2018, 31 Raising Day of the company was the day SJVN’s Shared Vision of 5000 MW by 2023, 12000 MW by 2025 & 25000 MW

installed capacity by 2040 was formulated and set out. This Shared Vision gave focus and right direction to our endeavors. The results were

visible within four years as there has been exponential growth in portfolio of the company. The growing portfolio further motivated the

th

Management and on 26 January 2022, Shared Vision has been upgraded to 5000 MW by 2023, 25000 MW by 2030 & 50000 MW by 2040.

During the financial year 2021-22 and first quarter of the financial year 2022-23, 4237 MW has been added to the portfolio of the company. This

is highest capacity addition since incorporation of the company thirty-four years ago.

I have always been advocating the concept of 'One Basin, One Developer' for integrated River Basin Development for optimum utilization of

resources and reduction of generation costs. Our persistent efforts have gained acceptance and acknowledgement. Government of Himachal

Pradesh has allocated six hydro projects on Chenab basin to your company. Similarly in Arun River Basin in Nepal, in addition to Arun-3, SJVN

got 669 MW Lower Arun Hydro Electric Project and 490 MW Arun-4 Hydro Electric Project. This development also has a strategic significance in

strengthening diplomatic and bilateral relations between India and Nepal. With the invaluable guidance and support of Ministry of Power, SJVN

is major contributor in achieving India-Nepal Joint Vision on Power Sector Co-operation.

In another significant development, your company has obtained Category-I Trading License for interstate trading of electricity across

entire Country in January 2022.

SJVN has also re-engineered its Business Model in sync with the commitment of Hon’ble Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi of 50% energy from

non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. As a step forward to achieve this vision and catalyze the future growth of the company, a

wholly owned subsidiary company SJVN Green Energy Limited has been incorporated in March 2022.

The project portfolio of the company has expanded rapidly to the present level of 55 Projects aggregating 31,905 MW spread across

13 states and 3 countries of Indian sub-continent. Out of these, 7 Projects including 6 Generation Projects of 2016.5 MW and 1 Transmission

Line Project of 86 km are Operational, 13 Projects including 11 Generation Projects of 4426 MW and 2 Transmission Line Project totaling 254 km

are under Construction, 11 Projects of 1878 MW are under Investment approval & Pre-Construction Stage and 12 Projects of 4538 MW are in

Survey & Investigation Stage.

Ministry of Power has identified five hydro projects of 5097 MW capacity in Dibang Basin of Arunachal Pradesh for allocation to SJVN. Also, 10

Pumped Storage Projects having an estimated capacity of 13,950 MW and spread across four states have been identified for allocation by the

Ministry.

PROJECT EXECUTION: Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great satisfaction to share that displaying remarkable perseverance, our projects have been consistently performing well and their

progress is either on track or has surpassed the set targets. The project development activities have scaled to an all-time high during the

previous year.

The detailed status and progress of the Power Stations and Projects have been amply covered in the

Dear Shareholders,

Despite the global pandemic, all India demand in power sector continued to achieve new benchmarks. The highest all India demand of 2,00,570

th

MW was achieved on 07 July 2021 and this was 14 percent higher than the previous year. Addition of 28 million new consumers is indicative of

the fact that our economy is recovering well. During the financial year 2021-22, Ministry of Power undertook many comprehensive reforms

covering the entire gamut of the energy sector.

For addressing the issue of timely recovery of the costs due to change in law, Electricity (Timely Recovery of Costs due to Change in Law) Rules,

2021 have been issued. The Electricity (Promotion of generation of Electricity from Must-Run Power Plant) Rules, 2021 have been issued to

ensure that the consumers get green and clean power and secure a healthy environment for the future generation. Also, amendment in the

existing Renewable Energy Certificate mechanism is being made to align the present mechanism with the emerging changes in the power

scenario and to promote new renewable technologies.

A Model Contract Document for Dispute Avoidance Mechanism in Hydro CPSUs through "Independent Engineer" has been issued by Ministry

of Power. Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022 covering liquidation of old outstanding dues and payment

security mechanism will help in clearing of old outstanding dues of SJVN by state power utilities.

The market has been widely expanded with the launch of Real Time Market, Green Term-Ahead Market and Green Day Ahead Market which

has proven extremely beneficial to all the stakeholders.

In addition, the Government has taken several other steps to promote renewable energy. This includes - Permitting Foreign Direct Investment

up to 100 percent under the automatic route; Waiver of Inter State Transmission System charges for inter-state sale of solar and wind power for

projects to be commissioned by June 2025; Setting up of Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Parks to provide land and transmission to renewable

energy developers on a plug and play basis; Schemes such as PM-KUSUM, Solar Rooftop Phase II, 12000 MW CPSU Scheme Phase II, etc;

Laying of new transmission lines and creating new sub-station capacity under the Green Energy Corridor Scheme for evacuation of renewable

power; Setting up of Project Development Cell for attracting and facilitating investments; Standard Bidding Guidelines for tariff based

competitive bidding process for procurement of Power from Grid Connected Solar PV and Wind Projects. Government has issued orders that

power shall be dispatched against: Letter of Credit or advance payment to ensure timely payment by distribution licensees to renewable energy

generators.

All these reforms and initiatives have brought in transformation in Indian power sector, on a scale, which is unparalleled in the energy history of

the world.

FUTURE PROSPECTS

My Dear Friends,

The Russia-Ukraine war has the potential to trigger a long-term global turmoil and change in world order. It has accelerated the global shift to

green energy. The investment into renewable energy is being considered a component of energy security and political stability.

I recall the time when in December 2017, only one wind power project with an investment of Rs. 300 crores was under construction. In

subsequent period of less than four years, there has been a complete transformation in the company’s portfolio. At present, the estimated cost of

under construction projects and transmission line projects is about Rs. 33,000 Crores. Continuing to reorient and readapt to the ever-changing

business environment, we are venturing into the new fields of Hybrid Energy, Pumped Storage, Green Hydrogen and Battery Storage Energy

Systems. As the company gets to execute more projects, the overall investments are estimated to rise to about Rs. 3,00,000 crores by 2040. We

are taking significant steps for spearheading energy transition to deliver excellent growth.

In recent years, SJVN has truly transformed itself into a Fully Diversified Multinational Power Company striding ahead to meet the power

demands of the nation. SJVN aspires to be a one-stop source for any generator and consumer wanting to trade power in the country and

contribute to the evolution of a robust and competitive energy market in India.

Regulation

Foreign exchange rate variation on loans is recovered through

tariff as per CERC regulation

i)

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial

loss. The company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities including

deposits with banks and financial institutions.

ii)

Liquidity risk.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations without incurring

unacceptable losses.

iii)

Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.

Market prices comprise three types of risk: currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other price risks. Financial instruments affected by market

risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial

instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a

financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities

held as at 31st March, 2022 and 31st March, 2021.

The company operates mainly in regulated environment. Tariff hydro power stations of the company is fixed by the Central Electricity

Regulatory Commission (CERC) through Annual Fixed Charges (AFC) comprising the following five components: 1. Return on Equity (RoE),

2. Depreciation, 3. Interest on Loans, 4. Operation & Maintenance Expenses and 5. Interest on Working Capital Loans. In addition to the

above, Foreign Currency Exchange Variation and Taxes are also recoverable from Beneficiaries in terms of the Tariff Regulations. Hence

variation in interest rate, currency exchange rate variations and other price risk variations are recoverable from tariff and do not impact the

profitability of the company.

The company's risk management is carried out as per policies approved by Board of Directors from time to time.

(A)

Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including

deposits with banks and other financial instruments.

a)

Trade Receivables

The Company extends credit to customers in normal course of business. The Company monitors the payment track record of the customers.

Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade

receivables as low, as its customers are mainly state government authorities and operate in largely independent markets.

CERC tariff regulations 2019-24 allows the Company to raise bills on beneficiaries for late-payment surcharge which adequately

compensates the Company for time value of money arising due to delay in payment. Further, the fact that beneficiaries are primarily State

Governments/ State Discoms and considering the historical credit loss experience for trade receivables, the Company does not envisage

either impairment in the value of receivables from beneficiaries or loss due to time value of money due to delay in realization of trade

receivables.

b)

Financial assets at amortised cost

Employee Loans: The Company has given loans to employees at concessional rates as per the Company's policy which have been

measured at amortised cost at Balance Sheet date. The recovery of the loan is on fixed instalment basis from the monthly salary of the

employees. Management has assessed the past data and does not envisage any probability of default on these loans.

c)

Financial instruments and cash deposits

The Company considers factors such as track record, size/networth of the institution/bank, market reputation and service standards and

limits and policies as approved by the board of directors to select the banks with which balances and deposits are maintained. The Company

invests surplus cash in short term deposits with scheduled Banks.

(B)

Liquidity Risk

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an

adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due.

The Company’s objective is to maintain optimum levels of liquidity at all times to meet its cash and collateral requirements. The Company

relies on a mix of borrowings, capital infusion and excess operating cash flows to meet its need for funds. The current committed lines of

credit and internal accruals are sufficient to meet its short to medium term expansion needs. The Company monitors rolling forecasts of its

The preparation of consolidated financial statements of SJVN Limited for the year ended 31 March 2022 in accordance with the financial

reporting framework prescribed under the Companies Act, 2013 (Act) is the responsibility of the management of the company. The statutory

auditor appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India under section 139(5) read with section 129(4) of the Act is responsible for

expressing opinion on the financial statements under section 143 read with section 129(4) of the Act based on independent audit in accordance

with the standards on auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act. This is stated to have been done by them vide their Revised Audit

Report dated July 26, 2022 which supersedes their earlier Audit Report dated May 25, 2022.

I, on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, have conducted a supplementary audit of the consolidated financial statements of

SJVN Limited for the year ended 31 March 2022 under Section 143(6)(a) read with section 129(4) of the Act. We conducted a supplementary audit of

the financial statements of SJVN Limited and SJVN Thermal Private Limited, but did not conduct supplementary audit of the financial statements of

Companies mentioned in Annexure A for the year ended on that date. Further, section 139(5) and 143(6)(a) of the Act are not applicable to SJVN

Arun-3 Power Development Company Pvt. Ltd. And Kholongchhu Hydro Energy Limited being private entities/ entities incorporated in foreign

countries under the respective laws, for appointment of their Statutory Auditors and for conduct of supplementary audit. Accordingly, Comptroller and

Auditor General of India has neither appointed the Statutory Auditors nor conducted the supplementary audit of these companies. This

supplementary audit has been carried out independently without access to the working papers of the statutory auditor and is limited primarily to

inquiries of the statutory auditor and company personnel and a selective examination of some of the accounting records.

In view of the revision(s) made in the statutory auditor's report, to give effect to some of my audit observations raised during

supplementary audit, I have no further comments to offer upon or supplement to the statutory auditor's report under section 143(6)(b) of the Act.
