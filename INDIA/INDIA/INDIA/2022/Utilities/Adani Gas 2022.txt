Dear shareholders,

Overview

The year under review proved to

be a seminal one for Adani Total

Gas for a number of realities

that converged concurrently,

increasing the challenges,

opportunities and unforeseen

all at once. The ability of the

Company to navigate these

challenges and address the

opportunities made it a rewarding

year. If there was an intangible

bottom-line to the year under

review, then it was this: your

Company demonstrated resilience

in the face of unforeseen realities

on the one hand without losing its

capacity to seize on opportunities

on the other. The result is that the

Company demonstrated a multi-

faceted picture of its personality,

the full implications of which

will be progressively reflected

in its growth across the coming

years. This was the year when

your Company strengthened its

leading position as India’s largest

private CGD player following the

addition of 14 new geographical

areas in the 11th CGD bid round.

Your Company, along with

authorisations of its joint venture

company Indian Oil Adani Gas

(IOAGPL), has been authorised to

develop gas distribution networks

across 124 districts in India.

Building business

The Company has been

continuously building its business

around a holistic Ten-Fold

Approach, which is intended to

enhance value for all stakeholders.

The Ten-Fold Approach is backed

by the Adani Group vision of

Growth with Goodness and

Responsibility.

i. Safety

ii. Sustainability

iii. Operational and execution

excellence

iv. Cost-efficiency

v. Capital management

vi. Customer Centricity

vii. Human Capital

viii. Volume expansion and future

proofing

ix. Governance

x. Compliances

The Ten-Fold Approach will

strengthen the Company’s

preparedness to address

opportunities with de-risked

speed.

Performance

The strong performance of ATGL

was achieved in the face of the

pandemic resurgence that came

with lockdowns or slowdowns

during the first and fourth

quarters of the year. The outbreak

of the unprecedented geopolitical

crisis in the fourth quarter

spiked gas prices, affecting our

procurement economics. Over

and above, there was an increase

in the price of gas under the

Administered Pricing Mechanism

(APM) and a marginal decline in

gas allocation under the APM

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

STATUTORY REPORTS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

Dear Shareholders,

The year under review signified

the age of turbulence.

A number of unanticipated

realities materialised, increasing

volatility, uncertainty, change and

ambiguity.

Seldom has a financial year been

marked by the concurrence of

a range of challenges as one

witnessed during the year under

review. During the first quarter,

the country experienced a sharp

resurgence of the second wave

of the pandemic, which recurred

during the fourth quarter,

affecting people and equipment

mobility. The year was marked by

a sharp increase in logistics and

freight costs, which enhanced

the cost structure of the global

economy and kept the cost of oil/

gas high. During the last quarter

of the year, the outbreak of the

Russia-Ukraine armed conflict

hardened gas procurement costs.

If there is a single message that

one needs to communicate it is

that despite these challenges,

the Company not only sustained

but also grew its topline, profit

and physical growth while

working with low leverage.

The Company strengthened its

competitive position following

additional investments out
