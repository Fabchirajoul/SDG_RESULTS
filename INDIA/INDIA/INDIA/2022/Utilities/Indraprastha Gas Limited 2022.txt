letter from Greater Noida Authority amounting to H 10.13 crore for payment of lease

rent in respect of the pipelines already laid in Greator Noida. The demand from Greator Noida authority included

annual lease rent with 10% escalation in every year and penal interest @18% thereon. The demand was further

increased to H 22.29 crore by Greater Noida Authority in June 2019.

The rationality of the demand for annual lease rents, escalations and penal interest was looked into by the Company

by obtaining expert legal opinion in this regard and demand for lease rent was not found legally tenable. Hence, the

matter in respect of the aforementioned demands was taken up by the Company with Greater Noida Authority for

waiver and a: letter in this regard was submitted with the Greater Noida Authority in November 2019. Subsequent to

this, the Greater Noida Authority has not further pursued the matter with IGL till date.

(e) During the financial year 18-19, the Company received a demand amounting to H0.04 crores from the Commercial

Tax department, Uttar Pradesh which has been deposited by the Company under protest.

(f) Apart from those disclosed above, the Company has certain ongoing litigations involving customers, vendors and

employees. Based on legal advice of in house legal team, the management believes that no material liability will

devolve on the Company in respect of these litigations.

2

Demand raised by Goods and Service tax (GST) authorities

During the financial year 19-20, the Company had received a demand cum show cause notice from the GST authorities

for an amount of H19.55 crores (previous year H 19.55 crores) in respect of financial year 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17

and from April 2017 to June 2017 wherein it has been alleged by the aforementioned authorities that the Company has

incorrectly availed cenvat credit on the purchases made by the Company and has not paid service tax on certain other

services.

The Company has filed the responses to the demand cum show cause notice and is of the view that such demand is not

tenable. Accordingly, no provision has been made for the demand so raised.

3

There are numerous interpretive issues relating to the Hon’ble Supreme Court (SC) judgment dated 28 February 2019

on provident fund on which the Company is seeking legal advice specially on the retrospective applicability of the same.

However, the Company for the current year is complying with the statutory requirements of the same and does not

believes that any material liability would devolve on it.
