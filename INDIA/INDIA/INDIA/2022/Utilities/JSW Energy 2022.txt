To foster a cleaner

energy future, we

intend to reverse

our energy mix

in the medium to

long term. We have

targeted a growth in

our portfolio from

7 GW currently to

10 GW by 2025, and

to 20 GW by 2030.

Sajjan Jindal

Dear Shareholders,

A crucial decade for energy

transition

Transition to clean energy has

emerged as a key driving force for

sustainable development in recent

years, presenting a huge economic

opportunity. Countries across

the globe are more determined

than ever to accelerating

decarbonisation of their economies

and securing their future energy

needs. The current decade will

hence be one of great climate

action – that of focussed planning

and taking necessary actions for

enabling a global energy shift.

For our nation, two key themes

acted as catalysts in FY2022 for

accelerating energy transition.

First, at COP-26, India announced

a target to achieve Net-Zero

emissions by 2070, implying

a deep-decarbonisation of

all “hard to abate” sectors

like thermal power, industry,

agriculture and transport over

the next fifty years. Second,

geo-political tensions, supply

chain constraints and elevated

fossil fuel prices accentuated the

importance of energy security for

economic sustainability.

Electricity is only 18% of total

energy consumption in India. The

balance 82% energy use, which

mainly depends on fossil fuels,

presents a large opportunity for

new green businesses. For the

last two decades, JSW Energy

has primarily been an electricity

generation utility. However, as

India gears for this transformative

decade of serious action, it’s time

for us at JSW Energy to also enact

change and be at the forefront

of energy transition. Therefore,

over the next decade, I see our

company transform from a power

generating utility into an energy

solutions provider for new green

businesses such as energy

storage and deep decarbonisation.

With climate change agenda and

sustainability at the core of our

business, we remain committed

to becoming a net-zero company

by 2050.

Accelerated growth for a better

tomorrow

With energy transition gaining

momentum in FY2022, we

reimagined JSW Energy and

expanded our growth strategy

by establishing twin engines of

growth – scaling our generation

capacity to 20 GW by 2030 and

being future-ready with new

energy solutions.

To foster a cleaner energy future,

we intend to reverse our energy

mix in the medium to long term.

We have targeted a growth in our

portfolio from 7 GW currently to

10 GW by 2025, and to 20 GW by

2030, with incremental capacity

additions from renewable energy.

With this, the share of Renewables

in our portfolio will increase to 70%

by 2025 and 85% by 2030. During

the year, we achieved significant

developments on this aspect. We

increased our portfolio from 4.6 GW

to 7 GW by signing long term PPAs

for the entire 2.4 GW renewable

With energy transition

gaining momentum in

FY2022, we reimagined

JSW Energy and

expanded our growth

strategy by establishing

twin engines of growth -

scaling our generation

capacity to 20 GW by

2030 and being future

ready with new energy

solutions.
