Managing Director

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

Global events that unfolded during the previous year have the

potential to alter the structural landscape of the energy sector and by

all standards, the year gone by has been a challenging one for energy

and commodity sectors, which witnessed extreme volatility in prices.

Adding to it, as COVID-19 restrictions around much of the world

are relaxed and economic activity recovers, energy consumption is

expanding sharply, putting available energy supplies under strain and

highlighting fragilities in the system. Your Company has successfully

steered its course during this demanding period, emerging only

stronger and resilient.

Unprecedented growth in times

of global uncertainty and turmoil

Despite the global uncertainty and testing times, your Company has

yet again surpassed its previous records and clocked a 62% increase

in Revenue from Operations to ` 91,646 crore in FY22 as against

` 56,738 crore in FY21, Profit Before Tax (PBT) increased by 113%

to ` 13,590 crore in FY 22 as against ` 6,386 crore in FY21. The

Profit After Tax (PAT) increased by 112% to ` 10,364 crore in FY22

as against ` 4,890 crore in FY21 mainly on account of increased gas

marketing and transmission volume, better gas marketing spread and

higher product prices. Your Company has exceeded the highest ever

Revenue, PBT and PAT achieved in any of the previous financial years.

Your Company has been working tirelessly to strengthen its

core business and today owns and operates about 14,500 km of

trunk natural gas pipeline representing nearly two-third of the

country’s existing network. Work is progressing at a good pace on

construction of nearly 5,000 km of additional natural gas pipelines,

which is expected to bolster transmission quantities once completed

and provide extensive geographical reach within the country.

Your Company is also actively scouting additional gas sourcing

opportunities to serve its clientele, both existing and new accretions.

To stimulate and fortify core business, in particular, your Company

incurred a Capex of ` 7,738 crore mainly on Pipelines, Petrochemicals

and Equity to JVs. You will also be delighted to know that your

Company has acquired 26% stake from ILF&S in ONGC Tripura Power

Company. This acquisition would encourage synergy and enable GAIL

to stronghold its presence in North East region of the country.

Your Company is also aware of the transformational changes

happening in the global energy sector and has been taking initiatives

to get a foothold in such space. It is my honor to announce that your

Company has, in line with the National Hydrogen Mission commenced

India’s first-of-its-kind project of mixing hydrogen into natural gas

system at Indore, Madhya Pradesh. The hydrogen blended natural

gas is being supplied to Aavantika Gas Limited, one of GAIL’s Joint

Venture (JV) Company with HPCL, operating in Indore. This project

marks the stepping stone of India’s journey towards hydrogen based

and carbon neutral future. The grey hydrogen would subsequently

be replaced by green hydrogen. Your Company has always been

committed to the growth of a gas-based economy in India and to

India’s vision of a greener and a cleaner environment. As our country

is moving forward with ambitious goal of achieving a carbon-neutral

and self-reliant future, this project is a significant step in that direction.

Growth and returns go hand in hand

The support of our shareholder has been consistently rewarded

through regular dividends and also buyback of shares at premium.

Your Company takes pride in being a consistent dividend-paying

Company. The Board of Directors of your Company had approved

payment of two interim dividends during the financial year, 1st and

2nd Interim Dividend @ 40% and 50% respectively on equity share of

` 10 each (` 4.00 and ` 5.00 per equity share each) amounting to

` 3,996.35 crore on the paid-up equity share capital of the Company.

The Board of Directors of your Company has also recommended the

payment of Final Dividend @ 10% (` 1/- per equity share) for the FY

2021-22 on the paid-up equity share capital of the Company.

During FY 2021-22, your Company made Buyback of 5,69,85,463

(Five Crore Sixty Nine Lakh Eighty Five Thousand Four Hundred And

Sixty Three) fully paid-up equity shares of face value of ` 10 each

(representing 1.28 % of the total number of fully paid-up equity

shares) at a price of ` 190 (Rupees One Hundred Ninety Only) per

equity share payable in cash for an aggregate consideration of

` 1082,72,37,970 (Rupees One Thousand Eighty Two Crore Seventy

Two Lakh Thirty Seven Thousand Nine Hundred and Seventy only)

excluding taxes. Buyback offer was successful and oversubscribed

by 9.04 times. Total number of Shares tendered were 51.52 crore

against 5.69 crore shares offered. The paid-up equity share capital

of the Company thus reduced from ` 4,440.39 crore to ` 4,383.40

crore.

Endeavors for the collective good

Your Company believes in benefitting communities and protecting

the environment that will ultimately determine the sustainability of

continued progress

Your Company with a turnover over US $ 12 billion is India’s largest

natural gas company and ranked as the top gas utility in Asia. But

GAIL is more than just a gas company. As a conscious corporate

citizen, the organization believes that it has a social purpose. The

rigor and strategic thought that drives GAIL to be consistently ranked

among the top gas utilities in the world, also drives its CSR initiatives.

GAIL’s motto statement ‘Energizing Possibilities’ is also a reflection

of the hopes, aspirations and dreams of the many beneficiaries of

the CSR initiatives. Your Company is at the forefront of countless

welfare projects that further its CSR objectives namely through

ventures like GAIL Utkarsh-which provides support for specialized

residential coaching for Engineering/ Medical entrance exams,

GAIL Vidya- which provides support towards promoting education

to underprivileged girl students from rural and semi-urban localities,

Project Arogya- Health Care facilities through operation of Mobile

Medical Units in various states etc. The Company is always dedicated

Risks, Challenges, and Mitigation

PNGRB Regulatory Framework

The Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) was

established by the Government of India on 1st October, 2007

for carrying out the various provisions of the PNGRB Act, 2006.

The PNGRB Act provides a legal framework for regulating the

refining, processing, storage, transportation, distribution,

marketing and sale of petroleum, petroleum products and

natural gas but excluding the activities of production of crude

oil and natural gas, to protect the interests of consumers

and entities engaged in these activities. The main functions

of PNGRB include, inter-alia, (a) granting authorizations for

laying, building, operating, or expanding new pipelines as

common carriers or contract carriers and for laying, building,

operating, or expanding new city gas distribution networks

(CGD networks) (b) declaring existing natural gas pipelines,

petroleum & petroleum product pipelines and CGD networks

as common carriers or contract carriers (c) regulating access

to common carriers or contract carriers (d) regulating

transportation rates of common carriers or contract carriers

and (e) to perform such other functions as may be entrusted

to it by the Central Government to carry out the provisions of

this Act.

During the financial year 2021-22, PNGRB has notified various

Amendments to Regulations in respect of Natural Gas Pipelines,

CGD networks, and Petroleum Product Pipelines. During

this period, your Company has been granted authorization

for developing various Tie-In Connectivity pipelines in the

regions of Bokaro and Jharia which shall bring in more gas

from new domestic sources. Your Company has also received

PNGRB Acceptance for laying a dedicated pipeline from BPCL

Uran Terminal to your Company’s PDH-PP plant at Usar for

transportation of liquid propane. In this period, affiliates of your

Company have also been granted authorization for developing

City Gas Distribution Networks in Geographical Areas located

in the states of Telangana, Odisha and Maharashtra under the

11th Round of CGD Bidding.

PNGRB has also issued various orders and decisions in relevant

matters. The details of the said regulations, amendments,

authorizations, orders and decisions are available on the

official website of PNGRB (www.pngrb.gov.in) and have varying

implications on business. These regulations, amendments,

authorizations, orders, decisions of PNGRB are appealable

before the PNGRB Bench, Appellate Tribunal, and Courts and

accordingly, some of them pertaining to your Company are

also under various stages of appeals. The timing and content

of any final changes in regulations made by PNGRB is not in

your Company’s control. However, regular interactions with

PNGRB on sectoral issues, participation in public consultation

exercises conducted by the Regulatory Board and making

logical submissions to the Regulator in writing helps your

Company to anticipate or to minimize risks associated with

any sudden or unforeseen changes in regulations.

letter dated 2nd August, 2018, and

revised catch up plan vide: letter dated 15th November, 2019, was

Pending settlement, the liability is provided to the extent

considered appropriate by the Company.

IV) ONGC Petro additions Limited

a) The Company has set up a Petrochemical Complex in Special

Economic Zone (SEZ), situated at Dahej, State of Gujarat. In view

of changes in market dynamics over the years, the demand for

petrochemical products has increased in domestic market and

India is now a net importer of polymers. Therefore, Company

is selling its majority of products in Domestic Tariff Area (DTA),

thereby substituting the imports and saving foreign exchange

outflow of the country. However, Basic Custom Duty is applicable

on the sale of products from SEZ to DTA which is directly impacting

the margin of the Company. Therefore, Board of directors has

accorded approval to make an application for voluntary exit from

SEZ.

Development Commissioner, Dahej SEZ has conveyed in-principal

approval for exit from SEZ subject to de-notification of the area;

EPCG authorisation from Director General of Foreign Trade;

payment of all applicable duties and taxes which may be finalised

on the basis of the date of final exit and compliance of all the

provisions of SEZ Act and other Rules. The unit is still under the

SEZ and the proposal for approval of final exit will be considered

subject to approval of de-notification from Board of Approvals,

MoCI, New Delhi.

SEZ Developer has to make an application for De-notification along

with inter alia NOC from State Government, No due certificate

from Specified Officer and demarcation of area from SEZ. These

approvals/ activities are in process.

SEZ exit is expected to bring significant improvement in the

future margins along with one time cost. Based on the available

information, the provisional estimated amount on account

of SEZ exit is ` 2,734.4 crore. This includes (i) Duty on capital

goods ` 1,558.5 crore, which is permitted to be settled under

EPCG scheme; (ii) Duty on inventory is ` 524 crore out of which

` 375 crore is eligible for Input Tax credit; (iii) Capital expenses

of ` 193.6 crore on land and construction of infrastructure; (iv)

Duty, taxes and charges payable to Developer & others ` 364.5

crore; (v) SEZ exit expenses of ONGC C2C3 plant ` 93.8 crore.

The above amount does not include provisional duty computed

by Specified Officer, Dahej SEZ on immovable properties and

provisional VAT amount estimated by State tax department.

It is pertinent to mention that the duty amount and other

estimates are provisional. Actual outflow on account of SEZ exit

and its quantum is contingent upon the terms and conditions on

which various approvals may be granted.

As the exit is voluntary in nature, OPAL has requested for exit from

SEZ considering economic benefits in future to the concerned

authority. Since various NOC, approvals and duty assessment for

SEZ exit are under consideration with the competent authorities,

management believes that a final decision on exit can only be

taken based on the terms and conditions mentioned in these

approvals. In view of that management has considered that as on

date OPaL has no liability to consider the books of accounts.

b) The Company has incurred a net loss for the year ended

31st March, 2022 of ` 533 crore (year ended 31st March, 2021

` 796.6 crore) and cumulative loss up to 31st March, 2022

reached to ` 8,867.7 crore. There is negative working capital as at

31st March, 2022 of ` 8,486.7 crore (March 31, 2021 ` 7,211

crore). In spite of this situation, Company do not doubt its

sustainability as it constantly reviewing its operations to improve

margins. It has taken following measures which will improve

profitability: -

i)

Production ramp up year on year basis.

ii) Exploring option of exit from SEZ area.

iii) Improvement in Product mix.

iv) Further steps are being evaluated to improve the net back

and reduce the cost to improve overall profitability.

v) Finance cost reduction through Forex loan.

vi) Scheduled Major turnaround activity (MTA) for production

improvement.

Keeping above measures these financial statements have

therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.

V) Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Ltd.

a) Capital Subsidy: Based on the approval of the Government of

India for setting up AGCP, being implemented by BCPL in state

of Assam, against Capital Subsidy of ` 5239.45 Cr., the Company

has received Capital Subsidy of ` 5221.33 Cr. till 31st March,

2022. No Capital subsidy was released during the FY 2021-22. The

interest earned on Capital Subsidy has been considered part of

capital subsidy and adjusted from capital subsidy receivable. The

balance amount of capitals subsidy receivable stands at ` 18.12

Cr and release of the same shall be requested in RE 2022-23 from

Govt. of India. Capital Subsidy received from Government of India

has been considered as deferred income in terms of Ind-As 20

and is recognized as income in the Statement of Profit and Loss

over the useful life of the petrochemical complex. Accordingly in

the current financial year an amount of ` 211.65 Cr. has been

transferred (Previous year ` 211.64 Cr.) to the Statement of Profit

& Loss as other income and the balance in Capital Subsidy account

has been carried forward as “Government Grants” classified under

“Non- Financial Liability”.

b) Revenue Grants.

i) Feed Stock Subsidy:

The feedstock subsidy was approved by CCEA for a period of

15 years of plant operation for maintaining minimum post tax

project IRR of 10% of the Assam Gas Cracker Project (AGCP)

54) Financial Risk management

The Company is exposed to a number of financial risks arising

from natural business exposures as well as its use of financial

instruments including market risks relating to commodity prices,

foreign currency exchange and interest rates; credit risk; and

liquidity risk.

a) Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows

of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes

in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk:

interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as

equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments

affected by market risk include loans and borrowings,

deposits, and derivative financial instruments.

(i) Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash

flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of

changes in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to

the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily

to the long-term domestic rupee term loan and foreign

currency loans with floating interest rates. The Company

manages its interest rate risk according to its Board approved

Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Risk Management Policy.

Market interest rate risk is mitigated by hedging through

appropriate derivatives products such as interest rate swaps

& full currency swaps, in which it agrees to exchange, at

specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable

rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-

upon notional principal amount.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

With all other variables held constant, the following table

demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible

change in interest rates on floating rate portion of forex

loans and borrowings outstanding as on 31st March,

2022, after considering the impact of swap contracts.
