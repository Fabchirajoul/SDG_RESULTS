Dear Stakeholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to write to you after another

eventful year of progress, transition and transformation.

We performed well across all segments, with our conventional

generation, transmission and distribution (T&D) businesses

delivering solid results, Odisha Discoms stabilising and the

Renewables business firing on all fronts. Today, we stand

strong, serving more than 12 million consumers through our

distribution and new-age businesses.

We continue to be aggressively focused on growing our clean

energy portfolio which today constitutes over one-third of

our total generation portfolio and we aim to increase it by

more than 60% over the next five years. We are facilitating

this clean energy transition through new technology

adoption in collaboration with our customers and partners.

With BlackRock and Mubadala investing ₹ 4,000 crore in our

Renewables business, we are well positioned to pursue even

larger opportunities in the RE space and continue to retain our

leadership position in the new consumer centric businesses -

Rooftop Solar, EV Business, Solar Pumps etc.

A year of standout financial performance

That said, FY22 also came with its fair share of challenges,

with headwinds emanating from elevated commodity prices,

residual effects and variants of COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts

and erratic weather patterns. However, we were able to deliver

a strong financial performance, with revenue at ₹ 42,576 crore

(up 28% y-o-y), EBITDA at ₹ 8,191 crore (up 3% y-o-y) and PAT at

₹ 2,156 crore (up 50% y-o-y).

We also made solid progress on some of our key issues and

continued to strengthen our balance sheet. Leveraging our

robust operating cash flows, we brought down our net debt to

underlying EBITDA to 3.92. Our domestic as well as international

credit ratings received an upgrade in FY22, with our average

borrowing cost narrowing 36 bps y-o-y to 6.82%.

An all-round progress across businesses

Tata Power’s focus on becoming a consumer-oriented,

renewables-led company continued to deliver sustained results

in FY22. Our Solar Utility Scale EPC order book stood at 3 GW

worth ₹ 12,000 crore. We achieved our highest-ever quarterly

revenue in our rooftop solar business and doubled our revenue

"At Tata Power, we believe that access

to energy is an enabler for creating a much

larger socio-economic impact in the country"

Managing Director). The Code of Conduct for Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) and for Independent Directors

(IDs) carries explicit clauses covering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, there are explicit clauses in the TCoC

prohibiting any employee - including the: Managing Director (MD) and Executive Directors (EDs) - from accepting any position

of responsibility, with or without remuneration, with any other organisation without the Company’s prior written approval.

For MD and EDs, such approval must be obtained from the Board.

Board independence

The TCoC, which defines the governance philosophy at Tata Power, emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders.

Shareholders can communicate any grievance to the Company Secretary’s office through a well-publicized channel, where

complaints are tracked to closure. The Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee (SRC) oversees the redressal of these complaints.

The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is another forum where they can interact with the Board.

“The Tata philosophy of management has always been, and is today more than ever, that corporate enterprises must be managed

not merely in the interests of their owners, but equally in those of their employees, of the consumers of their products, of the local

community and finally the country as a whole.”

Open Demat Account and dematerialise your shares

Members are requested to convert their physical

holdings into electronic holdings.

ii)

Consolidate your multiple folios

Confidentiality of security details

Folio Nos./DP ID/Client ID should not be disclosed to

any unknown persons. Signed delivery instruction slips

should not be given to any unknown persons.

intermediary. In case the intermediary does not act

professionally, Members can take up the matter

with SEBI.

v)

Obtain documents relating to purchase and sale of

securities

A valid Contract Note/Confirmation Memo should be

obtained from the broker/sub-broker, within 24 hours

of execution of the trade. It should be ensured that the

Contract Note/Confirmation Memo contains order no.,

trade no., trade time, quantity, price and brokerage.

vi)

Prevention of Frauds

exercise diligence and notify the Company of any

change in address, as and when required.

2.

The carrying amount of trade receivable does not include receivables of ₹ 1,150.64 Crore (March 31, 2021: ₹ 188.67 Crore)

which are subject to a factoring arrangement. Under this arrangement, the Group has transferred the relevant receivables

to the factor in exchange for cash on non recourse basis. The Group, therefore, has derecognised the said receivables under

the said arrangement. Amount received from such customers not transferred to factoring agent is disclosed as financial

liability (Refer Note 26).

9.1 Trade Receivables

The Group has used practical expedient by computing the Expected Credit Loss 'ECL' allowance for trade receivables based on

a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience of Holding Company and respective

subsidiaries and adjusted for forward looking information. The ECL allowance is based on the ageing of the days the receivables

and has been calculated and applied at the respective entity level of the Group.

In case of Odisha Discoms, the management believes that collection data related to pre-acquisition period is

not relevant to assess ECL allowance on receivables in the post-acquisition period. In the absence of availability

of adequate and relevant past data related to payment behaviours, the Group has elected to recognise ECL

allowance on trade receivables as per the OERC tariff regulations, i.e., @ 1% of revenue from power supply.

Post-acquisition of Odisha Discoms, the Group's endeavour has been to reduce AT&C losses, reducing provisional billing and

improving collection through better reach to consumers. In the process, the Group has faced several challenges including Covid

waves, Cyclones and delays in appointment/ working of metering, billing and collection (MBC) agencies for reasons beyond

control of the Group. The Group has successfully dealt with these challenges. It has reduced provisional billing and also collected

significant amount towards pre-acquisition receivables on behalf of the erstwhile Odisha Discom utilities. The management

is confident it will be able to collect most of the outstanding receivables as it increases its reach to the consumers and also

considering that electricity is an essential commodity for all consumers. Accordingly, the management believes the above ECL

allowance reflects best estimate and is appropriate as per Ind AS 109 – Financial Instruments.

letter dated 23rd April, 2007 conveyed its decision to the GNCTD upholding the Group’s

view. As GNCTD has refused to accept the DERC decision as binding on it, the subsidiary company has filed a writ petition

in the Hon’ble Delhi High Court and the matter was made regular on 24th October, 2011. No stay has been granted by the

High Court in the matter for refund of consumer security deposits and payment of interest thereon.

d)

The Group supply solar power to Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited ('TANGEDCO') against long term

Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). As per the said PPAs, the Group is entitled to receive consideration for all energy units

supplied and billed. However, whilst effecting payments to the Group, TANGEDCO has disputed and is not making payment

for energy units supplied and billed in excess of 19% Capacity Utilisation Factor (CUF) in accordance with its internal circular.

The National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) has filed the writ petition with Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory

Commission (TNERC) challenging the said circular issued by TANGEDCO on behalf of generators who have commissioned

solar power plants and impacted by the said circular. The Tata Power Company Limited, ultimate holding company of the

group, is also a Member of NSEFI and thereby party to petition filed by NSEFI. The TNERC has now issued Order dated

22nd December 2020 on the petition filed by the NSEFI and decided the matter in favour of TANGEDCO. The Group has

challenged the ruling of TNERC at the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (ATE) through NSEFI. Based on legal assessment, the

management of the Group is confident of getting a favourable order.

With respect to above dispute, the Group has a trade receivable balance of ₹ 109.77 crore for such excess units as on

March 31, 2022 (March 31, 2021 - ₹ 90.85 crore). The Group has also recognised a revenue of ₹ 18.92 crore (March 31, 2021 -

₹ 2.93 crore) for such excess units as on 31st March 2022. Considering signed PPA and its independent legal evaluation, the

Group believes that these amounts are fully recoverable along with interest and no provision has been recognized in the

consolidated financial statements.

e)

The Group entered into long-term Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) of 200 MW wind and solar plant with the Southern

Power Distribution Company of Andhra Pradesh Limited (“APSPDCL” or “APDISCOM”) to supply power that is valid for a

period of 25 years. APDISCOM issued letters dated 12th July, 2019 to the Group requesting for revision of tariffs previously

agreed as per the PPAs to ₹ 2.44 per unit. Since the Group and other power producers did not agree to the rate revision,

APDISCOM referred the matter to the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the “APERC”) for revision of tariffs.
