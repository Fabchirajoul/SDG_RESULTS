Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer.

External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as unquoted financial assets. Involvement of external

valuers is decided upon annually and approval by the management. Selection criteria include market knowledge, reputation,

independence and whether professional standards are maintained. Valuers are normally rotated every three years. The

management decides, after discussions with the Company's external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for

each case.

At each reporting date, the management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be

re-measured or re-assessed as per the Company’s accounting policies. For this analysis, the management verifies the major

inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation.

The management, in conjunction with the Company's external valuers, also compares the change in the fair value of each asset

and liability with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature,

characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes. (Refer

note 45)

1.

Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions.

2.

Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy.

3.

average basis.

Inventories of Project materials (capital Inventory) are valued at cost on moving weighted average basis.

(n)

Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operation

Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction

rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying

amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits,

financial assets and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is

recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative

impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset

(or disposal group) is recognised at the date of de-recognition.

Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as

held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet.

A discontinued operation is a component of the Company that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that

represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose

of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of

discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit and loss.

translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year-end exchange rates are

generally recognised in profit or loss.

Erstwhile Gujarat Gas Company Limited and Erstwhile GSPC Gas Company Limited (Now collectively known as Gujarat Gas

Limited “GGL”) had signed Gas supply agreement with Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPCL) for purchase of

Re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG). As per the provision of said agreement, GGL has to pay interconnectivity charges to

GSPCL for the supply and purchase of RLNG at Delivery point which is charged to GSPCL by their supplier i.e. PLL Off takers

(GAIL India, BPCL, IOCL).

PGNRB had vide its order dated 13.09.2011 and the majority members of PNGRB (three member panel of Board) had vide its

order dated 10.10.2011 held that GAIL had adopted Restrictive Trade Practices by blocking off direct connectivity to GSPCL and

further, directed Respondents (PLL Off takers -GAIL India, BPCL, IOCL) to immediately give direct connectivity to GSPCL at

Dahej Terminal.

The PLL Offtakers (GAIL) filed appeals against the said PNGRB orders before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). On

23.02.2012 APTEL had issued an interim order for shifting the Delivery Point from GAIL-GSPL Delivery Point to GSPL-PLL

Delivery Point. On 18.12.2013 APTEL issued its judgment and required GSPCL to pay the amount of the difference between

` 8.74/MMBTU (exclusive of Service Tax) – earlier connectivity charges and ` 19.83/MMBTU (Exclusive of Service Tax) –

HVJ/DVPL Zone-1 tariff to GAIL for the period from 20th November 2008 to 29th February 2012.:

Erstwhile Gujarat Gas Company Limited and Erstwhile GSPC Gas Company Limited (Now collectively known as Gujarat Gas

Limited “GGL”) had signed Gas supply agreement with Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPCL) for purchase of

Re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG). As per the provision of said agreement, GGL has to pay interconnectivity charges to

GSPCL for the supply and purchase of RLNG at Delivery point which is charged to GSPCL by their supplier i.e. PLL Off takers

(GAIL India, BPCL, IOCL).

PGNRB had vide its order dated 13.09.2011 and the majority members of PNGRB (three member panel of Board) had vide its

order dated 10.10.2011 held that GAIL had adopted Restrictive Trade Practices by blocking off direct connectivity to GSPCL and

further, directed Respondents (PLL Off takers -GAIL India, BPCL, IOCL) to immediately give direct connectivity to GSPCL at

Dahej Terminal.

The PLL Offtakers (GAIL) filed appeals against the said PNGRB orders before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). On

23.02.2012 APTEL had issued an interim order for shifting the Delivery Point from GAIL-GSPL Delivery Point to GSPL-PLL

Delivery Point. On 18.12.2013 APTEL issued its judgment and required GSPCL to pay the amount of the difference between

` 8.74/MMBTU (exclusive of Service Tax) – earlier connectivity charges and ` 19.83/MMBTU (Exclusive of Service Tax) –

HVJ/DVPL Zone-1 tariff to GAIL for the period from 20th November 2008 to 29th February 2012.
