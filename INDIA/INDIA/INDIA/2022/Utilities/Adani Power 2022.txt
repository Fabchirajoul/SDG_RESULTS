Dear stakeholders,

The human civilisation is facing

several global challenges,

leading to a growing economic

uncertainty. People across the

world seek to overcome economic

disruption caused by two years of

a debilitating pandemic. Recent

geopolitical events enhanced

energy shortages, increasing

inflation and threatening to derail

global trade and commerce.

This volatility also challenged

policy makers and businessmen

with a lower room to manoeuvre.

These events re-emphasise the

burgeoning need to strengthen

self-reliance in critical sectors like

energy and critical spares, among

others.

Like all global economies, the

Indian economy is vulnerable to

commodity inflation and cost

shocks. However, the country

enjoys several advantages, being

one of the largest global coal

producers. Whereas renewable

energy protects the power

sector against global market

vagaries, it suffers the limitation

of intermittence and depending

on the availability of solar power

and wind velocity for wind energy

generation.

For 24x7 operations, your

Company established an

advanced fleet of strategically

located base load power plants

with proximate access to

domestic and imported coal. It

tied up long-term domestic fuel

supply to the extent of 69% of

M A N A G I N G D I R E C T O R ’ S C O M M U N I Q U E

Looking forward, as power

demand grows, your Company

will be prepared to fulfill the

need for reliable, cost-effective

and efficient base load supply

through a modern and efficient

portfolio.

Anil Sardana,: Managing

Managing Director

As a leading

thermal power

producer, we

recognise our role

in achieving the

purpose outlined

in the historic Paris

Agreement to limit

increase in the

planet’s temperature

to below 1.5º C.

derecognition of financial liabilities

The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations

are discharged, cancelled or have expired. An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with

substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability

and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a substantial modification of the terms of an

existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and

the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial

liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.

All amounts are in C Crores, unless otherwise stated:

Letter of Credit and Inland: Letter of Credit.

derecognition of financial liabilities

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged,

cancelled or have expired. An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with substantially different

terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a

new financial liability. Similarly, a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability

is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new

financial liability. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised

and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.

h

derivative financial instruments

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest

rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps

and cross currency swaps, Principal only Swap, coupon only swap etc. Further details of derivatives

financial instruments are disclosed in note 54.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and

are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain

or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges,

which is recognised in OCI and later reclassified to profit or loss.

embedded derivatives

Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are not financial assets within the scope of

Ind AS 109 “Financial Instruments” except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges (refer note (i))

are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those

of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL. These embedded derivatives

are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss.

Reassessment only occurs if there is either a change in the terms of the contract that significantly

modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required or a reclassification of a financial asset out of

the fair value through profit or loss category.

i

Hedge Accounting

The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which includes derivatives and non-derivatives in

respect of foreign currency risk, as cash flow hedges.

To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet all of the following requirements :

- there is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments,

- the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic

relationship,

- the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the

hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the

entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging

instrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking

various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the

letter dated 8th September, 2011

had granted the Company with Provisional Mega Power Status Certificate under the Mega Power

Policy for construction of its 1,370 MW Thermal based Power Plant. In terms of the same, REL has

availed exemptions of duty of customs and excise duty upon submission of bank guarantees worth

C 960.01 Crores and pledge of margin money deposits of C 59.67 Crores. The grant of final Mega

power status of REL is dependent upon REL achieving tie up for supply of power for 70% of its

installed capacity through long term Power Purchase Agreements by way of competitive bidding

and the balance through regulated market within stipulated time. The time period to achieve tie up

for supply of power as prescribed in Mega Power Policy has been further extended by 156 months

from the date of Imports, by the Ministry of Power, Government of India vide amendment dated 7th

April, 2022.

(b) REL had entered into a bulk power transmission agreement (‘BPTA’) with Power Grid Corporation

of India Limited (‘PGCIL’) dated 31st March, 2010 as per which REL was granted Long term Access

(‘LTA’) of 816 MW. However, owing to non-availability of PPA, which is beyond the control of REL,

REL was not in a position to utilise the LTA and has accordingly sought for surrender of the LTA,

for which PGCIL has raised demand of C 154.50 Crores towards relinquishment charges on REL.

However, the said claim will be subject to the outcome of the petition filed by REL before the CERC.

ii) Apart from above, the Development Commissioner, Mundra has issued a show cause notice to APMuL

for the period FY 2009-10 to FY 2014-15 in relation to custom duty on raw materials used for generation

of electricity supplied from SEZ to DTA, which amounts to C 963.94 Crores. APMuL has contested the

said show cause notice. Further, the management is of the view that such duties on raw material are

eligible to be made good to APMuL under the PPA with Discoms or are refundable from the Authorities.

iii) The Group has assessed that it is only possible, but not probable, that outflow of economic resources

will be required in respect of above matters.

letter dated 17th September, 2021, accepted the surrender petition by

APMuL and ordered for invocation of bank guarantee along with obligation to fulfil antecedent liability. On

29th September 2021, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in response to petition filed by APMuL, has stayed the

invocation of the said performance bank guarantee and restrained the Nominated Authority from taking

any coercive steps in the matter. Further the Hon’ble Delhi High Court vide its order dated 3rd March, 2022,

instructed the Nominated authority that the said performance bank guarantee shall be returned within one

week from date of execution of “: Letter of Intent of Coal Mines Production and Development Agreement”

with a new bidder.

The management expects to resolve all matters relating to Jitpur mine with Nominated Authority and

basis legal opinion obtained, is reasonably confident to realise the entire amount incurred towards the

development of the coal mine.

49 The Government of India conducted bidding for allocation of coal blocks, under the coal block auction

process whereby the MEL acquired the rights of Tokisud Coal Block (in the state of Jharkhand) on 18th March,

2015. Subsequently, in the month of April 2015, by way of a notification, Ministry of Power put cap on the

fixed/capacity charges due to which MEL had filed a writ petition in the High Court of Delhi for impugning

the above referred notification and also offered to return the said coal block to the Government of India

against return of the performance security in the form of Bank Guarantee of C 261.76 Crores provided by

MEL and moneys paid, without any penalty.

However, Hon’ble High Court vide its judgement dated 15th April 2019 dismissed the petition of MEL.

Subsequently, MEL has filed Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against the

order of the Hon’ble High Court. Meanwhile, the bank guarantee of C 261.76 Crores had been invoked by the

Nominated Authority.

The Union Ministry of Coal has re-allocated the said coal block to National Mineral Development Corporation

(NMDC) for commercial mining. On 16th March 2022, Nominated Authority had determined compensation

of C 163.23 Crores payable to MEL that is shown as other receivables.
