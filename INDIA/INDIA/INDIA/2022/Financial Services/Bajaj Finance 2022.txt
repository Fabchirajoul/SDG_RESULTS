managing director of a company, by way of commission not exceeding

one percent of the net profits of the company, if the company authorises such payment. Members of the

Company had approved such payment on 19 July 2017 for a period of five financial years commencing

from 1 April 2017.

In view of the increased demand on non-executive directors’ participation in Board and Committee meetings

and the higher responsibilities they are expected to bear in the interest of higher levels of excellence in

corporate governance on account of statutory and regulatory changes, it is proposed to continue to pay such

commission to the non-executive directors for a further period of five years from 1 April 2022 up to

31 March 2027. The same is in accordance with the Remuneration Policy of the Company.

The amount of commission shall be payable each year after the annual accounts are approved by the Board

of Directors and adopted by the members.

Within the overall limit approved by shareholders, the Board of Directors determines, on the recommendation

of Nomination and Remuneration Committee, commission for Directors based on several parameters

including attendance at Board/Committee meetings. For FY2022, total commission payable to non-executive

directors is ₹ 2.89 crore, which tantamount to 0.03% of the net profits as per section 198 of the Act.

Pursuant to the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2020, read with rules made thereunder, if a company fails

to make profits or makes inadequate profits in a financial year, any non-executive director of such company,

including an independent director, may be paid remuneration in accordance with Schedule V of the Act.

Accordingly, the said resolution includes an enabling provision.

The above payment to non-executive directors will be in addition to the sitting fees payable to them for

attending Board/committee meetings, which at present is fixed at ₹ 250,000 per meeting.

None of the Directors/key managerial personnel and/or their relatives, except the concerned non-executive

directors may be deemed to be concerned or interested, directly or indirectly, financially or otherwise, to the

extent of their shareholding, if any, and remuneration that may be received by them in the resolution set out

in item no. 8 of the Notice.

Dear Shareholder,

Let me begin on a personal note. It has been a difficult year for me. I know of no son or

daughter who hasn’t suffered from the death of the mother or father. But when your father

was Rahul Bajaj, it becomes something else altogether.

For long the Chairman and more recently the Chairman Emeritus of your Company, my father,

was a unique and very special person. Everyone who worked with him knew of his pinpointed

focus on details. People across the country lauded him for being fearless and outspoken.

His courage in honestly speaking his convictions was second to none. As was his generous

ability to accept his mistakes. He was a supremely confident human being. But within that

enormous confidence of his, he was truly compassionate and caring — not just to his family

but to all those whose lives he touched. More than being my father, he was my mentor,

counsellor and friend.

I could go on, but he would have emphatically disallowed any more of this emotional content.

I can see him chiding me by saying, “This is the Chairman’s: Letter. Not a public obituary.” So,

in deference to him, let me move on to the consolidated performance of your Company.

For the financial year 2021-22 (or FY2022):

• Number of new loans booked was 24.7 million.

• Customer franchise grew by 19% to 57.6 million.

• Assets under management (AUM) increased by 29% to ₹ 197,452 crore.

• Total income grew by 19% to ₹ 31,640 crore.

• Net interest income (NII) rose by 27% to ₹ 21,892 crore.

• Impairment on financial instruments decreased by 20% to ₹ 4,803 crore.

• Profit before tax (PBT) increased by 59% to ₹ 9,504 crore.

• Profit after tax (PAT) grew by 59% to ₹ 7,028 crore.

• Capital adequacy ratio as of 31 March 2022 was 27.22%, Tier I adequacy was 24.75%,

which is well above the RBI norms.

Your Company is now a thirty-five-year old enterprise. It has become a leading player in

the NBFC sector in India. Given your Company’s strong and sustainable growth trajectory,

I thought, I will briefly delve into elements of the core culture that defines it. In my

assessment, they are:

Resilience

Your Company displayed significant resilience in dealing with various external shocks in

recent years — be it the three successive COVID-19 waves, macroeconomic slowdown

that pre-dated COVID-19 or the fundamental changes in the industry that we belong to.

Through these shocks, your Company demonstrated tremendous grit and financial strength

and took all necessary actions without damaging any aspect of its business model or its

financial position.

Agility

Your Company prides itself in being agile. The focus on agility and speed were key to aligning

rapidly to the pandemic and then to the post-pandemic shifts in customer preferences

and expectations. Pandemic has made your Company even more nimble and responsive

than ever before.

And now to the another wholly owned subsidiary of your Company, BFinsec. Registered with

the SEBI as a stock broker and depository participant, BFinsec started its business operations

from August 2019. With a strong digital platform and seven branches, BFinsec offers demat,

broking, margin trade financing, financing for offer for sale to retail and HNI clients, and

enables funding for new equity listing (IPO finance) and ESOP financing. In FY2022, BFinsec

earned a net interest income of ₹ 95 crore; profit before tax of ₹ 23 crore; and profit after tax

of ₹ 17 crore. I look forward to Finsec growing impressively in the years to come.

COVID-19 created an unprecedented crisis, especially during the second wave (Delta). We

took multiple initiatives to ensure safety and well-being of employees and their families and

extended financial and logistical support towards diagnosis and treatment. Further, the Bajaj

group of companies supported mega vaccination drives which administered over 1 million

doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to beneficiaries in the districts of Pune and Aurangabad. In

addition, the Bajaj group contributed ₹ 170 crore to support the nation wide fight against

COVID-19, alleviate the immediate on-ground challenges, and enhance capabilities and

resources. This included the installation of 12 oxygen plants to provide more than 5,000

LPM of oxygen supply to rural and urban hospitals plus respiratory support equipment like

oxygen concentrators, ventilators and BiPaps to help augment their capacity in treating

COVID-19 patients.

The pandemic took a toll in FY2022, with your Company losing 25 employees to COVID-19.

Support was extended to the families of the deceased employees under the ‘Family

Assistance Program’, which covered financial support to these families for 48 months and

educational assistance to children till the age of 21.

As of today, none of us know when the next strain of the COVID-19 virus will arrive and how

infectious it may be. However, with the success of our nation-wide vaccination programme,

sufficient stocks of oxygen and adequate hospital beds, plus the fact that all Indians of 18

years and above can now get their booster shots, I think we have reasons to believe that the

next round may not lead to the kind of personal and economic devastation brought about by

the Delta variant. As a nation, we seem to have learnt how to cope with this pandemic. And

your Company is certainly organisationally and digitally well prepared to ensure that it will

continue growing its businesses as expected.

Therefore, I am optimistic of your Company’s growth, and of its ability to deliver superior

performance and greater shareholder value.

May we as a nation do better than before.

Yours sincerely,

Sanjiv Bajaj

internal processes and procedures as well as to regulatory and legal requirements providing timely feedback

to Management for corrective action, including minimising the design risk, if any.

Dear Shareholders,

Your directors present the thirty-fifth Annual Report along with the audited standalone and consolidated

financial statements for FY2022.

Sad demise of Shri Rahul Bajaj, Chairman Emeritus of the Company

At the outset, your directors express their profound grief on sad demise of Shri Rahul Bajaj, the iconic leader

of the Company, who passed away on 12 February 2022.

He lived an extraordinary life. He was the architect of one of the most respected business groups in the

country, a vocal proponent of entrepreneurship, and a voice of the industry at large.

He stood for what he believed, a man driven by values, bold in both expression and action. While he remained

the torchbearer of a family legacy that dates back to the founding days of our country, he championed the

creation of a new India.

While his passing away has left a huge void among us, he leaves behind an unparalleled foundation for all of

us to build upon.

The Board of Directors ('Board') places on record its whole-hearted appreciation of the invaluable

contribution made by him to the spectacular success of the Company and the Group over several decades.

Secretarial Standards of ICSI

The Company has complied with the requirements prescribed under the Secretarial Standards on meetings of

the Board of Directors (SS–1) and General Meetings (SS–2) read with the MCA circulars granting exemptions

in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Internal Audit

The internal audit function provides an independent view to the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee

and the Senior Management on the quality and efficacy of the internal controls, governance systems and

processes. In line with the RBI’s guidelines on Risk Based Internal Audit, the Company has adopted a Risk

Based Internal audit policy.

At the beginning of each financial year, an audit plan is rolled out after approval of the Audit Committee.

Pursuant to Risk Based Internal Audit Framework, internal audit is aligned in such a manner that assurance is

provided to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors on quality and effectiveness of the internal controls,

and governance related systems and processes.

The Audit Committee regularly reviews the internal audit reports and the adequacy and effectiveness of

internal controls. Significant audit observations, corrective and preventive actions thereon are presented to

the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.

Statutory Auditors

Reserve Bank of India, through its circular dated 27 April 2021, issued Guidelines for Appointment of

Statutory Auditors (the 'Guidelines'/'circular'), mandating NBFCs (including HFCs) with an asset size of

₹ 15,000 crore and above to appoint minimum two audit firms as joint auditors for a continuous period of

three years. Further, the Guidelines also specifies that an auditor who has completed a period of three years

(counted as one tenure) as on the date of the circular shall not be eligible for re-appointment in the same

entity for six years (two tenures) after completion of one tenure of three years. Subsequently, the RBI had

also released Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) dated 11 June 2021, inter alia, clarifying that the existing

statutory auditors who have completed three years with an entity would not be able to continue as auditors

with effect from second half of FY2022, even though they may not have completed their present tenure as

approved by the Members of the said entity.

Managing Director (MD) periodically.

Among the important tenets of

our CoEPC, are our unwavering

commitment to health, safety

and environment, along with

focus on elimination of waste and

conservation of resources, with zero

tolerance towards non-compliance.

 For adherence to ethical norms and

behaviour by the top leadership, we

have a separate Code of Conduct

(CoC) for Directors and Senior

Management. The CoC provides that

‘Directors and Senior Management

shall observe the highest standards

of ethical conduct and integrity

and shall work to the best of their

ability and judgement’. A declaration

from the Directors, and the Senior

Management’s affirmation to the

said CoC, is communicated to all

stakeholders by the MD, through the

Annual Report.

 BFL and its subsidiaries have

zero tolerance towards unethical

business practices. We ensure strict

compliance of CoEPC with respect

to anti-bribery, conflict of interest,

protecting assets and information

of the Company including customer

information and necessary policies

with respect to human rights,

prevention of insider trading,

prevention of money laundering,

to the Code of Practices and

Procedures for Fair Disclosure

of Unpublished Price Sensitive

(Prohibition of Insider Trading)

Regulations, 2015, as amended,

the CoC for regulation of trades

by designated persons covers all

concerned employees of BFL, its

parent company, subsidiaries and

other group companies. It protects

an employee against victimisation

in cases where insider trading is

reported by him/her. Periodic review

and updation of the policies is done,

as required. The Board takes non-

compliance seriously and initiates

action commensurate with proven

violations.

 In compliance with the provisions

of the SEBI Listing Regulations, the

Board through its Nomination and

Remuneration Committee (NRC) has

devised a policy on Board Diversity.

The board comprises of adequate

number of members with diverse

experience and skills, such that it

best serves the governance and

strategic needs of the Company. The

present composition broadly meets

this objective. The directors are

as profession, business, industry,

finance, law, administration,

research, banking, etc. and bring

with them experience/skills which

add value to the performance

of the Board. The directors are

selected purely based on merit with

no discrimination on race, colour,

religion, gender, or nationality. Core

skills/expertise/competencies of the

Board is available on the website

of the Company at https://www.

bajajfinserv.in/finance-board-of-

directors.

The Company, through its Parent

Company i.e. Bajaj Finserv Limited

(BFS), has signed charters of

Confederation of Indian Industry (‘CII’):

i. Model code of conduct for ethical

business practices,

ii. Charter on fair and responsible

workplace guidelines for

collaborative employee relations,

and

iii. Charter on fair and responsible

workplace guidelines for contract

labour.

 During FY2022, all employee

complaints linked to CoEPC (earlier

CoC) adherence were suitably

resolved, except for 4 complaints

pending as on 31 March 2022,

however these complaints have

been suitably resolved subsequently.

Imbued with a Culture of

Transparency

 At BFL Group, adherence to

transparency and fairness in

dealings with customers is

maintained in: letter as well as

We strive to combine

the Bajaj Group’s

historical values with
