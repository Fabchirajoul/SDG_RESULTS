CORPORATE INfORMATION

Details as on the date of issue of the Annual Report:

Dear Shareholders,

As I begin to write this message,

my first as the Chairperson of the

Board, I look back in appreciation

of Mr. Shailesh Haribhakti’s earnest

leadership in establishing LTFH as

a sustainable and well-capitalised

financial institution. With over five

decades of experience across various

sectors, Mr. Haribhakti has been

associated with LTFH since FY11

and has led the Company despite

turmoil in the financial industry.

His stewardship of the Board and

contribution in the areas of digital,

data analytics, ESG / Sustainability,

retailisation and risk management

has added great value and enabled

the Company to have a competitive

edge in the future. He also handled

the Company through the period of

Covid, when many of the staff were

finding it difficult to meet clients or

go to places of work.

This year, we witnessed the world

emerge from the pandemic’s

struggles, changing from ‘the New

Normal’ to ‘the Now Normal’ and

getting into a more settled outlook.

Notwithstanding the exceptional

circumstances, your Company

progressed steadily and accomplished

milestones, be it in businesses,

processes, or the safety of our

employees. We improved financial

performance metrics, strengthened

businesses, and revisited strategic

priorities for the next phase of

growth by building on our shared

strengths. This report presents your

Company’s accomplishments and

along with the management team,

we are resolved to build a healthier

and stronger Company.

The extent of recovery observed in

urban centres was different from

rural geographies where cashflows,

in addition to Covid impact, were

also burdened by the skewness of

monsoon and elevated costs of

cultivation. This resulted in demand

challenges in rural India which was

indicated by YoY decline in retail sale

of Two-Wheelers and tractors in the

country.

Macro-economic

Scenario

If FY21 was all about retooling

mindsets, strategies and businesses,

FY22 was about recovery. Post-

easing of Covid limitations,

economic activities picked up

across sectors. The Government’s

stimulus measures, the RBI’s

fiscal policies, and a broader

immunisation together handheld

the economy towards stability.

Forecasts of normal monsoons with

equitable distribution is likely to aid

strengthening of rural economy in

this year. According to the IMF, India

will remain the world’s fastest-

growing major economy from 2021

to 2024. The economy is anticipated

to witness a GDP growth of 7.2% in

FY23. With increased Government

spending post Union Budget 2022,

the rise in private consumption and

investment is further expected to

bolster economic activity and boost

demand.

Digital-led

Transformation Journey

We introduced the LTFS 2.0 strategy

five years ago to transform your

Company through the strategy of

‘Right Business’, ‘Right Structure’,

and ‘Right People.’ I am pleased to

report our significant progress in the

businesses we chose to continue,

and where we have built a strong

‘Right to Win’. Our ability to respond

to market expectations has grown

manifold using Digital and Data

Analytics, a journey your Company

started way back in 2016, helping

us deliver among the fastest Turn

Around Times (TATs) in the market

today. Whether for customer profile

identification, credit evaluation,

collection efficiency & analysis, and

customer retention, our technical

acumen in deploying analytics has

helped us gain a market-leading

position across products.

Geared up for Lakshya

2026

It is at this time that our parent

company, L&T, unveiled the way

forward strategy plan ‘Lakshya

2026’. Lakshya, which means

‘Target’, lays down a roadmap

for growth and value addition to

achieve the overarching goal of

Return on Asset (RoA) / Return on

Equity (RoE). Your Company intends

to align with the group’s ‘Lakshya’

through its ‘Lakshya’ of creating

a top-class digitally enabled retail

finance company. LTFH intends

to achieve this by focussing on

‘AIM. INNOVATE. CREATE.’ The

goal is to move the emphasis from

product-focus to customer-focus

and establish a robust retail portfolio

with excellent quality assets, as

well as strong NS3, thus creating a

Fintech@scale.

This would be built by crafting a

sustained and profitable growth

engine, keeping customers at the

core. A sustainable and profitable

In respect of disputes, the Group is hopeful of succeeding in appeals and does not expect any significant liabilities to materialise.

**

This disclosure is given pursuant to the notification no. DNBS.CC.PD.No. 252/03.10.01/2011-12 dated December 26, 2011 issued by Reserve

Bank of India. The Group has assessed its obligations arising in the normal course of business, proceedings pending with tax authorities and other

contracts including derivative and long term contracts wherever applicable. In accordance with the provisions of Indian Accounting Standard (Ind

AS) - 37 on ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’, the Group recognises a provision for material foreseeable losses when it has

a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of

which a reliable estimate can be made. In cases where the available information indicates that the loss on the contingency is reasonably possible

but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, a disclosure to this effect is made as contingent liabilities in the financial statements. The

Group does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially adverse effect on its financial statements.
