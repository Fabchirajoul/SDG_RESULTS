Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure as Chairman of the Board to write

to you in the 2021-22 Annual Report of your Bank.

The year gone by has been challenging for the global

ecosystem. Particularly, in the last few months, global

challenges have intensified.

The financial year 2021-22 started with the second wave

of COVID-19, which spread to rural India resulting in

lockdowns and disruptions in business and supply chains

across the country. But the situation recovered quickly from

then and there was a smooth pick up in the economy in

the second, third and fourth quarters of the year across all

key parameters. However, towards the end of the year, the

Ukraine conflict triggered higher energy prices, food and

commodity shortages and global inflationary pressures.

There is widespread talk of monetary tightening globally

as well as in India, and its potential spillover effects on

economies.

The Indian economy’s near-term prospects have been

affected by a spike in retail inflation which hit an 8-year high

of 7.8% per cent in April 2022. Coupled with a slowdown in

global growth, high energy prices, a cycle of rising interest

rates and a tightening of monetary policy by global central

banks and India, will all be key headwinds. In the recent

monetary policy review, the RBI hiked repo rate by 50 bps

to 4.90%, retained FY23 GDP growth forecast at 7.2% and

raised the CPI inflation forecast to 6.7%.

Against this backdrop, India is relatively better placed than

other emerging economies and even many developed

nations. Despite economic growth slowing during the

January-March 2022 quarter, India’s recovery is expected to

remain strong and it continues to be the fastest growing major

economy. For the full year FY22, India’s economic growth of

8.7% was lower than the 8.9% projected earlier, but higher

than 6.5% contraction in the previous year.

According to the IMF, growth at 8.2% will be the highest

among the large countries and by FY27, India will be the

world’s fifth largest economy with a GDP of $5 trillion at

market prices.

The momentum in the services sector, government’s focus

on enhancing public capital expenditure, the re-surfacing

of consumption demand, and positive growth in core

infrastructure industries, will continue to be key drivers

for growth.

With a strong foundation in place, a

clear strategy of Customer First and

a rich product suite, your Bank is

well-positioned for the future. Your

Bank has turned the corner and we

can all look forward to a bright and

sustainable future.

Managing Director & CEO’s Message

Looking forward to FY23: Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to write to all of you on the occasion

of the Annual Report 2021-22.

There have been global headwinds to the Indian economy

due to rising inflation globally, particularly in developed

markets, and the consequent tightening of interest rates

across the globe. Higher crude prices because of the Russia-

Ukraine conflict, coupled with pressure on the Rupee has

resulted in higher levels of imported inflation in our country.

During the COVID crisis, India had used its resources

rather conservatively and most of the benefits given to

micro-entrepreneurs in the Indian system were through

government guarantees, and not cash transfers. The benefit

of such conservative fiscal management is showing now, as

the increase in inflation in India is only marginal compared

to the pace of increase of inflation in developed countries.

The RBI has been raising interest rates off late to deal with

the situation.

Nevertheless, the fundamental strengths of the Indian

economy continue to be strong. India has a large domestic

consumption. The government is continuing to pursue

market-oriented “macro level” reforms like GST, Insolvency

and Bankruptcy Code, and divestments, etc., and at the same

time, implementing “micro level” reforms such as welfare

schemes of toilets, electricity, LPG, DBT, tap water, housing,

education, and subsidies to the poor without leakage. This

combination augurs well for our country in the long term.

In parallel, a massive digital infrastructure is being created

like e-gov, DigiLocker, Aadhaar, e-NAM, UPI, ONDC etc.

about which much has been written. All these initiatives have

massive long-term positive implications for our country and

our business.

Our Bank, over the last few years, has undertaken numerous

steps to create the foundation for sustainable growth going

forward. Before I get into the details of the businesses, I

would like to first discuss about the two fundamental pillars

of our foundation – Governance and Culture.

GOVERNANCE

Corporate Governance is the key element of our business

model. We maintain high standards of governance in terms

of accounting and business practices, disclosure levels,

prudent risk management, internal financial control, regulatory

compliance etc. guided by our Board of

Managing Director & CEO’s Message

stress tests like slowing economy and high inflation (2010-

2014), demonetization (2016), GST implementation (2017),

IL&FS crisis (2018-19). Even after COVID (2020-2022, our

Gross and Net NPA is trending down back to long term

average (Refer graph from Section 4.5). Thus, as the Indian

retail credit increases by say 15-20 times over the next 15-20

years, our bank is extremely well poised to participate in such

growth and indeed even contribute to such growth.

Corporate Banking opportunities

Corporate banking (> ` 10 crore) is a market of about ` 65

lac crore ($850b) and is an important part of our bank. Our

corporate banking offerings include trade finance, working

capital, term loans and treasury solutions. We also have

a cutting-edge corporate banking portal with industry-

first features such as single window experience across

products, intelligent report builder capability and online trade

regulatory portal. While we have reduced the infrastructure

financing portfolio, we look forward to increasing our non-

infra corporate book moderately and opportunistically, but

only with strong credit evaluation process. I’m happy to

say that we have sanctioned over ` 18,000 crore ($2.4b)

of new exposures on the corporate banking side in the last

three years of which about ` 11,000 crore ($1.5b) have been

disbursed and the quality of this book is pristine.

New business opportunities

Beyond lending, our bank has also launched several other

new businesses which will will provide us income streams

in future years. We have launched or recently scaled up our

best-in-class Digital Cash Management solutions (3,000

clients), Trade Forex, wealth management (AUM ` 6,536

crore ($870m), up 97% over last year), FASTag (8.5 million,

up 50% last year), toll acquiring business (420 toll plazas,

up 50% over last year), credit cards (7 lac cards), We have

also launched many variants of current accounts catering to

different segments such as merchants, professionals, start-

ups and new businesses.

We have significantly grown our Mobility and Transit payments

over the last 2 years. We are one of the largest banks in the

FASTag ecosystem and we help 8.5 million vehicles pay their

toll, fuel and parking payments in a digital mode.

We have also started distribution investment products,

mutual funds, PMS, AIF, insurance, Sovereign Gold bonds,

and many such products where we will make distribution

We will not dilute credit norms to

get more business. We are very

careful with our portfolio quality and

we monitor indicators minutely. We

rigorously subject the applications

through 10 specific filters. We

generally reject about 40-60% of the

applications received by us based on

product category as part of the above

stringent filtration process.

One key development is that our

funding costs have come down over

time, and as a result we have migrated

to safer customer segments while

maintaining similar margins.

Managing Director & CEO’s Message

The trend line on ROE is very

encouraging. In Q4 FY21, our

annualized ROE was 2.92%, in Q4

FY22 was 6.67%, and for Q4FY23,

we have guided for double digit ROE.

You can see for yourself how this

chart is rising.

Dear Shareholders,

The Financial Year 2021-22 marks the third full year of

operations of IDFC FIRST Bank. While the Bank stands

successfully transformed across all key business metrics,

we are continuously re-imagining how we can create a more

sustainable future through our approach to the Environment,

Social and Governance (ESG), and build value for our

customers, communities and all stakeholders.

ESG has always consider part of the Bank’s vision and

desired culture. The Bank has embedded social good in

its vision statement. We keep management of ESG as a key

priority. At IDFC FIRST Bank, we are acutely aware of the fact

that the development that meets the needs of the present

without compromising the ability of future generations to meet

their own needs, is the only way to build lasting sustainability.

Without sustainability, stability and impact on everything that

we do cannot be created.

The Bank is closely monitoring global developments in

climate related financial risks. Especially, in the light of the

recent IPCC 2022 report (Climate change 2022: Impacts,

Adaptation and Vulnerability) clearly highlights that India

could be one the most economically harmed countries due

to extreme climatic events like heat waves, water scarcity,

sea level rise etc. This poses significant physical risks which

can translate into Credit risk on the banks’ lending portfolio.

At the same time, global trends on climate risk adaption and

mitigation, India’s own Nationally Determined Commitments

for net zero by 2070 will present significant financing

opportunities in industries and economic activities which

will support transition to greener economy (like renewables,

electric vehicles etc) and climate adaptation (like infrastructure

projects for sustainable urban projects etc).

The Bank will consider these sustainable finance opportunities

in its strategic planning, new product design and technology

enablement.

The business strategy carved by the bank’s management

has an integrated approach to sustainability, inclusion, and

governance. Sustainability is an integral part of how we do

business. We can only be successful as an organisation if

we are mindful of the broader impact of our activities and

consistently embed material environmental, social and

governance (ESG) considerations into all that we do, across

our value chain. Ultimately, this will help deliver economic
