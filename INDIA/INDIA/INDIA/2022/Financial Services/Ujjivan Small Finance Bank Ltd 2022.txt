Dear Shareholders,

We, along with other SFBs,

started the banking journey

five years back. These five

years have been a mixed bag

with several achievements and

learnings. All of us have been

able to create a deposit book to

match asset side, invest in IT and

robust banking platform, create

new highs in financial inclusion.

However, cost and profitability

has been a challenge due

to the transformation as

well as external shocks like

demonetisation and COVID.

Financial year 2021-22 was marked

by challenges with dynamic changes

in the Board, Management, Work

Force, Market Value etc. However,

we ended the year on a high with

a remarkable turnaround and

record-breaking business numbers

in second half of the fiscal. I would

take this opportunity to thank

all the shareholders who trusted

us through these challenging

times. Our Board has witnessed

considerable changes during the

year, and Mr. Ittira Davis, a seasoned

banker took charge as the MD &

CEO of the Bank effective from

January 14, 2022, with the prior

approval of the RBI. Further, after

the induction of the new Board

members during the year, we are

glad that the present Board of the

Bank comprises of experienced

professionals totally committed

to help achieve our mission to be

the best digital mass market Bank.

In addition, to further strengthen

our Board, the Bank recently has

appointed Ms. Anita Ramachandran,

a veteran HR expert as an

Independent Director. This brings

the total number of female Board

Members to 30% of the total.

The Bank started its journey

towards the turnaround with

three-fold objectives of rebuilding

business volumes, improving

asset quality and reducing credit

cost and attracting good talent to

further stabilise our team. In order

to achieve these objectives, the

Bank formulated two “100-Day

Plans” in the third and the fourth

quarter and the combined efforts

of the Board, the Management

and our entire workforce made

the turnaround possible. The

Bank recorded a pre-provisioning

operating profit of ₹217 Crores

in the last quarter. Further, with

COVID fear receding and the

economy gradually normalising,

we’re seeing a good credit demand.

This is visible from all-time highest

gross disbursements and growth

in advances in the second half

of the last fiscal. Overall, I am

confident that FY 2022-23 will be

a strong comeback year for Ujjivan

where new milestones will be

achieved which will create a solid

platform for next growth cycle.

The Board will provide all support

and guidance to the management

in this next interesting phase

of the cycle to help achieve the

required stability and consistent

desired profitability.

Further on the talent front, despite

the high attrition that we faced

in the beginning of the year, we

have been progressing well on

attracting good talent at all levels.

Our Management team has been

strengthened by joining of senior

leaders with vast experience and

the attrition at the other levels has

also come under control with the

help of various HR initiatives.

I would also like to highlight

certain other important initiatives

taken by the Bank. In order to

ensure safety of our customers

as well, after extending the

vaccination drive to cover 99%+

of our employees and families,

we launched an initiative to help

our customers and families get

vaccinated. In the FY 2021-22

the Bank’s CSR activities were

also focused on COVID relief

and healthcare. In addition

to the same, our community

development programme, Chote

Kadam in partnership with

Parinaam Foundation carried out

5 civil projects in Karnataka, Goa,

Rajasthan and Gujarat for the

benefit of the underprivileged

communities. We have partnered

with skill development NGOs

like Cheshire Disability Trust,

Divya Nur Foundation and Savera

society towards the training and

placement of youths and women

in Maharashtra, Jharkand, Orissa

and Bihar. We also adopted an

education centre in Chennai which

is run for children of Persons with

Intellectual and Developmental

Disability (PwIDD).

During the year, the Bank initiated

necessary steps for the reverse

merger of Ujjivan Financial Services

Limited, the Holding Company

(UFSL) with the Bank in accordance

with applicable laws and guidelines.

As mandated by SEBI, the Bank

is in process to increase its public

shareholding to at least 25% by way

of Qualified Institutions Placement,

after which the merger application

will be submitted with the stock

exchanges and other regulators.

Further, the Bank is also exploring

a debt issue (sub-ordinated debt

eligible for Tier II Capital) since

augmenting the capital is necessary

for the Bank to grow in line with

its budgeted growth rate in the

current financial year.

FY 2022-23, I believe, looks

encouraging for the industry,

and Ujjivan especially, to reap the

benefits of the hard work put in

over the last five years. Economy

is gradually recovering from the

COVID impact. Our target customer

segment is resilient and is bouncing

back with strong credit demand. We

are confident that the momentum

built in the second half of FY 2021-

22, would continue in the current

fiscal and would enable Ujjivan to

attain newer heights in terms of

growth, size, deposit mobilisation

and profitability.

We are optimistic that the Bank has

the potential to grow exponentially,

and we are hopeful that the

long-standing shareholders will

appreciate the overall performance

and be rewarded in the years

to come.

Chairman

Dear Shareholders,

The first half of

FY 2021-22 was as

trying as the last

financial year, with

global financial

systems continuing to

face a severe stress

test. For India, the

challenge was even

more at the bottom

of the pyramid, as

multiple waves of the

pandemic continued

to disrupt economic

activities.

Ujjivan SFB saw the asset quality

worsening post COVID 2.0, led

by lower income and higher

provisioning, leading to losses

in the first half of the fiscal.

However, the Management acted

rather promptly, and drew up

recovery plans under the two

‘100-day plans,’ and executed

them from September 2021.

Accomplishing Targets

with the 100-day Plans:

The plans had three-pronged

objectives: (a) rebuilding business

volumes (b) improving asset

quality and reducing credit cost,

and (c) attracting good talent and

stabilising our team.

Rebuilding Business Volumes

Our disbursements in Q3 and

Q4 of this fiscal were the

highest ever for the Bank,

leading to a 68% y-o-y growth in

disbursements, and 20% y-o-y

growth in gross advances for the

year. MicroBanking and our retail

businesses, MSE and Affordable

Housing, contributed significantly

to this growth.

Overall deposits build-up was very

strong, 39% to ₹18,292 Crores

with credit-to-deposit ratio falling

below 100% for the first time

since we started operations. In

line with our vision of attracting

sticky deposits, we launched

non-callable FDs called Platina FD,

which helped us achieve growth

of 30% y-o-y for Retail Term

Deposits. Our CASA also showed

tremendous growth of 85%

y-o-y, taking the CASA ratio to

27%. This helped us achieve total

growth of 59% y-o-y from retail

branch banking.

Our cost of deposits continued

to decline – 6.2% for March 2022

versus 7.1% for March 2021.

Overall cost of funds for FY 2021-

22 was at 6.3%, down from 7.3% in

FY 2020-21.

Improving Collections, Asset

Quality

Focussed collection strategy was

drawn to reduce slippages, and

flow to higher buckets of PAR.

This covered collections from all

buckets, including the stress pool.

We strengthened our collection

team, added manpower, and also

involved collection agencies.

The results are heartening with

gross NPAs reducing to 7.1% from

11.8% as of mid FY2021-22. We

are maintaining a high provision

coverage ratio of 92%, including a

floating provision of ₹250 Crores,

which provides a solid cushion for

future earnings.

Building a Promising Talent

Pool

As part of our 100-day plans,

we also looked at strengthening

our senior leadership team and

stabilising our workforce morale.

To address attrition, we took

multiple steps like engaging with

employees on one-on-one basis,

and understanding their issues,

Our disbursements

in Q3 and Q4

of this fiscal were the

highest-ever for the Bank,

leading to a 68% y-o-y

growth in disbursements,

and 20% y-o-y growth in

gross advances for the

year. MicroBanking and

our retail businesses, MSE

and Affordable Housing,

contributed significantly

to this growth.

performs compliance risk assessment of the business,

support and control functions, and ensures quality of

compliance through continuous evaluations as part of

the monitoring and testing framework. Bank ensures

adherence to the regulatory guidelines on the KYC, and

Bank’s AML monitoring mechanism is automated with

a stringent transaction monitoring framework in place.

The Bank has also complied with the listing requirements

within three years from the date of commencement of

operations and is compliant with the regulatory reporting

framework for timely submission of data and Risk Based

Supervision (RBS) tranches, as mandated by RBI.

INTERNAL AUDIT

The Bank has an independent internal audit department

headed by Head of Internal Audit who functionally reports

to Audit Committee of the Board (ACB). The Internal Audit

Department functions with the objective to provide

independent assurance to the Board of Directors and

senior management, about the quality and effectiveness

of its internal control, risk management, and governance

framework.

IAD is appropriately staffed with qualified and competent

personnel, and has five audit verticals covering all

branches, central functions, IS audit, credit audit, and

concurrent audit. An annual audit plan, encompassing

all the audit areas, is prepared on a risk-based approach,

and submitted to the ACB for approval. Internal Audit

Department reports all significant observations along

with the management action plan to the ACB. The ACB

assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal

audit function, including the structure of the internal audit

department, progress of annual audit plan and staffing.

It ensures effective and independent review procedures.

VIGILANCE

During the year under review, the Bank emphasised on

prevention and early detection of fraud. We implemented

the enterprise-wide Fraud Risk Management System

{eFRMS}, targeted at securing the transactions of

the customers, monitoring any unusual activities and

enhancing the overall security with a view to mitigating

transaction-related fraud. e- FMRS covered all five

channels, such as core banking system, mobile banking,

internet banking, debit cards, and UPI.

A ‘Report to Vigilance’ process was also implemented to

provide a unified pathway to all Ujjivan employees, for

reporting of frauds directly to the vigilance team, helping

in bringing down the TAT for initiation of investigations,

and acting as a mechanism for regular tracking of cases.

The ‘Warriors of Ujjivan - Be Vigilant Awards,’ have been

spearheaded, in line with RBI directions. The idea is to

appreciate employees, who have gone beyond their call

of duty, in detection/prevention of fraud. 8 awardees have

been finalised for this honour.

Another praiseworthy feat has been receiving of the: letter

of appreciation from Bengaluru City Police (Kamal Pant

IPS, Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru city) for timely

responses to Cybercrime Incident Report (CIR) cell,

towards preventing and mitigating cyber-crimes.

During the review period, process improvement, suggested

by the Vigilance Department to the MicroBanking / Rural

Banking vertical, has been implemented.

The fraud reporting guidelines of Central Payment

Fraud Information Registry, all payment related frauds,

irrespective of value of the fraud, either reported by

the customer to the issuer banks or detected by the

Bank themselves, shall be reported via Electronic Data

Submission Portal (EDSP), within a maximum period of 7

calendar days, from the date of reporting/detection. We

have streamlined the same, and from the month of August

2021 onwards, reporting TAT has been brought down and

tracked closely.

CREDIT

FY 2021-22 was one of the most challenging years for the

Bank as well as the industry on a whole. In the middle of

April 2021, second wave of the pandemic struck India,

impacting the livelihoods of our customers, who had just

started to recover from the aftermath of the first wave.

The impact was so severe that the nation went into a

lockdown for about 2.5 months (mid April 2021 - Jun 2021).

Due to restrictions in mobility, collections got impacted

severely, thereby leading to deterioration in portfolio

quality. This impacted the profitability of the Bank as well.

The Bank, as a prudent measure, made a floating provision

of ₹250 Crores in the first quarter of the fiscal.

However, the second half of the financial year saw the

economy bouncing back to normalcy. This also resulted

in improvement of the business landscape, thereby

improving collection efficiency of the Bank, along with

increasing demand for credit.

A slew of measures were taken to minimise the impact on

our customers’ lives in the form of policy, process, strict

underwriting and portfolio management. Special focus

was on implementing key regulatory guidelines, and

strong collection infrastructure, which helped us support

existing customers, develop and offer new products,

and work on rebuilding customer credit behaviour, while

keeping credit costs in check. Continued connect with

customers helped us to appropriately respond to their

needs in a timely manner. This resulted in stabilisation of

the business during the second half of the year.

letter), monitoring of CA certified receivables statement received from borrowers

and EWS alerts. The Bank has also introduced an internal rating model with additional bank specific parameters. The

rating output is analysed in conjunction with the external rating for the purpose of credit decisioning and pricing.

VEHICLE LOANS

There were 25,702 Vehicle Loan borrowers with a total gross advances of `16,174 lakh. The Bank had launched digital

LOS for two-wheeler products in FY21, and scaled it to 100% in Q1FY22. The products variants offered under Vehicle

Loans are Two Wheeler loans and Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) Loans (Three wheeler ICE29, three wheeler electric

and small commercial vehicle). As part of the strategy overhaul, the Bank has temporarily stopped sourcing business

in the LCV segment. The Bank intends to restart these variants in the ensuing year post augmentation of capital.

Key Risk Indicators are defined and monitored at portfolio level while EWS triggers are analysed at account level.

Expert judgement scorecards are developed on the basis of customer track record. Two variants viz. thick (with rich

credit history), thin (with low credit history) are developed and deployed for the two-wheeler variants. Customers are

categorized on a four-point scale viz. green, yellow, amber and red. The delegation of authority is linked to the rating

outcome of the Borrower. Pricing is however not linked to these scorecards as per the dispensation received from RBI.

These scorecards are deployed primarily to collate data which can be further analysed to develop statistical scorecards.

Dear Stakeholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of

Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Limited (the “Bank or Ujjivan”),

it is our immense pleasure to present the 6th Annual Report

of the Bank along with the Audited Financial Statements

and Auditor’s Report thereon for the FY 2021-22.

OVERVIEW AND STATE OF AFFAIRS OF THE BANK

During the FY 2021-22, even though Ujjivan had a

difficult start, it witnessed a remarkable turnaround and

a promising close. Beginning of the year was muted as

the momentum built towards close of FY 2020-21 was

thwarted by outbreak of Covid 2.O which followed a

cycle of lower business and collections, rising NPAs and

provisioning leading to reduced profitability. Also, it led

to destabilizing Bank’s human resource across all levels –

field, mid-level and leadership as well as Board. However,

Ujjivan has a strong core and is resilient. Beginning with

strengthening of Board, we brought in a stability to the

entire team and attracted good talent across all functions

and verticals. Also, we implemented recovery plan – what

we call “100-day plan” to focus on business growth and

improving asset quality.

In second half of FY 2021-22, the Bank rebound from the

initial setback in the business in H1 due to COVID lockdown

and delivered record high business volumes. With the

opening up of markets gradually from Q1, volumes picked

up across asset and deposit businesses surpassing pre-

COVID normal by Q3. The Bank closed the financial year

on a high note, with the last quarter showing tremendous

growth across businesses. In the first half of the year, the

Bank took a cautious approach towards microfinance

lending in select pockets and increased focus on collections

post lockdown. The Bank also took a measured approach

towards its MSE lending in certain stressed segments

and has shifted its focus towards lending to semi-formal

and formal segment for better portfolio quality. Bank

maintained a cautious stance in its Institutional lending

business, lending to high rated entities, while maintaining

portfolio NIM. Business volumes under the MSE and

Affordable Housing vertical saw steady ramp up with

improved approval rates, despite restricted segments and

stringent credit policy. Bank’s assets under management

(AUM) registered a 20% Y-o-Y growth in FY 2021-22 over

that in the Previous Year. Despite slowdown in business

momentum in the first half on account of the pandemic,

the Bank witnessed significant Y-o-Y growth in all verticals:

Micro Banking (13.6%), Affordable Housing (33%) and MSE

(33%).

During FY 2021-22, Bank’s deposit book recorded 39%

y-o-y growth driven by new retail customers. 2.7 Lac

new retail deposit customers were on-boarded during

the year. CASA grew by 85% y-o-y, closing at 27% of the

total deposit book as of March 31, 2022 against 21% in

March 2021.

Collection strategy: Our foremost objective under our

100-day plans was to improve collection efficiency. This

was done through (a) strengthening collection team by

adding off-role staff and agencies, (b) focusing on digital

collection, (c) expanding our reach through tie-ups with

fintechs and payment bank, (d) data analytics driven

prediction models based on Early Warning Triggers

and geo-special analysis aiding in better collections, (e)

expediting legal process on secured book. We are very

pleased with the results and the increased collection

efficiency. This has yielded in improvement in our asset

quality parameters.

of Master Direction on Amalgamation of Private Sector

Banks, Directions, 2016 dated April 21, 2016, Three (3)

months prior to completing five years from the date

of commencement of business of small finance bank.

Accordingly, the Bank has initiated necessary steps for the

the RBI Requirement of promoter shareholding dilution.

Therefore, the Board of the Bank at its meeting held on

October 30, 2021 considered and approved a Scheme

of Amalgamation (“Scheme”) between Ujjivan Financial

Services Limited (UFSL, promoter of the Bank) and the:

letter dated December 02,

2021 acceded to relax the three-year minimum promoter

lock-in requirements in the Bank to the extent required

to implement the Scheme soon after receiving final NCLT

approval. However, SEBI advised the Bank to ensure

compliance with MPS as prescribed by SEBI Circulars

dated November 30, 2015 and February 22, 2018 and then

proceed with the filing of the scheme documents with

the exchanges.

During the period internal working group of the RBI,

pursuant to the Recommendations of the Internal

Working Group to Review Extant Ownership Guidelines

and Corporate Structure for Indian Private Sector Banks

dated October 20, 2020 and November 20, 2020, had

recommended that no intermediate sub-targets between

five to 15 years may be required and that promoters may

submit a dilution schedule which may be examined and

approved by the RBI. The progress in achieving the agreed

milestones must be periodically reported by the banks and

shall be monitored by the RBI. (“Dilution Requirement”)

Pursuant to the circular issued by the RBI dated

November 26, 2021 (“November 26 Circular”), the RBI

inter alia accepted the recommendation on the Dilution

Requirement without any modification subject to

submission of a dilution schedule with the RBI. However,

the proposed recommendations have not been notified as

yet by the RBI by way of a separate notification.

However, to ensure that the MPS compliance is met well

before the due date i.e. by December 11, 2022 (within 3

years of listing of the Bank), the Board at its Meeting on

February 05, 2022 evaluated various methods to achieve

the MPS by reducing UFSL’s holding in the Bank from

present 83.32% to 75% or lower. After deliberations,

the Board approved the option to carry out a Qualified

Institutions Placement (“QIP”) in terms of the SEBI ICDR

Regulations to the extent necessary to achieve the MPS

norms, provided the total issue proceeds shall not exceed

`600 crores.

The Bank has obtained an approval from its Shareholders

for the aforesaid QIP through a postal ballot and the Bank

is in the process of completing its QIP during the FY 22-23.
