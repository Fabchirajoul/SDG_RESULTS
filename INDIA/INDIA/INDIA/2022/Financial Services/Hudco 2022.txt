Dear Shareholders, Ladies & Gentlemen,

Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent seemingly unending Russia-Ukraine war, with resurgent waves of mutant

variants, supply-chain disruptions, and also return of inflation in both advanced and emerging economies has resulted in uncertainty

for the global economy. The cyclical slowdown that set in the Indian economy before the outbreak of the pandemic, got aggravated

during COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has caused a deep dent on livelihoods, production capacities and confidence levels

with far-reaching economic and social costs. With serious health concerns, governments across the States, implemented measures

like lockdown and reduced economic activity to curb the virus spread. During the year, State Govt. Agencies have taken up very

few projects resulting in limited business opportunities for HUDCO. India’s recovery from the pandemic, despite its innate strength

of macroeconomic fundamentals, remains fragile and is yet to become broad-based. Despite all these hurdles, your Company has

achieved a sanction of ` 20663 crore and disbursement of ` 8887 crore and earned a profit after tax of ` 1716 crore.

I would like to share the highlights of HUDCO’s performance during 2021-22, vis-a-vis the economic environment, challenges faced

and future outlook of the Company, which clearly depicts that your Company is on growth path.

1. Economic Environment

According to the data released by National statistical office (NSO) in its provisional estimates of GDP India’s real GDP is estimated

to have grown by 8.7% in 2021-22. The growth of 8.7% in GDP in 2021-22 came against the backdrop of a 6.6% contraction of

GDP in the previous fiscal i.e. 2020-21. The data also showed that the Q1, Q2, Q3 &Q4 GDP had grown by 20.1%, 8.4%, 5.4%

& 4.1% respectively in 2021-22 which were better than the corresponding quarterly growth rates achieved in the previous fiscal.

(Source: press note dated 31.05.2022 on provisional estimates of Annual National Income 2021-22, NSO, MoSPI). Although the

overall economic performance was better in 2021-22 compared to 2020-21, the negative impact and the uncertainties arising out

of the pandemic was evident on the speed of recovery. Particularly, the Q4 growth was adversely affected by the spread of the

Omicron variant of the coronavirus. Against this backdrop the Government ensured a soft interest rate regime, with ease in extended

repayment mechanism and supportive policies for ensuring to maintain economic growth.

2. Sectoral Overview and Government Policy Initiatives

The Government has outlined its focus on orderly urban development in 2022-23 budget. The focus would be to nurture the megacities

and their hinterlands to become current centres of economic growth and also to facilitate tier 2 and tier 3 cities to develop in future.

It was announced in the Budget 2022-23 that a high-level committee of reputed urban planners, urban economists and institutions

will be formed to make recommendations on urban sector policies, capacity building, planning, implementation and governance. The

budget has also announced that 80 lakh houses shall be completed in 2022-23, for the identified eligible beneficiaries of PM Awas

Yojana for both rural and urban areas and ` 48,000 crore was allocated for this purpose. The Central Government will work with

the state governments for reduction of time required for land and construction related approvals, for promoting affordable housing

for middle class and economically weaker sections in urban areas. Further effort would be there to work with the financial sector

regulators to expand access to capital along with reduction in cost of intermediation. (Source: Union Budget speech 2022-23).

In the Union Budget 2022-23, the Government also focused on infrastructure development by outlining PM Gati Shakti, a transformative

approach for economic growth and sustainable development. The approach is driven by seven engines, namely, Roads, Railways,

Airports, Ports, Mass Transport, Waterways and Logistics Infrastructure. All seven engines will pull forward the economy in unison.

These engines are supported by the complementary roles of Energy Transmission, IT Communication, Bulk Water & Sewerage and

Social Infrastructure. The approach would be powered by Clean Energy and Sabka Prayas - the efforts of the Central Government,

state governments and private sector together - leading to huge job skill development and entrepreneurial opportunities for all,

especially the youth. (Source: Union Budget speech 2022-23).

letter dated 16th December, 2020 for special dispensation to HUDCO for granting exemption from

the clause pertaining to 50% lending to individuals and treat HUDCO as HFC.

RBI in its reply: letter dated 10th February, 2021 has informed its inability to accede to HUDCO’s request for exemption

and accordingly suggested to submit a Board approved plan to fulfill the principal business criteria for HFC or to

convert into a NBFC-ICC.

In the meantime, as per RBI’s Master Directions issued vide Notification dated 17th February, 2021 for NBFC-HFC,

certain circulars issued by NHB have been repealed. As HFC status is ruled out by the RBI, the decision to convert

HUDCO into NBFC- Investment and Credit Company (ICC) or Infrastructure Finance Company (IFC) from the present

HFC status, requires detailed analysis to be carried out on various pros and cons.

RBI was requested vide letter dated 8th March, 2021 to grant six months’ time for transition to NBFC and to retain the

status of HFC and to continue operations with the special dispensations/ relaxations given earlier with regard to credit

concentration norms/ exposure norms permitted by NHB/ RBI.

In response to HUDCO’s request, RBI vide letter dated 26th March, 2021 has granted six months’ time to submit Board

approved plan for conversion to NBFC. RBI has further advised that the exemptions from concentration/exposure

norms granted previously by NHB/RBI would continue to apply at present subject to the conditions specified while

granting such exemptions. Owing to second wave of Covid 19 pandemic, RBI was requested vide letter dated 23rd

September, 2021 to grant further six months’ time to HUDCO for submission of Board approved plan for transition

to NBFC – IFC. In response to HUDCO’s request, RBI vide letter dated 27th September, 2021 granted time till 31st

December, 2021 to submit Board approved plan for conversion to NBFC.

letter dated 28th December, 2021 to grant three months’ time for submission of application to RBI and to retain the

status of HFC and to continue operations with the special dispensations/ relaxations given earlier with regard to credit

concentration norms/ exposure norms permitted by NHB/ RBI. In response to HUDCO’s request, RBI vide: letter dated

31st December, 2021 granted time till 31st March, 2022 for conversion from HFC to NBFC-IFC.

HUDCO has submitted application to RBI on 29th March, 2022 to convert from HFC to NBFC-IFC. The RBI vide its

letter dated 8thApril, 2022 called for specific details and information from HUDCO.

The management reckons to receive the said approval from RBI in FY 2022-23. Till such time, HUDCO continues to

retain the status of HFC.

14)

RBI has issued Master Directions for NBFC-HFC vide their Notification dated 17th February, 2021. RBI’s credit concentration

norms state that a Housing Finance Company’s lending exposure to any single borrower or investment in the shares of another

company should not exceed 15% of its owned funds and lending exposure to any single group of borrowers or investment in

the shares of single group of companies should not exceed 25% of its owned funds. As per the said circular, Investment of a

Housing Finance Company (HFC) in the shares of another HFC shall not exceed 15% of the Equity Capital of the investee

company.

The Company is complying with National Housing Bank’s credit concentration norms except in one case of investment in

another HFC viz., Indbank Housing Ltd. (IBHL), a subsidiary of Indian Bank in which HUDCO has invested 25% capital of

investee.

HUDCO had invested `2.50 crore, even before guidelines were applicable, in the Equity Shares of IBHL, whose total paid-up

capital is `10 crore resulting in investment to the extent of 25% of the equity.

IBHL through their letter has informed that the earlier decision for merger of IBHL with the parent bank was taken by the IBHL

Board on account of the then situation prevailing at that point of time. IBHL took various steps towards revival of housing finance

business. The authorized capital of the company was increased from `50crore to `150crore The company-initiated steps for

restructuring of capital by converting loan liabilities of Indian Bank into Compulsory Convertible Preference shares (CCPS)

carrying 0.01% rate for `129crore. However, the required permission of RBI was not forthcoming and hence conversion of loan

liability to CCPS could not be carried out.

IBHL has engaged the services of SBI Capital Market Services Ltd with effect from 1st August 2019 for the purpose of finding

suitable investor. Since then, several discussions have taken place with real estate players and PE investors, however, the

deal is yet to materialize. HUDCO would also exit partially/ fully once new investor is finalized

NHB/ RBI, from time to time, has given certain relaxations from credit concentration norms considering the role envisaged

for HUDCO. However, vide its letter No. NHB(ND)/ DRS/ SUP/ 3911/ 2018 dated 2nd April, 2018, NHB capped the credit

concentration (Exposure) limit for Government/Public agencies as follows:

(a)

The individual exposure limit of HUDCO to Government/Public Agencies (inclusive of the exposure limit of upto 30%

for infrastructure/ non-housing related activities) shall be capped at 50% of its NOF.

letter dated 16th December, 2020 for special dispensation to HUDCO for granting exemption from

the clause pertaining to 50% lending to individuals and treat HUDCO as HFC.

RBI in its reply: letter dated 10th February, 2021 has informed its inability to accede to HUDCO’s request for exemption

and accordingly suggested to submit a Board approved plan to fulfill the principal business criteria for HFC or to

convert into a NBFC-ICC.

In the meantime, as per RBI’s Master Directions issued vide Notification dated 17th February, 2021 for NBFC-HFC,

certain circulars issued by NHB have been repealed. As HFC status is ruled out by the RBI, the decision to convert

HUDCO into NBFC- Investment and Credit Company (ICC) or Infrastructure Finance Company (IFC) from the present

HFC status, requires detailed analysis to be carried out on various pros and cons.

RBI was requested vide letter dated 8th March, 2021 to grant six months’ time for transition to NBFC and to retain the

status of HFC and to continue operations with the special dispensations/ relaxations given earlier with regard to credit

concentration norms/ exposure norms permitted by NHB/ RBI.

In response to HUDCO’s request, RBI vide letter dated 26th March, 2021 has granted six months’ time to submit Board

approved plan for conversion to NBFC. RBI has further advised that the exemptions from concentration/exposure

norms granted previously by NHB/RBI would continue to apply at present subject to the conditions specified while

granting such exemptions. Owing to second wave of Covid 19 pandemic, RBI was requested vide letter dated 23rd

September, 2021 to grant further six months’ time to HUDCO for submission of Board approved plan for transition

to NBFC – IFC. In response to HUDCO’s request, RBI vide letter dated 27th September, 2021 granted time till 31st

December, 2021 to submit Board approved plan for conversion to NBFC.

The proposal for transition of HUDCO from its present status of HFC to NBFC – IFC was approved in principle by the

HUDCO Board in its meeting held on 28th December, 2021. Thereafter HUDCO required approval from Ministry of

Housing and Urban Affairs for the conversion before submission of application form to RBI. RBI was requested vide

letter dated 28th December, 2021 to grant three months’ time for submission of application to RBI and to retain the

status of HFC and to continue operations with the special dispensations/ relaxations given earlier with regard to credit

concentration norms/ exposure norms permitted by NHB/ RBI. In response to HUDCO’s request, RBI vide letter dated

31st December, 2021 granted time till 31st March, 2022 for conversion from HFC to NBFC-IFC.

HUDCO has submitted application to RBI on 29th March, 2022 to convert from HFC to NBFC-IFC. The RBI vide its

letter dated 8th April, 2022 called for specific details and information from HUDCO.

The management reckons to receive the said approval from RBI in FY 2022-23. Till such time, HUDCO continues to

retain the status of HFC.

14)

RBI has issued Master Directions for NBFC-HFC vide their Notification dated 17th February, 2021. RBI’s credit concentration

norms state that a Housing Finance Company’s lending exposure to any single borrower or investment in the shares of another

company should not exceed 15% of its owned funds and lending exposure to any single group of borrowers or investment in

the shares of single group of companies should not exceed 25% of its owned funds. As per the said circular, Investment of a

Housing Finance Company (HFC) in the shares of another HFC shall not exceed 15% of the Equity Capital of the investee

company.

The Company is complying with National Housing Bank’s credit concentration norms except in one case of investment in

another HFC viz., Indbank Housing Ltd. (IBHL), a subsidiary of Indian Bank in which HUDCO has invested 25% capital of

investee.

letter has informed that the earlier decision for merger of IBHL with the parent bank was taken by the IBHL

Board on account of the then situation prevailing at that point of time. IBHL took various steps towards revival of housing finance

business. The authorized capital of the company was increased from `50 crore to `150 crore The company-initiated steps for

restructuring of capital by converting loan liabilities of Indian Bank into Compulsory Convertible Preference shares (CCPS)

carrying 0.01% rate for `129 crore. However, the required permission of RBI was not forthcoming and hence conversion of loan

liability to CCPS could not be carried out.

IBHL has engaged the services of SBI Capital Market Services Ltd with effect from 1st August 2019 for the purpose of finding

suitable investor. Since then, several discussions have taken place with real estate players and PE investors, however, the

deal is yet to materialize. HUDCO would also exit partially/ fully once new investor is finalized.

NHB/ RBI, from time to time, has given certain relaxations from credit concentration norms considering the role envisaged

for HUDCO. However, vide its: letter No. NHB(ND)/ DRS/ SUP/ 3911/ 2018 dated 2nd April, 2018, NHB capped the credit

concentration (Exposure) limit for Government/Public agencies as follows:

(a)

for infrastructure/ non-housing related activities) shall be capped at 50% of its NOF.

(b)

The exposure limit of HUDCO for State Government (under group exposure) shall be capped at 150% of its NOF

in respect of State of Telangana and 100% of NOF for all other States. HUDCO is required to take suitable steps to

bring down the group exposure in respect of State of Telangana also to 100% within a maximum period of 3 years

The conditions relating to compliance by the concerned State with the FRBM limits shall continue to be ensured by

HUDCO.

The Board of

letter no 1736/3.10.136/2019-20 dated 5th March, 2020 granted relaxation of credit concentration norms for

exposure to Telangana State Housing Corporation Limited (TSHCL) upto 75% of Net Owned Fund of HUDCO subject to

following conditions:

(i)

The additional exposure is backed by explicit guarantee from State Government.

(ii)

The exposure to TSHCL will be brought down to 50% of NOF by 31st March, 2023 as prescribed by NHB (ND)/DRS/

SUP/880/2019: letter dated 8th March, 2019.A detailed action plan to this effect may be forwarded to NHB.

(iii)

Other conditions as prescribed by NHB vide their above mentioned letter dated 8th March, 2019 are adhered to.
