Message from the Chairman 6

From the: Managing

MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN: Dear Shareholders,

The world, as we knew it, remarkably

changed, two years back. Today, the

pandemic and its overwhelming impact

is not new to us, and we knew how it

disrupted the world. Maintaining stability

and growth during turbulent times

demonstrates our resilience and agility.

Even during the times of pandemic,

we underwent digital transformation

and remained singularly committed to

delight our customers with cutting-edge

products and new industry benchmarks.

As we complete 33 years of remarkable

journey of nurturing relations with our

borrowers, we are set to capitalise on

the conducive market. Even during the

turbulent times of the past two years,

we have displayed our solid foundation

and a strong resilience for a sustainable

future and remarkable growth.

With the dream of home ownership

being an overarching aspiration for

every Indian today, we are serving and

facilitating 30 lakh customers realise

their inherent dreams. Through our key

objective and single-minded vision,

we are powering India’s progress by

enabling every Indian to own a home and

driving transformative change.

As a long-term participant and with

a strong track record and industry

experience, we have experienced

several financial and economic cycles,

and always endeavoured to stay ahead

of the curve. Over the years, we have

grown stronger and built a huge base of

30 lakh customers with an outstanding

loan book of ` 2.52 lakh crore, laying

a strong foundation for sustained

business growth.

Enthused by our business metrics,

our parent company Life Insurance

Corporation of India (LICI) having made

a capital infusion of ` 2,335.51 crore

into the Company. This demonstrates

their confidence in the Company and

adds credibility to our balance sheet.

The capital infusion has strengthened the

capital adequacy and helped us become

adequately capitalised.

WHAT DIFFERENTIATES US

We have differentiated ourselves

strategically aligning with customer

needs, being innovative in our approach

and laying an emphasis on quality

business, and creating long-term value

for our stakeholders and investors.

Today, about 78% of our outstanding

loan portfolio comprises of the salaried

class. With an asset-liability mix that is

conducive to manage an increasingly

higher rate environment and an

increasing loan portfolio, we are growing

stronger each day. We continue to be

in a position of strength to increase

our market share and consolidate

our leadership.

BEING SMART AND EFFICIENT

Despite monetary tightening, we

reduced our cost of funds by 41 basis

points in the year. Our incremental

cost of funds was 5.10%. Our weighted

average cost of funds on total borrowed

funds reduced from 8.49% in FY2019 to

6.93% in FY2021 and further to 6.52% in

FY2022. We maintain one of the lowest

cost of funds with AAA rating by all

rating agencies since 2001-02, remaining

better placed on liabilities front.

Our Asset-Liability mix is conducive

to manage a high-rate environment.

The ability to source low-cost liabilities

from strong fundamentals and effective

liability management ensures that

despite rising rates, we managed to

reduce cost of funds.

Over the years, our liability profile

has gradually altered. From a higher

portion of Non-Convertible Debentures

(NCD), the liability portion of banks,

deposits and National Housing Bank has

increased. Continuous negotiation on

the liability side and proactive liquidity

management led to further reduction

in cost of funds.

Better asset-liability mix, strong recovery

and improved collection efficiency

helped us leverage good Net Interest

Margins (NIM). Our margins were stable

in the range of 2.20 to 2.40% in FY2021

to 2.29% in FY2022. Our borrowings

are a mix of fixed and floating, with

a substantial amount into fixed rates,

which helps maintain ratios and

stabilise NIMs.

Annual Report 2021-22

MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO’S DESK: Dear Shareholders,

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic

has taught us a lot, and these

learnings will help evolve for the

better. The pandemic unleashed a

new world order in which agility and

digital adoption emerged as the new

norms. At LIC Housing, we stood up

to the challenge and quickly adapted

to the challenging conditions to

support our business operations.

With a vintage of 33 years, we have

seen various credit and economic cycles

and have come out unscathed and

stronger than ever. We had a satisfying

year with a rising loan book, while we

maintained profitability, asset quality

and solvency, and had the ability to

negotiate challenges – moving from

strength to strength. Today, we take

pride in having a credible portfolio

and being a tech-driven company with

tech-centric business model, innovation

strategy and growth. Both these are

our strategic differentiators over the

medium-to-long term.

Despite the tough macro environment,

a healthy growth on disbursements was

witnessed, especially in the individual

home loan segment. A strong business

traction led to strong disbursement

and AUM growth. The outstanding

portfolio grew, retail disbursements

rose, and net interest income benefited.

We worked out a strategy to grow the

business and improve asset quality with

a strong focus on collection efficiency.

Our GNPA dropped quarter on quarter

this year (QoQ), giving us the leverage

in maintaining good Net Interest

Margin at 2.29%.

FY2022 IN BRIEF

The year witnessed us helping our

customers battle the COVID-19

disruptions and engaging with them to

weather the tough situation. At LICHFL,

we followed the RBI restructuring norms

in helping borrowers reorganise their

business by offering moratorium and

restructuring the loans. However, our

underwriting practices during COVID-19

and post that were stringent enough to

weed out any delinquencies.

During the pandemic, as people

saved money for unforeseen

circumstances, liabilities took a backseat.

Hence, we enabled our customers to

take advantage of the Emergency Credit

Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), in

view of the economic distress caused

by the pandemic. Through this, we

helped the MSME sector with small

working capital to tide over short gaps,

operational liabilities and restart the

business impacted.

We interacted with the affected

borrowers to guide them on the

moratorium offered by the government,

besides also counselling them on how

best to avail these benefits. We also

offered the benefit of one-time loan

restructuring (OTR) to eligible

borrowers, in line with the regulatory

norms. We opened various touchpoints

to help customers and provided

them with options. We also offered

them to make part-payment so that

inconvenience to borrowers was

minimised. Further, we trained the staff

on ways to interact with the borrowers

and developed educational material.

With schemes and waivers to borrowers,

nearly 2.76% of our loan portfolio

was under OTR.

PERFORMING DESPITE A

CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT

Despite the COVID-19 disruptions

and a turbulent environment, this has

been a remarkable year for LICHFL.

We have become India’s one of the

leading housing finance company in

terms of book size. During the year, we

maintaining experience and continuity.

planning, the Company puts the necessary financial and human

resources in place so that its objectives can be met.

skills and viewpoints to aid the Company in advancing its

strategy. In addition, promoting senior management within the

organization fuels the ambitions of the talent force to earn future

leadership roles.

As part of succession planning and in order to ensure stability and

effective implementation of long term business strategies and for

smooth transition at MD & CEO level, the Board considered and

approved that senior official from LIC of India may be deputed to

LIC Housing Finance Limited, at least 4 to 6 months in advance

before the retirement / elevation / transfer of MD & CEO, by

creating a new position of Chief Operating Officer (COO) who

would subsequently take over as MD & CEO on retirement /

elevation / transfer of the MD & CEO with a view to ensuring

stability and effective implementation of long term business

strategies.

In terms of Article 138(b) of the Articles of Association of

Company, LIC of India is entitled to nominate upto one third of

the total number of directors of the Company and therefore, the

Board after consideration, approved posting of senior official

from LIC of India as Nominee of LIC of India for the post of COO

as part of succession plan for MD & CEO with a view to ensuring

stability and effective implementation of long term business

strategies. LIC of India had posted Shri Y.Viswanatha Gowd as

(Accounts)

Place: Mumbai

Date : May 18, 2022:

Managing Director & CEO is identified as the Chief

Operating Decision Maker (CODM) by the management

of the Company. CODM has identified only one operating

segment of providing loans for purchase, construction,

repairs renovation etc. and has its operations entirely

within India. All other activities of the Company revolve

around the main business. As such, there are no separate

reportable segments, as per the Indian Accounting

Standard (Ind AS) 108 on ‘Segment Reporting.

3. Key Estimates and Judgements:

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity

with Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) requires

the management to make estimates, judgements

and assumptions. These estimates, judgements and

assumptions affect the application of accounting policies

and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,

the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at

the date of the financial statements and the reported

amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.

Accounting estimates could change from period to

period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised

prospectively. The Management believes that the

estimates used in preparation of the financial statements

are prudent and reasonable. Future results could differ due

to these estimates and the differences between the actual

results and the estimates are recognised in the periods in

which the results are known / materialise.

3.1 Determination of Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”)

The measurement of impairment losses (ECL) across

all categories of financial assets requires judgement, in

particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of

future cash flows based on Company’s historical experience

and collateral values when determining impairment losses

along with the assessment of a significant increase in credit

risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors,

changes in which can result in different levels of allowances.

Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting

judgements and estimates include:

Bifurcation of the financial assets into different

portfolios when ECL is assessed on collective basis.

Company’s criteria for assessing if there has been a

significant increase in credit risk.

Development of ECL models, including choice of

inputs / assumptions used.

The various inputs used and process followed by the

Company in measurement of ECL has been detailed

in Note 38.4.2.3

3.2 Fair Value Measurements

In case of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded

or disclosed in financial statements the company uses:
