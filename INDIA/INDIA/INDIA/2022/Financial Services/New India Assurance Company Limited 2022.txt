Key Managerial Personnel as per IRDAI:

Dear Stakeholders

Every country across the globe has faced grave concerns due

to the unprecedented challenge and long lasting impact of the

Coronavirus. The impact has been felt in every sector and in

everyday life. Despite several uncertainties, the Company has

acted as a source of strength for individuals, the communities in

which we operate and the economies that depend on us. Around

14,000 colleagues of the company worked tirelessly as individuals

and as teams to deliver to all our stakeholders. The Company once

again demonstrated its strength, the resilience, dedication and

commitment of its employees.

It gives me immense pleasure to share with you the highlights

of the performance of New India Assurance Company during

the financial year 2021-22. During the course of FY22, the gross

premium written by non-life insurers reached Rs. 220,772 crores

(US$ 28.14 billion), an increase of 11.1% over the same period

in FY21. Company’s gross direct premium income in India grew

by 14.08%, which was higher than the industry growth rate. The

Company continued to be the market leader with over 14.75%

market share.

The company settled about 3,760 Cr worth of COVID claims during

the year. The surge in incurred claims due to the Coronavirus

pandemic adversely impacted the financial performance. However,

the operating performance in FY22 excluding the COVID claims

remains satisfactory.

One-time initial provisions towards employee benefits due to SVRS

and sick leave totalling 121 Cr also negatively affected the results.

The foreign business suffered a setback because of additional

provisions required in the UK operations due to unprecedented

inflation and some adverse claim development on a few large-

sized losses in the Dubai operations.

The solvency ratio was 1.66x, higher than the IRDAI-mandated

control level solvency margin of 1.5x. The Company continues

to be debt free and well capitalised. With the COVID situation

improving, we can look forward to improved performance in the

coming year.

The non-life insurance industry has grown at a CAGR of

approximately 17% for the last 18 years. While the development

has been impressive, there is ample headroom for further growth

as non-life insurance penetration in India is about 0.93% against

the world average of 2.80%. India’s favorable demographic divide,

with 65% of the population below the age of 35, is a strong driver

of growth for the coming years.

New India way:

At New India, New Indians, never sit back on the laurels of the

past. They have always rewritten the growth story with renewed

enthusiasm and dedication. As the Company looks at its vast

resources of customers who are the face and arms of the

Organization, the onus and burden is more on the Company’s

workforce to take this message in: letter and spirit. It is our bounden

duty to explore, re-explore ourselves, our work culture, our work

ethics and performance parameters, to check or rather introspect

ourselves towards fulfilling the mission of the Company in the art

of servicing the customers.

With a sound base of solvency and capital adequacy, New India

stands taller than the rest, in terms of leadership, insurance

expertise and technical talent. A moment has now come to reinvent

ourselves, revisit our way of doing business with the common man

who needs tailor made covers to suit his life and work style. As

we take new initiatives, in the wake of competition and redraw our

strategies, reflecting on the ethos of the Nation; New Indians take

their glorious legacy forward to reach further heights, that others

fear to dare!

Prudent underwriting ensuring Profitable growth, coupled

with Policyholder delight, remains the goal for the Company.

Transforming the Company by adopting the right technologies

coupled with people, processes, and operations to adapt quickly to

disruptions and opportunities, is the path for New India.

I am tempted to quote Alvin Toffler who said, “The illiterate of the

21st Century will not be those who cannot read and write, but

those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn”.

I take this opportunity to greet every New Indian, past and present

who has been part of this saga of New India and it is our obligation

to re-plan, re-energize and re-orient ourselves and dare to walk on

the unchartered path towards Success.

Finally, I would like to thank all our beloved customers and all

Stakeholders and assure you that New India Assurance shall live

up to its legacy and continue to lead the way in creating value for

every stakeholder associated with the Company.

I would like to reassure you that your Company will strive to

retain the leadership position and grow strongly and profitably

in the coming years. I wish to thank all the Stakeholders, for

their continued support and co-operation throughout this long

successful journey.

coinsurance receivables as on March 31, 2022, is Rs.

1,15,103.19 Lakhs (P.Y. Rs. 2,03,302.54 Lakhs). During

the balances with coinsurance parties other than the total

unreconciled coinsurance credit balance of Rs. 2,435.45

Company is maintaining provision of Rs. 2,958.42 Lakhs

(P.Y. Rs. 2,645.98 Lakhs) up to March 31, 2022, towards

unreconciled coinsurance debit balances as a prudent

measure. As informed to us, the Company will continue to

persons or bodies carrying on insurance business including

reinsurance business except terrorism Pool and Nuclear Pool

Precise gross debit and gross credit balances against each

are also being compiled. These balances include old

cases including migration differences for which supporting

records are being identified and necessary action is being

taken, the impact of the above, if any on the Standalone

financial statements are unascertainable. The Company has

maintained a provision of Rs. 14,952.04 Lakhs up to March

31, 2022, towards doubtful debts as a prudent measure.

Refer note no. 9 (a) and (b) of Schedule 16B of the Standalone

Financial Statements for reconciliation related matter with

respect to Coinsurance and Reinsurance balances. We

have issued modified opinion in this Independent Audit

Report with regards to this matter.:

2020, had granted approval for the amortization of the pension liability on account of regular employees, over a period

of not exceeding five years with effect from FY 2019-20. Accordingly, the balance of unamortized pension liability of Rs.

1,23,042.00 Lakhs as on April 1, 2021, would be amortized in the remaining three years. During the year ended March 31,

2022, an amount of Rs. 41,014.00 Lakhs is charged to the revenue and the balance amount remaining to be amortized in

remaining period is Rs. 82,028.00 Lakhs.

b)

The Income Tax Assessments of the Company have been completed up to assessment year 2019-20. Major disputed

demands are in respect of profit on sale of investment, expenses paid to Auto tie-up dealers and related exemptions

management of the Company is of the opinion that the demands are likely to be either deleted or substantially reduced

I.

A sum of Rs. (1,609.36) Lakhs (PY Rs. 1,303.16 Lakhs) has been credited to the Profit and Loss Account on

account of creation of deferred assets during the year.

II.

On prudence basis recognition of deferred tax asset on unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward losses has

establish virtual certainty that sufficient future taxable income would be available against which such deferred tax

assets can be realised.

III.

Deferred Tax Asset in respect of foreign branches does not have any timing difference other than fixed asset.

IV.

The Company continues to recognise the deferred tax asset in respect of temporary difference mentioned in

the above table, as in the opinion of the management there are sufficient evidence to establish the reasonable

certainty of realisation of the deferred tax assets from the future taxable profits.

d)

Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 -

The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 was enacted on 11th December 2019. It amended the Income Tax Act,

1961 and the Finance Act (No. 2) Act, 2019. It provides domestic companies with an option to opt for lower tax rate,

provided they do not claim certain deductions. The Company has not exercised the option to opt for lower tax rate and

has presently considered the rate existing prior to the amendment. The Company shall evaluate the option to opt for

lower tax rate once it utilises the entire carried forward losses and MAT credit available under the Income Tax Act.

5.
