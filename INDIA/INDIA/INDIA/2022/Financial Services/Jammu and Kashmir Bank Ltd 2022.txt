(Mohammad Shafi Mir)

Company Secretary:

Message from MD & CEO

Dear Shareholder

It gives me immense pleasure to present the 84th Annual

Report of the Bank and place before you the highlights of

the Bank’s performance for the FY2021-22. Details of the

initiatives and achievements are provided in the enclosed

Annual Report of the Bank.

It has been over six months since I assumed the

responsibility of this wonderful institution as its first MD &

CEO to take forward the momentum which your bank has

gained in FY21.

Economic Outlook

After witnessing the slowdown in economy during the last

two years due to COVID-19 pandemic, global economy

has been on the path of recovery in FY2022. Going by

the FY2021-22 results of banks, there is an unmistakable

improvement in key financial metrics especially asset

quality with reduced NPAs and improved profitability. And

with strengthened balance-sheets, improved consumer

and business confidence outlook from rating agencies

backed by domestic demand; the banking sector looks

poised for accelerated growth.

Although continuing Geo-Political strife marked by

protracted Russia-Ukraine conflict coupled with the

inflationary pressures have injected some moderation

in the economic growth forecasts for FY 2023, however

the easing of pandemic woes and some stability in

the operating conditions of economy point towards a

comparatively stable future outlook. Registering a growth

of 8.7% in FY2022 as against the contraction of 6.6% in

FY2021, Indian economy is expected to grow at 7.5% in

FY2023, making it the fastest growing economy.

Bank’s Performance

With your unflinching support and dedicated efforts of our

staff, we have been able to register growth in all business

segments in FY22, coinciding with the improvement in the

economic activity. Profitability of your Bank has increased

by 16%, registering a net profit of Rs. 501.56 Crore during

FY2022. Net interest income of your Bank registered a

growth of 6% to Rs. 975.50 Crores. Credit costs have

declined significantly with Return on Assets as well as

Return on equity increasing in FY2022 compared to

FY2021. Your bank continued its focus on improving the

asset quality while keeping special focus on recoveries

and arresting fresh slippages.

Meanwhile, during the FY2021-22, your Bank registered a

growth of over 6% in deposits with CASA ratio at 56.85%

as of March 2022, which is among the best in the industry.

Advances of your Bank also increased with 11% growth in

retail advances - in line with the industry average. Priority

sector loans grew by 9% during the year while as the

corporate sector registered de-growth of 4%, owing to the

bank’s decision to focus lending primarily in retail sectors

and mid-sized rated corporates only. Investment portfolio

of your Bank increased by 10% to 0.33 Lakh Crore in

FY2022, which are all domestic investments. The yield on

investments is in line with the interest rate scenario and

has come down to 5.65% from 6.25% in FY2021.

Moreover, Capital of your Bank improved by way of fresh

infusion of capital by the J&K Government and also

through Employee Stock Purchase Scheme (ESPS) and

plow-back of profits resulting in Capital Adequacy Ratio

(CAR) of 13.23%, an improvement of 123 bps over March

2021. Through capital planning, Tier I capital base of your

Bank also improved to 11.73% in March 2022 from 10.28%

in the previous year.

Strategic Initiatives

During FY2022, some key initiatives of strategic

significance taken included placement of General

Managers in Kashmir & Jammu Divisions and in Rest-of-

India for better monitoring of business, management of

business and follow-up, shifting of Treasury Operations

to Mumbai for better business prospects, creation of

Marketing Teams across the Zones for generation

of fresh business leads and mobilization of business,:

Dear Shareholders,

Backed by the illustrious legacy of more than eight decades

and your support, your Bank holds a great promise for not

only its own future but for the region as an institution of

systemic importance. For your support, I extend heartfelt

gratitude to all of you and other stakeholders and express

my resolve to deepen the trust reposed in us by all our

stake-holders. Lastly but most importantly, I would like

to thank our promoters, the Government of UTs of J&K

and Ladakh for lending their gracious support. I am also

grateful to the esteemed Board of Directors for their

guidance. And I am highly thankful to the workforce of the

Bank, whose commitment, sincerity and honest efforts

have made the Bank’s annual performance possible. As I

look forward, I can see this Bank has the potential to scale

the greater heights.

Thank You!

of Corporate Governance codes and apply it innovatively in a

more meaningful manner, thereby making it relevant to the

organization that is operating in a specific environment.

In line with its vision, Bank wants to use Corporate Governance

innovatively in a transitional economy like Jammu and

Kashmir. The Bank wants to use Corporate Governance as

an instrument of economic and social transformation. Given

the fact that J&K Bank is seen as a great success of “public-

private partnership”, our Bank as a business is expected to

play a pivotal role in social transformation of the economy.

This lends urgency to implementation of good governance

practices which go beyond the Corporate Governance code.

We, as the prime Institution of Jammu and Kashmir and

Ladakh, have a focused interest in making the Union

Territories a safe place for business. Bank has a key role

to play in providing public and private services, financial

infrastructure and employment. As such, the efficiency and

accountability of the Institution is a matter of both private

and public interest and governance, therefore, comes at the

top of the agenda. The fact that the Bank is majorly owned by

the Government of UT of J&K but professionally managed to

take care of interests of all stake holders which include sizable

number of other investors, makes governance critical. For us,

Corporate Governance is concerned with the systems of laws,

regulations and practices, which will promote enterprise,

ensure accountability and trigger performance. The Bank,

for one, stands for being more accountable, practice self-

policing and make financial transactions transparent and

constitutional.

VISION
