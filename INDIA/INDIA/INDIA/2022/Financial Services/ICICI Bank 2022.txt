Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer,

Executive Directors, Key Managerial Personnel,

Senior Management Personnel and Material Risk

Takers as on the date of the Grant.

List of Material Risk Takers include such senior

employees of the Bank, as on date of grant,

identified in accordance with the criteria laid

down under the RBI Compensation Guidelines.

•

It also includes employees of the Bank who

upon grant of Units under the Scheme 2022

are transferred or deputed or who resign from

the Bank to join the Bank’s subsidiary/associate/

holding company prior to vesting or exercising of

such Units.

•

All employees of the Bank’s unlisted wholly

owned subsidiaries, who are exclusively working

in India or outside India, excluding equivalent

levels to Key Management Personnel, Senior

Management Personnel, Material Risk Takers and

wholetime Directors of the Bank as on the date

of the Grant, which are aligned as a key delivery

engine of the Bank’s core operating franchise and

in essence complement the business delivery of

the Bank, including but not limited to:

o

ICICI Bank UK PLC

o

ICICI Bank Canada

o

ICICI Investment Management Company

Limited (IIMCL)

The key principle considered for inclusion of these

current subsidiaries is alignment of the business

strategies to the overall strategic direction and

business of the Bank. Few important points under

consideration are as follows:

o

ICICI Bank UK PLC & ICICI Bank Canada are

core international Banking subsidiaries of the

Bank which work in tandem with ICICI Bank’s

India business. These subsidiaries are largely

engaged in India linked businesses, private

banking, remittances and NRI services.

o

IIMCL is a complementary business to the

core retail & private banking franchise of the

Bank. On account of regulatory guidelines,

the specialization of investment is anchored

by IIMCL. As a part of the overall regulatory

guidelines, the gamut of investment advisory

services linked to the private banking

business of the Bank is required to operate

distinct from the rest of the pure distribution

or execution services. This purpose is served

by IIMCL. All the personnel provide advisory

support exclusively to customers of the

Bank and hence are directly linked to the

private banking business, while maintaining

arm’s length nature of relationship between

advisory and distribution function

D. Requirements of vesting, period of vesting

The vesting of Units shall be essentially based on

continuation of employment or service subject to

minimum vesting period of 1 (one) year from the date

of grant of Units and the vesting period would be

spread over a minimum period of 3 (three) years from

the date of grant of the Units. However, in case of death

and permanent disability of an Eligible Employee in

employment or service, condition of minimum vesting

period of 1 (one) year shall not apply, in which case

all the Units granted up to the death or permanent

disability, as the case may be, shall vest as on date of

such event. However, in the event of superannuation,

the Units shall vest as may be determined by the

Committee as per policy of the Bank and applicable

laws. Provided however that in the event of death or

permanent disability of the Eligible Employee after

retirement but before vesting of Units, the whole of the

Units shall immediately vest in the Eligible Employee’s

Successors or the Eligible Employee as the case

may be.

Besides continuity of employment, vesting shall also

be dependent on achievement of certain corporate

performance parameter(s) such as:

i.

Risk Calibrated Core Operating profit;

ii.

Provision/asset quality;

iii.

Other parameters, if any, as the Committee may

determine.

The performance parameter(s) for Control Functions

of the Bank (which include Internal Audit, Risk &

Compliance functions) would be governed by the

regulatory guidelines.

In the event that an Eligible Employee, who has been

granted Units under the Scheme, is transferred or

MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Fiscal 2022 was marked by a strong recovery in

economic activities, bringing to the fore the inherent

strengths in the Indian economy. Despite the setback

from the Covid-19 pandemic earlier, and with variants

of the virus and localised lockdowns during the year,

the Indian economy was resilient and saw a strong

rebound and progress towards normalcy. The recovery

in the Indian economy was broad-based, and supported

by the rollout of the vaccination programme. Amidst

these positive developments, however, the year ended

with new challenges of high energy prices and inflation,

geopolitical tensions, supply side disruptions and a likely

slowdown in global growth. Nonetheless, we remain

optimistic on India’s potential.

During fiscal 2022, ICICI Bank stayed committed to its

articulated strategy of targeting risk-calibrated growth in

core operating profit, while ensuring resilience against

potential risks and being well-poised to capitalise on

market opportunities. The strong financial performance

and portfolio quality that the Bank has delivered in the last

three years demonstrates the efficacy of the strategy. The

healthy growth in core operating profit and profit after tax

in fiscal 2022 reflect the strong underlying performance of

the business. The Bank grew its market share across key

segments, while maintaining credit discipline and a robust

balance sheet. The decline in credit costs during the year

was a further pointer to the effective risk management

framework adopted by the Bank over the last few years.

A key focal point for business growth is to create value

for customers. The Bank is pursuing this through a

customer-centric approach, underlined by the principles

of ‘Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank’ and ‘One Bank, One

ROE’. These value drivers lend confidence to the Bank’s

focus on ‘customer-360’ and becoming a trusted financial

partner for its clients. However, the dynamism, creativity

and commitment of our employees are a key driver

of the Bank’s success. Working as one team to serve

customers and facilitating cross-functional collaboration

will differentiate the Bank and enable value-unlocking of

our franchise.

A core enabler to meet the Bank’s strategic objectives

is technology. The initiatives in developing a strong

technology architecture, the focus on platforms and

digitisation, and continuous investments in innovations

and security features are enabling the Bank to respond

During fiscal 2022, ICICI Bank

stayed committed to its

articulated strategy of targeting

risk-calibrated growth in

core operating profit, while

ensuring resilience against

potential risks and being well-

poised to capitalise on market

opportunities.

MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

to the needs of customers with agility. The Bank’s mobile

applications, iMobile Pay and InstaBIZ, have now become

universal and open architecture, enabling the Bank to

expand the number of people and businesses that it can

serve. In today’s dynamic environment, it is imperative

to be responsive to new technologies, digital processes

and design customer digital journeys with speedy

time-to-market. The Bank’s competencies will only

strengthen as it progresses on transforming from

Bank to BankTech.

The Bank made further progress in the area of

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), with the

adoption of a Board-approved ESG policy and formalising

Board oversight on ESG by including it within the remit

of the Risk Committee. Further, to understand the ESG

considerations of stakeholders, the Bank undertook a

survey to identify ESG issues believed to be material for

the Bank by our stakeholders. The top five issues that

emerged were compliance with regulations and other

laws, digital innovation/transformation, data privacy and

cybersecurity, corporate governance & business ethics,

and transparency & disclosures. An approach to integrate

ESG and climate change risks in the Bank’s lending and

risk management has also been developed. The Bank will

remain cognizant of the structural shifts in a decarbonising

world, and will aim to build mitigants while capitalising

on the opportunities that would emerge within India’s

national goals and commitments.

The Bank endeavours to promote long-term sustainable

growth in the economy through responsible corporate

citizenship. The dedicated focus of ICICI Foundation

on creating a positive social and environmental impact

has led to several projects being undertaken across the

country. The efforts made in the areas of healthcare

and environmental sustainability, especially in rural and

remote areas, have yielded positive impact.

The Board is committed to maintaining highest standards

of corporate governance and will continue to review

and strengthen these practices. During the year, the

Board approved the Risk and Compliance Culture Policy,

anchored on five key principles. The Board and its

Committees conducted regular reviews to assess the

Bank’s response to opportunities and challenges and

evaluating the impact on the business and loan portfolio.

Ensuring organisational resilience and responsiveness

to

the

evolving

technological

developments

and

cybersecurity are priority areas of focus. The Board will

continue to maintain integrity, fairness and transparency

in our engagement with all our stakeholders.

Looking

ahead,

uncertainties

have

resurfaced

as

economies will have to tackle issues of inflation, monetary

policy actions and tightening global liquidity conditions.

A slowdown in global economic growth seems inevitable

in the immediate period, with likely spill over to India.

The Bank will focus on remaining strong and resilient

while seeking to maintain sustainable, risk-calibrated and

profitable growth in business.

We would like to thank all our stakeholders and look

forward to your continued support.

Managing Director & CEO

In fiscal 2022, we continued to grow our core operating profit, within the guardrails of compliance and

risk while strengthening our deposit franchise and expanding our technology and digital offerings.

While the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic tapered during the year, we focussed on

maintaining a strong balance sheet with prudent provisioning and healthy capital adequacy. Our

focus on 360˚ customer-centricity and internal collaboration enabled us to deliver customised

solutions in a seamless manner.

The Indian economy presents an exciting landscape of opportunities. The extensive corporate

ecosystems, global in-house centres generating high quality employment, increasing digital

adoption of financial services and rising aspirations in metros, urban and rural areas provide ample

opportunities to increase our market share across customer segments and products. In order to

leverage these opportunities we have reorganised our business teams. Cities with large concentrated

market opportunities have been organised under ‘city business heads’ covering the full spectrum of

ecosystems. We have also focussed on strengthening the workforce by skilling and providing cross-

functional opportunities.

Going forward, we will continue to operate within our strategic framework while focussing on

micromarkets and ecosystems. The principles of 'Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank' and 'One Bank,

One ROE' will guide our operations. We focus on building a culture where every employee in the

Bank serves customers with humility and upholds the values of brand ICICI. We aim to be the

trusted financial services provider of choice for our customers and deliver sustainable returns to

our shareholders.

Fiscal 2022 was a year of resurgence from the unprecedented challenges brought forth by the

Covid-19 pandemic. Our employees continued to show exceptional commitment to serving

customers in this phase of transition to the new normal. As their well-being is of paramount

importance to us, we launched a vaccination programme for our employees and their families. We

continued to grow our core operating profit during the year within the guardrails of compliance

and risk management through 360° customer-centric approach. We have further institutionalised

our alignment of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) with our business by bringing

out an ESG policy and integrating ESG oversight into our governance framework. We continue

to strengthen our measures on cybersecurity, data protection and ensuring safe transactions for

our customers. Our investment in technology is helping us to transform from a Bank to BankTech.

We remain committed to building a sustainable and responsible banking business to create

holistic value for all our stakeholders.

The Indian corporate sector showed great resilience in fiscal 2022 by overcoming the setback that

it suffered during the peak pandemic period. The strong recovery in the economy is encouraging

corporates to enhance capacity. There are fresh challenges in the form of inflation and geo-political

uncertainties. However, armed with deleveraged balance sheets, the Indian companies are well

equipped to weather volatility and capture growth opportunities. Progressive government-led

initiatives to create Atmanirbhar Bharat add further fuel to the growth ambitions of the corporate

sector. We, at ICICI Bank, stay committed to supporting our clients across all elements of balance

sheets and cash flows in a 360° manner through our robust digital platforms, internet banking,

Trade Online, structured trade finance, supply chain solutions and retail offerings for their human

capital. ICICI Bank has been using the public digital infrastructure in our country to improve

efficiency of our clients as well our own. In addition, our vast physical distribution network

enables us to understand their needs and offer improved solutions to them.

Over the years, we have focussed on enhancing customer experience through digital enablement

and streamlining of processes. Our digital platforms and usage of analytics and behavioural

sciences underpin our banking solutions. During fiscal 2022, we further sharpened our focus on

customer-centricity with the objective of providing 360° offerings to customers. We continue to

design our approach based on in-depth profiling of each micromarket and leveraging potential

across ecosystems. We were delighted to introduce 'The Orange Book', a monthly digital magazine,

to promote financial awareness and provide guidance on financial trends. ‘iMobile Pay’ witnessed

significant adoption from non-ICICI Bank account holders during the year. While strengthening

our digital offerings for SME and business banking customers, we introduced the new version of

InstaBIZ offering a host of services that can now be experienced by non-ICICI Bank account holders

too. Building upon our foundation of 'Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank', we continuously strive to

provide our customers with a transparent and best-in-class banking experience.

The Bank measures and monitors risk of its derivatives portfolio using such risk metrics as Value at Risk (VaR), stop

loss limits and relevant greeks for options. Risk reporting on derivatives forms an integral part of the management

information system.

The use of derivatives for hedging purposes is governed by the hedge policy approved by ALCO. Subject to prevailing

RBI guidelines, the Bank deals in derivatives for hedging fixed rate, floating rate or foreign currency assets/liabilities.

Transactions for hedging and market making purposes are recorded separately. For hedge transactions, the Bank

identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at the inception of the hedge itself. The effectiveness is assessed at the

time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter.

Based on RBI circular issued on June 26, 2019, the accounting of hedge relationships established after June 26,

2019 is in accordance with the Guidance note on Accounting for Derivative Contracts issued by ICAI. The swaps

under hedge relationships established prior to that date are accounted for on an accrual basis and are not marked to

market unless their underlying transaction is marked-to-market. Gains or losses arising from hedge ineffectiveness,

if any, are recognised in the profit and loss Account. The premium or discount arising on inception of forward

exchange contracts, not intended for trading purpose, is amortised over the life of the contract as interest

income/expense.

Over the counter (OTC) derivative transactions are covered under International Swaps and Derivatives Association

(ISDA) master agreements with the respective counter parties. The exposure on account of derivative transactions

is computed as per RBI guidelines.

The Board of Directors has authorised the ALCO to review and approve matters, as applicable, pertaining to the

LIBOR transition to alternate risk free rates. A LIBOR Working Group has been constituted which reviews the progress

on the international front, and the work carried out alongside Indian Banking Association (IBA). An update on the

activities on the LIBOR transition and the proceedings of the Working Group are presented quarterly to the ALCO.

The necessary changes were implemented in the treasury system of the Bank to handle the transition of existing

trades to the alternate risk free rates. The transition was carried out for the LIBORs (GBP, JPY, EUR, CHF) that ceased

on December 31, 2021. USD LIBORs are expected to cease at the end of June 2023. There is sufficient liquidity in

market for USD LIBOR linked trades. The Bank does not expect material valuation risk arising out of non-alignment

of fallback provisions of commercially linked positions i.e., trading deals and on the existing hedge deals of the Bank.
