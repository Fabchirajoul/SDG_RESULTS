Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to present before you the highlights of your

Bank's performance during the financial year 2021-22. Your

Bank continued to be on the growth trajectory and the details

of achievements and initiatives of the Bank are provided in the

Annual Report for the year.

The performance of your Bank came in an economic

environment where the Indian economy did well despite

multiple challenges faced externally as well as internally. Let

me begin with a short glimpse of the prevailing financial eco-

system and the outlook for global and Indian economy.

Global Economy:

The war in Ukraine and its consequent impact on commodity

prices cast a cloud on the growth outlook globally. It was

buffeted by volatile crude prices, rising interest rates in the

Advanced

Economies,

heightened

trade

tensions

and

geopolitical uncertainties in some parts of the world. To curb

runaway inflations, the US-Fed has already increased the

policy rates by 25bps in Mar'22, 50bps in May'22 and more

hikes are expected in coming months. China's tighter and

wider COVID-19 curbs halted factory production and crimped

domestic demand, adding to wider economic woes.

Higher commodity prices due to disrupted supplies and

intensified economic uncertainties have fuelled inflationary

pressures,

squeezing

real

incomes

of

households.

Consequently, the International Monetary Fund has scaled

down the global growth projections for 2022 and 2023 to 3.6%.

Indian Economy:

Although,

Indian

economy

was

affected

by

slowing

consumption demand and concerns on widening fiscal deficit,

it continues to be one of the fastest growing economies in the

world. The second advance estimates for FY22 released by

Letter

DOS.ARG.No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020 (as amended) (the “RBI communication”)

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Indian Bank as of March 31, 2022 in conjunction with our audit

of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date which includes internal financial controls over

financial reporting of the Bank's branches.

Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Bank's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over

financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note

on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These

responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating

effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Bank's policies, the safeguarding of

its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely

preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Banking RegulationAct, 1949 and the circulars and guidelines issued

by the Reserve Bank of India.

Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank's internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We

conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the

“Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of CharteredAccountants of India (the “ICAI”) and the Standards onAuditing (SAs) issued by the

ICAI, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply

with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial

controls over financial reporting were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over financial

reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an

understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and

evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal financial controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected

depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial

Statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors, in terms of their reports

referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Bank's

internal financial controls over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A Bank's internal financial controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with

generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank's internal financial controls over financial reporting includes those policies and

procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit

preparation of Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and

expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and Board of Directors of the Bank; and

(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank's

assets that could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper

management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any

evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial

controls over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the

policies or procedures may deteriorate.
