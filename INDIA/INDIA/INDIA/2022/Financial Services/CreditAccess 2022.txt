The Company has received a notice from BSE Limited for not furnishing the required information un

there are adequate systems and processes in the company commensurate with the size and opera

tions of the company to monitor and ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if the counterparty to a financial instrument, whether a customer

or otherwise, fails to meet its contractual obligations towards the Company. Credit risk is the core business risk of the

Company. The Company therefore has high appetite for this risk but low tolerance and the governance structures

including the internal control systems are particularly designed to manage and mitigate this risk. The Company is

mainly exposed to credit risk from loans to customers (including loans transferred to SPVs under securitization

agreements, excluding loans sold under assignment presented as off-balance sheet assets).

The credit risk may arise due to, over borrowing by customers or over lending by other financial institutions

competitors, gaps in joint-liability collateral and repayment issues due to external factors such as political, community

influence, regulatory changes and natural disasters (storm, earthquakes, fires, floods) and intentional default by

customers.:

PD.NO.4906/03.10.038/2012-13 dated April 4, 2013 to Micro-finance Institutions Network (the “MFIN format”)

read with the FAQs issued by RBI on October 14, 2016 and RBI circulated dated March 13, 2020 on implementation

of Indian Accounting Standards.

2. Average loan outstanding determined for the purpose of calculating NIM is based on carrying value of loans

under Ind AS, excluding effect of following:

a. Fair value changes recognised through other comprehensive income;

b. Securitised loans qualifying for de-recognition as per RBI’s “true sale” criteria and related interest income

have not been considered for computation of “average interest charged” in accordance with the MFIN format.

Accordingly, the purchase consideration received towards such securitisations and related finance costs have

also not been considered for computation of “average effective cost of borrowings”.

c. Impairment allowance adjusted from the carrying value of loans in accordance with Ind AS 109;

d. Carrying value of loans classified as Stage III loans (i.e. erstwhile NPA classification) as per specific communication

from RBI.

3. Interest income considered for computation of “average interest charged” excludes loan processing fee

collected from customers in accordance with para 56 (vi) of the RBI Master Directions. As per Ind AS 109, such

loan processing fee forms part of interest income in the Ind AS standalone financial statements.
