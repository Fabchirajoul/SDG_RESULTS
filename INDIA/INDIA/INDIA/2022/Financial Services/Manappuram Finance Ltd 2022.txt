MISSION

4:

Dear shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to share

with you our 30th Annual Report for the

financial year ending March 31, 2022.

The adaptability and agility displayed

by our employees during this volatile

period and the continuing trust of

our customers have helped us meet

the challenges and stay ahead in a

competitive landscape to achieve a

profitable growth. Our consolidated

Assets under Management (AUM) stands

at ` 302.61 billion as on March 31,

2022, growing by 11.15% over the

previous year.

What makes me happier is the resilience

with which we stood by our customers,

our people and the community at

large in these difficult times, taking

inspiration from our rich legacy.

Manappuram Finance, as you would be

aware, is a 70-year-old brand. We have

seen and withstood multiple challenges

through our existence, the latest being

demonetization and COVID-19 pandemic.

Each time, we have emerged stronger.

Each time our determination to serve our

customers, majority of who are the most

impacted in such difficult times, becomes

more steadfast. We are proud of our

legacy and will continue to stay true to it.

FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT

AND SMILES

The FY 2021-22 was one of hope and

change as the world learned to cope

with the unprecedented economic and

social crisis triggered by the COVID-19

pandemic. The year began with a more

severe second wave of the pandemic

which took a toll on lives and livelihood.

However, since then, better understanding

of virus, rapid vaccination drive covering

majority of country’s eligible population

and sustained fiscal and policy support

from the government and regulators have

greatly improved sentiments. The mood

of despair has now been replaced by a

distinct feeling of optimism, as all of us

made peace with the New Normal.

The euphoria was evident in a buoyant

Indian economy which saw 8.7% growth

in FY 2021-22 against a contraction of

6.6% in the previous fiscal. All sectors

performed well, and the economy

has recovered to pre-COVID levels,

although it may take another decade to

overcome the losses. In another positive

development, the rural economy which

was largely muted through the year, is

beginning to show signs of revival. With a

good monsoon forecasted at 103% of the

long-term average for 2022 by the IMD,

the expectations of better agricultural

production and rural economy rebound

remains high.

Though a few of the challenges that

remain are that of rising inflationary

pressure globally and the geopolitical

tensions due to Russia-Ukraine war

which has raised the risks of stagflation.

With no resolution visible in the near

future, global governments will have

to combat mounting inflation while

maintaining growth. That said, compared

with the steep price inflations seen

globally, such as 8.5% in the US and

9.1% in the UK, India’s is comparatively

benign at an estimated 6.7% for

FY 2022-23. Decision of the MPC

to remain focused on withdrawal of

accommodation and recent hike in

the policy rates are likely to keep

inflation under check. As for the war, it

continues to be a regional event and has

not spread.

The impact of these events along

with hardening rates in the US and

appreciation of US Dollar against

global currencies triggered sell-offs

across global stock markets.

The Indian market followed the cues

with FIIs pulling out, which has caused

significant uncertainties and volatility.

India’s benchmark index Sensex shed

over 10,000 points from its peak level

of over 62,000 seen in October 2021.

As a result, our share price along with

others, has experienced depreciation,

which caused some pain to our investors.

With the improving economic situation

of the country and growth prospects of

your Company, I expect that the Indian

stock market will revive, and we will

regain our glory.

Banks as well as non-banking financial

institutions, I believe, are better placed

than their counterparts in many other

sectors. As per RBI assessment, they

have sufficient capital buffers to

withstand negative shocks from the

geopolitical tension and resultant

inflationary pressure and supply chain

bottlenecks.

Overall, the recovery process for the

Indian economy seems to be progressing

smoothly and efficiently despite global

headwinds. The country tops the IMF

forecasts for 2022 with GDP growth

seen at 8.2%, ahead of China and the US

which are expected to grow at 4.4% and

3.7% respectively.
