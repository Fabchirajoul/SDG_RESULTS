in FY 20‑21 to ` 218.88 Crore in FY 21‑22. This decrease is

primarily due to decrease in Lease Liability balances.

Non Financial Liabilities

Non Financial Liabilities have increased to ` 131.45 Crore

in FY 21‑22 from ` 88.51 Crore in FY 20‑21. This increase is

primarily due to movement of net Deferred Tax balances.

Further, Interest Coverage Ratio and Debt Equity Ratio have not been

and Loss is a result of accounting treatment under Ind AS 116 – Leases

and accordingly, there is no obligation on the Company to service any

interest cost.

# Profit After Tax has not increased proportionately as compared to rise

in the Annual Average AUM due to higher non cash charge in employee

benefits expenses, higher other expenses and lower other income as

explained earlier.

* Reason for increase in Current Ratio:

(i)

current asset balances and specifically, investments which are

maturing within 12 months from the reporting date including new

purchases, have changed and;

(ii)

current liabilities have reduced largely due to a reduction in lease

liabilities payable within 12 months.
