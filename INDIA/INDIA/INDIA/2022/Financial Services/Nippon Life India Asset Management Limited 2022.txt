Letter to Shareholders: Letter To Shareholders

Paving the path for a sustainable tomorrow

Dear Shareholders,

Greetings!

FY22 has been a momentous year for our industry and more

so for your company. Strong investor and stakeholder trust

in your company has led to us having the privilege of serving

the largest investor base in the industry. We are humbled

to have welcomed 7 million new investors this year alone.

Number of unique investors grew by 75% this year and our

market share and AUM grew at a fast clip, especially in the

retail domain; on the back of robust processes, strong risk

management and in-depth research.

Into the new year, the world economy continues to bear the

brunt of the post-pandemic easing, virus resurgence as well

as the geopolitical turmoil in Europe. Globally, inflation has

proven to be a dampener to the otherwise buoyant equity

markets. In a measured manner, RBI has shifted its focus to

combating inflation, resulting in consensus expectation of

multiple hikes in interest rate in FY23.

India continues to evolve

India, however, has historically overridden global downturns

and exhibited its resilience and immense potential time and

again.

While the last half a decade has been challenging for India,

the phase has seen much more structured and meaningful

reform taking place than in the past. Economic disarray,

stagnation, sluggish investment and bureaucratic red-tapism

have all been addressed adequately over the last few years.

Though a great challenge in a country as diverse as India,

many necessary structural reforms were implemented in

last 5 years with an objective of creating an environment

conducive for investment.

As a result, India has emerged as a strong player with

significant growth trajectory that is higher than any other

developing country in the world. Defying all expectations,

new estimates have shown that India may well be on the

path to surpassing Japan in becoming Asia’s second largest

economy. Though there are multiple factors that have led

to the same, exports reaching a new high of $418 billion in

a single year is a noteworthy contributor; apart from the

growth in manufacturing activity. Collectively, it has helped

raise global interest in the investor-friendly FDI policy of the

government, thereby it can easily be ensured that India is

looked at as a strong powerhouse and a force to be reckoned

with in days to come.

Future Ready NAM

All this gives me great hope about our future as a country.

But as the CEO of your company, what gives me even more

hope - and, if I may add, immense satisfaction - is the fact

that as India grows in stature and size, your company has the

right people, strategies, processes, products, performance

and partnerships in place to grow with India.

Our strategies revolve firmly around the well-being of our

investors. We strive to never lose sight of the fact that the

only constant in the dynamic environment around us is

Investors’ interest.

With higher financial literacy, formalisation of business

activity, growing individual savings, improved reach of

financial products aided by granular offline and convenient

online conduits, and a strong governance structure, the

financial services’ space, particularly asset management,

has the potential to help many new investors realise their

financial goals. In FY22 alone, the number of active Demat

accounts in India rose by 63% to 90 million. Retail MF folios

rose by 30 million to 118 million. Indian capital markets were

key beneficiaries of these growth trends. Equities, as a share

of household assets, reached a record high of 4.8%. Overall

assets of the Mutual Fund sector increased by 20% to INR

37.6 trillion in FY22. As a responsible leader in this rapidly

expanding and underpenetrated sector, we continue to

deploy our domain knowledge and global expertise to build

products and processes with an “Investor First” philosophy

at our core and nurture a performance-driven culture

within a carefully calibrated effective risk management and

governance framework within the organisation.

With a single-minded focus on making our investment

products accessible to everyone, our products range mirrors

the diverse risk-return preferences of our investors. Our

leadership position in the retail as well as the passive segment

is testament to the successful execution of this vision. Today,

we can offer one of the most complete suite of offerings for

all segments of investors (retail, HNI, institutional, corporate

as well as offshore) and product classes (Equity, Debt,

Liquid, ETF, Commodity, Real Estate and VC Funds). Our MF

assets increased by 24% in FY22 and led to a rise in overall

market share by 26 basis points to 7.38%. Our annualised

systematic flows grew to INR 88 billion from 4 million folios.

The stickiness of our SIP folios and AUM is far superior to the

industry. This growth in assets and market share, combined

with detailed cost optimisation initiatives which led to an

expanding and favourable operating leverage, have helped

us achieve an all-time high annual profitability of INR 7.4

billion. By successfully executing a strategy that has distinct

focus on all investor segments, we have ensured that our

reach and connect with our partners and investors remains

amongst the best in the business.

Looking into the future, we believe that a nimble and secure

digital ecosystem and an objective approach to sustainable

investing are vital determinants of our growth aspirations. I

would like to further share a few comments in this regard.

Digital Leadership

In this digital age, ideas such as super Apps, algo-trading,

AI advisory tools, conversational commerce, etc. have

transformed the global business landscape. NAM India has

been a thought leader through its constant source of digital

innovation in the asset management space. We have been

able to build a complete world of digitech for the new-age

consumers.

There were no material complaints received

concerning breaches of customer privacy and

losses of customer data during the financial year

either from outside parties and substantiated

by NAM India or from regulatory bodies. Nil

complaints have been received against identified

leaks, thefts, or losses of customer data for FY22.

The Company has not experienced any instances

of data breaches along with its impact and the

percentage of data breaches involving personally

identifiable information of customers is zero for

FY22. Also, its complaints to folio ratio is 0.005% in

FY22.

Stakeholder complaints

In the ordinary course of business, customers and

investors may have disputes with the Company

regarding deficiency in services or product

performance, which could result in a civil suit,

or a consumer complaint. Most of NAM India’s

businesses are linked to the capital markets

and thus, prone to short-term fluctuations. The

Company, regularly, engages with its stakeholders

to appropriately address their concerns; however,

in some cases, legal resolutions may also be

pursued. Customers and investors may have

disputes with the Company regarding deficiency

in services or product performance, which could

result in a civil suit, or a consumer complaint. In

FY22, all four of the shareholder complaints

received were resolved by NAM India.

VI. Empowering Employees

With a 900+ strong workforce as on March 31,

2022, NAM India believes that its strong people

culture is critical to its long-term sustenance.

The Company is committed to creating a safe

working environment for all its employees and has

implemented several policies in this regard. The

Company ensures all colleagues, at every level, are

part of the organization’s growth strategy and are

empowered to take sound business decisions.

Talent Management

The key pillars of NAM India’s core philosophy are

talent care and development, empowerment and

decision making, innovation, agility and digital

transformation.

NAM India has been recognized as AON Best

Employer for 4 years since 2016 (including 2021)

and has also featured in ‘India’s Best Companies

to Work For’ by Great Place to Work, in 2018. The

Company has also been awarded with jury award

for “Commitment to Talent”, 2020 Kinecentric Best

Employers Awards.

The Company achieved an employee engagement

score of 89% in FY22 portraying its continual

efforts towards fostering employee engagement

and satisfaction. NAM India has seen a constant

improvement in this score since 2016.

The Company has a strong employee retention

rate. The average employee tenure is more than

six years despite NAM India being a fairly young

organisation.
