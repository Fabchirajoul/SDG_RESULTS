MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN: Dear Shareholders,

FY 21 ended with hope that the COVID-19 pandemic was ﬁnally

behind us. However, the second wave of the pandemic aﬀected the

lives and jobs of millions of Indians in the 1st quarter of FY 22.

Through this phase, team Chola worked Ɵrelessly to ensure the

health and safety of our people and their families. Our learnings

from the ﬁrst wave enabled us to be nimble and alter ‘ways of

working’ to ensure business conƟnuity and rapid return to

normalcy. Despite the changing world order, driven primarily by the

pandemic and unstable geo-poliƟcal situaƟon, I am very pleased to

inform that your company conƟnues to grow from strength to

strength - closing the year with the best-ever disbursals, collecƟons,

and proﬁtability in Q4 of FY 22.

Last year, we embarked on a journey to chalk-out Chola’s strategy

for the next decade. We have successfully put in place the building

blocks for the next wave of proﬁtable growth, thereby making

FY 22 the year of ‘Expanding Horizons’.

I would like to highlight a few of the key iniƟaƟves that we launched:

1.

Ecosystem focus - Planned and well deliberated expansion across SME and consumer ecosystems through three new

business lines:

a.

Consumer and Small Enterprise Loans - focused on business loans, professional loans, and personal loans.

b.

Secured Business and Personal Loans - focused on secured business loan against self-occupied residenƟal

property or commercial cum-residenƟal property as collateral.

c.

SME Loans - a wide suite of products including supply chain ﬁnancing, term loans for capex, loan against shares,

funding on hypothecaƟon of machinery for speciﬁc industries, etc. to India’s SMEs.

2.

Strategic acquisiƟon of stake in Payswiﬀ technologies Private Limited, a payments soluƟon provider in India and

Paytail Commerce Private Limited, a Fintech focused on oﬄine Buy-now-pay-later through brand partnerships.

3.

Strengthened the tech infrastructure to enhance ﬂexibility, modularity, security, and scalability of our systems.

4.

AdopƟon of ‘Lean’ and ‘Kaizen’ at an organizaƟon level to drive process eﬃciencies and reduce risk across all

businesses and funcƟons.

5.

Development of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework, thereby enhancing our posiƟon as a

responsible lender.
