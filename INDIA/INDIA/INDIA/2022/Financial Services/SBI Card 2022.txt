Dear Shareholders,

While pursuing sustainable growth during

FY2022, we calibrated our risk strategies,

strengthened our portfolio monitoring

mechanisms, and reinforced our well-proven

underwriting models.

Dinesh Khara

Chairman:

MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO: Dear Shareholders,

Consumers in India have adopted digital transactions

in a big way. According to a report from FICCI, more

than 87% of payments in FY2022 are expected to

be digital and digital retail credit has been growing

at a rate in double digits for the last three years.

Furthermore, total e-commerce volumes are

expected to exceed $188 billion by 2025, from

merely $46 billion in 2020. While there is a surge

in digital payments adoption among consumers,

digital lending is also picking up at a fast pace. Not

surprisingly, financial services industry has also

seen a significant technological transformation. At

SBI Card, we are right at the centre of action where

technology and consumer behaviour are meeting at

an inflection point of exponential growth.

We are committed to deliver an enriching payments

experience to our customers, therefore, our

endeavours are focused on constant exploration and

rapid adoption of new age payments technologies.

We have integrated tokenisation throughout our

system which offers our customers an enhanced

security when they transact online, whether it is

through Visa, Mastercard or RuPay network. We

have also been building our contactless payments

ecosystem. As a result, all our newly issued cards

are contactless cards now. We have also made

available our existing Scan to Pay and SBI Card

Pay payment solution on SBI Card Mobile App

for Mastercard cardholders. Moreover, we have

further expanded our digital payments suite and it

now includes Jio Pay and Paytm Pay. These are in

addition to already existing Samsung Pay, SBI Card

Pay, Google Pay, and Scan & Pay (Bharat QR).

At the enterprise level, we continue to invest

in building future capabilities and seamlessly

managing our customer acquisition, servicing, and

engagement processes. We have already ramped

up digital multi-carding with instant card issuance

to existing customers. Further, we have also set

up an extensive data lake for advanced analytics

and machine learning models for both credit and

portfolio management.

All these efforts to achieve complete digital

transformation have contributed significantly to

our ability to grow consistently and reinforced

our agility and resilience. As a result, we were not

only able to navigate through the choppy waters of

FY2022 successfully but also cemented our market

position as the largest pure-play credit card issuer

and the second-largest credit card issuer in India

in terms of cards in force, with a market share of

18.7%. With a total card base of 13.8 million as of

March 2022, SBI Card has seen a growth of 16%

YoY in cards in force with a healthy acquisition rate

throughout FY2022. What’s gratifying about this is

that many of our new accounts emanate from Tier 2

and 3 cities, demonstrating the extensiveness of SBI

Card’s outreach.

Rama Mohan Rao Amara

Managing

Managing Director & CEO, SBI Card:

Dear Stakeholders,

SBI Card conducts its business based on

clearly defined business principles. In all our

activities, we carefully weigh the interests

of our stakeholders: customers, employees,

shareholders, and society at large.

As a responsible corporate citizen, SBI Card has

focused on ESG strategy and implementation since

FY 2020-21 to create long-term value for all our

stakeholders. We are determined to comply with

international reporting frameworks such as GRI

(Global Reporting Initiative), SASB (Sustainability

Accounting Standards Board), and TCFD (Task

Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures),

among others, to be in line with current practices.

We believe that comprehensive, robust, and

comparable disclosures enable stakeholders to

understand our activities and progress.: Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer’s Statement

To step up the pace of embedding ESG into

our business model, we have partnered with

an industry expert to design a forward-looking

strategy for long-term business sustainability. On

the completion of the initial phase of engagement,

we have evaluated our current sustainability

maturity and reviewed our policies and practices

against international guidelines and frameworks.

The initial gap assessment has helped us refine

our focus areas. We have done a thorough

materiality assessment that aided in shortlisting

key topics (in the areas of environment, social,

and governance) for our sustainability framework.

Our sustainability strategy aligns with the UN

SDGs and national ambitions.

As MD & CEO, my priority is to consistently

ensure that SBI Card meets all Environment,

Social, and Governance obligations and focus

on addressing areas where we have scope for

improvement.

I wholeheartedly thank our employees for

their commitment, expertise, and sense of

responsibility. I would also like to thank our

customers for their loyalty to our Brand and

for trusting us. We look forward to continuing

working in this direction and promise to maintain

the highest standards of transparency.
