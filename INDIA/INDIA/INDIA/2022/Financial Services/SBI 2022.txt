Letter DOS.ARG.

No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020

(as amended) (the “RBI communication”)

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial

reporting of State Bank of India (“the Bank”) as of March 31,

2022 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial

statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date which

includes internal financial controls over financial reporting of the

Bank’s branches.

Management’s Responsibility for

Internal Financial Controls

The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and

maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal

control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank

considering the essential components of internal control stated

in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls

Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered

Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design,

implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial

controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly

and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the

Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and

detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness

of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable

financial information, as required under the Banking Regulation

Act, 1949 and the circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve

Bank of India.

Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal

financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We

conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on

Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the

“Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants

of India (the “ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by

the ICAI, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial

controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we

comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit

to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate Internal

Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting were established and

maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material

respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit

evidence about the adequacy of the Internal Financial Controls

over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our

audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included

obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over

financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness

exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating

effectiveness of internal financial controls based on the assessed

risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement,

including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of

the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the

audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors, in terms of their

reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is

sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion

on the Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls

Over Financial Reporting

A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting is a

process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding

the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial

statements for external purposes in accordance with Generally

Accepted Accounting Principles. A Bank’s internal financial

controls over financial reporting includes those policies and

procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,

in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions

and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable

assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to

permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and that receipts and

expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance with

authorizations of management and directors of the Bank; and

(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely

detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the

Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial

statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial

Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over

financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper

management override of controls, material misstatements due to

error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections

of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial

reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the

internal financial controls over financial reporting may become

inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree

of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
