MANAGING DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE

Advancing

with resilience

Hardayal Prasad: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to

present to you our 34th Annual Report

at a time when India, along with the

world, is emerging out of the throes

of the pandemic. India demonstrated

its resilience to the pandemic and

was quick to recover, emerging as the

fastest-growing economy in the world.

With the largest young population

in the world and robust economic

fundamentals, the country is poised for

strong growth.

According to CRISIL, the real estate

cycle that had witnessed contraction

for a decade, is likely to see upcycle

from FY22 onwards. CRISIL estimates

housing demand to surpass pre-

pandemic levels, indicating the

beginning of a growth cycle. In both

FY23 and FY24, CRISIL expects real

estate demand to grow modestly at

5-10%. Considering the anticipated

improvements in the macroeconomic

situation, a large number of people are

expected to enter the home purchase

market. CRISIL further expects the

portfolio of NBFCs/HFCs to grow by 13-

15% on account of improved affordability

and pent-up demand. Affordable housing

is expected to grow by 15-17% in FY23.

After a lapse of several years, the

residential real estate market is

expected to grow for the next five

years. HFCs will be able to tap the

opportunity. The reforms in the past

few years, including the implementation

of RERA and GST, have brought

transparency in the housing sector.

Consumers today are more convinced

about their investments and we are

confident that the housing sector offers

great potential.

Since our inception, PNB Housing

Finance has helped millions of Indians

in realising their aspirational dream

of owning a home. With India soon to

celebrate 75 years of Independence,

we renew our commitment towards

the ‘Housing for All’ vision. We are

well-positioned to catalytic growth in

the real estate sector. At PNB Housing

Finance, we remain committed to India’s

growth story.

PERFORMANCE AT A

GLANCE

The year FY22 had started on a

sombre note, with the second wave

of the pandemic overwhelming India’s

healthcare infrastructure and leading

to the reimposition of lockdowns.

The government rightly focused on

accelerating the nationwide vaccination

drive while continuing to undertake

measures to stabilise the economy. The

lockdown resulted in loss of business in

13-15%

Estimated NBFCs/HFCs

portfolio growth in FY23

15-17%

Expected affordable housing

segment growth in FY23

Since our inception, PNB Housing Finance has

helped millions of Indians in realising their

aspiration of owning a home. With India soon to

celebrate 75 years of Independence, we renew

our commitment towards the ‘Housing for All’

vision and are well positioned to catalytic growth

in the real estate sector. At PNB Housing Finance,

we are committed to India’s growth story:

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE

Q1 FY22. While the challenges were

innumerable, the team displayed solid

grit and determination, to put the

business back on track, and remained

steadfast in their commitment to grow

our network and connect manifold.

In line with our retail first strategy,

we disbursed 97% of our total

disbursement to the retail segment.

As per our stated policy, we reduced

our corporate loan book by 39%

during the year, through sell-down

and accelerated re-payments. We

closed FY22 with an AUM of ` 65,977

crore, with the retail segment

accounting for 89% of AUM. During

the year, we reported disbursements

of ` 11,246 crore, reflecting a y-o-y

growth of 8%.

Within the retail segment, we continue

to build our affordable housing

portfolio. We opened 24 locations to

cater to Unnati loans. With our strong

distribution network, underwriting

capabilities and customer service,

Unnati loans are expected to play

a significant role in driving our

growth. We closed our Unnati

book AUM at ` 3,108 crore as

on 31st March 2022.

During the year, the asset classification

norms underwent changes and the

COVID-19 waves had an impact on

the HFC sector. This put our financial

performance under pressure as well.

Our gross NPA (as per Ind AS), as on

31st March 2022 stood at 8.12%. Our

total provisions to total assets stood

at 4.42% at the end of the financial

year under review. Meanwhile,

with sustained efforts, our cost of

borrowing fell sequentially, with

the incremental cost of borrowing

during the year at 5.8% and overall

at 7.3% at the close of the year. For

FY22, net interest income stood at

` 1,868.92 crore against ` 2,322.91 crore

in FY21. Operating profit declined 20%

y-o-y to ` 1,660.32 crore, while net

profit reported a degrowth of 10% to

` 836.48 crore.

With the renewed focus on retail

business and reduction in corporate

loans, our CRAR increased to 23.4% at

the end of FY22 from 18.7% at the end

of FY21. The Tier 1 stood at 20.7%. Our

leverage fell to 5.4x from 6.7x.

We maintained liquidity of around

` 6,260 crore with a Liquidity Coverage

Ratio of 144%. With various internal

measures undertaken, we witnessed

a rating outlook upgrade to ‘Stable’

from Negative on our non-convertible

debentures (NCDs) from ICRA on

12th April 2022. The Board has

approved capital raise upto

` 2,500 crore through Rights Issue,

subject to necessary approvals.

(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022,

applicable from April 1, 2022, as below:

(i)

Ind AS 16 – Proceeds before intended use -The

amendments mainly prohibit an entity from deducting

from the cost of property, plant and equipment amounts

received from selling items produced while the

Company is preparing the asset for its intended use.

Instead, an entity will recognise such sales proceeds

and related cost in profit or loss. The Company does

not expect the amendments to have any impact in its

recognition of its property, plant and equipment in its

financial statements.

(ii) Ind AS 37 – Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a

Contract - The amendments specify that that the ‘cost

of fulfilling’ a contract comprises the ‘costs that relate

directly to the contract’. Costs that relate directly to a

contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that

contract (examples would be direct labour, materials)

or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to

fulfilling contracts. The amendment is essentially

a clarification and the Company does not expect

the amendment to have any significant impact in its

financial statements.

(iii) Ind AS 109 – Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021) -

The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes

when it applies the ‘10 percent’ test of Ind AS 109 in

assessing whether to derecognise a financial liability.

The Company does not expect the amendment to have

any significant impact in its financial statements.

Note 51: Previous year figures have been rearranged /

regrouped wherever necessary to correspond with current
