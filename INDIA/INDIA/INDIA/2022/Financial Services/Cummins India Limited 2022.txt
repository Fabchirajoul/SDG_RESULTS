Board of

Dear Shareholders,

2022 is a landmark year for your company in India, as

we mark 60 glorious years of powering an incessantly

resilient, diverse, inclusive, and progressive country.

For the past six decades, our success has been

guided by Cummins’ mission of ‘making people’s

lives better by powering a more prosperous world’. It

has particularly inspired our strategy and actions to

navigate the pandemic-hit world order – one that has

been in a constant state of flux for the past two years,

with universal disruptions, colossal devastation, and

recent geopolitical developments.

In many ways, 2022 was a culmination of a series of

changes that happened in the year that preceded it.

Unravelling a multitude of challenges, 2021 was the

year of resurgence for Cummins globally and in India.

Not only did we achieve remarkable financial growth,

but we also made strides across a gamut of issues

impacting our communities and the planet.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company

launched a dedicated global campaign to vaccinate

our employees, their families, and other stakeholders.

We partnered with local governments and healthcare

providers to facilitate delivery of over 45,000 doses

of approved vaccines to our employees worldwide,

including over 32,500+ doses to our Cummins Group

employees in India.

With renewed vigor, we set on the path to zero

emissions via our PLANET 2050 strategy. We recently

launched Destination Zero - our global strategy

to go further and faster to reduce the greenhouse

gas (GHG) and air quality impacts of our products.

It is a step towards reaching net-zero emissions

by 2050 in a way that is best for Cummins and all

stakeholders. This is a bold step up from October

2021, when Cummins Inc. was named to the S&P

Dow Jones World Index for the first time since 2013

for demonstrating stellar performance across the

environmental, social and governance matrix.

Our industry remains afflicted by the ongoing

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-

Ukraine conflict, resulting in global supply chain

constraints driving up costs and reducing margins.

Your company is uniquely positioned to address

these complex issues with a remarkable history of

effectively overcoming challenges and resiliently

demonstrating our vision of ‘Innovating for our

customers to power their success’. I am confident

that the Company is in a strong position to innovate

and invest in future growth while continuing to return

cash to our shareholders.

Once again, I thank each one of you for entrusting

us with your confidence and sharing our mission in

these past 60 years. Today, our success in India is

etched in the Integrity, Diversity & Inclusion, Caring,

Excellence, and Teamwork demonstrated by our

employees and partners as well as the foresight

and courage exhibited by our shareholders. As we

embark on the next chapter of our growth story

in India, I look forward to your continued support,

optimism, and faith.

Your trust and confidence in

our brand have been integral to

building this robust legacy and

will be instrumental in shaping

our future for the next 60 years

and more.

Steven

Thank You,

Annual Report 2021-22:

Managing Director

Cummins India Limited (CIL)

Dear Shareholder Family,

I hope this note finds you and your loved ones

healthy and safe.

Cummins commenced its India journey in 1962

and has become synonymous with innovation

and dependability. As a second-generation

Cummins employee, I have had the privilege and

honor of first witnessing and then contributing

to Cummins’ growth story in India over five

momentous decades. As we commemorate our

remarkable 60-year legacy, I am incredibly proud of

what we have built together. We have been working

relentlessly on our mission of “Making people’s

lives better by powering a more prosperous world”

through pioneering technological innovation and

human ingenuity.

2021 was a testing year fraught with challenges

for Cummins, as it was for the world. It was

excruciatingly demanding on our business,

people, processes, and communities because of the

Covid-19 implications and uncertainties exacerbated

by the second wave. But, true to the Cummins

spirit, we traversed these continuously evolving

complexities through collective strength, resilience,

and agility. We emerged stronger through the waves

of isolation and grief and demonstrated immense

care and compassion. We chose hope over fear and

continued to march forward with optimism.

Cummins’ commitment to ensuring the well-being

of our people was reflected through the robust

vaccination drives organized for our employees,

suppliers, business partners, and their family

members. These efforts focused on protecting our

people have resulted in 99.5% of our employees

vaccinated. We also committed ourselves to caring

for our communities by providing them COVID-19

relief support in the form of oxygen cylinders, cooked

meals, critical equipment, supporting sanitization

workers, and community vaccinations impacting

over 1.75 Lakh lives. We embraced new ways of

working, accelerated digitalization across our

offices and sites, and renewed our commitment to

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.

Despite mammoth challenges, the sheer brilliance

and grit of our teams across different businesses

and functions in the past year led to us launching

a range of power generation products, providing

strong aftermarket service support to over 110,000

engines in the field, navigating complex supply

chain constraints successfully.

We are deeply grateful for the trust and faith that

our employees, customers, shareholders, partners,

investors, suppliers, and communities put in

Cummins every single day. Their trust inspires us to

deliver on our vision of innovating for our customers

to power their success. As Cummins celebrates

60 years of its presence in India in 2022, we are

committed to strengthening our relationships with all

our stakeholders and continuing to deliver value to all.

With great excitement, I share the Cummins India

Limited FY 2021-22 overview with you, comprising

updates on our financial performance, awards

and recognitions, business activities, corporate

responsibility initiatives, and a snapshot of our

glorious 60-year legacy.

I am pleased to share that this

demonstration of agile strength,

exceptional teamwork, and

customer-centricity helped us

emerge stronger and resulted in

an excellent financial year, with

your company reporting the highest

ever revenue, outstanding domestic

sales, and record exports.
