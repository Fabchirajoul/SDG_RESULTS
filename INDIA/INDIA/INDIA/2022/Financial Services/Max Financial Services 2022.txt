In the FY22 annual employee

engagement survey, about 95%

of the employees gave favourable

scores to the company, making it

among the best in its category.

Mohit Talwar: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

Greetings !

The Indian economy, like the rest of the

world, has been affected by multiple

challenges in the past two years. While

COVID-19 has impacted the growth

prospects creating an uncertainty, a

wave of new opportunities emerged

with digitalisation strengthening the

growth of the insurance ecosystem. This

has witnessed elevated levels of activity

in the past two years and is poised to

grow exponentially in the years to come.

According to a 2020 Insurtech report,

India’s global share in the insurance

market is roughly 1.7%, which is expected

to reach close to 2.3% by 2030.

According to the Insurance Regulatory

and Development Authority of India

(IRDAI), the life insurance industry’s

combined new business premium

growth rate was 13% year-on-year

in FY22 and will grow from here as

awareness and risk perception among

consumers is increasing owing to the

continuous emergence of COVID-19

variants and the subsequent waves of

infection. During the financial year under

review, IRDAI had adopted e-KYC and

video-KYC method for disseminating

policies, making the process smooth and

hassle-free.

This year, further solidifying Max Life’s

decade-long relationship with Axis Bank,

Max Financial Services Limited (MFSL),

and Axis Bank Limited, India’s third-

largest private sector bank, together

with its subsidiaries Axis Capital Limited

and Axis Securities Limited, became the

co-promoters of Max Life particularly so,

after the completion of the acquisition

of a 12.99% stake collectively by the Axis

Entities in Max Life – India’s fourth-largest

private life insurance firm. From now on,

MFSL’s stake will be 81.83%.

This new relationship between MFSL and

Axis Entities will promptly address the

reported uncertainty around Max Life’s

distribution and improve its position

amongst its peers. The total premium

generated through this relationship has

been aggregated to over `50,000 crore.

In FY22, Max Life had also filed an

application with IRDAI for acquisition of

a 5.17% equity stake in Max Life (balance

shares held by MSI) by the Company

under the MSI Put/Call option, which is

pending approval.

During FY22, MFSL reported consolidated

revenues of `31,188 crore, marginally

lower than the previous year, due to

lower investment income. Consolidated

Profit after Tax at `318 crore, 43% lower

compared to the previous year. The

decline in the profits was primarily

to COVID-19 related provisions in the

current year and one-off items in the

previous year.

Despite COVID-19-related challenges,

Max Life’s new business premium

(individual and group) grew 16% to

`7,905 crore. In addition, the renewal

premium (including group) grew 19% to

`14,509 crore, taking the gross premium

to `22,414 crore, an increase of 18% over

In FY22, Max

Life secured

an overall

market share

of 6.8% in

terms of total

new sales.

Among the life

insurer players

in the private

industry in

India, Max Life

has secured a

9.9% market

share in terms

of individual

adjusted first

year premium

this year.

Letter to Shareholders

Mr. Prashant Tripathy: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

India was amongst the worst hit

countries in the second wave of the

pandemic. Nevertheless, fiscal and

monetary measures undertaken by the

Indian Government and the Reserve Bank

of India (RBI), along with a widespread

vaccination drive, have helped cushion

the impact on a large section of

society. While the disruptions brought

along challenges, there have been

opportunities as well.

Max Life has demonstrated resilience in

addressing these challenging times. Our

employees, Life Advisors, and partners

have worked with the singular purpose

of inspiring people to increase the value

of their lives, which has enabled us to

consistently deliver year on year. In FY22,

we secured a 9.9% market share among

the private players in terms of individual

adjusted first-year premium and were

amongst the top four in the private life

insurance industry. During the year, the

total new business premium (individual

+ group) of Max Life increased by 16%

to `7,905 crore. Additionally, the renewal

premium income (including group)

grew by 19% to `14,509 crore, taking the

gross written premium to `22,414 crore,

an increase of 18% over the previous

financial year.

FY22 also marked a significant milestone

in our strategic partnership with Axis

Bank as it became a co-promoter of Max

Life. Our management team resolved

to chart a new growth trajectory by

combining the forces of the third largest

private bank in India with Max Life to

elevate the experience for our customers

through digitally-enabled processes,

innovative products, and a wider reach.

At Max Life, we have always believed

in creating long-term value for our

shareholders. In order to deliver

consistent and long-term profitability for

the company and for our shareholders,

we have refreshed our strategy and

set targets for consistent market

outperformance, powered by customer-

centricity across the value chain,

digitization and analytics. These strategic

priorities are:

Managing Director in the Annual Report.

MFSL has established a Whistle Blower Policy, which lays

down the process to report any unethical behaviour

or violation of the Code of Conduct. Employees can

report to the Management any instances of unethical

behaviour, or suspected fraud or violation of the Code

of Conduct. Adequate measures are in place to ensure

safeguards against victimization of employees who

report any unethical behaviour. There is also a provision

for direct access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee

in exceptional cases. All whistle blower complaints are

investigated, and action is initiated, wherever required.

No complaints linked to the Code of Conduct adherence

were received in the reporting year.

Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and

services that are safe and contribute to sustainability

throughout their life cycle

MFSL endeavors to contribute to sustainability and

conservation of resources in all possible manners. All

Board level meetings have been paperless for more than

five years with Directors and other participants accessing

relevant material electronically.

Principle 3: Businesses should promote the well-

being of all employees

As of March 31, 2022, MFSL had a total of 12 (Twelve)

employees, which included five women employees.

There were no temporary or contractual employees in

the reporting year. As a holding company with limited

areas of operations, the Company’s staffing is adequate

and commensurate with the scale of its business. The

Company believes its employees are its greatest strength

and invests in the growth and development of all its

employees and engages with them on a regular basis

including providing requisite training. Employees are

also given opportunities to move across other Group

companies to get wider exposure.

MFSL has policies and procedures in place to prevent any

kind of discrimination. It has a ‘Policy on Prevention of
