Mr. Mundra has experƟse in banking, supervision, management and administraƟve

maƩers. During his illustrious career, spanning over forty years with various banks, he

planning, economic research, investment banking, risk management and internaƟonal

In line with the organisaƟon’s eﬀorts to maintain the highest standards of corporate governance, there has been a

consolidated push to ensure greater oversight by a strong board with more representaƟon of independent directors as well

as to bring direct insƟtuƟonal oversight on the operaƟons of the Company.

The Board is now led by ex-RBI Deputy Governor Mr. S. S. Mundra, who is a Non-ExecuƟve Independent Director, amongst

the 60% independent directors that make up the Board of Directors. Key sub-commiƩees such as Audit, NominaƟon and

Dear Shareholders and Friends,

Over the past 2 years, people across the world have

showcased the indomitable human spirit, as we fought a

once in a century pandemic that impacted one and all.

Through this period, humanity endured loss of lives,

livelihoods, and destrucƟon of wealth on an enormous

scale. Yet, we came back strong, navigaƟng through

these tough Ɵmes, to contain the pandemic within a

couple of years, which a century back, would have taken

a decade.

The world economy, including the Indian economy,

staged a strong comeback post the 'Delta' variant led

devastaƟng wave of the pandemic in the ﬁrst quarter of

FY 2021-22. Sustained policy support, benign ﬁnancial

condiƟons and an impressive tracƟon in vaccinaƟons

helped nurture a global recovery. Policy support helped

in shoring up ﬁnancial posiƟons of ﬁnancial insƟtuƟons,

containing non-performing loans and maintaining

solvency and liquidity globally. On the domesƟc front,

while the ferocity of the second wave of COVID-19

dented economic acƟvity, monetary, regulatory and

ﬁscal policy measures helped curtail the solvency risk of

ﬁnancial enƟƟes, stabilise markets, and maintain

ﬁnancial stability. However, by the end of the year, rising

inﬂaƟon on account of the conƟnued aggressive

accommodaƟve monetary policies by global central

banks, supply-side disrupƟons, mainly due to the

Russian invasion of Ukraine and fears of more COVID-led

lockdowns in China dented global economic recovery,

especially hurƟng emerging economies, such as India.

Despite the setbacks from the second and third wave of

COVID-19, the resurgence in the Indian real estate

market conƟnued its strong momentum. Home loan

interest rates on oﬀer conƟnues to be way below the

long-term average, and this, combined with other

factors such as increased aﬀordability on the back of

steady wage inﬂaƟon, stable property prices, aƩracƟve

discounts oﬀered by developers and supporƟve

regulatory policies helped residenƟal property sales

scale new heights and exceed those pre-COVID, across

price segments. The real estate property cycle has

indeed turned, and this augurs very well for your

Company.

Performance Overview

The Indiabulls team too displayed its indomitable spirit,

as the Company put up a resilient performance during

the year in spite of the two devastaƟng waves of COVID-

19 pandemic. Our balance sheet size at the end of FY

2021-22 stood at ₹ 81,973 Crores while total loan assets

stood at ₹ 72,211 Crores. As we conƟnued with our

eﬀorts to reduce our wholesale book and focused on

creaƟng a granular retail loan book, our on-balance

sheet loan book consolidated further and closed the

year at ₹ 59,333 Crores. Our Proﬁts aŌer tax saw

quarter-on-quarter growth for all quarters during the

year and stood at ₹ 1,178 Crores for the complete ﬁscal.

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Managing Director of the Life Insurance CorporaƟon of

India, onto the Board of the Company, as a nominee

director of LIC, which is the largest insƟtuƟonal

shareholder and the largest bondholder of the

Company. With the inducƟon of Mr. Patnaik, majority

(60%) of your Company's Board now comprises of

Independent Directors, in-line with globally accepted

and followed good corporate governance pracƟces.

Credit RaƟng

ConƟnuing with the posiƟve momentum of FY 2020-21,

your Company, in FY 2021-22, received revision in raƟng

outlook to 'Stable' from domesƟc raƟng agencies ICRA

and Brickwork and InternaƟonal raƟng agency Moody's.

The turnaround in the Company's raƟng trajectory is a

ﬁrm validaƟon of the management's eﬀorts over the

past 2 years in creaƟng a fortress balance sheet, the

Company's shiŌ towards a retail-focused tech-enabled

asset-light business model and the Company's

transformaƟon towards a Board managed

professionally run insƟtuƟon.

Future Outlook

Successful execuƟon and achievement of stated goals of

last year has rejuvenated the management to get

aggressive in their approach towards business in the

coming year. We have laid out broad areas of work

where we will be focussing on achieving certain speciﬁc

targets. The areas of focus for FY 2022-23 would be:

1. Scaling up the Retail Asset-Light Business

2. OperaƟonalizaƟon of AIF Plaƞorm for Wholesale

Loans

3. ConƟnuing InsƟtuƟonalizaƟon of the Company

Scaling up the Retail Asset-Light Business

I believe the real estate cycle has completed its

recovery phase and is now in the expansion phase,

which will conƟnue for the next 3 – 4 years. With

strong macroeconomic factors supporƟng demand

and supply increasing commensurately catalysed

through supporƟve regulatory policies, I believe the

next few years are going to be very favourable for the

housing ﬁnance sector. We have prepared ourselves to

take full advantage of this opportunity, having

successfully laid the foundaƟon of our asset-light

business model in FY 2021-22.

On the co-lending side, our intended partnerships are

now in place and disbursals under the model are

increasing quarter-on-quarter. Tech integraƟon with 2

partners is already complete, and within FY 2022-23,

tech-integraƟon with remaining partners will be

completed as well. The scalability of this model is now

well established, and which is evident by the fact that

various banks are lining up to establish co-lending

relaƟonships with mulƟple HFCs and NBFCs, with the

banks themselves also making huge investments in

implemenƟng the technology and digital plaƞorms for

co-lending. For FY 2022-23, we have commiƩed demand

for disbursing ₹ 15,000 Crores of retail loans through co-

lending with our partners banks. On the sell-down side,

our partners conƟnue to vie to purchase our retail loan

book, having witnessed the performance of our pools

purchased by them over the years.

Together, through the two models, we are on track to

disburse ₹ 15,000 Crores retail loans in FY 2022-23 and

scale it up further to ₹ 20,000 Crores in FY 2023-24. I

believe the consolidaƟon phase of our Assets Under

Management (AUM) has ended, and we have formed a

base for a 10% growth in AUM for FY 2022-23 and 15%

for FY 2023-24. We will achieve this by conƟnuing to

invest in people, technology, and opening new branches

in Tier-3 and Tier-4 towns – serving the credit-

underserved Bharat, to eﬀecƟvely scale up the retail

asset-light business model.

ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

Your Directors are pleased to present the Seventeenth Annual Report of the Company along with the audited statement of accounts

for the financial year ended March 31, 2022.

The first half of the financial year ended March 31, 2022 continued to be marred by the catastrophic economic and social effects

of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the second wave, fueled by the deadly variant ‘Delta’, wreaking havoc in India and the world over.

Fortunately, quick vaccine approvals and expedited implementation of vaccination programmes helped contain the casualties and

curtail the effect of the third wave of the pandemic in the second half of the year.

Favourable government and central bank policies helped the world economy bounce back from the lows of the second wave of

pandemic. However, the global economic recovery started losing momentum in the second half of 2021, in the face of considerable

uncertainty on account of the war in Europe leading to supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks, front-loaded monetary policy

normalisation by central banks across advanced economies and emerging market economies in response to persistently high

inflation and multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Notwithstanding the challenges from inflationary pressures, external spillovers and geopolitical risks, the Indian economy remained

on the path of recovery during the year.

For Indiabulls Housing, FY 2021-22 was a year of transition and growth.

The Company smoothly transitioned to its retail asset-light business model – establishing its intended co-lending partnerships and

scaling up disbursals from the second half of the year. The Company also continued with its endeavor of maintaining a fortress

balance sheet supported by strong capital position, healthy liquidity on balance sheet, adequate provisioning buffer and ensuring

a well-matched ALM.
