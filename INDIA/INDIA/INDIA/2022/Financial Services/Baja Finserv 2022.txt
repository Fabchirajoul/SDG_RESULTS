Corporate Overview

Dear Shareholder,

Allow me to begin with a short tribute to Shri Rahul Bajaj, who was for long the

Chairman, and more recently the Chairman Emeritus, of your Company. This tribute

is from a son to a beloved father.

My father was unique and special. People across the country — even those who

did not know him personally — lauded him for being fearless and outspoken.

I have not seen many who had his courage to honestly share his convictions.

People who worked closely with him knew of his pinpointed focus on details and

his legendary eyesight and concentration that could unerringly focus on the

tiniest error without fail. Just as he was courageous and outspoken, he was quick

and generous to accept his mistakes. And within that supreme confidence of

his, he was compassionate and caring to all those he knew. He was my mentor,

counsellor and friend.

I will miss him. Yet, I am secure in the knowledge that the values he instilled in me

will always remain.

Let me start with a word. ‘Resilience’. Your Company and all its businesses

have shown enormous resilience in the last two years — be it through the three

successive waves of Covid and the organisational transformations that these

entailed, the macroeconomic slowdown that pre-dated Covid and fundamental

changes in the industry that we belong to, and the strength to take all necessary

provisions without damaging our financials and capital adequacy. Such resilience

was shown by every employee across each business of your Company.

There is another word that comes to my mind. It is ‘Focus’. Across the enterprises

that constitute your Company, the focus has been to create new, powerful, fast and

all-encompassing digital capabilities; add new products; and create greater synergy

and efficiencies- all to better service our customers.

In this, Bajaj Finance Ltd. (BFL) leads the pack; closely followed by Bajaj Allianz Life

Insurance Company Ltd. (BALIC) and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Ltd.

(BAGIC). Through focus, BALIC has transformed itself into one of India’s top life

insurers with strong profitable growth. Thanks to years of uninterrupted profitability,

BAGIC has completed 14 consecutive years, since its last capital infusion and

continues to be one of the most efficient users of capital among the private sector

insurance companies.

I am particularly proud of the performance of Bajaj Housing Finance Ltd. (BHFL), a

100% subsidiary of BFL. It formally started lending operations from July 2017. In less

than five years, it has created multiple businesses where the aggregate assets under

management amount to ₹ 53,322 crore. In FY2022, BHFL earned total income of

₹ 3,767 crore; net interest income of ₹ 1,612 crore; profit before tax of ₹ 960 crore;

and profit after tax of ₹ 710 crore. It is an extremely creditable performance.

Indeed, BHFL is fast growing into an adult to join the other three large enterprises in

your Company — BFL, BALIC and BAGIC.

CHAIRMAN’S: LETTER

Letter

Corporate Overview

Statutory Reports

Financial Statements

Let me conclude by making two other observations.

Over the last couple of years, we have seen considerable regulatory tightening — be

it from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Insurance Regulatory and Development

Authority of India (IRDAI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

We welcome these developments because, as we see it, these are prompting

fundamental structural changes in the ways in which the industry does business

and, in doing so, are separating men from the boys.

My other observation is about our corporate culture. This has been hard-baked

across all our organisations. It involves customer centrality; perennial quest

for greater operational efficiencies; managerial ownership, empowerment and

accountability; welcoming disruptive innovations and long-term profitable growth.

These, more than anything else, have created value for your Company and its

subsidiaries. And, will continue doing so in the years to come.

Thank you for your support. With my best wishes,

Yours sincerely,

Sanjiv Bajaj

Summary of Our Major Initiatives Towards

Furtherance of ESG

Our Focus Areas

Bajaj Finserv Limited

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report FY2022:

Message from the Chairman

&: Managing Director

There is an adage that ‘life never

gets any easier or more forgiving, it is

only we who get stronger and more

resilient’ with every challenge and

hardship that life presents. These

unique experiences help us become

more accepting of our new realities to

thrive in a new, emerging environment.

And nothing can be more relevant

today than this when we think of the

overwhelming shared experiences

of the two bygone years. In this new,

emerging world, being responsible for

one's environment and communities is

no longer an option but an imperative

for building a sustainable future for all.

Late Shri Rahul Bajaj. Sadly, he left for

his heavenly abode earlier this year,

and us with a greater responsibility to

take forward this inspirational legacy

of being a responsive and responsible

corporate citizen to serve the needs of

an aspirational new India.

In line with this ideology, we have

adopted a practical approach to

implementing our ESG goals and

mapped our business responsibility

strategy towards the realisation of

the nation's sustainable development

and its people's inclusive growth.

Our businesses will strive towards

achieving these twin objectives, as

At Bajaj Finserv companies, the

financial services arm of the Bajaj

Group, one of the country's oldest and

most revered business houses, we

have imbued our organisational fabric

with this belief. We have built it into our

business philosophy.

The very foundation of our group

was laid by the philanthropic instinct

of Shri Jamnalalji Bajaj, our Group's

founding father, who took the bold and

unprecedented step of using business

to serve society, a long cherished value

further strengthened by the legendary

and extraordinary excellence of my

father and our

Managing Director

the families of children undergoing

treatment for curable diseases or

suffering from ailments requiring

prolonged treatment.

Our dedicated CSR teams conduct

year-long engagement programmes

in remote rural locations to spread

awareness about preventive

healthcare, immunisation needs,

prenatal and post-natal care for

mothers and newborns, inculcating

proper oral healthcare, basic hygiene

and dietary habits for children.

Our community-based livelihood

and skilling programmes help enhance

the household income of rural, tribal

and migrant populations and create

income generation opportunities for

their communities.

As a part of a part of the Bajaj Group,

we believe that education is one of the

most important drivers of the socio-

economic prosperity and stability of

a self-reliant nation, and all children

must have access to education.

Our child education programmes aim

to make quality education available

to all children through curricular,

extra-curricular and supplementary

intervention programmes. We are also

invested in the dire need of addressing

issues of child protection and

preventing crime against children.

Our employability initiative ‘BEYOND’

aims to upskill the first-generation

graduates from smaller towns and

cities to gain the right aptitude and

attitude for building a strong career

in the financial services industry. The

employability programme, started way

back in 2015, and has so far benefitted

more than 20,000 fresh graduates

across the country, which we achieved

in collaboration with our partner

institutes. It is heartening to note,

that this year, Bajaj Finserv BEYOND

touched a milestone of up-skilling a

record number of 10,000 students with

the desired capabilities and a winning

edge to compete for the limited job

opportunities in the BFSI industry.

Our well-crafted governance

framework has been structured to not

just meet the compliance standards
