Letter DOS. ARG.

No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020 (as

amended) (the “RBI communication”)

We have audited the Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting of Indian Overseas Bank (“the Bank”)

as of March 31, 2022 in conjunction with our audit of the

standalone financial statements of the Bank for the year

ended on that date which includes Internal Financial

Controls Over Financial Reporting of the Bank’s branches.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial

Controls

The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing

and maintaining internal financial controls based on the

internal control over financial reporting criteria established

by the Bank considering the essential components of

internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of

Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued

by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These

responsibilities include the design, implementation and

maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that

were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and

efficient conduct of its business, including adherence

to the Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,

the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the

accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,

and the timely preparation of reliable financial information,

as required under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and

the circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank

of India.

Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank's

Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting based

on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with

the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls

Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by

the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”)

and the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by the ICAI,

to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial

controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require

that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and

perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about

whether adequate Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting were established and maintained

and if such controls operated effectively in all material

respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit

evidence about the adequacy of the Internal Financial

Controls Over Financial Reporting and their operating

effectiveness. Our audit of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting included obtaining an understanding

of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting,

assessing the risk that a material weakness exists

and testing and evaluating the design and operating

effectiveness of internal financial controls based on the

assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the

auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the

risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,

whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained

and the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors,

in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters

paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a

basis for our audit opinion on the Bank’s Internal Financial

Controls Over Financial Reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial

Reporting

A Bank’s Internal Financial Controls Over Financial

Reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable

assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting

and the preparation of financial statements for external

purposes

in

accordance

with

generally

accepted

accounting principles. A Bank’s Internal Financial Controls

Over Financial Reporting includes those policies and

procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records

that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the

transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank;

(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial

statements in accordance with generally accepted

accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures

of the Bank are being made only in accordance with

authorizations of management and directors of the

Bank; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding

prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,

use, or disposition of the Bank's assets that could have a

material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of Internal Financial

Controls Over Financial Reporting, including the possibility

of collusion or improper management override of controls,

material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and

not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the

Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting to future

periods are subject to the risk that the Internal Financial

Controls Over Financial Reporting may become inadequate

because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of

compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
