Managing Director & CEO

As the nation gears up

to celebrate 75 fruitful

and challenging years of

independence, it is a time for

reflection, a quick press of

the rewind button to ponder

and visualize a wonderful

kaleidoscope of India’s glorious

achievements after attaining

independence at the stroke of

the midnight hour on August

15th, 1947. The gamut covers

a very definitive constitution

framed by the people, of the

people and for the people,

making India one of the largest

democracies, increase in

agriculture powered by the

green revolution, increase

in milk production, polio

eradication and enhanced

healthcare, ayurveda,

biotechnology, giant steel

plants, huge sturdy dams to

harness water power, a powerful

defence system manned by one

of the world’s most disciplined

and dedicated armed forces,

world class education, women

empowerment, becoming a IT

power and the 3rd largest start

up orientation.

A record year in our history

Loan Book crossed

Disbursements

Thus, India is fast catching up

with the developed nations and

is considered to be one of the

fastest growing economies. At

this juncture, it is necessary

to introspect as to what each

individual and institution should

do for the country. There are

still many hurdles to overcome,

the most potent of them being,

bridging the gap between the

‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’.

A roof over every head,

‘housing for all’ is still the

attainable goal, pursued by

the government. As a housing

finance Company that has

navigated a journey of thirty

four years, Can Fin remains

unwavering in its vision,

mission and objective of

increasing housing stock in the

country and helping thousands

of home aspirants to acquire

their dream homes.

With its evergreen

motto of Friendship

Finance, Can Fin

is all set to blaze a

new trail, abiding

by the true spirit

of ‘Azadi ka Amrit

Shri Naganathan Ganesan -

Managing Director’s

perspective: Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to present you

the Annual Report for the fiscal

year 2021-22.

The year’s challenges led us to reimagine

life as we knew it. The pandemic and its

subsequent waves significantly impacted

the global economy. As the COVID

induced challenges seemed to subside,

bringing a sense of optimism, geopolitical

upheavals rendered a blow to the fragile

economic recovery. India felt the ripples

of the conflict as did the rest of the world,

and is now grappling with the challenges

of rising crude and commodity prices

that are pushing up the already

elevated inflation.

Notwithstanding the challenges, the

year has been monumental for the real

estate industry as it demonstrated strong

recovery. Changing attitude of people

towards home ownership and adoption

of digital technologies are factors that

have helped in the revival of the real

estate sector. It is notable that the growth

of the real estate market has been led by

the residential sector due to the renewed

buyer confidence and affordable home

loan rates.

Financial performance

Emerging from the shadows of the

Pandemic and a good 4th quarter in FY

2020-21, the Company delivered a good

performance in the FY 2021-22 except

for a muted first quarter. The highest

growth in the illustrious journey of the

Company was recorded during the

fiscal in the three business parameters

– Loan Approvals, Disbursals and Loan

Book. This strengthened the balance

sheet matrix as the profitably parameters

improved, which could be attributed to

our prudent operating procedures, cost

conscious approach and our unwavering

commitment to uphold Asset Quality.

Future perfect

The future growth prospects for the

real estate industry are positive owing

to the Governments push to housing

industry which has also been reflected

in Union Budget 2022-23. In the Budget,

the government focused on bringing

transparency in the real estate sector

while prioritising the affordable

housing segment.

In terms of Sec.149, 150, 152 and other applicable provisions of

the Companies Act, 2013 and related rules made thereunder,

Shri Anup Sankar Bhattacharya, being eligible, is proposed to be

appointed as an Independent Director from this Annual General

Meeting until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of

the Company of the year 2025.

The Board of Directors therefore, recommend the passing of the

resolution proposed at Agenda No.7 of the Notice.

In terms of Sec.161 of the Companies Act, 2013, the Additional

Director appointed by the Board holds office upto the date of

the ensuing AGM and he shall be appointed as a Director by the

Members at this AGM. Hence, this agenda item is considered

unavoidable in terms of MCA Circulars and forms part of this

Notice.

In respect of Agenda No.7 - To borrow amounts not

exceeding J35,000 Crore

At the 34th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company

held on September 08, 2021, the shareholders have accorded

consent u/s.180(1)(c) and all other applicable provisions, if any,

of the Companies Act 2013, by way of a special resolution, to the

Board of Directors of the Company for borrowing money(ies) in

excess of the aggregate of the paid up capital and free reserves of

the Company upto a sum of H30,000 Crore (including temporary

loans obtained from the Company’s Bankers in the ordinary

course of business). At the 28th Annual General Meeting held

on July 08, 2015, the shareholders have authorised the Board of

Directors of the Company u/s. 180(1) (a) to create security to the

extent of the borrowing limits approved by the Members from

time to time.

The total borrowings of the Company as on March 31, 2022

was H24,647.68 Crore. As per NHB/RBI Master directions, for

the financial year ended March 31, 2023, the maximum amount

that the Company can borrow shall not exceed 12 times of the

net owned funds as per the last audited balance sheet. As on

March 31, 2022, the NOF was H3,001.61 Crore (net of Dividend

outflow) and hence our borrowing limit shall not exceed

H36,019 Crore at the end of the year 2022–23. The Borrowing

Power of H35,000 Crore sought by the Company will be valid

till the outstanding borrowing of the Company reaches the

limit approved at this AGM. Though the approved limit is higher

than the projected book size i.e., H32,100 Crore for FY23, the

limits will be availed by the Company only based on the actual

requirement. However, a higher limit will help the Company to

approach various Banks/ Institutions and have sufficient cost-

effective funds at our disposal.

In view of the above, it is considered desirable to increase

the Company’s existing borrowing limit from H30,000 Crore

to H35,000 Crore. In order to comply with the requirements

under Section 180(1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013, consent

of the Members is sought through the resolution(s) proposed

at Agenda No.7 by way of special resolution to enable the

Board of Directors of the Company to borrow money(ies) upto

a sum of H35,000 Crore (Rupees Thirty- Five Thousand Crore)

only, including the temporary loans obtained from Company’s

Bankers in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, the

aggregate amounts borrowed, which are outstanding at a given

point of time shall not exceed the limit of H35,000/- Crore as

recommended by the Board to the Members for their consent.

The borrowings of the Company include term loans, overdraft

facilities, issue of non-convertible debentures, commercial

papers, acceptance of deposits from public, etc. All the related

documents and registers referred to in the Notice, which do not

form part of the Annual Report, if any, are available for inspection

at the Registered Office of the Company.

None of the Directors are related inter-se. No Director or any

Key Managerial Personnel or the relatives of the directors or Key

Managerial Personnel is in any way concerned or interested,

financially or otherwise, in the said resolution, except for

borrowings, if any, from Canara Bank, in which case Shri L

V Prabhakar (MD and CEO of Canara Bank), Shri Debashish

Mukherjee (Executive Director of Canara Bank) and Shri Amitabh

Chatterjee (Dy. General Manager, Canara Bank) shall be deemed

to be the interested directors.

The Board of Directors therefore, recommends the passing of

the special resolution as set out at Agenda No.7 of this Notice,

for approval of the Members.

As the Company is a housing finance institution and its main

business is providing loans, borrowing through various sources

is inevitable. Hence, this agenda item for enhancing borrowing

limit is considered unavoidable and forms part of this Notice, in

terms MCA Circulars.
