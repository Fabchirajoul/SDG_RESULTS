remuneration payable to a single non-executive director exceeds fifty per cent of the total annual remuneration payable to all non-executive

directors, the approval of shareholders by means of special resolution is to be obtained.

Approval of the Members is hence sought for the Special Resolution under the applicable provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder and

the SEBI Listing Regulations for the proposed payment of remuneration by way of Commission as aforesaid, which is within the overall limits

of the Act and the Rules thereunder. The same is also in accordance with the Remuneration Policy of the Company and is wholly justified

considering the size of the Company, its creditable performance during the year after coming out of the COVID-19 impacted preceding

financial year 2020-21, the additional time spent by Mr. M A M Arunachalam during the financial year 2021-22 on the Company’s affairs and

his contribution to the growth of the Company during the said financial year. The said payment is also reasonable compared to the prevailing

practices in India for payment of remuneration to non-executive Chairmen.

Dear Shareholders,

It is indeed a pleasure to share

with you the performance of your

Company for FY 2021-22.

It

was

another

significantly

different year which was marked

by multiple challenges. A year,

which tested the resilience and

ingenuity of Team TII, to navigate

adverse landscapes and to forge

ahead stronger - to explore new

frontiers.

The year was marked by the

Company building a portfolio of

differentiated,

import-substitute

products, deepening its customer

engagement, expanding its market

presence across new geographies,

strengthening its manufacturing

capabilities

and

recording

a

creditable performance.

Global Economy

The year saw the emergence of

a VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty,

Complexity & Ambiguity) world

which threw many surprises,

re-framed many paradigms. The

resilient revival of the global market

with the receding of the pandemic

was negated by the surging second

wave of the virus and its toll on

economies and human lives across

the world. The period of respite

that followed the waning of the

virus was again shattered with the

emergence of the Omicron variant,

though fortunately less virulent.

The geopolitical tensions which

exacerbated by the escalation of

hostilities between Russia and

Ukraine changed the global growth

narrative,

with

supply

chain

disruptions halting production lines,

rising raw material, commodity and

fuel prices triggering inflationary

pressures on stressed economies,

and tightening of financial channels

creating market mayhem.

Global GDP decelerated from 6.1%

in 2021 and is estimated to plateau

at 3.2% in both 2022 and 2023,

leading to ‘stagflation’, or a period

of stagnation and inflation.

Indian Economy

The Indian Economy was also

adversely

impacted

with

a

slowdown in investments and

industrial growth, muted customer

demand and rural offtake, low

traction

in

contact-sensitive

services and closure of small

businesses leading to loss of

livelihoods.

The revival of the economy in the

second quarter of the year with the

resumption of operations and uptick

in investments and consumption

saw a setback with the emergence:

Managing Director. Over

the years at TII he has managed

different roles and positions, across

multiple functions, including as

President - Engineering business.

We believe his experience will

enrich the Company greatly as he

transitions to his new role.

Two new members were inducted

to the Board as Independent

Directors

during

the

year.

Ms. Sasikala Varadachari who

joined the Board in June 2021

brings with her over four decades

of rich experience in banking and

financial services. Mr. Tejpreet

Singh Chopra who was appointed

to the Board in March 2022 has

multi-industry experience, steering

large companies such as GE

Electric and serving on the board

of various companies.

Ms. Madhu Dubhashi, Director,

retired in August 2021. We at the

Board thank her for her valuable

services and contribution as a

senior member of the Board.

Mr. Mahesh Chhabria, Director of

the Company, resigned during the

year. The Board places on record

its appreciation of the distinguished

services rendered by him during

his term.

I thank the Members of the

Board

who

continue

to

be

a

source

of

support

and

encouragement to me and to

the management team. I also

take this opportunity to express

my gratitude to all of you, our

customers, stakeholders, bankers,

and suppliers for your continued

support. Last but not the least,

I would like to express my sincere

appreciation and thanks to all our

shareholders for their continued

support and trust reposed in us.

This is truly an exciting time to be

part of TII as it takes the steps to

explore new frontiers to become a

globally admired Company.

M A M Arunachalam

Yours Sincerely,:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to

present the performance of your

Company for the year 2021-22.

The year brought with it multiple

challenges - pandemic induced

lock-downs disrupted operations,

a volatile geopolitical environment

impacted

supply-chain

and

increased raw material prices,

semiconductor shortages affected

OEM production lines, muted

customer sentiment for part of the

year deterred sales across select

segments.

Despite these extreme challenges,

I am very pleased to inform that

your Company continues to grow

from strength to strength and has

delivered strong financial results.

Each business has demonstrated

great resilience and enhanced

capabilities

to

enable

this

performance.

Performance -TII

Your Company was focused on

delivering across the four metrics

we have set ourselves - Revenue

Growth, Profitability, Return on

Invested Capital and Free Cash

Flow.

We witnessed a strong demand

uptick

across

all

business

segments other than Mobility,

where bicycle demand was lower

during the year. Our ‘Engineering’

business, focused on premium

tubular products and solutions

for automotive and off-highway

sectors, witnessed strong revenue

and profit growth across domestic

and export markets. Growth in

our ‘Metal Formed Products’

business was primarily driven by

the automotive segment. Demand

from the Railway segment was

muted. However, this is expected

to rebound driven by the Railway’s

portion of the ‘Gati Shakthi’ master

plan. The ‘Mobility’ business,

despite reduced sales volumes,

has gained market share in the

domestic market.

Corporate Information:

Managing Director from 14th August

2018 till 31st March 2022. He was appointed as Executive Vice

Chairman (WTD) from 1st April 2022. He was earlier the Managing

Director of Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company

Limited (CIFCL). He is currently the Chairman of CIFCL and CG Power

and Industrial Solutions Limited and is also a Director on the Board

of various companies including SRF Limited and Cholamandalam

Financial Holdings Limited.

Mr. Mukesh Ahuja: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

The Directors take pleasure in presenting the 14th Annual

Report together with the Audited Financial Statements of

the Company for the year ended 31st March 2022.

1.

Business Environment

The fiscal year 2021-22 was a year of transition

with the focus shifting away from the pandemic

and more towards recovery and growth. Due to the

widespread vaccine coverage, the economic impact

of the recurrent COVID-19 wave was much lesser

than witnessed during the total lockdown in 2020-

21. While the pandemic influenced the first quarter’s

performance to some extent, there was a strong

recovery in the subsequent quarters.

Nonetheless the global ecosystem is still in a state

of flux. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has

resulted in a slew of new supply-chain bottlenecks

and adversely impacted the international crude oil

prices. The recent spike of COVID-19 cases in China

resulting in lockdowns in some parts of that country

and the economic turmoil in Sri Lanka point to a

challenging future.

Due to projection revisions, global growth was

predicted to moderate from 5.9% in 2021 to 4.4% in

2022, down half a percentage point from the World

Economic Outlook October 2021 Forecast of the

World Bank. In the advanced as well as the emerging

economies, inflation has become the key problem with

the rising prices of energy, non-food commodities,

inputs, the global supply chain disruptions and

increased freight costs continuing to fuel it across,

sparing none. In India, the consumer price inflation

fell to 5.2% in 2021-22 (April-December) from 6.6%

in 2020-21. It was 5.6% higher than the previous year

in December 2021. WPI (Wholesale Price Inflation) is

likewise in double figures.

Following a contraction of 7.3% in 2020-21, the Indian

economy is expected to grow to 8.9% in real terms

in 2021-22. In 2022-23, the GDP is predicted to be

7.2%. The Government and the Reserve Bank of India

(“RBI”) are taking well-timed steps to assist a robust

economic recovery such as establishing Production

Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for thirteen industries

including automobiles, telecommunications, and

pharmaceuticals. The Indian Railways’ capital

expenditure increased to `155,181 Cr. (US$

20.78 Bn.) in 2020-21, up from an average annual

expenditure of `45,980 Cr. (US$ 6.15 Bn.) between

2009 and 2014 and is further expected to increase to

`215,058 Cr. (US$ 28.80 Bn.) in 2021-22, a five-fold

increase over the 2014 figure. Additional impetus has

been given by the Government in the Union Budget

2022 for capital expenditure, with an allocation

of `7.5 lakh Cr., up from `5.54 lakh Cr., providing

greater fiscal space to States for capital investments

amongst other initiatives.

As per the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers

(SIAM), in 2021-22, sales of passenger vehicles (PVs)

grew by 17%, commercial vehicles (CVs) by 31%,

three-wheelers (3Ws) by 24% while two-wheelers

(2Ws) declined by 3%. The overall automobile sector

experienced a decline of 6% in FY 2022 in sales.

However, on the back of Government initiatives on

infrastructure spending, the PLI Scheme for auto

and auto components, vehicle scrappage policy,

favourable policies for adoption of electric vehicles

by OEMs etc, the auto industry is expected to come

back strong on performance in 2022-23, putting the

sector back on track.

Overall macro-economic stability indicators show

that the Indian economy is well-positioned to meet

the challenges of 2022-23 as per the Economic

Survey 2021-22. However, the challenges posed by

the external environment need to be kept firmly in

view for a timely and effective strategy to achieve

stability and growth. Of real concern are the current

economic indicators which signal some key issues

for the Government’s intervention and action,

namely, the rising inflation, increasing commodity,

food and fuel prices to an extent due to the

geo-political situation. These have also resulted in

the RBI coming forward with a hike in the interest

rates and the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) to check the

runaway inflation. World over including the USA,

an increase in interest rates is seen. It is likely that

such a measure could impact and dampen consumer

demand in the medium term. The investment climate

may also slow down due to higher interest rates

amongst others. With RBI keeping a close watch

on the situation, it is likely that periodical, calibrated

interventions through more rate hikes can be

expected in the current fiscal.:

Managing Director and the Chief

Financial Officer have submitted a certificate to the

Board regarding the financial statements and other

matters in terms of Part B of Schedule II [Corporate

Governance] of the SEBI Listing Regulations.

The Report further contains details as required to

be provided in the Board’s Report on the policy on

Directors’ appointment and remuneration including

the criteria, annual evaluation by the Board and

Directors, composition and other details of Board

committees, implementation of risk management

policy,

whistle-blower

policy/vigil

mechanism,

dividend policy etc.

15. Business Responsibility Reporting

As required under the SEBI Listing Regulations which

mandate the inclusion of a Business Responsibility

Report as part of the Annual Report for the top 1000

listed entities, the Business Responsibility Report

forms part of the Annual Report.

The Business Responsibility Policy of the Company is

displayed in the Company’s website at the following

link, https://tiindia.com/business-responsibility-policy/

With the increasing emphasis on reporting on the ESG

(Environmental, Social and Governance) matters,

the Company has taken steps to bring focus to ESG

initiatives.

16. Human Resources

The Company continues to lay emphasis on

creating a high performing work culture to achieve

organisational goals of the present as well as those

of the future in a sustainable way by establishing a

culture of process discipline, organisational oneness

and achievement orientation across its businesses

through simplification and digitization, empowerment,

project-based working and customer centricity.

The initiatives taken by the Company are in line

with its long-term HR strategy drawn up with three

broad thrust areas – TI Way of working, TI talent

development and creating a high-performance work

culture.

As the Company embarked on its ambitious plan

for expansion and growth, it has co-created a

comprehensive operational framework to guide the

employees in this journey covering all divisions/

business units/functions. ‘TI Way’ is a set of guidelines

for critical processes in the organization thereby

uniting their approaches irrespective of the business

units. TI Way rests on key three pillars – process

discipline, organisational oneness and achievement

orientation and powered by three key directional

initiatives – talent development, Lean management

and business acquisition. The journey on all these

three initiatives has started well.

As part of the talent development engine, the

Company has developed a framework that will:

Board of Directors as an Additional Director in the

Independent Director category of the Company on

In respect of all the four appointments as

aforementioned, the Board decided to recommend

approval of the shareholders through the issue of

a Notice of Postal Ballot & E-voting dated 12th May

2022, since the amended SEBI (Listing Obligations

and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015

stipulates inter alia that in respect of appointment of

any directors, shareholders’ approval be taken within

three months from the date of appointment by the

Board of Directors.

Consequent to his appointment as the Executive

Vice Chairman (Whole-time Director) effective

1st April 2022, Mr. Vellayan Subbiah stepped down as: Managing

Managing Director,

Mr. K R Srinivasan, President & Whole-time Director,

and Mr. S Suresh, Company Secretary are the Key

27. Energy Conservation, Technology Absorption

and Foreign Exchange Earnings and Outgo

The information on conservation of energy,

technology absorption and foreign exchange earnings

and outgo stipulated under Section 134(3)(m) of the

Act read with Rule 8 of The Companies (Accounts)

Rules 2014 is annexed herewith and forms part of

this Report.

The Directors thank all Customers, Vendors, Financial

Institutions, Banks, State Governments, Joint Venture

Partners and Investors for their continued support

to your Company’s performance and growth.
