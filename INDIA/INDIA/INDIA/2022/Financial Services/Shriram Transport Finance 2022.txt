direction, and control. The Board of Directors examines the Company’s policies, goals, and performance appraisals on a regular

These Committees represent various functions our business is segregated into and are constituted as per the applicable legal

requirements. They are responsible for enhancement of long-term shareholder value, assisting the management in decision-

making and prudent financial management along with maintaining transparency and professionalism across the Company. The

Committees are also delegated with the responsibility of achieving excellence in Corporate Governance by conforming to the

applicable guidelines and reviewing the existing systems periodically for further improvements.

The details of the Company’s Corporate Governance are presented separately in the Corporate Governance Report of this Annual

Report. As a further reflection of our highest commitment to ESG principles, we have constituted ESG Committee and the terms

of reference of the same are mentioned in the Corporate Governance Report also forming part of this Annual Report.

It is our constant endeavour to improve the quality of life of the economically weaker sections of the society and help them in

achieving financial independence. Keeping this in mind, a separate Business Responsibility Report also forming part of this

Annual Report, describes the Company’s approach towards creating positive environmental and social outcomes across the nine

principles of business responsibility.

contribution to Sustainability

principle 2: businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and contribute to sustainability throughout their life cycle.

STFC is a Non-Banking Finance Company primarily engaged in the business of financing pre-owned and new commercial

vehicles. Our product portfolio comprises providing financing solutions primarily for individuals who are first time buyers

/ business owners and are engaged in micro, small and medium enterprises across the country. The products have been

designed to ensure that the customers can meet their financial goals and are able to achieve financial independence. Apart

from providing loans to first time buyers and small road transport operators at affordable interest rates, we have financing

solutions covering all the aspects of a road transportation business, other financing solutions for working capitals, vehicle

tyre and engine parts replacement expenses, toll expenses, etc. We predominantly provide services to the unorganized

sector and economically weaker classes, which are otherwise deprived of the benefits of financial inclusion. About 70-75%

of our operations are based in the rural areas. We do not have a manufacturing unit, and hence we do not procure any raw

material or natural resources.

Our primary goal at STFC is to be environment friendly in all our approaches. Since we are engaged in financing

of pre-owned vehicles, we have drafted a checklist of eligibility criteria to ascertain whether the vehicle is

environmentally sound, compliant to emission standards and fit for usage by our customers. Pollution under Control

(PuC) certificates and fitness certificates are mandatory for all along with insurance that needs regular renewal.

Furthermore, we always encourage our employees and customers to use vehicles which run on cleaner fuels.

employee well-being

principle 3: business should promote wellbeing of all employees.

Human resources are the most precious assets of our Company. We have employees from all cultures and regions. We

value our employees’ well-being and general development. Employees are a critical component of our success, and we

invest in their long-term development and advancement. Robust people practices, best-in-class work environment and

learning initiatives are the prime drivers behind the achievements.

We provide equality in opportunities to everyone, the value we have created so far for our stakeholders is the result

of the hard work and dedication of our employees. Our employees play a critical role when understanding the

requirements of customers. Our Talent acquisition has always been with the approach of entrepreneurship attitude

who can understand the end-to-end requirements of the customer and provide customized solution. We have in-

house facilities designed to identify the local talent and build their capabilities via training, nurturing and leadership

development initiatives. Hiring local talent enables us to break language barriers and have a better understanding of

the geographic demography required to connect with our diverse customer base.

Young employees performing exceptionally are selected for Future Leadership training based on various performance

parameters and such employees are being trained at a regular interval to prepare themselves for leadership roles in

future. Employees can enrol for management learning programmes, which are at par with the courses offered at

various management education institutes in India, to work upon and build managerial skills. Apart from these, at

periodic intervals, we impart induction trainings focusing on products, processes, and policies to our new employees

while for existing employees we conduct refreshers trainings to communicate recent upgradations in products,

processes and policies

There are 25,456 people working for us out of those 1,398 permanent female employees and 27 permanent disabled

employees. We have one women Director, and three women hold position in key management roles. Our all

employees are being provided with various benefits for their well-being like they have health insurance, accident

insurance, Maternity benefits etc. Moreover, our lowest attrition rate shows our commitment towards the growth

and wellbeing of our employees.

The yearly health check-up has been extended to all STFC employees in keeping with the company’s commitments

to employee health and well-being. The Company is conducting frequent medical check up to its employees through

local hospitals. A term life insurance coverage for employees is also provided by the company. In light of the

COVID-19 pandemic, Company has taken several steps to minimize its impact on operations and ensure the well-

being of its employees. All the employees of the Company are vaccinated with both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine.

STFC has Death compensation for employees, which pertains to providing benefits to the family member of the

deceased employee in case of natural death. Employees who had worked with STFC for a minimum continuous

period of five years would be eligible for the above-mentioned benefit. Also, the EDLI (Employee’s deposit linked

insurance) scheme is in place as per which the nominee of an employee on account of natural or accidental death is

eligible for compensation, irrespective of his/her basic salary.:

letter heads, requested our shareholders to opt for soft copies of annual reports

and other relevant documents and for payment of interest, dividend, maturity amount of debentures and fixed

deposits etc. we make continuous appeal to the investors to furnish their bank account details to enable Company to

use electronic mediums (like NECS, NEFT, RTGS) of payment/remittance.

To promote digital collection of Loan instalments and investment in Fixed Deposits through online mode, we had

offered cashback on payment of Loan EMIs and differential interest rates on Fixed Deposits to the customers.

Our endeavour to create a positive impact on the environment is manifest in our financing, as we only finance vehicles

which are tested for compliance on Government prescribed emission limits. We encourage our customers to replace

their old vehicles with better, more efficient models and thus contributing towards to the overall environmental

quality. In the process of loan disbursement, fitness certificate of the financed vehicle for safe driving is mandatory

along with the insurance policy which has to be renewed regularly. In order to maintain the efficiency of vehicles

and in turn ensure minimal adverse impacts on environment, STFC provides financial assistance to its customers

for replacement of tyres and engine parts. Company has stopped purchase of DG (Diesel Generator) set to avoid

pollution and follow timely switching off all electronic equipment to reduce energy consumption in our branch

offices. To create environmental benefits, we have substituted videoconferencing over employee travel. Furthermore,

we abide by our environmental policy through measures such as replacing conventional lighting fixtures with LEDs,

installation of 5-star rated air conditioners and replacing old technology and gadgets with more efficient substitutes.

We prioritise timely disposal of E-waste and other scraps and have installed censer-based taps to restrict excess usage

of water.

We are taking steps towards supporting Indian economy in Electric Vehicles (EVs), a market witnessing emergence

of new players. We at STFC will join hands to contribute our best towards growing demand of EVs. We are working

towards financing electric vehicle in the two-wheeler segment, and the vehicle continues to attract the interest of

potential buyers. We will diligently work towards establishing the right environment for EV uptake and integration.
