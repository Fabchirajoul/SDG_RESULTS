CFO:

Dear Shareholders,

Your directors present the seventy seventh Annual Report along with the audited standalone and

consolidated financial statements for FY2022.

Sad Demise of Shri Rahul Bajaj, Chairman Emeritus of the Company

At the outset, your directors express their profound grief on the sad demise of Shri Rahul Bajaj, the iconic

leader of Bajaj Group, who passed away on 12 February 2022.

He lived an extraordinary life. He was the architect of one of the most respected business groups in the

country, a vocal proponent of entrepreneurship, and a voice of the industry at large.

He stood for what he believed, a man driven by values, and bold in both expression and action. He was the

torchbearer of the family legacy that dates back to the founding days of our country and championed the

creation of a new India.

While his passing away has left a void amongst us, he leaves behind an unparalleled foundation for all of

us to build upon.

The Board places on record its whole-hearted appreciation of the invaluable contribution made by him to the

spectacular success of the Company and the Group over several decades.

Managing Director in the

Annual Report.

BHIL follows the Code of Practices and Procedures for Fair Disclosure of Unpublished Price Sensitive

Information. The Company has established a Whistle Blower Policy which describes the process to report

any unethical behaviour or violation of the Code of Conduct. Any employee can report to the management

regarding instances of unethical behaviour, suspected fraud or violation of the Code of Conduct or ethics

policy. In order to safeguard employees, who report any unethical behaviour, against victimization, sufficient

measures have also been put in place. In exceptional cases, there is also a provision for direct access to

the Chairman of the Audit Committee. All whistle blower complaints are investigated, and action initiated,

where required.

No stakeholder complaints linked to adherence of Code of Conduct were received in the reporting year.

Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and contribute

to sustainability throughout their life cycle

BHIL is a holding and investment company and is not involved in any manufacturing activity or services under

the purview of BRR.

Principle 3: Businesses should promote the well-being of all employees

Industries for FY2022.

developments pertaining to the non-banking finance sector. Furthermore, the Company strives to balance the

interests of various stakeholders while proposing any recommendations.

Principle 8: Businesses should support inclusive growth and equitable development
