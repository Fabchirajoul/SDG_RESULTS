Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

I hope this letter finds you and your loved ones

safe and in good health. While we spent the

year under the constant threat of newer Covid

strains, there was a remarkable recovery of

business as relaxation in lockdown restrictions

revived economic activity significantly. The

Government of India estimated India’s economy

to have grown at 8.7% during FY 2021-22.

Going ahead, Government spending on

infrastructure and social projects is expected

to keep the economy buoyant and aggregate

demand scenario at healthy levels.
