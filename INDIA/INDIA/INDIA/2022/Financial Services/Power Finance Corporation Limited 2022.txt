Letter to

Shareholders

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Welcome to the 36th Annual General Meeting of

your company.

The pandemic had a significant impact on a wide range

of businesses and industries in the last two years. Our

economy is gradually emerging from its debilitating

impact, with the revival of consumption demand and

easing of supply chain constraints. Power demand

has also surpassed the pre pandemic highs, with peak

demand hitting new lifetime highs in 2022. However,

the war in Ukraine and comeback of inflation after

almost a decade have posed a new set of hurdles to

the global economic recovery. With prices of fuel and

other commodities, especially of food items remaining

volatile, inflation is likely to remain elevated in the near

term. Under these unusual circumstances, your company

was able to measure up to the challenges and deliver

excellent results.

PFC is now a Maharatna Company

During the year, your company was conferred

‘Maharatna’ status by Govt. of India, the highest

recognition for a public sector company. This is an

endorsement of PFC’s enhanced stature and an

acknowledgement of its sterling role in turning a power

deficit country into a power surplus state with universal

access to electricity. Maharatna status will give PFC

greater operational and financial autonomy and enable

diversification of its operations to further accelerate its

business growth.

To reward our shareholders,

PFC has declared a total

dividend of 120% i.e. ` 12 per

share during FY 2021-22, which

is the highest pay out in the

history of PFC.

The Management of the Company (PFC) is pleased to present its Report on

Industry scenario including Company’s performance during the FY 2021-22.

ANNEXURE A OF BOARD’S REPORT

Management Discussion & Analysis Report

(A) Industry Structure and Development

The last two years have been difficult for the world economy

on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. Repeated waves

of infection, supply-chain disruptions and, more recently,

inflation have created particularly challenging times. Faced

with these challenges, the Government of India’s immediate

response was a bouquet of safety-nets to cushion the impact

on vulnerable sections of society and the business sector. It next

pushed through a significant increase in capital expenditure

on infrastructure to build back medium-term demand as well

as aggressively implemented supply-side measures to prepare

the economy for a sustained long-term expansion. Gradual

unlocking of the economy, record vaccinations, improvement in

consumer demand, continued policy support towards industries

by the government in the form of Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan

and further reinforcements in FY 2021-22 have led to an upturn

in the performance of the industrial sector.

Power sector is the back bone for any economy. The extent and

quality of the sector determines the ability of the country to utilise

its comparative advantage and enables cost competitiveness.

Given the strong backward and forward linkages and the positive

externalities that it generates, it can be a vehicle for social and

economic transformation.

India has witnessed a significant transformation from being an

acutely power deficit country to a situation of demand being

fully met. India has also made remarkable strides to ensure

universal access to electricity for every household.

Generation

Installed Capacity

As on March 31, 2022, India’s total installed capacity was 3,89,179

MW. The installed capacity stood at around 27% (1,04,264 MW)

in state sector, around 48% (1,87,024 MW) in private sector and

around 25% (97,891 MW) in central sector. Thermal sources

continued to have a dominant share at around 60%, Hydro

around 12%, Renewable around 26% and Nuclear around 2%.

The Overall generation (Including generation from grid

connected renewable sources) in the country has been

increased from 1110.458 BU during 2014-15 to 1173.603 BU

during the year 2015-16, 1241.689 BU during 2016-17, 1308.146

BU during 2017-18, 1376.095 BU during 2018-19, 1389.121 BU

during 2019-20, 1381.855 BU during 2020-21 and 1491.859 BU

during 2021-22. The performance of Category wise generation

during the year 2021-22 was as follows:-

Thermal Increased by:

7.96 %

Nuclear Increased by:

9.49 %

Hydro Increased by:

0.88 %

Bhutan Import Reduced by:

14.51 %

Solar Wind & Other RES Increased by:

16.07 %

Overall Generation Increased by:

7.96 %

Transmission

Transmission system establishes the link between source

of generation on one side and distribution system, which

is connected to load/ultimate consumer, on the other side.

The transmission systems are planned and implemented for

evacuation of power from Generating stations, strengthening of

existing transmission network for meeting projected growth in

load / demand and Optimum utilisation of distributed generation

resources in different regions.

The transmission systems that are in place in the country

consist of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) and Intra

State Transmission System (Intra-STS). Transmission planning

is a continuous process of identification of transmission system

addition requirements, their timing and need. The transmission

requirements could arise from a) new generation additions in

the system b) increase in demand c) System strengthening that

may become necessary to achieve reliability as per the planning

criteria under change load generation scenario.

Power Finance Corporation Ltd. | 36th Annual Report 2021-22:

letter of comfort and guarantee. The

Company has recognised expected credit loss in

respect of loan assets, undisbursed: letter of comfort

and guarantee as required under Ind AS 109, on

the basis of documents provided by independent

expert agency appointed by the Company. Since

the calculation parameters require certain technical

and professional expertise, we have relied upon the

basis of determination of impairment allowance in

so far as it relates to technical aspects/parameters

considered by the said independent expert agency

and management’s judgement on the same.

(ii)

We draw attention to Note 58 of the Standalone

Financial Statements regarding the impact of

COVID-19 pandemic on the Company. Management is

of the view that there are no reasons to believe that

the pandemic will have any significant impact on the

ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

Nevertheless, the impact in sight of evolvement of

pandemic in future period is uncertain and could

impact the impairment allowance in future years.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.

4.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS

Key audit matters (“KAM”) are those matters that, in our

professional judgement, were of most significance in our

audit of these Standalone Financial Statements of the

current period. These matters were addressed in the

context of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do

not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have

determined the matters described below to be the key

audit matters to be communicated in our report:

Sr.

No.

Key Audit Matter

Auditors’ Response

(i)

Credit impairment of financial instruments – Loan

Assets

The Company follows a Board approved methodology

wherein assessment for allowance is carried out by an

external agency for impairment based on certain guidelines

and procedures in respect of criterion/framework classifying

the assets into various stages depending upon credit risk

and level of evidence of impairment.

Impairment loss measurement requires use of statistical

models to estimate the Probabilities of Default (PD), Loss

Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). These

models are key driver to measure Impairment loss.

The key indicators underlying for assessment of impairment

allowance are appraised on the ongoing basis by the

management.

The most significant areas where we identified greater

levels of management Judgement are:

Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) – Company has

classified SICR based on the indicator defined in Ind AS,

estimate the Probabilities of Default (PD), Loss Given Default

(LGD) and Individually assessed Stage 3 carrying value. The

carrying value of loans and advances to borrowers may

be materially misstated if individual impairments are not

appropriately estimated based upon certain estimates,

future cash flow and asset valuations.

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk

assessment, we determined that the value of ECL has

a high degree of estimation & uncertainty. In view of the

significance of the amount of loan assets in the Standalone

Financial Statements, i.e. 94.61% of total assets, impairment

of loan assets there on has been considered as Key Audit

Matter in our audit.

Our audit procedures included:

• Company has availed services of independent expert to

estimate the carrying value of the loan assets. We verified the

criterion/ framework with various regulatory updates along

with Company’s internal guidelines and procedures in respect

of the impairment allowance as well as the completeness and

accuracy of the data shared with the independent experts.

• Recoveries are verified applying the standard audit procedures.

Loan balances are confirmed and quality of the borrower is

evaluated and tested with key control parameters.

• We have reviewed the underlying assumptions and broad

methodology of ECL assessment and shared our inputs.

• Components and calculations in the study for impairment

allowance carried out by the third party are test checked,

discussed with management and relied upon by us. Our audit

procedure in the same is limited in view of not sharing certain

parameters of study being considered confidential by such

third party.

We considered the credit impairment charge and provision

recognised and the related disclosures to be acceptable &

satisfactory.

(ii)

Fair Valuation of Derivative financial instruments

Company enters into derivative contracts in accordance

with RBI guidelines to mitigate its currency and interest

rate risk in accordance with Company’s board approved

currency risk management policy.

Derivative contracts are either categorised at Fair Value

through P&L (FVTPL) or under cash flow hedge (Hedge

Accounting). Mark to market gain/loss on derivatives

categorised at FVTPL is recognised in P&L and that of Hedge

Accounting is recognised in the other comprehensive

income.

We consider the valuation of the derivative financial

instruments and hedge accounting as a key audit matter

due to material exposure and the fact that the inappropriate

application of these requirements/ assumptions/ estimate

by contracting bank could lead to a material effect on the

income statement.

Our audit procedures included:

Discussing and understanding management’s perception and

studying policy of the Company for risk management.

Verification of fair value of derivative in term of Ind AS 109.

Evaluation of key internal control over classification of derivative

instruments.

Company obtains fair value of derivative from the counterparty

banks. Our procedure includes evaluation of details of various

financial derivative contracts outstanding as on March 31, 2022

and fair value thereon. Additionally, we verified the accounting

of gain or loss on mark to market basis of derivative contracts in

profit & loss account and other comprehensive income in case of

derivatives contracts under cash flow hedge.

We did not find any material misstatement in measuring

derivative contracts at fair value obtained from counterparty

banks.

Letter of Comfort (LoC):

The Company measures ECL on loan assets at

an amount equal to the lifetime ECL if there is

credit impairment or there has been significant

increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial

recognition. If there is no SICR as compared to

initial recognition, the Company measures ECL at

an amount equal to 12-month ECL. When making

the assessment of whether there has been a SICR

since initial recognition, the Company considers

reasonable and supportable information, that

is available without undue cost or effort. If the

Company measured loss allowance as lifetime

ECL in the previous period, but determines in a

subsequent period that there has been no SICR

since initial recognition due to improvement in

credit quality, the Company again measures the

loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.

ECL is measured on individual basis for credit

impaired loan assets, and on other loan assets

it is generally measured on collective basis using

homogenous groups.

The

Company

measures

impairment

on

commitments under LoC on similar basis as in

case of Loan assets.

b)

Impairment of financial assets, other than

loan assets:

ECL on financial assets, other than loan assets,

is measured at an amount equal to life time

expected losses.

(iv) De-recognition of Financial Assets

The Company derecognises a financial asset when the

contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset

expire, or when it transfers the financial asset along

with all the substantial risks and rewards of ownership

of the asset to another party. The renegotiation

or modification of the contractual cash flows of a

financial asset can also lead to derecognition of the

existing financial asset.

On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety,

the difference between the asset’s carrying amount

and the sum of the consideration received &

receivable, and the cumulative gain or loss that had

been recognised in Other Comprehensive Income

and accumulated in Equity, is recognised in Statement

of Profit and Loss if such gain or loss would have

otherwise been recognised in Statement of Profit and

Loss on disposal of that financial asset.

5.4.2

Financial Liabilities

(i)

All financial liabilities other than derivatives and

financial guarantee contracts are subsequently

measured at amortised cost using the effective

interest rate (EIR) method.

EIR is determined at the initial recognition of the

financial liability. EIR is subsequently updated for

financial liabilities having floating interest rate, at the

respective reset date, in accordance with the terms of

the respective contract.

(ii)

Financial guarantee

A financial guarantee issued by the Company is initially

measured at fair value and, if not designated as at

FVTPL, is subsequently measured at the higher of:

• the best estimate of expenditure required to settle

any financial obligation arising as a result of the

guarantee; and

• the

amount

initially

recognised

less,

when

appropriate, the cumulative amount of income

recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

(iii) De-recognition of financial liabilities

The Company derecognises financial liabilities when,

and only when, the Company’s obligations are

discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference

between the carrying amount of the financial liability

derecognised and the consideration paid & payable is

recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.

5.5 Investment in Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and

Associates

Investment in equity shares of subsidiaries, joint ventures

and associates are accounted at cost, less impairment

if any.

5.6 Property,

Plant

and

Equipment

(PPE)

and

Depreciation

(i)

Items of PPE are initially recognised at cost. Subsequent

measurement is done at cost less accumulated

depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if

any, except for freehold land which is not depreciated.

An item of PPE retired from active use and held for

disposal is stated at lower of its book value or net

realisable value.

(ii)

In case of assets put to use, capitalisation is done on

the basis of bills approved or estimated value of work

done as per contracts where final bill(s) is/are yet to be

received/approved, subject to necessary adjustment

in the year of final settlement.

(iii) Cost of replacing part of an item of PPE is recognised

in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable

that the future economic benefits embodied within

the part will flow to the Company and its cost can

be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the

replaced part is derecognised. Maintenance or

servicing costs of PPE are recognised in Statement of

Profit and Loss as incurred.

(iv) Under-construction PPE is carried at cost, less any

recognised impairment loss. Such PPE items are

classified to the appropriate categories of property,

plant and equipment when completed and ready for

intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the

same basis as of other assets, commences when the

assets are ready for their intended use.

(v)

Depreciation is recognised so as to write-off the cost

of assets less their residual values as per written

down value method, over the estimated useful lives

that are similar to as prescribed in Schedule II to the

Companies Act, 2013, except for cell phones where

useful life has been estimated by the Company as 2

years. Residual value is estimated as 5% of the original

cost of PPE.

(vi) Depreciation on additions to/deductions from PPE

during the year is charged on pro-rata basis from/

up to the date on which the asset is available for use/

disposed.:

35. Corporate Social Responsibility

In accordance with the Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Amendment Rules, 2021 notified w.e.f. 22.01.2021,

any unspent amount pursuant to any ongoing project shall be transferred to unspent CSR Account in any scheduled bank

within a period of thirty days from the end of the financial year, to be utilised within a period of three financial years from the

date of such transfer. Any unspent CSR amount, other than for any ongoing project, shall be transferred to a Fund specified

in Schedule VII, within a period of six months of the expiry of the financial year. Further, if the Company spends an amount in

excess of the requirement under statute, the excess amount may be carried forward and set off in three succeeding financial

years against the amount to be spent.

As the notification was made effective during FY 2020-21, the Company complied with the amended provisions of Section

135 of the Companies Act, 2013 with effect from the FY 2020-21. Accordingly, the unspent CSR amount as at 31.03.2020 would

continue to be dealt with in accordance with the pre-amendment framework.:

Other covenants – Assignment of all project contracts, documents, insurance policies in favour of the Company,

Upfront equity requirement, Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA), Debt Equity ratio, shareholders’ agreements,

financial closure, etc.

(iii) Project Monitoring

The Company has comprehensive project/loan monitoring guidelines that captures aspects relating to monitoring,

tracking of project construction, implementation, identifies risks where intervention is required to minimise the time/

cost overruns/ consequent slippages in disbursements and including progress of commissioned projects.

For State sector projects, monitoring is carried out based on project progress details obtained regularly from borrowers

through progress monitoring reports, site visits, discussions with the borrowers, information/reports available on Central

Electricity Authority’s (CEA) website etc.

For private sector, where the Company is Lead Financial Institution (FI), the Company engages Lenders’ Engineers (LEs)

and Lenders’ Financial Advisors (LFAs), which are independent agencies to act on behalf of various lenders/consortium:

Letter of Comfort and Guarantee of ` 77.21 crore (as at 31.03.2021 ` 57.03 crore).

Loans to state sector are well diversified as these are extended to multiple entities under the control of various State

Governments and Central Government. The Company considers that these loans have a low credit risk in comparison to

lending to private sector mainly due to low default / loss history in state sector and availability of government guarantee in

certain loans. Presence of Government interest in these projects also lowers the risk of non-recoverability of dues.

Further, the Company has a lending portfolio comprising of loans to generation, renewable, transmission and distribution

power projects spread across diverse geographical areas.

Diversifying Growth Consolidating Strengths

Independent Auditors' Report

TO THE MEMBERS OF POWER FINANCE CORPORATION LIMITED

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

OPINION

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial

Statements of Power Finance Corporation Limited

(hereinafter referred to as “Holding Company”) and its

subsidiaries (Holding company and its subsidiaries together

referred to as “the Group”), and its associates, which

comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31,

2022, the Consolidated Statement of Profi t and Loss

(including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated

Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated

Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and

notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including

a summary of signifi cant accounting policies (hereinafter

referred to as “the Consolidated Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and

according to the explanations given to us and based

on the consideration of reports of other auditors on

separate Financial Statements and on the other fi nancial

information of the subsidiaries and associates, the

aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements give the

information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the

Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair

view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards

prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015,

as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles

generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of

aff airs of the Group, and its associates as at March 31, 2022,

of consolidated profi t (including other comprehensive

income),

consolidated

changes

in

equity

and

its

consolidated cash fl ows for the year then ended.

2.

BASIS FOR OPINION

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards

on Auditing (SAs) specifi ed under Section 143(10) of

the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are

further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the

Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section

of our report. We are independent of the Group in

accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute

of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the

ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the

Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions

of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfi lled

our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these

requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe

that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and

appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the

Consolidated Financial Statements.

3.

Emphasis of matter

(i)

We draw attention to Note 46.1.2 of the Consolidated

Financial Statements regarding the provision of

impairment allowance in respect of loan assets,

undisbursed: letter of comfort and guarantee. The

Company and one of its subsidiaries has recognised

expected credit loss in respect of loan assets,

undisbursed letter of comfort and guarantee as

required under Ind AS 109, on the basis of documents

provided by independent expert agency appointed

by them. Since the calculation parameters require

certain technical and professional expertise, we have

relied upon the basis of determination of impairment

allowance in so far as it relates to technical aspects/

parameters considered by the said independent

expert agency and management’s judgement on

the same.

(ii)

We draw attention to Note 57 of the Consolidated

Financial Statements regarding the impact of

COVID-19 pandemic on the Group. Management is

of the view that there are no reasons to believe that

the pandemic will have any signifi cant impact on the

ability of the Group to continue as a going concern.

Nevertheless, the impact in sight of evolvement of

pandemic in future period is uncertain and could

impact the impairment allowance in future years.

Our opinion is not modifi ed in respect of the above

said matters.

4.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS

Key audit matters (“KAM”) are those matters that, in our

professional judgement, were of most signifi cance in our

audit of the consolidated Financial Statements of the current

period. These matters were addressed in the context of our

audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole,

and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide

a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined

the matters described below to be the Key Audit Matters to

be communicated in our report:

Letter of Comfort (LoC):

The Group measures ECL on loan assets at

an amount equal to the lifetime ECL if there is

credit impairment or there has been significant

increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial

recognition. If there is no SICR as compared to

initial recognition, the Group measures ECL at an

amount equal to 12-month ECL. When making

the assessment of whether there has been a SICR

since initial recognition, the Group considers

reasonable and supportable information, that

is available without undue cost or effort. If the

Group measured loss allowance as lifetime ECL

in the previous period, but determines in a

subsequent period that there has been no SICR

since initial recognition due to improvement in

credit quality, the Group again measures the loss

allowance based on 12-month ECL.

ECL is measured on individual basis for credit

impaired loan assets, and on other loan assets

it is generally measured on collective basis using

homogenous groups.

The

Group

measures

impairment

on

commitments under LoC on similar basis as in

case of Loan assets.

b)

Impairment of financial assets, other than

loan assets:

ECL on financial assets, other than loan assets,

is measured at an amount equal to life time

expected losses.

c)

Financial assets are written off by RECL either

partially or in their entirety only when it has

stopped pursuing the recovery.

(iv) De-recognition of Financial Assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the

contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset

expire, or when it transfers the financial asset along

with all the substantial risks and rewards of ownership

of the asset to another party. The renegotiation

or modification of the contractual cash flows of a

financial asset can also lead to derecognition of the

existing financial asset.

On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the

difference between the asset’s carrying amount and

the sum of the consideration received & receivable,

and the cumulative gain or loss that had been

recognised in Consolidated Other Comprehensive

Income and accumulated in Consolidated Equity, is

recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and

Loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been

recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and

Loss on disposal of that financial asset.

6.5.2 Financial Liabilities

(i)

All financial liabilities other than derivatives and

financial guarantee contracts are subsequently

measured at amortised cost using the effective

interest rate (EIR) method.

EIR is determined at the initial recognition of the

financial liability. EIR is subsequently updated for

financial liabilities having floating interest rate, at the

respective reset date, in accordance with the terms of

the respective contract.

(ii)

Financial Guarantee

A financial guarantee issued by the Group is initially

measured at fair value and, if not designated as at

FVTPL, is subsequently measured at the higher of:

• the best estimate of expenditure required to settle

any financial obligation arising as a result of the

guarantee; and

• the amount initially recognised less, when

appropriate, the cumulative amount of income

recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit

and Loss.

(iii) De-recognition of Financial Liabilities

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and

only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged,

cancelled or have expired. The difference between the

carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised

and the consideration paid & payable is recognised in

Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

6.5.3 Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial

Liabilities

Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and the

net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet when currently

there is legally enforceable right to offset the recognised

amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to

realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

6.5.4 Embedded Derivatives

An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid

instrument that also includes a non-derivative host

contract with the effect that some of the cash flows of the

combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone

derivative. An embedded derivative cause some or all of

any fees, transaction costs and other premiums or

discount that are integral part of the effective interest

rate of a financial instrument.

Income is recognised in the Consolidated Statement

of Profit and Loss on an effective interest rate basis

for financial assets other than those classified as

at FVTPL.

EIR is determined at the initial recognition of the

financial asset. EIR is subsequently updated at

every reset, in accordance with the terms of the

respective contract.

Once the terms of financial assets are renegotiated,

other than market driven interest rate movement,

any gain/loss measured using the previous EIR as

calculated before the modification, is recognised

in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in

period during which such renegotiations occur.

b)

Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Other

Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)

A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if both the

following conditions are met:

• the objective of the business model is achieved

both by collecting contractual cash flows and

selling the financial asset; and

• the contractual terms of the asset give rise on

specified dates to cash flows that are Solely

Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) on the

principal amount outstanding.

All fair value changes are recognised in Other

Comprehensive Income (OCI) and accumulated

in Reserve.

c)

Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or

Loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset is measured at FVTPL unless it is

measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI, with all

changes in fair value recognised in Consolidated

Statement of Profit and Loss.

Business Model

An assessment of business model for managing

financial assets is fundamental to the classification of

a financial asset. The Group determines the business

model at a level that reflects how financial assets are

managed together to achieve a particular business

objective of generating cash flows. The Group’s

business model assessment is performed at a higher

level of aggregation rather than on an instrument-by-

instrument basis.

The Group is primarily in the business of lending

loans across power sector value chain and such loans

are managed to realise the contractual cash flows

over the tenure of the loan. Further, other financial

assets may also be held by the Group to collect the

contractual cash flows.

(ii) Classification,

Measurement

and

Derecognition of Equity Instruments

All equity investments other than in subsidiaries, joint

ventures and associates are measured at fair value.

Equity instruments which are held for trading are

classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments,

the Group at initial recognition makes an irrevocable

election to classify it as either FVTOCI or FVTPL. The

Group makes such election on an instrument by

instrument basis.

An equity investment classified as FVTOCI is initially

measured at fair value plus transaction costs.

Subsequently, it is measured at fair value and, all fair

value changes are recognised in Consolidated Other

Comprehensive Income (OCI) and accumulated in

Consolidated Reserve. There is no recycling of the

amounts from Consolidated OCI to Consolidated

Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of

investment. However, the Group transfers the

cumulative gain/loss within Consolidated equity.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL

category are measured at fair value with all changes

recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit

and Loss.

(iii) Impairment of Financial Assets

Subsequent

to

initial

recognition,

the

Group

recognises expected credit loss (ECL) on financial

assets measured at amortised cost as required

under Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’. The Group

presents the ECL charge or reversal (where the net

amount is a negative balance for a particular period)

in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss

as “Impairment on financial instruments” and as a

cumulative deduction from gross carrying amount in

the Consolidated Balance Sheet, wherever applicable.

The impairment requirements for the recognition

and measurement of ECL are equally applied to

financial asset measured at FVTOCI except that

ECL is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income

and is not reduced from the carrying amount in the

Consolidated Balance Sheet.:

letter

of award (LOA) is issued to the successful bidder.

(x)

Dividend income from investments is recognised in

Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the

Group’s right to receive dividend is established and

the amount of dividend can be measured reliably.

(xi) Dividend on financial assets subsequently measured

at fair value through profit and loss is recognised

separately under the head ‘Dividend Income’.

(xii) Interest expense on financial liabilities subsequently

measured at amortised cost is recognised using

Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.

(xiii) Other income and expenses are accounted on

accrual basis, in accordance with terms of the

respective contract.

(xiv) A Prepaid expense up to ` 1,00,000/- is recognised as

expense upon initial recognition in the Consolidated

Statement of Profit and Loss.

6.12 Expenditure on issue of Shares

Expenditure on issue of shares is charged to the securities

premium account.

6.13 Borrowing Costs

Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that

the Group incurred in connection with the borrowing of

funds. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to

the acquisition and/or construction of a qualifying asset,

till the time such a qualifying asset becomes ready for its

intended use, are capitalised. A qualifying asset is one that

necessarily takes a substantial period to get ready for its

intended use.

All other borrowing costs are charged to the Consolidated

Statement of Profit and Loss on an accrual basis as per the

effective interest rate method.

6.14 Employee Benefits

(i)

Defined Contribution Plan

Group’s

contribution

paid/payable

during

the

reporting period towards provident fund and pension

are charged in the Consolidated Statement of Profit

and Loss when employees have rendered service

entitling them to the contributions.

(ii)

Defined Benefit Plan

The Group’s obligation towards gratuity to employees

and post-retirement benefits such as medical benefit,

economic rehabilitation benefit and settlement

allowance after retirement are determined using the

projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations

being carried out at the end of each annual reporting

period. Actuarial gain/loss on re-measurement

of gratuity and other post-employment defined

benefit plans is recognised in Other Comprehensive

Income (OCI). Past service cost is recognised in the

Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the

period of a plan amendment.

(iii) Other long-term employee benefits

The Group’s obligation towards leave encashment,

service award scheme is determined using the

projected

unit

credit

method,

with

actuarial

valuations being carried out at the end of each annual

reporting period. These obligations are recognised in

the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

(iv) Short-term employee benefits

Short-term employee benefits such as salaries and

wages are recognised in the Consolidated Statement

of Profit and Loss, in the period in which the related

service is rendered at the undiscounted amount

of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for

that service.

(v)

Loan to employees at concessional rate

Loans given to employees at concessional rate are

initially recognised at fair value and subsequently

measured at amortised cost. The difference between

the initial fair value of such loans and transaction

value is recognised as deferred employee cost upon

issuance of Loan, which is amortised on a straight-

line basis over the expected remaining period of the

loan. In case of change in expected remaining period

of the loan, the unamortised deferred employee

cost on the date of change is amortised over the

updated expected remaining period of the loan on a

prospective basis.

6.15 Income Taxes

Income Tax expense comprises of current and deferred

tax. It is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and

Loss, except when it relates to an item that is recognised

in Consolidated Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) or

directly in equity, in which case, tax is also recognised in

OCI or directly in equity.

(i)

Current Tax

estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as

contingent liability in notes to accounts, unless the

probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.

(v)

Contingent assets are not recognised in the

Consolidated

Financial

Statements.

However,

contingent assets are disclosed in the Consolidated

Financial Statements when inflow of economic

benefits is probable.

6.11 Recognition of Income and Expenditure

(i)

Interest income on financial assets subsequently

measured at amortised cost, is recognised using the

Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. The Effective

Interest Rate (EIR) is the rate that exactly discounts

estimated future cash receipts through expected

life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying

amount on initial recognition.

(ii)

Unless otherwise specified, the recoveries from

the borrowers of RECL are appropriated in the

order of (i) costs and expenses of RECL (ii) delayed

and penal interest including interest tax, if any (iii)

overdue interest including interest tax, if any and (iv)

repayment of principal; the oldest being adjusted first,

except for credit impaired loans and recalled loans,

where principal amount is appropriated only after the

complete recovery of other costs, expenses, delayed

and penal interest and overdue interest including

interest tax, if any. The recoveries under One Time

Settlement (OTS)/ Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code

(IBC) proceedings are appropriated first towards

the principal outstanding and remaining recovery

thereafter, towards interest and other charges, if any.

(iii) Interest on financial assets subsequently measured at

fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), is recognised

on accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the

respective contract and is disclosed separately under

the head ‘Interest Income’.

(iv) Rebate on account of timely payment of dues by

borrowers is recognised on receipt of entire dues in

time, in accordance with the terms of the respective

contract and is netted against the corresponding

interest income.

(v)

The Group uses the principles laid down by Ind AS

115 to determine that how much and when revenue

is recognised, what is the nature, amount, timing

and uncertainty of revenues etc. In accordance with

the same, revenue is recognised through a five-

step approach:

a)

Identify the contract(s) with customer;

b)

Identify separate performance obligations in

the contract;

c)

Determine the transaction price;

d)

Allocate the transaction price to the performance

obligations; and

e)

Recognise

revenue

when

a

performance

obligation is satisfied.

Revenues are measured at the fair value of the

consideration received or receivable, net of discounts

and other indirect taxes.

In Cost Plus Contracts – Revenue is recognised by

including eligible contractual items of expenditures

plus proportionate margin as per contract;

In Fixed Price Contracts – Revenue is recognised on

the basis of stage of completion of the contract. The

Group has assessed that the stage of completion

is determined as the proportion of the total time

expected to complete the performance obligation

to that has lapsed at the end of the reporting

period, which is an appropriate measure of progress

towards complete satisfaction of these performance

obligations under Ind AS 115.

Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress

toward completion are revised if circumstances

change. Any resulting increases or decreases in

estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or

loss in the period in which the circumstances that give

rise to the revision become known by management.

(vi) Revenue from consulting services, in connection with

development of Independent Transmission Projects

(ITP) and Ultra Mega Power Projects (UMPP) taken

up as per the directions from the Ministry of Power,

Government of India, is recognised on completed

contract method basis i.e. when the ITP / UMPP

created for the project is transferred to a successful

(iii) Project Monitoring

PFC has comprehensive project/loan monitoring guidelines that captures aspects relating to monitoring, tracking of

project construction, implementation, identifies risks where intervention is required to minimise the time/ cost overruns/

consequent slippages in disbursements and including progress of commissioned projects.

For State sector projects, monitoring is carried out based on project progress details obtained regularly from borrowers

through progress monitoring reports, site visits, discussions with the borrowers, information/reports available on Central

Electricity Authority’s (CEA) website etc.

For private sector, where PFC is Lead Financial Institution (FI), PFC engages Lenders’ Engineers (LEs) and Lenders’ Financial

Advisors (LFAs), which are independent agencies to act on behalf of various lenders/consortium members. The LEs

conduct periodic site visits, review relevant documents, discusses with the borrowers and submit its reports on progress

of the project. LFAs submit the statements of fund flow and utilisation of funds in the project periodically. In cases where

PFC is not the lead FI, the tasks related to LEs and LFAs services are coordinated with the concerned lead lender.

Also, the consolidated periodic progress report of certain projects is prepared comprising important observations/ issues

viz. areas of concern, reasons for delay, issues affecting project construction/implementation etc. and is reviewed by PFC

on a regular basis.

PFC continuously monitors delays and/or default of borrowers and their recoverability. On occurrence of default in the

borrower’s account, PFC initiates necessary steps which may involve action(s) including, but not limited to, Special Mention

Account (SMA) reporting to RBI, credit information reporting to Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC)

etc., regularisation of the account by recovering all overdues, invocation of guarantees/ securities to recover the dues,

conversion of loan into equity as per loan agreement, restructuring of loan account, formulating resolution plan with the

borrower, change in ownership, Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under IBC -2016, sale of the exposures to

other entities/investors, other recovery mechanisms like referring the case for legal action before Debt Recovery Tribunal

(DRT), SARFAESI, etc. and other actions as specified under regulatory/legal framework.

B.

In respect of RECL

The credit risk is managed at different levels including at appraisal, disbursements and post disbursement monitoring. RECL has

"Integrated Rating Guidelines" and "Comprehensive Risk Management Policy". To mitigate credit risk, RECL follows systematic

institutional and project appraisal process to assess the credit risk. These processes include a detailed appraisal methodology,

identification of risks and suitable structuring and credit risk mitigation measures. Further, on periodic basis, the loan assets

are reviewed and categorised as High/Moderate/Low based on ECL Methodology. The process for Credit Risk Management is

as under:

(i)

RECL has "Integrated Rating Guidelines" covering credit assessment, risk grading, collateral requirements, reporting,

monitoring of end utilisation of funds etc. Further, independent Lender legal counsels are appointed to ensure effective

documentation and mitigation of legal risk.

(ii)

For all existing private sector projects, where RECL is Lead Financial Institution, RECL engages Lender’s Independent

Engineers (LIE), Lender’s Financial Advisors (LFA) and Lender’s Insurance Advisors (LIA), which are independent agencies:

Letter of Comfort (LoC) and Guarantee of ` 98.11 Cr. (as at March 31, 2021 ` 66.12 Cr.)

Loans to state sector are well diversified as these are extended to multiple entities under the control of various State

Governments and Central Government. The Companies considers that these loans have a low credit risk in comparison to

lending to private sector mainly due to low default/loss history in state sector and availability of government guarantee in

certain loans. Presence of Government interest in these projects also lowers the risk of non-recoverability of dues.

Further, the Companies have a lending portfolio comprising of loans to generation, renewable, transmission and distribution

power projects spread across diverse geographical areas.

46.1.8 Write off of Loan Assets

PFC and RECL writes off financial assets, in whole or in part, when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators

that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include ceasure of enforcement activity or where the Company’s recovery

method is foreclosing on collateral and the value of collateral is such that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery in full.

46.1.9 Policy for sale out of amortised cost business

PFC & RECL does not resort to the sale of financial assets, in ordinary course of business. However, the respective companies

B.

In respect of PFCCL

The trade receivables of PFCCL comprises mainly amount recoverable from the State Government entities. RECL considers that

the exposure to state sector have a low credit risk mainly due to low default/loss history. Further, the presence of Government

interest lowers the risk of non-recoverability.

Subsequent to initial recognition, PFCCL recognises expected credit loss (ECL) on financial assets especially on trade receivables

other than related parties. ECL is recognised at 100% on the trade receivables due for more than 2 years and 50% on the trade

receivables due for more than one year and less than 2 years.:
