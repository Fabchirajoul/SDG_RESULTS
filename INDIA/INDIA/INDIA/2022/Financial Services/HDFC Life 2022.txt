HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited

Integrated Annual Report 2021-22:

Dear Shareholders,

The year started on a challenging

note as COVID’s second wave had a

catastrophic impact on society and

the economy. It was a difficult period.

The dedication, commitment and

courage displayed by our frontline

workers

in

such

testing

times

deserve

our

deepest

gratitude.

While

the

unprecedented

crisis

challenged our public health systems,

we emerged stronger, thanks to the

indomitable human spirit and the

character of our people.

Alongside the contributions of the

frontline workers, we should also

duly acknowledge the efforts put

in by the essential services staff.

Risking their lives, and in some cases

despite personal tragedies, these

employees have ensured seamless

service delivery.

We, at HDFC Life, supported our

employees

by

leveraging

our

technological

capabilities

and

facilitating

remote

work

to

the

extent possible. We thus created

a nimble operating model that has

not only helped us in meeting our

commitment to shareholders but

has also prepared us to re-imagine

a future that is more responsive,

customer-friendly and efficient.

One of the most critical and often

under-appreciated aspects of our

industry is its social impact. This year

the moment of truth openly played

out for the life insurance industry.

The total amount of death claims

paid by all insurers put together

exceeded ` 60,000 crore in the

first nine months of FY 2021-22 i.e.

over 2x higher than the total death

claims paid for corresponding nine

months of FY 2020-21, amounting to

` ~29,500 crore. This gives us all an

idea of the kind of financial support

that the industry has provided in such

difficult times. Also, the total number

of agents currently licensed with life

insurance companies exceeds 24 lakh.

The industry is a significant source of

income for a large number of agents.

We are in dialogue with the regulator

to enable life insurance companies

to sell other regulated financial

products akin to banks. This will

help improve customer experience,

deepen financial inclusion and also

increase insurance penetration.

Dear Shareholders,

After

witnessing

significant

disruption in FY 2020-21 on account

of the COVID-19 pandemic, we

entered FY 2021-22 with a relatively

better understanding of the risks

and a glimmer of hope in the form of

a vaccine. As the country embarked

upon its vaccination program, it was

seen not just as a health response,

but also as a much-needed cushion

against

economic

disruptions

caused by resurgent waves of the

pandemic. Overall, however, the

past year remained volatile with

repeated

waves

of

infections,

supply chain disruptions and more

recently, inflation. In addition, the

recent withdrawal of liquidity by

major central banks has made global

capital flows quite volatile. We must

now prepare for a post-COVID world

that seems to have permanently

changed in terms of consumer

behaviour, technology adoption and

geo-political landscapes.

FY 2021-22, a bumpy path to

normalcy

FY 2021-22 started on a difficult

note with the Delta virus wreaking

havoc across the country, causing

great human suffering and economic

damage. It took us a few months to

get through the difficult period and

get

back

to

normalcy.

During

this period, business operations

were disrupted but we were able

to

weather

the

storm

due

to

the investments made in digital

capabilities during the first wave of

the pandemic. Indian life insurers

received greatly elevated number of

death claims which had a material

impact on the profitability of the

industry. The normalcy after the

second wave was short-lived as

the new variant of coronavirus –

Omicron, spread rapidly across the

nation. Businesses were disrupted

once again, however, the impact of

the third wave was thankfully short-

lived and did not cause the scale

of human and economic damage

seen in the second wave. We have

returned to normalcy once again, in

the latter part of the fourth quarter.

Despite

disruptions

in

physical

operations during the year, our self

service capabilities have helped us

maintain high levels of customer and

distributor service. In FY 2021-22,

Mr. Suresh Badami - Executive Director:

revenue account as on March 31, 2022. Consequently, the numbers for the previous year have been regrouped to align

with current periods classification.:

letter dated July 19, 2021, supplemented by an addendum to the engagement: letter, dated September 29,

2021. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Willis Towers Watson does not accept or assume any responsibility,

duty of care or liability to anyone other than Exide Life for or in connection with its review work, the opinions it has formed

or for any statements set forth in this opinion.

COVID-19 is an ongoing and continuously evolving issue which has and will continue to have significant effects on global

economic activity and insurance claims experience. The actual effects of COVID-19 could have an unexpected material

impact on our findings. The level of uncertainty affecting our conclusions and the underlying volatility of actual outcomes

is increased because of the emergence and contingent evolution of COVID-19.
