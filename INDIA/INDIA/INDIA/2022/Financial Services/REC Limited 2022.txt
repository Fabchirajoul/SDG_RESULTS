appointed in the Company, as required under the RBI norms. Further,

the Company has adopted policy and framework for Risk Based

Internal Audit, in line with the requirements of RBI.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Your Company pursues CSR initiatives with focus on socially

beneficial projects to reach a wide spectrum of beneficiaries, while

giving priority to developmental issues of national concern. During

the financial year 2021-22, REC has supported CSR projects in various

MoU RATING & AWARDS

In terms of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with

the holding company, Power Finance Corporation Limited, the

performance of your Company has been rated as “Excellent” for the

financial year 2020-21, with a perfect score of 100 by the Department

of Public Enterprises. REC is the only CPSE in the country, to secure

100 out of 100 marks in MoU evaluation last year.

Not only that, your Company has been named as India’s Leading

NBFC in Infrastructure Financing Category by Dun & Bradstreet, at its

BFSI & FinTech Awards; and also the ‘Best Organization for Women

Empowerment’ by Exchange4Media, at its Women Achievers Awards.

THE PATH AHEAD

With implementation of programmes like ‘24x7 Power for All’,

we expect a huge latent demand for power in the near future. The

increased power demand would also require robust transmission &

distribution infrastructure, thereby attracting more investment in

was 17% above the net worth a year ago, indicating significant

value addition. As an Infrastructure Finance Company, REC’s Gross

Loan Asset Book as on March 31, 2022, stood at a historic high of

₹3,85,371 crore. Your Company maintained “AAA” rating for its

domestic debt instruments and international rating of “Baa3” and

“BBB-”, which is at par with the sovereign rating of India. These

strong fundamentals are coupled with a future-ready outlook, which

empower us for the times to come.

In addition to its business goals, REC has also been and shall continue

to be, a reliable partner of the Government in achieving national

goals of the power sector. It is heartening to see that electricity

has reached the remotest corners of the country. The flagship

schemes of Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and

Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA), for which

your Company was the nodal agency of the Ministry of Power,

achieved successful completion and have truly laid the foundation of

Ujjwal Bharat, a brighter and more prosperous India. The power

sector is now poised for modernization and technological

up-gradation, reduction of power prices for consumers and

optimization of efficiency and service delivery. We are proud to be

associated with the ₹3 lakh crore reforms-based and results-linked

Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) of the Government,

which is a progressive step in this direction.

ECONOMIC OVERVIEW

The global economy entered the year 2022 in a weaker position

than previously expected, with the pandemic causing inflation,

increase in food prices and disrupted supply chains across the

world. Geopolitical conflicts and the war in Ukraine also added to

the uncertainty. However, general business sentiment is improving

across the globe. Even as the supply chains faced inevitable

pressure after the pandemic, trade of goods & services picked up

fast and continues to be stronger. As per a report by the United

Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the value of global

trade reached a record level of USD 28.5 trillion in 2021, which is

an increase of 25% over 2020 and 13% over 2019, just before the

pandemic struck. Trade in services also grew substantially, nearly

reaching their pre-pandemic levels.

Inflation, however, is expected to remain elevated for a longer

period than previous forecasts. For 2022, the inflation is projected

at 5.7% in advanced economies and 8.7% in emerging market &

developing economies. Countries which have weaker economic

policies and higher dependence on global supply chains, are bound

to be more affected in this scenario. This is where we must realize

the importance of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the mantra given by our

Hon’ble Prime Minister.

India continues to reign as the fastest growing economy in the world.

RBI has projected real GDP growth of India at 7.2% for FY 2022-23,

whereas Asian Development Bank has pegged India’s GDP growth at

7.5% in 2022-23 and 8% in 2023-24. We saw an immensely successful

nation-wide vaccination programme, which was instrumental

in containing the damage by the pandemic, given the huge

demographics of our country. The Government’s broad range of Covid

responses, including fiscal, monetary and health packages, mitigated

the adversities well in time. The results are visible in improving

socio-economic indicators such as power demand, labour

participation and railway freight traffic. Having said that, I would

say, it is still not the time to drop caution, by industry as well as by

common citizens. We have to strengthen ourselves as a nation and

support each other, so as to absorb any external impacts.

POWER SECTOR REFORMS

The global electricity demand grew by 6% in 2021, which is a healthy

sign of economic recovery. In India, the total installed generation

capacity crossed the 400 GW mark. Record increase in transmission

lines and additions to renewable energy space are taking place

rapidly. In addition, the Government is rolling out several reforms

to strengthen the distribution sector. RDSS, the recently launched

scheme of the Government after the success of DDUGJY and

SAUBHAGYA, is aimed to improve the quality, reliability and

affordability of power supply to consumers, through a financially

sustainable and operationally efficient distribution sector.

The objectives of RDSS include reduction in AT&C losses to pan-India

levels of 12-15% by 2024-25 and reduction in ACS-ARR gap to zero

by 2024-25, both extremely important milestones for the holistic

growth of power sector. The scheme also lays special emphasis on

leveraging advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence and

Machine Learning.

Under the guidance of Ministry of Power, your Company has

developed a framework for ‘DISCOM Consumer Service Rating’,

wherein discoms are rated based on operational parameters, with

the aim to promote healthy competition and improve performance

in deficient areas. Your Company is also publishing periodic reports

on key regulatory parameters, which provide a guiding light to the

power sector, through compilation, benchmarking and comparative

assessment of various utilities and highlighting corrective measures

wherever required.

As a step towards addressing the mounting power purchase dues of

State power utilities, the Ministry of Power has issued the Electricity

(Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022 or

LPS Rules, with the aim to financially strengthen the electricity

suppliers and bringing financial discipline. REC will be extending

financial support to discoms for timely payment of their dues under

the LPS Rules, which will help in achieving financial sustainability in

the Indian power sector.

FINANCIAL & OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE

After the pandemic, power projects witnessed some delays in

take-off and commissioning, owing to movement restrictions, labour

issues etc. As a spillover, the Company’s sanction of loans during

FY 2021-22 were on the lower side, at ₹54,422 crore. These loans were

towards various conventional generation projects, renewable energy

projects, T&D projects, short-term, medium-term and other loans.

Renewable projects constituted 27% of the total loans sanctioned

during the year. Your Company is constantly endeavoring to increase

its green portfolio, in keeping with the Government’s long-term

vision for renewable energy sector.

The disbursements made by your Company during FY 2021-22

were ₹64,150 crore, towards various conventional generation

projects, renewable energy projects, T&D projects and other loans,

including counter-part funding under DDUGJY and SAUBHAGYA.

The disbursements included ₹19,752 crore to various power

utilities under the Liquidity Infusion Scheme of the Government,

under Atmanirbhar Bharat. Apart from the above, your Company

also disbursed a subsidy of ₹5,318 crore under various Government

schemes.

The operating income of your Company for FY 2021-22 was

₹39,132 crore on a standalone basis, which was 11% higher than last

year. The total comprehensive income for FY 2021-22 was ₹9,987:

For and on behalf of the Board of Directors

Vivek Kumar Dewangan

Chairman &: Managing

Letter of Credit (LoC) as payment security

mechanism under power purchase agreement (PPA) by distribution

licensees. The order mandates NLDC (National Load Dispatch Centre)

and RLDC (Regional Load Dispatch Centres) to dispatch power, only

after the generating companies intimate and confirm the opening of

LoC by discoms.

In the backdrop of outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the Central

Government had announced a Liquidity Infusion Scheme as part

of Atmanirbhar Bharat on May 13, 2020, under which REC and PFC

have extended special long-term transition loans at concessional

rates to discoms. The loans were against the receivables of discoms

from State Governments, in the form of electricity dues and subsidy

not disbursed, to enable them to clear their outstanding dues as

existed on June 30, 2020 towards central public sector undertakings,

generation & transmission companies, independent power producers

and renewable energy generators. Various distribution utilities in the

country have been sanctioned total loans worth ₹1.40 lakh crore and

disbursed loans worth ₹1.12 lakh crore so far, under the LIS scheme.

These reform measures are aimed at improving the financial health

of discoms, leading to a reduction in outstanding dues to power

generating companies.

Power Sector Policy Environment

Power is one of the key sectors attracting FDI inflow into India. 100%

FDI is allowed under the automatic route in the power segment and

renewable energy.

The Government of India has taken significant policy measures in

the past years to restructure the power sector, increase capacity and

improve transmission, sub-transmission & distribution network etc.

The Electricity Act of 2003 brought sweeping changes to the legal

framework governing the sector, which was followed by notification

of National Electricity Policy, National Tariff Policy, Renewable Energy

Policy, National Hydro Policy and Mega Power Policy, reflecting the

measures taken by the Government to bring competitiveness and

efficiency in the sector.

The Rural Electrification Policy was notified in August 2006, with the

objective of improving access and quality of electricity supply in rural

areas to ensure rapid economic development, by providing electricity

as an input for productive uses in agriculture, rural industries etc.

Over the past few years, Indian power sector has undergone

significant transformation that has redefined the industry outlook,

through path-breaking policy initiatives such as UDAY, Power for

All, UJALA, village & household electrification and now RDSS, to

name a few. While discom reforms have achieved limited financial

success, policy reforms like payment security mechanism, power-cut

penalization, Electricity Amendment Bill etc., will go a long way in

enhancing efficiencies in the sector. India has already kick-started the

process of privatization of power distribution in Union Territories, to

usher in competition, forcing discoms to improve their performance

standards and adopt a more consumer-centric approach rather than

remaining geographical monopolies.

Apart from the above, the Government’s Atmanirbhar push puts

the country firmly on an accelerated growth plan and makes India

a compelling investment opportunity for foreign capital. A huge

amount of this foreign capital is expected to flow into the Indian

infrastructure sector, facilitated further through InvITs and REITs.

The Union Budget for financial year 2022-23 is a step towards

innovative and sustainable development in New India, to

strengthen energy transition and fight climate change. The major

announcements of the budget relating to power sector, included:



Issue of Sovereign Green Bonds for mobilizing resources for

green infrastructure, for use in public sector projects, which help

in reducing the carbon intensity of the economy.



Co-firing of 5-7% biomass pellets in thermal power plants, which

will result in CO2 savings of 38 MMT (million metric tonnes)

annually. This will also provide extra income to farmers and

job opportunities to locals and help avoid stubble burning in

agricultural fields.



Allocation `19,500 crore (USD 2.57 billion) for a Production

Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to boost manufacturing of highly

efficient solar modules.



Four pilot projects for coal gasification and conversion of coal

into chemicals required for the industry, to evolve technical and

financial viability.



Energy efficiency and saving measures through setting up

of Energy Service Company (ESCO) business model in large

commercial buildings, to facilitate capacity building and

awareness for energy audits, performance contracts, common

measurement and verification protocol.



Considering the space constraint in urban areas for setting

up charging stations at scale, a battery swapping policy and

interoperability standards, to improve the e-vehicle ecosystem.

India strives to increase its green energy production as per the

Paris Agreement, with commitment to raise its Renewable Energy

contribution from current 25% to 40% by 2030. On the other hand,

Government has set a target of achieving 50% share of energy

from non-fossil fuels and 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. All

these targets would fuel the growth of clean energy generation. The

Government is providing various incentives to the power sector to

ensure sustainable production through one or other scheme, such

as solar roof-top programme, PM KUSUM (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja

Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan), etc.

The country is in the process of introducing important energy pricing

reforms in coal, oil, gas and electricity sectors, which are fundamental

to further opening up of the energy market and improving its

financial health. Significant steps are being taken to enhance energy

security in the country by fostering domestic production, through

most significant upstream reform of India’s Hydrocarbon Exploration

and Licensing Policy (HELP) and building up dedicated oil emergency

stocks in the form of a strategic petroleum reserve.

Energy Research, Development & Deployment (RD&D) can be a

strong enabler of India’s energy policy goals, while also contributing

to broader national priorities such as “Make in India”. Through RD&D,

the Government is working to attract global companies to produce

solar PV, lithium batteries, solar charging infrastructure and other

advanced technologies in India. As part of its climate policy agenda,

the Government has pursued a mission-based approach in various

policy areas, including solar power and hydropower. The Government

is strengthening its innovation efforts in a broad range of energy

technology areas, including cooling solutions, e-mobility, smart grids

and advanced bio-fuels.

Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS)

The Central Government has notified a reforms-based and results-

linked Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) in July, 2021,

with an outlay of ₹3,03,758 crore over a period of five years, from

FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26, with the objective to improve quality,

reliability and affordability of power supply to consumers through a

financially sustainable and operationally efficient distribution sector.

The scheme aims to reduce the AT&C losses to pan-India levels

of 12-15% and ACS-ARR gap to zero by 2024-25, by improving the

operational efficiencies and financial sustainability of all discoms /

power departments, excluding private sector discoms. REC and PFC

are the nodal agencies of RDSS scheme.

It is pertinent to mention that earlier schemes of Deendayal Upadhyaya

Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme

(IPDS) along with Prime Minister Development Package (PMDP-2015)

for the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir, have been subsumed

in RDSS as per their extant guidelines and under their existing terms

& conditions.

RDSS lays special emphasis on leveraging advanced technologies

to analyze data generated through IT/OT (Information Technology

and Operational Technology) devices, including system meters

and prepaid smart meters, to materialize the envisaged goal i.e.,

introducing advanced technologies like AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence

and Machine Learning) in power distribution, by leveraging

partnerships and consultations.

Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY)

Government of India’s flagship programme, Deendayal Upadhyaya

Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), for which REC is the nodal agency, has

been completed in its sunset year 2021-22 i.e., on March 31, 2022. The

MoP had notified DDUGJY in 2014, as an integrated scheme covering

all aspects of rural power distribution. The scheme had an approved

outlay of ₹43,033 crore, including budgetary support of ₹33,453 crore

from the Government of India. All erstwhile RE schemes (including

Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana i.e., RGGVY) were

subsumed in DDUGJY. After March 31, 2022, the DDUGJY scheme has

been subsumed in RDSS. On closures, the total executed cost under

the scheme has been arrived at ₹45,942.74 crore.

It is noteworthy that on August 15, 2015, the Hon’ble Prime Minister

had announced that all remaining 18,452 Un-Electrified (UE) villages

in the country would be electrified within 1,000 days. The MoP took

up the task on mission mode and assigned the work of monitoring

of electrification works of UE villages to REC. These UE villages were

located in highly inaccessible areas with tough terrain, extreme

temperatures, areas facing right-of-way issues or areas plagued by

insurgency and extremism. A new monitoring mechanism was set

up and ‘Gram Vidyut Abhiyantas’ (GVAs) were appointed at block/

district level. An online application, ‘GARV App’, was developed for

transparent and accountable monitoring of the progress of village

electrification. The commitment of Hon’ble Prime Minister to the

nation was fulfilled ahead of the deadline, with 100% electrification

of all un-electrified census inhabited villages getting completed as

on April 28, 2018.:

sector is 25% of owned funds in case of single borrower and 40% in case of a single group of borrowers and exposure for lending and

investing taken together can be upto 30% and 50% of owned funds, respectively.

In respect of Central/State Government entities, RBI vide its: letter No.DNBR.PD.CO.No.2184/03.10.001/2015-16 dated 16th June 2016

represented to RBI for further extension of above exemption for a further period of five years. The matter, considering Company’s

business model and strategic positioning being a Government Company, is under consideration of RBI and the response is awaited. In

Independent Auditors’ Report

To the Members of

REC Limited

Report on the Audit of Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the standalone Ind AS financial statements of REC Limited (“the Company”) which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31st

March, 2022, and the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income) and the Statement of Change in Equity and the

Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone Ind AS financial statements including a summary of significant

accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone Ind AS financial

statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, (“the Act”)in the manner so required and give a true & fair view in

conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of the affairs of the Company as at 31st March 2022, and

Profit (including other comprehensive income) and changes in equity and its cash flow for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143 (10) of the Act. Our responsibilities

under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements section

of our report. We are independent of the Company, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of

India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements under the provisions

of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the

Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Emphasis of matter

1.

We draw attention to Note No. 48.1.3 to the standalone Ind AS Financial Statements regarding, the provision of impairment allowance

in respect of its loan assets and Letters of Comfort. In this regard, we have relied upon the basis of determination of impairment

allowance, in so far as it relates to technical aspects/parameters considered by independent agency appointed by the company and

management judgement for ascertaining impairment allowance as management overlay.

2.

We draw attention to Note No. 50 of the standalone Ind AS Financial Statements regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the

Company. Management is of the view that there are no reasons to believe that the pandemic will have any significant impact on the

ability of the company to continue as a going concern. Nevertheless, the impact in sight of evolvement of pandemic in future period

is uncertain and could impact the impairment allowance in future years.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters (“KAM”) are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone Ind

AS financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone Ind AS Financial

Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined

the following matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report:

S. No.

Key Audit Matter

Auditor’s Response

1.

Impairment allowance of Loan Assets –

(Refer Note No. 48.1.3 to the Standalone Ind AS Financial

Statements read with accounting policy No. 3.11)

The Company follows a Board approved methodology

wherein assessment for allowance is carried out by

an external agency for impairment based on certain

criterion/framework classifying the assets into various

stages depending upon credit risk and level of evidence

of impairment.

Impairment allowance is measured as product of the

Probability of Default, Exposure at Default and Loss

Given Default being the key parameters for assessing the

impairment allowance.

We have applied following audit procedures in this regard

a). According to the provisions of Ind AS 109 “Financial Instruments”,

we have obtained the report of the external agency and verified

the criterion/framework with various regulatory updates

alongwith Company’s internal guidelines and procedures in

respect of the impairment allowance.

b)

Verification of loan assets on test check basis covering substantial

part of total loans with respect to monitoring thereof for recovery/

performance aspects and assessment of the loan impairment

considering management perception on the same.

c)

Recoveries are verified applying the standard audit procedures.

Loan balances are confirmed and quality of the borrower is

evaluated and tested with key control parameters.:

Consolidated Notes to Accounts

letter dated 17th September 2010 had categorized REC as an Infrastructure Finance Company (IFC) in terms of instructions

contained in RBI Circular CC No.168 dated 12th February 2010. As an IFC, the total permissible exposure for lending in the private

sector is 25% of owned funds in case of single borrower and 40% in case of a single group of borrowers and exposure for lending and

investing taken together can be upto 30% and 50% of owned funds, respectively.

In respect of Central/State Government entities, RBI vide its: letter No.DNBR.PD.CO.No.2184/03.10.001/2015-16 dated 16th June 2016

represented to RBI for further extension of above exemption for a further period of five years. The matter, considering Company’s

business model and strategic positioning being a Government Company, is under consideration of RBI and the response is awaited. In

view of the above, our maximum credit exposure limits to Central and State power Utilities continue to vary maximum upto 150% of

owned funds, which is based on the board approved policy and the rating of the borrowers as per entity appraisal.

responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial

Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by ICAI, and we have fulfilled

our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the provisions of the Act, 2013. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is

sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Emphasis of matter

1.

We draw attention to Note No. 52.1.3 of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements regarding, the provision of impairment allowance

in respect of its loan assets and Letters of Comfort. In this regard, we have relied upon the basis of determination of impairment

allowance, in so far as it relates to technical aspects/parameters considered by independent agency and management judgement for

ascertaining impairment allowance as management overlay.

2.

We draw attention to Note No. 54 of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the

Company. Management is of the view that there are no reasons to believe that the pandemic will have any significant impact on the

ability of the company to continue as a going concern. Nevertheless, the impact in sight of evolvement of pandemic in future period

is uncertain and could impact the impairment allowance in future years.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.
