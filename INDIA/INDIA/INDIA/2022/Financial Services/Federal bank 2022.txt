Message from the Chairman

The Bank has been working

towards becoming the First

Choice for all Indians, with its

philosophy of superior customer

service at the core.: Dear Shareholders,

Greetings!

I am extremely delighted to write to you

as the

Managing Director and CEO: Dear Shareholders,

Let me begin by thanking you for all the support and encouragement

over the years. I consider it a privilege to report to you on our progress

and share our plans for the years ahead. This being my 12th Annual

Report update, I seek your indulgence to use 12 short narratives to

outline the development and plans of our bank.

You may have observed that over the years our guiding

philosophy has always been to focus on the ‘here & now’ while

our eyes are rivetted firmly on the opportunities that lie ahead.

Inspired by this practice, this year our Annual Report has been

themed as ‘Responsible, Sustainable & Progressive Today for a

better Tomorrow’.

Let me elaborate on this theme though the filter of our employees,

communities, customers, financial performance, and strategic

initiatives that will help create a sustainable franchise that makes us

the ‘The Most Admired Bank’ ( MAB ).

We are delighted that for the second year on the trot, we

have been ranked in the Top 50 (moved up 21 slots to 26)

in the, Great Place to Work® Survey. We are determined

to break into the Top 10 very soon. You will be happy to

note that COVID or any other challenges will not deter ‘Team Federal’

from ‘Mission Top 10’.

Our commitment to the communities we live and work

in is unparalleled. ‘Sanjeevani - A Shot of Life’ was an

example of our outreach to so many in the far corners of

rural India who may have never benefited from vaccines. The program

helped catalyze the government initiatives to create awareness and

help vaccinate lakhs of folks who otherwise may have had challenges

of inadequate assistance or resources.

The year that went by fetched us many accolades, and in particular the

BT-KPMG Best Banks Survey chose us for the second time as the top

Bank in two years. Every award is certainly an inspiration and equally

a reminder for us to do better work in the period ahead. We are

determined to do that, always.

Last year we launched Feddy, our AI powered

virtual

assistant.

Feddy

has

since

grown

up!

The technology powering Feddy is richer, stabler and

more humanlike and is helping us deliver on our mantra of

Digital at Fore and Human at Core (DFHC). This doctrine is

shaping our successful technology capabilities. Over 230+

RPAs (robotic process automation) and 300+ APIs are

helping us both increase productivity and engage meaningfully with a

range of Fintech Partnerships.

FEDERAL BANK

14

Managing Director

& CEO. Further, trainings, webinars and

workshops are being conducted to build

employee capacity.

Our focus is on phasing out coal-related

subproject exposure and building a green

portfolio by financing firms / projects

in energy efficiency, renewable energy,

climate-smart agriculture, green buildings

and waste management. This will provide

significant business opportunity as well as

mitigate risks related to climate change.

Towards a Better Tomorrow by

Adopting the Right Business Model

Tackling climate change is a global priority as the world faces imminent

challenge of losing 11 to 14% of its output amounting to ~USD 23 trillion by

2050. The urgency necessitated COP26 to revise its target for limiting the

global temperature rise to 1.5

oC from 2

oC earlier.

At Federal Bank, we are joining the global efforts. We are adopting

sustainable practices both in processes and in business model to help the

Nation transition to a less-carbon and sustainable economy, as it strives to

reach the target of net-zero by 2070.

This is the right way forward for a better world, and it will also help us in

mitigating environmental and social (E&S) risks and gain from incremental

business opportunities coming up from global sustainability efforts.

INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEIR ADEQUACY

The Bank has through the years developed and stabilized an

effective internal control system calibrated to the risk appetite

of the Bank and aligned to the scale, size and complexity of its

operations. The scope and authority of the internal audit function

is defined in the Audit and Inspection Policy of the Bank, duly

approved by the Board of Directors. In order to help Bank achieve

its mission of adopting the best professional practices prevailing

in the industry, while framing the policy, substantial inputs are

taken from - RBI guidance note on Risk Based Internal Audit, ‘The

internal audit function in banks’ published by Basel Committee

on Banking Supervision and RBI Circular on ‘Concurrent Audit

System’. Audit and Inspection Policy is reviewed annually. Policy is

reviewed considering various guidelines of RBI, Basel Committee

recommendations, ICAI guidelines, other statutory / regulatory

guidelines, directions of Board / Audit Committee of the Board

issued from time to time and periodic internal guidelines /

instructions issued by the Bank. At the enterprise level, the

Inspection and Audit Department, on a continuous basis,

assesses and monitors the effectiveness of the control systems

and its adequacy to meet the growing complexities. The audit

function essentially validates the compliance of Bank’s processes

and operations with regulatory guidelines, accounting procedures

and Bank’s own internal rules and guidelines. A department level

group meets on periodical intervals to discuss latest internal / RBI

/ regulatory guidelines for ensuring that the required changes are

implemented for making the audit function updated and dynamic.

The Bank has a robust system towards escalating the audit

Managing Director & CEO, Whole Time

Directors and Material Risk Takers (MRTs)

The compensation paid out to the referred functionaries is divided

into two components:

The fixed compensation is determined based on the relevant

factors such as industry standards, the exposure, skill sets, talent

and qualification attained by the official over his/her career span

and adherence to statutory requirements. All the fixed items of

compensation, including the perquisites, will be treated as part

of fixed pay. Perquisites that are reimbursable would also be

included in the fixed pay so long as there are monetary ceilings on

these reimbursements. Contributions towards superannuation/

retiral benefits will also be treated as part of fixed pay. (Approval

from RBI to be taken as per section 35B of the Banking Regulation

Act while deciding the fixed and variable compensation part for: Managing

Managing Director & CEO and Whole Time Directors,

serious supervisory observations (if any) shall be factored, which

will be ensured through suitable processes.

Risk, Control and Compliance Staff

Members of staff engaged in financial and risk control, including

internal audit, are compensated in a manner that is independent

of the business areas they oversee and commensurate with their

key role in the Bank. The total fixed and variable compensation

paid out to the employees in the Risk Control and Compliance

Function is decided independent of business parameters. The mix

of fixed and variable compensation for control function personnel

is weighted in favour of fixed compensation, to ensure autonomy

and independence from business goals.

Other categories of Staff

The compensation package applicable to Executives in Level IV

to VII was fixed and governed based on the periodical industry

level settlements under IBA pattern. To make the Compensation

Structure market driven and competitive, a new performance

based compensation package called “Grander Compensation

Package” has been introduced for Executives in Level IV and

above with effect from May 01, 2017 which consists of both

fixed and variable compensation. The Compensation Package of

Executives under Non Grander Compensation Package comprises

of fixed compensation (determined based on the relevant factors

such as industry standards, the exposure, skill sets, talent and

qualification attained by the official over his/her career span)

and variable compensation (comprising of cash, share-linked

instruments, or a mix of both cash and share-linked instruments).

The compensation paid to Award Staff and Officers coming

under Scale I to III is fixed based on the periodic industry level

settlements with Indian Banks’ Association. The present scale

of pay and other service conditions applicable to employees,

whose compensation package is governed under IBA package is

as per provisions of 11th Bipartite Settlement/ Joint note dated

November 11, 2020.

DIGITAL & TECHNOLOGY

Digital, the word in itself is a definition and has become an

indispensable part of our daily routines irrespective of the

demography. With the arrival of the pandemic in 2020, an

existential effort by institutions across industries, began. The core

part of this strategy to “Go Digital” for this was to turn out to be

deciding factor in the survival of the fittest. Digital is no more a

differentiating factor but a necessary and mission critical one.

Your Bank has always been the flag bearer of introducing

novel and useful digital initiatives time and again. Products like

FedBook and Selfie app to open accounts are testimony of your

Bank’s inclination towards digital innovation. Today, a prospective

customer of your Bank can open a full-fledged account in less

than 5 minutes, using the Video KYC services, facilitated by e-KYC

services of UIDAI and the new regulations allowing the usage

of Video calling service for completing customer due diligence.

The technology enables them to open accounts as per their

preferred scheme from the comfort of their office or any other

Indian location.

Your Bank also had launched FedSwagat, an online appointment

booking solution to allow the customers to book an appointment

with a branch staff avoiding all the hassle of a queue in these

uncertain times.

Your Bank also introduced an AI based personal assistant ‘Feddy’

which is a true omnichannel virtual assistant for customers to help

them with their queries. To make Feddy a true flagship banking

assistant, we launched an industry first true ‘24x7’ Live feature in

Feddy across channels such as WhatsApp, Google Maps + Search

and Website. Now customers need not call the legacy call center,

for they can now connect with a bank’s agent over the chat on all

these popular platforms.

and firm-wide) and KPAs set for the official. The organization’s performance is charted based on Performance

Scorecard which takes into account various financial indicators like revenue earned, cost deployed, profit earned,

NPA position and other intangible factors like leadership and employee development. The Scorecard provides a mix

of Financial and Non-Financial, Quantitative and Qualitative Metrics. Additionally, serious supervisory observations

(if any) are also factored. The variable pay is paid in the form of share-linked instruments, or a mix of cash and

share-linked instruments.

Risk, Control and Compliance Staff: Members of staff engaged in financial and risk control, including internal audit, are

compensated in a manner that is independent of the business areas they oversee and commensurate with their key

role in the bank. The total fixed and variable compensation paid out to the employees in the Risk Control and Compliance

Function is decided independent of business parameters. The mix of fixed and variable compensation for control function

personnel is weighted in favour of fixed compensation, to ensure autonomy and independence from business goals.

RISK EXPOSURE AND ASSESSMENT

1.

Credit risk

Strategies and processes:

The Bank is exposed to credit risk in its lending operations. The Bank’s strategies to manage the credit risks are given below:

a)

Defined segment exposures delineated into Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Corporate, Retail and Agri advances.

b)

Industry wise segment ceilings on aggregate lending in respect of certain industries, ceilings have been fixed for specific

geographies with a view to contain Concentration risk.

c)

Individual borrower wise and borrower group wise lending ceilings linked as a percentage to the Bank’s eligible capital base as

at the end of the previous year.

d)

Borrowers are subjected to credit rating and loans are granted only to those borrowers falling within defined thresholds of

risk levels; the approach also includes diversification of borrowers within defined thresholds of risk levels.

e)

Major business of the Bank is within India. However, bank has an IFSC branch located in GIFT City, Gujarat. In respect of cross

border trade which would involve exposures to banks and financial institutions located outside India, there is a geographic cap

on exposures apart from cap on individual bank / institution. Bank has also fixed ceiling for its foreign currency exposures.

f)

Bank has adopted a well-defined approach for sourcing and underwriting loan proposals. Proper due diligence is carried out

while sourcing fresh credit limits.

g)

Credit sanctioning powers are granted as per Credit Delegation Policy based upon the amount and riskiness of the exposure.

h)

Regular review of all credit policies including exposure ceilings are carried out with due approval of Bank’s Board of Directors.

i)

Credit hub system is put in place to enhance quality of credit appraisal and underwriting process.:
