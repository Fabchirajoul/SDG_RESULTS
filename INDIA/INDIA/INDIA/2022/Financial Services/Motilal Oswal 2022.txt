Dear Shareholders,

India entered into FY2022 with the threat of 2nd

Covid wave looming over. Despite the pandemic

situation, markets continued to have a buliish run

as both indices touched all-time high in the

month of October 2021. There was an increasing

retail participation in capital markets witnessed

during the year as the industry added all-time high

demat

accounts

along

with

record

fund

mobilization through IPO route. With tensions

arising due to Russia Ukraine conﬂict, market

witnessed a free fall. Subsequently, markets

bounced back and erased some of its losses by

March 2022.

FY2022 added another feather in our cap as we continued to reach new highs on several parameters. We reported

highest ever consolidated revenues of ` 4,320 crore and PAT of ` 1,311 crore. Our operating PAT touched an

all-time high of ` 905 crore, registering a growth of 69% YoY. Our ROE, excluding other comprehensive income,

stood at 30% in FY2022. Our focus on knowledge, talent, processes, technology, brand & culture and inter-segment

synergies have helped us in achieving key milestones across all business verticals. We continue to remain

optimistic on the growth potential of our all business verticals given the robust fundamental structure.

On the capital markets front, Indian equity markets continued their bullish run for most part of the ﬁnancial year.

The industry witnessed a record of 3.5 crore new demat accounts being opened. While FIIs were on a selling spree

in FY2022, DIIs offset the pressure and recorded highest ever inﬂows. The success of “Phygital Business model”

of our broking business has continued to yield positive results as we recorded highest ever Broking revenues,

proﬁt and ADTO in FY2022. We successfully added 8.8 lakh clients in FY2022, taking the total retail client base to

~28.5 lakh. We have one of the highest ARPUs in the industry. Our cash market share was at multi period high in

FY2022. Our distribution AUM at ` 16,764 crore has huge head-room for growth. We have made signiﬁcant

investments in this business in talent and digital marketing. In Institution business, our rankings and clientele

continued to remain robust. We were awarded #1 Domestic Brokerage and Overall Sales in Asia Money Brokers

Poll 2021. Our Investment Banking business made a turnaround in performance this year as we closed 13 deals.

We continue to engage on a wide cross-section of mandated transactions across capital markets and advisory.

Our AMC AUM which includes MF, PMS and AIF stood at ` 49,020 crore in FY2022. SIP inﬂows crossed ` 200 crore

monthly milestone in FY2022 with highest ever monthly inﬂows recorded in March 2022. Our gross sales at AMC

level increased by 49% YoY led by 125% growth in Alternate sales. Further, improvement in performance coupled

with decline in redemptions has resulted in strong positive net sales in FY2022 as compared to net outﬂows in

FY2021. We have witnessed strong traction in our Passive offerings, our AUM crossed ` 10,000 crore mark. Fee

earning PE and RE AUM crossed ` 10,000 crore. We exited from all investments of IBEF I and the fund had

delivered a XIRR of ~27%. During the year, we launched IBEF IV, the biggest PE fund, with a target size of ` 4,500

crore. We have witnessed overwhelming response to this fund as it has achieved its 2nd close at ` 4,000 crore.

MD’s MESSAGE

Motilal Oswal: Managing Director & Chief Executive Oﬃcer

Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited

IREF V, which was launched in FY2021, attained its close at ` 1,215 crore. Our wealth management business

recorded 53% YoY growth in revenue led by 36% YoY growth in AUM at ` 34,389 crore and strong net sales

of ` 5,400 crore. Strong operating leverage was visible in this business which was led by improvement in RM

productivity. We continue to invest in this business by adding RMs. With improvement in the vintage of RMs, the

proﬁtability of our wealth management is poised for further traction.

On our housing ﬁnance business, our efforts to strengthen the organisation in terms of processes, systems,

manpower, culture and structure has yielded results, as we recorded highest ever proﬁtability in FY2022. During

the year, CRISIL/ICRA upgraded/assigned AA rating to long term borrowings of MOHFL. Our full year

disbursements grew by 136% YoY to ` 643 crore. We have joined hands with U.S. International Development

Finance Corporation (DFC), world’s largest development ﬁnance institution during the course of FY2022. DFC has

committed USD 50 million as a long term loan under ECB route. Apart from that, we continued to have strong

Liability Mobilizations from various Banks & Institutions at competitive rates. Our cost of borrowings for FY2022

stood at 8.2%, down by 105 bps YoY. Further, we have expanded our sales force with 600+ sales employees

currently in place and expanded our presence in Northern India. In our fund based businesses (comprising of

sponsor commitments to quoted equity and private equity funds), we recorded gains on investments at ` 407

crore. As per IND-AS, these gains are a part of our reported earnings. Our QGLP philosophy, niche expertise in

equities, proven track record and belief in ‘skin in the game’, augurs well for our fund based business.

Some of the key highlights of FY2022 include group’s asset under advice crossing ` 3 lakh crore mark, 68% growth

in PAT of Capital Markets business, 116% growth in PAT of Wealth Management business, successful launch of

IBEF IV fund and highest ever NIM and lowest ever COF for Home Finance business.

Our strategy to diversify our business model towards linear sources of earnings continue to show positive results.

Capital Market business, which is our oldest and cash cow business, has achieved new high on various

parameters and continues to beneﬁt from industry consolidation led by knowledge driven Phygital offerings. Our

Asset Management business is likely to gain from strong product performance and its niche offerings. Going

forward, with ample room for scalability of our Housing Finance and other businesses, we remain excited for the

future prospects of the Company.

IMF has estimated a growth rate of 8.2% in FY2023 with India retaining its tag as the fastest growing major global

economy. India is gradually becoming a preferred investment hub for many global MNCs. The growing demand for

affordable housing industry stands positive for our business. Sustenance of macros at reasonable levels augurs

well for our business and industry as a whole. As these macro trends open up opportunities, our experience and

emphasis on ‘Knowledge First’ give us the ability to capture these growth prospects.

I sincerely thank all the employees for their unwavering commitment towards the Company in the thick and thin of

the journey. I also thank all the stakeholders who have shown support and rendered well-wishes for the Company.

I have no doubts that the new ﬁnancial year will bring its own challenges and opportunities and that this ﬁne team

will be up and running to face them.
