Dear Shareholders,

It is said that tough times make us stronger.

Proving this right, after the raging impact of

the pandemic, economic activities gathered

momentum and domestic economy posted a

decent recovery during the fiscal year 2022 on

the back of pent-up demand and relaxation of

the COVID-19 induced restrictions. Proactive

measures taken by the Government and

regulators across sectors went a long way in

minimising disruptions caused by the second

and third covid waves. On the global front, the

economy briefly revived until the growth was

hampered by the geo-political conditions in

Europe since February 2022.

Despite the volatile economic scenario, our

businesses embraced changes, developed clear

strategies and demonstrated resilience during

the year. I am pleased to share with you the: MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Company’s performance highlights during

FY 22. The Company together with its group

entities continued to deliver a consistent

performance during the year. Our consolidated

income grew around 6% to `14,735 Crore and

profits after tax grew by 27% to `2,239 Crore.

At standalone levels, the Company’s total

income was `84 Crore and profits after

tax was `56 Crore for the same period. I am

glad to inform you that the Company’s Board

has recommended a dividend @ 55% for

shareholders’ approval at the upcoming

annual general meeting.

Over the years, financial services industry has

undergone rapid expansion. More specifically,

the NBFC sector in which our business operates,

witnessed a roller coaster trend in the last few

years. Though the sector saw a setback in the first

quarter owing to wave 2 lockdowns, it posted a

broad revival from the second quarter of the fiscal

year 2022 as economic activities progressed. The

Reserve Bank of India in its continued endeavour

to strengthen regulatory supervision on NBFCs,

introduced a host of scale based norms during

the year. We welcome these changes and our

businesses are receptive to the new requirements.

That said, the fiscal year 2022 turned out to

be an eventful year for our NBFC subsidiary,

Cholamandalam Investment and Finance

Company Limited (Chola). Chola delivered a

stellar performance during the year with highest

disbursements in its history clocked at `35,490

Crore, business assets under management was

`76,907 Crore and profits after tax grew by 42%

to `2,147 Crore. Among its business segments,

vehicle finance disbursements had a growth of

26%, loan against property business grew by

62% and home loans business marginally grew by

2%. On provisioning norms, the company took a

conservative stance and maintained an optimum

level of liquid assets to ensure a comfortable

ALM position. Chola acquired a new subsidiary,

Payswiff Technologies Private Limited at an

Managing Director and

Chief Executive Officer of SBI SG Global Securities Services Pvt. Ltd., a JV between

SBI and Societe Generale for over four years prior to retirement;

Dear Shareholders,

The Directors take pleasure in presenting the 73rd Annual Report together with the audited financial statements of the

Company for the financial year (‘FY’) ended March 31, 2022.

DIVIDEND

The Board of Directors have recommended a dividend at

the rate of 55% i.e., `0.55 per equity share of face value

of `1/- each for the year ended March 31, 2022.

APPROPRIATIONS

MACRO ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

The financial year 2022 began with the impact from the

COVID second wave creating havoc for India and the

world, ushering in newer challenges across sectors.

However, a rapid vaccination coverage, positive business

environment paired with government support provided a

strong momentum for a sustained economic recovery.

The onset of the third wave, which was seen in the latter

part of the year was quite brief and had a muted impact

on the economy than the earlier two waves. The second

half of the year gradually picked up with progress in

consumption, investment, capacity utilisation, among

others. Key macroeconomic parameters including GST

collections, digital transactions, FASTag revenues,

demand for electricity, metals and coal production

demonstrated a positive trajectory. The country continues

to remain one among the fastest growing economies with

its GDP expected to grow around 9.2% in FY 22.

Turning to the sectoral aspects, growth in agriculture

and allied activities is estimated at 3.3% backed by a

normal monsoon. After a contraction in the previous

fiscal year the manufacturing sector is expected to

expand by 12% while the services sector is projected to

grow by 8.2% in FY 22 following a decline of 8.4% last

year. Contact intensive segments such as trade, hotels,

transport and communication though yet to fully recover

is likely to expand 11.6% in FY 22. Private consumption

improved to recover significantly from the second half

of the year. The RBI’s Monetary Policy maintained an

accommodative stance and continues to support the

economy’s expansion.:

letter and spirit of

the law and its own demanding levels of business ethics.
