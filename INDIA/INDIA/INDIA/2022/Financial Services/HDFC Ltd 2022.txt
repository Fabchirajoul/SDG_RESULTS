Credit risk assessment methodology

Corporate portfolio

The Corporation has an established credit appraisal procedure which has been detailed in Corporate Loans

Policy and Developer Loans Policy respectively. The policies outline appraisal norms including assessment of

quantitative and qualitative parameters along with guidelines for various products. The policy also includes

process for approval of Loans which are subject to review and approval by Sanctioning Committees.

Corporation carries out a detailed analysis of funding requirements, including normal capital expenses, long-

term working capital requirements and temporary imbalances in liquidity. A significant portion of Corporate

Finance loans are secured by a lien over appropriate assets of the borrower.

Borrower risk is evaluated by considering:

•

the risks and prospects associated with the industry in which the borrower is operating (industry risk);

 the financial position of the borrower by analysing the quality of its financial statements, its past financial

performance, its financial flexibility in terms of ability to raise capital and its cash flow adequacy (financial

risk);

 the borrower’s relative market position and operating efficiency (business risk)

 the quality of management by analysing their track record, payment record and financial conservatism

(management risk); and

 the risks with respect to specific proMects, both pre-implementation, such as construction risk and funding

risk, as well as post-implementation risks such as industry, business, financial and management risks

related to the project (project risk).

Restructuring , ECLGS and Moratorium Guidelines issued by RBI are adopted for loans on a selective basis,

after assessing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their businesses.

Lease rental discounting

Loan is given against assured sum of rentals / receivables. The risk assessment procedure includes:

• carrying out a detailed evaluation of terms of Lease / Leave and License Agreements such as lease rental

receivables, term of the leases and periodicity of rentals.

• conducting due diligence on and appraisal of Borrowers / Lessors and Lessees including due diligence of

project/property. These Loans are secured by project property and serviced from rentals / receivables.

Construction Finance

The Corporation has a framework for the appraisal and execution of proMect finance transactions. The Corporation

believes that this framework creates optimal risk identification, allocation and mitigation and helps minimi]e

residual risk.

The proMect finance approval process begins with a detailed evaluation of technical, commercial, financial,

marketing and management factors and the sponsor’s financial strength and experience.

As part of the appraisal process, a risk matrix is generated, which identifies each of the proMect risks, mitigating

factors and residual risks associated with the project. After credit approval, a: letter of intent is issued to the

borrower, which outlines the principal financial terms of the proposed facility, sponsor obligations, conditions

precedent to disbursement, undertakings from and covenants on the borrower.
