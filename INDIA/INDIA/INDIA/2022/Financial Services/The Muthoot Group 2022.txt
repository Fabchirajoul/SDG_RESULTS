Dear Shareholders,

I hope that this finds you well and your

loved ones are safe and in good health.

I want to begin by extending my

heartfelt gratitude towards the

medical fraternity and governments

across nations for their contribution

and resilience during the Covid-19

pandemic. A multitude of initiatives

were undertaken by the governments

towards the disaster management and

addressing the economic disruptions.

The timely rollout of vaccinations,

stringent measures to curb the spread

of the virus and effective medical

recourses offered to patients have

helped the world in gradually coming

close to normalcy.

The last two years were probably the

most challenging in history as the

eruption of the pandemic brought about

a set of completely unprecedented

challenges. It is fair to say that none of

the economies across the globe were

immune to the disruptions it brought

forth, including India.

However, I am pleased to say that I am

extremely optimistic about the fact

that the worst is behind us now. India

demonstrated remarkable resilience,

validated by the fact that it grew by

8.9% during CY2021, the fastest among

major global economies. This was

only made possible due to the wide-

scale vaccination campaign across the

country, easing of Covid restrictions in

a phased manner, and proactive policy

response from the Government of

Indian and Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Our goal is to blur the line

between physical and digital

through the integration of

technology to ensure we are

able to create a contactless and

seamless ecosystem.
