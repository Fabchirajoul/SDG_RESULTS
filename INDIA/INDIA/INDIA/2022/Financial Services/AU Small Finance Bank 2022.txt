Dear Stakeholders,

It gives me immense pleasure and satisfaction to inform you

that we have closed FY 2021-22 on a splendid note and robust

numbers. We reaffirm and assure all our valued stakeholders

that we are fully committed towards serving your interests

and scaling up business through progressive growth on all

parameters. We reiterate with pride and humility that at

AU, we were able to deliver on all our stated commitments,

goals and objectives while progressing on our strategic focus

areas. We remain well capitalised, and are looking forward to

growing dynamically and strategically. The year also marked

the completion of the Bank’s five years of journey as a Small

Finance Bank, and I am proud to say that we have retained

our reigning title as the largest small finance bank in India

with our sound and dynamic policies, robust processes, risk

mitigation framework and strong governance architecture.

A dynamic macroeconomic

environment

Resilience and economic rebound defined FY 2021-22 for

India. While the initial two quarters were impacted by the

second wave of COVID-19, the rapid pace of vaccinations

and resumption of commercial activity shored up the

economy. The roll-out of infrastructure projects, together with

important and supportive fiscal measures and release of pent-

up demand aided the revival. At the end of the fiscal, India's

growth rate stood at 8.7%, downside risks notwithstanding.

India’s Gross Value Added increased by 8.1% and Gross Fixed

Capital Formation improved by 15.8%, a clear indicator of

rising investments in the country.

India continues to be a market where credit absorption

remains high, with significant headroom for growth. Across

industries, credit growth is on the rise, with further scope for

improvement. We, at AU Bank, recognise this as a significant

opportunity to capture and expand.

Inflation weighs on full recovery

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had maintained an

accommodative monetary policy stance for the most part of

the pandemic years. However, towards the end of FY 2021-22,

inflationary trends started to rise beyond the threshold, with

the Consumer Price Index touching an 8-year high and

Wholesale Price Index at a 30-year high of 15%, exacerbated

by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This has prompted the RBI to

respond with expected consecutive policy rate cuts, including

an off-cycle intervention. The policy repo rate now stands

at 4.90%, post a 90 bps hike in May and June 2022, but still

below the pre-pandemic position. Standing Deposit Facility

(SDF) and Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rates have also

been raised by 50 bps, and now stand at 4.65% and 5.15%,

respectively. Going forward, the RBI is expected to maintain

a conservative stance, with a few more rate hikes likely in the

immediate future, as inflation threatens to pull back economic

recovery by straining household budgets.

AU SMALL FINANCE BANK LIMITED:

Dear Stakeholders,

Namaskar!

I write to you with an overwhelming sense of

gratitude, respect, humility, pride, and wonder. It is

an amazing feeling to have completed five years

as a Bank. And for us, the story has just begun.

In March 2017, we had 301 touchpoints in 10 states,

which has grown to 919 touchpoints across 18 states

and 2 Union Territories in 2022. From lending to

5.6 lakh borrowers, we are now serving 27.5 lakh+

customers. From a family of 8,500 people, we have

grown into a winning team of 27,800+, and built

a sound liabilities franchise, garnering a deposit

base of 50,000+ crore. We have scaled our asset

book from ` 10,700 crore to ` 47,000+ crore while

remaining profitable throughout. At the same time,

we have built an industry-leading tech architecture

with a suite of digital products.

“On the other side of a storm is

the strength that comes from

having navigated through it.”

Gregory S. Williams

Dear Stakeholders,

Namaskar!

I write this message with immense pride, happiness and

positivity. As we complete five years of banking, we stand

strong in our resolve to continuously create value for

our customers and other stakeholders. With a digital first

approach and innovation at the core of our products and

services, we look forward to serving India with best-in-class

banking experience.

Change amid challenges

Since our foundational days in 1996, our aim was to

support small businesses in rural and semi-urban India

with much-needed funds using a ‘Robinhood model’ that

ploughed capital from HNIs. We continued to scale up our

reach and distribution of credit to needy individuals and

small businesses. However, we were always consistent in

our beliefs and values for providing security, building trust,

compliance-orientation and strong governance ecosystems.

So, when we received our licence to operate as an SFB from

the RBI, we were geared to establish not just another bank,

but an institution that would stand the test of time and create

a massive positive impact in the lives of all our stakeholders.

The banking licence enabled us to sense the real needs of

people and become custodians of their wealth and trust at

an even more extensive scale. Armed with our core values,

we were able to build a digitally enabled, retail-focused

bank that simplified banking for the common man while

delivering rewarding experiences. We built a strong,

empowered team and ensured that good governance was

a way of life. Importantly, we did all this profitably while we

built and expanded presence in underserved retail segments

with our secured offerings.

AU SMALL FINANCE BANK LIMITED:

Managing Director of

the Bank in the discharge of vigilance functions, broadly

divided into three parts – Preventive, Detective and

Punitive Vigilance.

Whistleblowing and Vigil mechanism

We have an efficient vigil mechanism to quickly spot any

aberration and deal with it at the earliest.

The Vigilance department reports to the Audit

Committee (Disciplinary committee) on whistle

blower and vigil mechanism in the Bank. It also looks

after the implementation of the Whistleblower policy,

communication and complaints received on the whistle

blower platform along with investigation reports with

staff action and process improvement, if any, with other

activities on a periodic basis.

Together with our Whistleblower policy, our vigilance

mechanism also ensures protection of our employees from

reprisals or victimisation for whistleblowing in good faith

as we follow a ‘No retaliation’ policy. The vigilance team

ensures integrity, transparency, and accountability in day-

to-day functioning of the Bank.

Critical units of the Bank are subjected to the Independent

Concurrent Audit process by reputed external audit firms.

The observations, along with the management responses,

are periodically reviewed by the Audit Committee and

Board and necessary corrective actions are undertaken.

We hold ISO/IEC 27001: 2013 certification, a testament to

best practices followed by us in managing information

security. We also hold the ISO 27001: international

standard certification, which describes the best-practice

specifications for an information security management

system (ISMS).

and spirit, adherence to ethical standards, distribution

sustainable development of all stakeholders.

Banking and financial institutions are the backbone of

any economy. The functioning of banking and financial

Institutions differs from that of other corporate entities in

many ways, which makes good Corporate Governance

of banks both critical and important. With the increasing

trust of the public in the banking system, banks have

been entrusted with a greater responsibility so that

long-term value for stakeholders, protects the interest of

depositors, strengthens accountability, credibility, trust,

transparency and integrity of the bank.

The Bank’s philosophy on Corporate Governance

second lines of defense, which provides independent

review and objective assurance on the quality and

effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control system.
