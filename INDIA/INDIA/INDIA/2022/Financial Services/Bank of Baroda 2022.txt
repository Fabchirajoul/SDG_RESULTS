Dear Stakeholders,

It gives me great pleasure to share with you the prog-

ress made by your Bank through this Annual Report

and the general operating environment during 2021-22

(FY 2022).

FY2021-22 started with the second wave of Covid-19

and the uncertainty on its spread posed high risks

across the globe. The faster spread of the mutated vi-

rus across the world and the unequal access to vaccine

for countries severely affected the overall global growth

prospects. However, the response of countries to the

situation in terms of ensuring access to the vaccines

and additional policy stimulus helped revive global

economic activity to a great extent, though in a phased

manner. India has done very well in this respect and

this is manifested in the GDP growth of 8.7% in FY 2022

with all sectors operating in a normal manner.

The credit for this high growth trajectory for the econo-

my may be attributed to the efforts of the Government

which provided an enabling environment by providing

incentives where required, like the PLI scheme while

also addressing the needs of the weaker sections and

yet maintaining the fiscal deficit at the targeted rate. At

the same time the capex provided the necessary push

for investment which had to pick up at the private sec-

tor end. We can be sanguine of this link being strength-

ened in FY23.

As far as the Indian Economy is concerned, the year

2021-22 witnessed overall revival across all major sec-

tors in the economy. The GDP of the country expand-

ed by 20.3% in Q1, 8.5% in Q2, 5.4% in Q3 and 4.1%

in Q4 of FY 2022. The GDP for the full year (FY 2022)

is marked at 8.7% as compared with a contraction of

(-)6.6% during FY 2021, as a result of overall revival in

the economic activity of the country. India’s GDP growth

at 8.7% for FY 2022 was in line with the estimates of

Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation

(MoSPI) at 8.9% and the IMF estimates at 8.2%. With

the proactive actions being taken by the government

and regulators, we do believe that India’s GDP rate will

continue to grow in FY 2023 as well and India will still

be one of the fastest growing economies in the world.

The RBI had maintained an accommodative monetary

policy with unchanged repo rate through the year as

the focus was on growth. The RBI has taken several

measures to tackle the situation that has arisen due

to the pandemic and due to the geopolitical problems

which has the potential of affecting the country’s finan-

cial sector. The Reserve Bank has given the highest pri-

ority to maintain financial stability by taking necessary

steps to ease liquidity constraints, restore market confi-

dence and prevent contagion to other segments of the

financial market. All this has ensured that the banking

system has become well capitalized with the quality of

assets improving substantially during the year.

Towards the end of FY 2022, the war in Ukraine has en-

hanced uncertainty and posed challenges. The Indian

government has reacted proactively to curb inflation as

well as reducing supply disruptions to ensure that the

equilibrium is maintained in the economy.

Currency markets have turned highly volatile in re-

sponse to a hawkish Fed and elevated Russia-Ukraine

tensions with the US dollar index reaching its highest

level since June 2020 due to a flight to safety syn-

drome. Here too prompt intervention and guidance

by the RBI has ensured that volatility has been curbed

without the rupee losing the competitive edge in the

exports market.

Going forward, elevated oil and commodity prices,

lingering war and sanctions, prolonged supply chain

disruptions, global financial market volatility emanating

from monetary policy shifts in major economies, and

renewed waves of COVID-19 across countries are fac-

tors that will drive market sentiments.

Dr. Hasmukh Adhia

Chairman:

Managing Director & CEO:

Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present before you the highlights of the

Bank’s performance during the financial year.

FY2022 has been a standout year for your Bank as the broad-

based economic recovery combined with the realisation of

post-merger synergies contributed to robust business growth

and record profits. There were many challenges, particularly

in the first quarter when the second wave of Covid took a

heavy toll on staff well being as well as business but exhibiting

tremendous resilience your Bank overcame these challenges

to end the year on a strong note. I remain indebted to our staff

members, our covid warriors, for their selfless and dedicated

services during this period. In the midst of these challenges,

your Bank also initiated a far-reaching transformation

agenda to prepare for new ways of working and customer

engagement in the post covid world.

Financial Performance

Prudent liability management

Conscious of the surplus liquidity in the system, your Bank

focused on improving the CASA franchise and the quality of

deposit franchise. Thus, while overall deposit growth at 8.2%

was closely aligned to advances growth to optimise margins,

the domestic CASA deposits grew significantly faster at

11.4%, pushing up the domestic CASA ratio by 137 bps to

44.24%, a record high and in line with the best in the industry.

Focused Advances growth

Similarly, advances growth was also focused on categories

that afforded the best balance between credit quality and

margins. While the loan book overall grew by 8.9% the

organic growth in the Retail portfolio, which has remained

resilient through credit cycles, was as high as 16.8%, well

above the industry growth rate. Within Retail, organically

the growth of Auto loans at 19.5%, Home loans at 11.3%

and Education loans at 16.7% have all been above industry.

The strides made by the Bank in the digital space, which I

shall dwell upon in detail subsequently, enabled your Bank

to target new business segments of which the personal loan

portfolio was the best example which grew 100% during the

year. Agriculture growth too was above industry at 10.3% of

which a substantial proportion came from loans secured by

gold. While the MSME segment was significantly impacted

by Covid related disruption, timely assistance through the

government supported Emergency Credit Guarantee Linked

Scheme helped mitigate the challenges. As the broader

economy has recovered, the organic MSME portfolio has

also grown strongly in the latter part of the year and this year

should see significantly faster growth as compared to the

5.4% YoY growth we have witnessed.

Growth in the corporate segment was impacted by multiple

factors, deleveraging, substitution of bank finance by bonds,

as well as surplus liquidity which pushed pricing for well rated

borrowers to levels where risk was getting mispriced. Your

Bank ensured that lending discipline was not compromised

and fully leveraged the unique flexibility afforded by our

international network. As a result, even though we limited

growth in the domestic corporate segment to 3.1% to protect

margins, the 21% growth in the international corporate loan

book, helped balance the twin imperatives of growth and

profitability.

Secular improvement in Asset Quality

That asset quality improved progressively despite vicissitudes

of Covid underlines the secular improvement in asset quality

that has been set in train. Gross NPAs declined 226 bps from

8.87% as of FY21 to 6.61% as of FY22. Net NPAs too declined

by 137 bps over the same period. The fresh accretion to NPAs

too was arrested and the slippage ratio declined from 2.71% in

FY21 to 1.61% for FY22. Collection efficiency received special

attention to ensure that the improvement was sustainable and

overdue loans were proactively managed. In consequence,

the percentage share of SMA1 and SMA2 in standard

advances, as reported in CRILC, declined from 3.23% as of

March 2021 to 0.44% as of March 2022. A proactive approach

to provisioning helped coverage to improve as to 88.71%

as against 81.80% in the previous year, indicating a strong

capacity to absorb any stress in future.

Strong Earnings

The disciplined and targeted asset and liability growth strategy

resulted in a sharp improvement in the earnings parameters

of the Bank. The net interest income grew by 13.2% driven

by sharp decline in interest expenses. While operating profit

grew by 5.6%, growth in profit after tax (PAT) was almost 9x

times at Rs 7272 crore due to a decline in overall provisions

in Public Sector Banks-Reporting obligations

for SCAs from 2019-20”, read with subsequent

RBI, we further report on the matters specified in

a)

In our opinion, the aforesaid Standalone Financial

Statements comply with the applicable accounting

with the accounting policies prescribed by RBI;

b)

There are no observations or comments on

financial transactions or matters which have any

adverse effect on the functioning of the bank.

c)

On the basis of the written representations received

Letter no.

DOS.ARG.No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March

17, 2020 (as amended) (the “RBI communication”)

We have audited the internal financial controls with

reference to Financial Statements of Bank of Baroda

(the “Bank”) as of March 31, 2022 in conjunction with

our audit of the standalone financial statements of the

Bank for the year ended on that date which includes

internal financial controls with reference to Financial

Statements of the Bank’s branches.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial

Controls

The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing

and maintaining internal financial controls based on

“the internal control over financial reporting criteria

established by the Bank considering the essential

components of internal control stated in the Guidance

Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered

Accountants of India”. These responsibilities include

the design, implementation and maintenance of

adequate internal financial controls that were operating

effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct

of its business, including adherence to the Bank’s

policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention

and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and

completeness of the accounting records, and the

timely preparation of reliable financial information, as

required under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and

the circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve

Bank of India.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the

Bank’s internal financial controls with reference

to Financial Statements based on our audit. We

conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance

Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by

the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the

“ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by

the ICAI, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal

financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance

Note require that we comply with ethical requirements

and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable

assurance about whether adequate internal financial

controls with reference to Financial Statements were

established and maintained and if such controls

operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain

audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal

financial controls with reference to Financial Statements

and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal

financial controls with reference to Financial Statements

included obtaining an understanding of internal

financial controls with reference to Financial Statements

, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,

and testing and evaluating the design and operating

effectiveness of internal financial controls based on

the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend

on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment

of the risks of material misstatement of the financial

statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained

and the audit evidence obtained by the branch

auditors, in terms of their reports referred to in the Other

Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate

to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Bank’s

internal financial controls with reference to Financial

Statements .

Meaning of Internal financial controls with reference

to Financial Statements

A Bank’s internal financial controls with reference

to Financial Statements is a process designed to

provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability

of financial reporting and the preparation of financial

statements for external purposes in accordance with

generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s

internal financial controls with reference to Financial

Statements includes those policies and procedures

that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,

in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the

transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank;

(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions

are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of

financial statements in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles, and that receipts

and expenditures of the Bank are being made only

in accordance with authorizations of management

and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable

assurance regarding prevention or timely detection

of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the

Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the

financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal financial controls:

No.

DOR.ACC.REC.

No.45/21.04.018/2021-22 dated August 30, 2021

additional provisioning for NPAs assessed by RBI

exceeds 10% of the reported profit before provisions

and contingencies and/or additional Gross NPAs

10655/21.04.048/2018-19 dated 21.06.2019 disclosure

with respect to accounts kept as standard due to the

Court order, three accounts are classified as Standard

by the Bank as per Court orders, with aggregate

outstanding of ₹ 282.29 Crores against which the Bank

is holding provision of ₹ 70.79 Crores as on March

31, 2022 as per IRACP norms, including provision for

unrealized interest.

Apart from above, the Bank is holding additional

provision of ₹ 598.88 Crores as of 31.03.2022 over and

above the IRACP norms in certain stressed standard

advances on prudent basis.

15.11 Bank has estimated the additional liability on account

of revision in family pension for employees as per IBA

Joint Note dated November 11, 2020, amounting to

₹ 1,454.41 Crores. However, RBI vide their Circular

RBI/2021-22/105 DOR.ACC.REC.57/21.04.018/2021-

22 dated 4th October 2021, has permitted Banks to

amortize the said additional liability over a period of

not exceeding 5 (five) years, beginning with financial

year 2021-22, subject to a minimum of 1/5th of the

total amount being expensed every year. Bank has

opted the said provision of RBI, charged an amount of

₹ 72.72 Crores & ₹ 290.88 Crores to the Profit & Loss

account for the quarter and FY ended 31st March 2022

respectively and the balance unamortized expense

of ₹1163.53 Crores has been carried forward. Had

the Bank charged the entire additional liability to the

Profit and Loss Account, the net profit (after tax) for

the quarter and FY ended March 31, 2022 would have

been lower by ₹ 870.67 Crores.

15.12 Payment to Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises under

the Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises Development

Act, 2006

There have been no reported cases of delayed payments

of the principal amount or interest due thereon to Micro,

Small & Medium Enterprises and hence disclosure for

payment of interest on delayed payments to MSME

is not applicable. The details regarding Micro, Small

and Medium Enterprises has been provided by the

Management and relied upon by us.
