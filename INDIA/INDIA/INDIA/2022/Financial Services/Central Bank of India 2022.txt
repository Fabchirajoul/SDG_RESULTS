Jeeef<e&keÀ efjheesì& / Annual Report 2021-22:

Dear Stakeholders,

We are pleased to announce that our Bank has made

tremendous progress in the last financial year, and

that we have made a difference. I am presenting

highlights of the performance of our Bank for

FY 2022 in the attached report.

Economic Outlook

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report

released in April 2022, projects the growth of the

global economy by 3.6% in 2022 from a growth of

6.1% in 2021 and further projects a growth of 3.6%

in 2023. However, the global growth is expected

to be slow in 2022 due to impact on economy due

to ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. The

April 2022 Report of the IMF estimates advanced

economies to grow by 3.3% in 2022 from a growth

of 5.2% in 2021. The economy of United States

has suffered with the problem of high inflation in the

FY22, for which they have started rate hikes to curb

the inflation problem. The emerging markets and

developing economies are projected to grow by 3.8%

in 2022 after a growth of 6.8% in 2021. In 2023, the

emerging markets and developing economies are

projected to grow by 4.4%.

On the domestic front, as per the provisional

figures, real GDP grew by 8.7% in 2021-22 with

a pickup in economic activity with the receding

impact of Covid-19 pandemic. Sectors like mining,

manufacturing, construction, and some other service

sectors have reported a double digit growth for two

Message from the desk of

the MD and CEO

reasons- low base of FY21 and economic activity

gaining momentum after Covid-19 impact faded. The

quarterly data shows that the domestic economy

slowly started to recover from the pandemic. The

Q4 2021-22 real GDP grew by (+) 4.1 per cent

vis-à-vis (+) 5.4 per cent in Q3 2021-22. However,

private final consumption expenditure as percentage

of real GDP softened to 55.5 per cent in Q4 2021-

22 as compared to 61 per cent in Q3 2021-22.

On the other hand, gross fixed capital formation as

percentage of real GDP inched up to 33.6 per cent in

Q4 2021-22 vis-à-vis 30.1 per cent in Q3 2021-22.

The ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia is not

over yet due to which we expect growth to remain

muted in 2022-23. Nonetheless, with the economic

activities gaining traction with government support

provided through fiscal expenditure will help demand

to achieve momentum.

This years’ Union Budget 2022-23 conveyed the

futuristic viewpoint of attaining macro-economic

level growth targets with a micro-economic level

all-inclusive welfare. It laid foundation & gave a

blueprint of the economy over ‘Amrit Kal’ of next 25

years – from India at 75 to India at 100. In these

25 years India aims to attain the vision-promoting

digital economy & fintech, technology enabled

development, energy transition, and climate action,

and relying on virtuous cycle starting from private

investment with public capital investment helping to

crowd-in private investment.

In light of our results for the last financial year, I

must express my joy for meeting shareholders’

expectations. We will continue to transform our

business and make it future-ready.

Letter DOS. ARG.

No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020

(as amended) (the “RBI communication”)

1. We have audited the internal financial controls over

financial reporting of Central Bank of India (“the Bank”)

as at March 31, 2022 in conjunction with our audit of the

standalone financial statements of the Bank for the year

ended on that date which includes internal financial controls

over financial reporting of the Bank’s branches.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal

Financial Controls

2. The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing

and maintaining internal financial controls based on the

internal control over financial reporting criteria established

by the Bank considering the essential components of

internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of

Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued

by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These

responsibilities include the design, implementation and

maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that

were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and

efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to

the Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the

prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy

and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely

preparation of reliable financial information, as required

under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the circulars

and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

Auditor’s Responsibility

3. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s

internal financial controls over financial reporting based on

our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the

Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the

Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and

the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by the ICAI, to the

extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls.

Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we

comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform

the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether

adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting

were established and maintained and if such controls

operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit

evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls

over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness.

Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting

included obtaining an understanding of internal financial

controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a

material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the

design and operating effectiveness of internal financial

controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures

selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the

assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the

financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and

the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors, in terms

of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph

below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our

audit opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls over

financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting

4. A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting

is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance

regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the

preparation of financial statements for external purposes in

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting

includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the

maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately

and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the

assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation

of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted

accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures

of the Bank are being made only in accordance with

authorisations of management and directors of the Bank;

and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention

or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or

disposition of the Bank’s assets that could have a material

effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial

Controls Over Financial Reporting

5. Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial

controls over financial reporting, including the possibility

of collusion or improper management override of controls,

material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and

not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the

internal financial controls over financial reporting to future

periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial

controls over financial reporting may become inadequate:
