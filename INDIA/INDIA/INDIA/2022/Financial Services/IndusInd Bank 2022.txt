Dear Shareholders,

At the outset, I hope you and your loved ones are doing well. The

past couple of years have been a period of extraordinary

circumstances wherein we have been combating recurring global

pandemic, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions that have

impacted individuals as well as the economy’s well-being. We have

nevertheless seen a semblance of stability returning in FY2021-22

amidst these turbulent times with daily activities returning to

normal. For India, the economic recovery continued to progress well

from the pandemic lows, supported by massive nationwide

vaccination drive and targeted support measures by the

government and regulators. While the pace of economic recovery

got impacted by the global geopolitical tensions and rising

commodity prices, India is well placed to deal with these challenges

on the back of robust macro-economic profle, strong external

bufers and healthy corporate and banking industries. India

continues to remain among the fastest growing major economies in

the world and I believe we are at the cusp of sustained growth and

opportunity for the country.

Coming to the Bank’s performance, we continued the execution on

the Planning Cycle 5 strategy of “Scale with Sustainability”. We

further strengthened our position across sustainability metrics,

while steadily pivoting towards growth.

• We persisted with our strong focus on deposit mobilisation with

15% y-o-y growth, achieved along with a reduction in cost of

deposit. The cost of deposit has now come down to the lowest

levels in the history of the Bank. The deposit growth was driven

by granular retail deposits and CASA, which grew faster than the

overall deposits.

• On the loan book side, we remained watchful of the evolving

operating environment. We slowed down loan disbursements

during COVID-2 wave in the early part of the year and resumed

loan growth cautiously once the pandemic concerns receded.

Our loan growth for the year picked up by 12% y-o-y compared to

3% y-o-y for the last year.

• The Bank has a unique customer franchise focused on “livelihood”

generating loans. These are also segments of domain expertise

such as vehicle fnance, microfnance and diamond manufacturer

fnancing. These segments continued to outperform the industry

in these uncertain times as well. We also saw them participating

in the economic recovery achieving one of the best quarterly

disbursements in March '22.

• We also progressed well on scaling up our new initiatives such as

afuent banking, NRI banking, tractor fnancing, small corporates

with less than ₹500 crores turnover, merchant acquiring,

afordable housing and Digital 2.0.

• We continued to invest in our physical and digital distribution

network. We added 250 branches during the year, increasing our

branch count to 2,265 compared to 2,015 last year. We now have

5,876 distribution points (including BFIL branches & vehicle

fnance outlets) covering ~1,32,000 villages across India. We also

made signifcant progress towards our Digital 2.0 journey with

multiple planned launches during the year. I will cover these

items in detail during the latter part of my message.

Policy for Selection and Appointment of Directors

The Board of Directors are at the helm of the Bank, and an enlightened Board creates a culture of leadership and provides a

long-term policy approach to enhance the quality of governance.

The Policy for Selection and Appointment of Directors (the Policy) shall act as a guideline for determining the qualifications,

positive attributes, independence of Directors, and matters relating to the appointment and removal of Directors.

The Policy has been formulated and adopted, in terms of the provisions of Section 178 of the Companies Act, 2013, the SEBI

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, Section 10A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the

Guidelines issued by the RBI, in this regard, from time to time.

The Policy sets out the guiding principles for identifying persons who are qualified to become Directors, to determine the

independence of Directors and the manner of selection and appointment/reappointment of Directors.

The Policy for Selection and Appointment of Directors has been hosted on the Bank’s website at:

Board Diversity Policy

The Bank has benefited from the guidance and strategic direction of eminent persons from diverse fields as Directors in its

Board.

The ‘Board Diversity Policy’ was formulated in 2015 to ensure diversity of experience, knowledge, perspective, background,

gender, age and culture. The primary objective of this Policy is to provide a framework for building a Board that would

contribute to the achievement of the Bank’s strategic and commercial objectives.

The Bank believes that a professional Board that possesses diverse skills, varied experience and expertise enhances the quality

and speed of decision-making processes, which benefits all stakeholders.

RBI have, vide their Circular dated November 24, 2016, advised banks to broaden the fields of specialization of persons who

could be considered for appointment as ‘Director’, viz., Information Technology, Payment & Settlement Systems, Human

Resources, Risk Management, and Business Development and Management.

•

The Internal Auditor of the Bank reports directly to the Audit Committee.

•

The Bank hosted its Quarterly / Annual Financial Results on its website (www.indusind.com) which is accessible to

the public at large. Besides this, the Financial Results are published in newspapers, apart from being reported on the

websites of the Stock Exchanges. Therefore, the Bank does not find it expedient to send individual communications to

the shareholders regarding significant events and financial performance every half-year.

•

Besides the above, e-mail messages and SMS messages were sent during the year to shareholders whose e-mail IDs

and cell phone numbers were available with the Bank, informing them about declaration of the Bank’s Quarterly and

Annual Financial Results. The Bank has continued the exercise of collecting the e-mail IDs of shareholders wherever not

available, so as to communicate more regularly with them via e-mail.

Prevention of Insider Trading

In compliance with the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015, the Bank had accordingly amended the

undermentioned Codes to align with the standards prescribed under the Regulations:

•

Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by Designated Persons in Securities of the Bank (‘the Insider

Trading Code’); and

•

Code of Practices and Procedures for Fair Disclosure of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (‘Fair Disclosure Code’).
