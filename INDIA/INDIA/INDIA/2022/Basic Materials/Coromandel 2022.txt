Chairman's message11

10 GRI 102-14: Dear Shareholders,

The past year 2021-22 was a period

of recovery and new uncertainties in

equal measure for both the Indian and

the global economies. The period saw

a broad-based uptick in investments

and demand revival followed by the

vagaries of a global commodity shock

due to war in Europe and supply chain

disruptions in China. These supply-

side

bottlenecks

and

a

stronger-

than-anticipated rebound of demand

have resulted in major commodities

experiencing a significant price surge

during the year. While the demand

revival was in part supported by strong

fiscal stimulus measures across the

world, it remains to be seen how the

governments respond to the resultant

increase

in

inflationary

pressures.

As we look forward, the monetary

tightening due to inflation pressures,

geopolitical uncertainty, covid-19 flare-

ups, and high commodity prices can

impact the speed of a global economic

recovery in the coming year, with the

World Bank forecasting the developing

economies to grow at a modest 2.9%

and India to grow at 7.5% in 2022.

A fourth consecutive year of normal

monsoon should hold Indian agri-

sector and Coromandel in good stead

The year 2021-22 witnessed normal

monsoons,

leading

to

increased

acreage under sowing for the period.

Despite the heatwave in central and

north Indian regions dampening the

harvest, food grain output was expected

to grow by 1% to 315 million tonnes

over the previous year. Forecasts of a

well-distributed and normal monsoon

for the upcoming Kharif season has

enabled the government of India to

set a new record target of 328 million

tonnes of food grain production for the

year 2022-23, a 4% increase over the

estimated output of 315 million tonnes

in 2021-22. Despite the fact that the

global geopolitical instability has put

pressure on the availability and price

of key raw materials catering to the

agri-inputs sector, the government has

assured of taking sufficient steps to

ensure availability of agri-inputs for the

upcoming season.

As far as the fertiliser industry was

concerned, 2021-22 was a challenging

year as a surge in raw material prices

and constrained supply chain impacted

fertiliser availability and led to a sharp

increase in prices of finished products.

As per IMF, the fertiliser price index rose

by 114% during the year. Many countries

increased their self-sufficiency efforts

in the second half of the year and placed

restrictions on trade of agricultural

inputs. In 2022-23, Fertiliser affordability

and availability, geo-political situation

and Government subsidy support are

likely to have significant influence

on the demand and supply dynamics

of fertilisers. However, higher agri

commodity prices, focused approach

from the government to increase farm

output and a normal monsoon coupled

with sufficient reservoir levels present

an year of positive outlook for Indian

agriculture.

Coromandel is poised to tap into the

emerging growth opportunities

Coromandel

recorded

strong

growth numbers despite the market

uncertainties. The Company registered

revenue of INR 19,111 Crores for the

year 2021-22, a significant growth

of 35% over the previous year. The

Company’s EBITDA was at 2,154 Crores,

a growth of 8% over the previous year.

On the strategic front, the fertiliser

business had successfully completed

a significant backward integration

deal recently in addition to ramping up

its manufacturing capacities through

sustained

de-bottlenecking

efforts.

The crop protection business has

significantly invested in revamping

its infrastructure and organisational

capabilities during the past year. This

shall reflect in the upcoming new

product launches and new geography

expansions

in

the

coming

years.

Despite the challenging environment

on the sourcing front, Coromandel’s

speciality nutrients and bio businesses

too have managed to grow during

the past year. With renewed growth

aspirations in place, we expect these

relatively smaller businesses to be the

face of Coromandel’s growth story over

the next few years. In addition to these

business specific growth prospects,

Coromandel is also looking forward

to unlocking its growth potential in

its adjacencies with a growth-focused

team to deliver on the emerging

opportunities.

Welcoming the new members to

Coromandel Board

I would like to welcome Mr. Sudarshan

Venu to the Board of Coromandel, he

joined us during the past year. With

his diversified expertise set including

manufacturing,

technology

and

financial services, Mr. Sudarshan would

be a great asset to the Coromandel

Board.

Thank you all...

I would like to thank the Members of the

Board for their continued support and

guidance throughout the year. On behalf

of the Board of Directors, I would like to

thank all our stakeholders, including

our customers, shareholders, banking

partners, channel partners, and the

government for supporting us in our

journey. I would like to wholeheartedly

thank my fellow colleagues at the

factories and offices of Coromandel for

ensuring yet another year of successful

business operations. With all your

continued support and the blessings of

the almighty, I eagerly look forward to

the upcoming year.

A. Vellayan

Managing Director’s message

How has been the Indian agriculture

sector and company’s performance in

FY2021-22?

The Indian Agriculture sector continued

to perform well with record food grain

and

horticulture

production.

Agri-

exports reached a record USD 50 billion,

a 20% increase over last year. This was

helped by a 3rd consecutive year of good

monsoons leading to high crop sowings

during the year. The Agricultural Gross

Value Added (GVA) is expected to grow

by 3.0% during the year.

Government continued with its support

of agricultural activities throughout the

year with Direct income transfers to the

farmers, record procurement under MSP

program, credit and other reforms. In

addition, timely nutrient-based subsidy

disbursements addressed the working

capital needs of the industry. The

Government with regular interaction

with the industry ensured that fertiliser

was made available to the farmers,

despite the international supply side

constraints.

Coromandel

registered

a

strong

performance in FY2021-22, with a top

line growth of 35% and PAT growth of 15%

at a consolidated level. This was despite

a challenging business environment

affected by record raw material price

surge,

Covid-19

uncertainties

and

logistics and supply chain disruptions.

The

all-round

performance

was

driven by improvements in sourcing,

manufacturing efficiency, consumer

connect, digital initiatives and product

development.

The Company ensured the timely

availability

of

critical

agri-inputs

including Fertilizer and Crop Protection

despite the tight raw material situation,

leveraging its long-term contracts with

the suppliers and through backward

integration. The Retail outlets continued

to service the farming community by

following strict Covid protocols.

The Company continued to strengthen

its consumer connect with the help

of its All-India dealer network, Nutri-

clinics and rural Retail centres, offering

diversified

portfolio

of

Phosphatic

Fertilizer, Single Super Phosphate, Crop

Protection, Bio Pesticide, Specialized

Nutrition including Organic fertiliser

to promote balanced nutrition and

integrated pest management.

Nine new products were introduced

during

the

year.

Research

&

Development team is working on a rich

product pipeline, and we will continue

to develop differentiated solutions for

the farming community.

As

its

response

to

Covid-19,

the

Company

prioritized

safety

of

its

employees and their families and

ensured a safe working environment.

We optimized production and ensured

distribution to meet the critical and

timely agri input requirements of

the

farming

community.

Several

measures including vaccination to

employees and their families, extended

insurance coverage, health helpline

support, medical care access, isolation

facilities and awareness sessions were

undertaken. Coromandel put up seven

oxygen generating units in Government

hospitals to augment and support

the health infrastructure and local

administration across states. Several

awareness campaigns were conducted

and Covid kits were distributed to

the communities around the Plants.

Awareness was created to the rural

communities using the Company’s vast

infrastructure.

I would like to thank our Employees who

have stayed strong and agile in a volatile

business environment and delivering a

record performance for the Company.

I thank our stakeholders including

Shareholders,

Customers,

Business

Partners for their contribution and

support. I would also like to compliment

the resilience and sacrifices of the

Indian farmers, who during this period

delivered record food grain output

contributing towards an ‘Atma Nirbhar’

Bharat and the global food security.

What are the key focus areas for the

Company, going forward?

Coromandel

is

focusing

on

the

key

strategic

levers

–

deepening

understanding of its consumer, building

power brands, investing in R&D and

data analytics, becoming a player

of scale, creating new markets and

strengthening its efficiency and quality

across the value chain.

Farmers

remain

centric

to

the

Company’s business approach and its

activities are guided by the intent of

improving the farmer’s welfare. The

Company is strengthening its farmer

engagement and advisory initiatives

through its Agronomists, Nutri clinics

and Retail centers. The Company is

introducing novel products and agri-

tech solutions to help improve farm

efficiency.

Coromandel has embarked upon a

Company-wide digital transformation

journey

which

will

overhaul

the

Company’s IT infrastructure and help

improve efficiency by real-time data

and analytics in decision making.

The Company continues to strengthen

its

Supply

Chain,

Manufacturing

excellence,

R&D,

New

product

development,

Digital

marketing

&

Branding capabilities. The Company

is investing in the backend supply

chain to ensure availability of critical

raw material to support its expansion

plans. It has initiated Sulphuric acid

brownfield

expansion

project

at

its Visakhapatnam plant, which is

expected to be completed in first half

of 2023. For the first time, the Company

has invested in rock phosphate mine

project in Senegal. It is entering into

long term contracts with diverse supply

sources to mitigate business risk and

ensure continuity.

The Company is also looking at various

growth opportunities in adjacent areas

that can complement the existing

businesses and create new prospects

for the organization. It has set up

a separate structure for looking at

investment in new start-ups and ag-

tech ventures.

We are investing in strong leadership

within the Coromandel ecosystem with

strong entrepreneurship and execution

capabilities.

With the growing consumer focus

towards

sustainability,

how

does

Coromandel view the Environment,

Social and Governance (ESG) aspects?

As

a

responsible

corporate,

ESG

forms the core of our overall business

philosophy and is closely integrated

with our operational strategy. The

agriculture sector is critical for feeding

a growing population, taking care of

its healthy dietary needs and is also

used as a source of green energy. At the

same time, given the limited natural

resources like land and water, it places

pressure on the planetary boundaries.

Coromandel

is

cognizant

of

the

opportunities, risks and environmental

related responsibilities and is working

towards developing solutions to enable

sustainable agriculture.

The Company promotes a balanced

nutrient

approach

customized

to

sustainable

farming

and

provides

solutions based on crop and soil needs

including usage of organic, primary,

secondary,

and

micro-nutrients.

Considering the resource constraints

of Indian farms, it is continuously

improving the use efficiency of nutrients

and water through technology and

research interventions. Coromandel is

amongst India’s largest water-soluble

fertiliser and organic fertiliser player. It

follows an integrated pest management

approach to improve crop yields with

the use of biological pesticides. The

Company is globally the largest neem

based biopesticide manufacturer and

is continuously upgrading its product

portfolio towards greener chemistries.

It is introducing superior delivery

mechanisms

to

improve

product

efficacy and application efficiency.

Coromandel conducts its operations

in an environmentally responsible

manner. ~44% of its Plant area is

covered under green belt. The Company

continues to upgrade its infrastructure

to reduce emissions and has installed

the

Online

Continuous

Emission

Monitoring System (OCEMS) to record

real time data across its major plants. It

has also obtained the unified registration

for plastic waste management from

CPCB. The Company has completed the

plantation of around 2,25,000 saplings

under the flagship program of the

Government of Andhra Pradesh known

as “Green Visakha”. The Company

has

adopted

TERI’s

Mycorrhiza

technology for land bioremediation

and is following “Miyawaki Plantation”

Methodology. During the year, the

International

Fertilizer

Association

awarded

us

Industry

Stewardship

Champion Gold Award. The initiative of

developing a Birds’ Paradise within the

Plant premises at Kakinada has been

recognized by global agencies like the

UNDP and Discovery.

The Company’s social commitments

span in the areas of education, health

and community development. During

FY21-22, it touched upon ~7.2 lakh

lives through its various initiatives,

positively impacting the UN Sustainable

Development Goals.

The Company’s Corporate Governance

practices are based on transparency

and accountability. Its commitment to

ethical and lawful conduct of business

is shared by all members across the

organization. The Company’s Board,

comprising more than 50% independent

members, drives highest standards

2. Significant Accounting Policies

2.1 Statement of compliance

The financial statements which comprise the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive

Income), the Statement of Cash Flows, and the Statement of Changes in Equity (“financial statements”) have been prepared

in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the

Act”), Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, along with relevant amendment rules issued thereafter and

other relevant provisions of the Act, as applicable. The Company has consistently applied accounting policies to all periods.

2.2 Basis of preparation and presentation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are

measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, and on accrual basis.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between

market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using

another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the

characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing

the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial

statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS

102, leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 116, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value

but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in Ind AS 2 or value in use in Ind AS 36.

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the

degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value

measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at

the measurement date;

• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either

directly or indirectly; and

• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
