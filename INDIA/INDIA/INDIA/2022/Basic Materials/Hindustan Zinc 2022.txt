Message from the Chairman: Dear Stakeholders,

At Hindustan Zinc, amidst heartening optimism, there is, a

strong sense of buoyancy that drives us towards new horizons

of greater growth and inclusive value creation. The journey

of the past one year, which saw us successfully negotiate a

multitude of challenges, has left us enthused about the future.

It has encouraged us to surge proactively ahead towards

realising our vision and delivering on our promises and goals.

In a tough macro environment,

FY 2021-22 proved to be an

exceptional year for Hindustan

Zinc. We set many new operational

benchmarks and notched up new

milestones. I am pleased to share

that we posted unprecedented

numbers across both operational

and financial metrics during the year,

touching historically high production

volumes, and record annual revenue,

EBIDTA and net profit.

This was no small feat and was made

possible by the dedication and hard

work of our people. I would like to

take a moment here to thank them all

for standing by us through the turmoil

of the times. I credit them for giving

us many reasons to celebrate and for

shaping Hindustan Zinc’s journey of

excellence. We continue to steer the

trajectory of our targeted initiatives to

nurture a culture of high performance

and inclusiveness in our workforce,

which finds endorsement in the

various awards and accolades we

receive year-on-year and validates

our people-centric policies

and programmes.

In FY 2021-22, too, we earned

several awards and recognitions

that underscored the quality and

strength of our pro-employee

initiatives. These included Hindustan

Zinc’s certification as ‘Great Place to

Work 2021’ for the 4th consecutive

year, ‘Company with Great Managers

2022’ by People Business for

the 2nd year in a row and ‘Prize

for Leadership in HR Excellence’

by CII National HR Excellence

Awards. Going forward, it shall be

our focussed endeavour to drive

even greater employee-centricity,

to generate more opportunities

for our people, across genders,

demographics, and communities, to

grow and progress.

We shall simultaneously continue to

work concertedly towards augmenting

the safety environment at our mines

and sites. Given the nature of our

operations, we are cognisant of

the inherent risk involved in our

business. It is with deep sorrow that

I must inform you that despite best

efforts to keep our people safe, three

unfortunate incidents at our sites

led to the tragic loss of four precious

lives during the year. We share the

grief of the bereaved families and will

continue to support them in every

possible way in these difficult times.

We have also launched thorough

investigations into all the incidents

and will take corrective actions after

a comprehensive root cause analysis.

Let me assure you that every single

life is dear to us, and we will not

compromise on the safety of our

people under any circumstances.

Our continual investments in

strengthening our safety framework

through digitalisation and automation

are aimed at propelling our Zero Injury

vision, and we will not rest till we have

achieved this goal.

We have made the 2025 Sustainability

Goals an intrinsic part of our strategic

approach and remain committed to

surging ahead aggressively towards

the realisation of these objectives.

The formation of our Board level

Sustainability and ESG Committee

during FY 2021-22 is aligned with

this commitment and facilitates our

efforts towards the accomplishment

of our 2025 goals and Environmental,

Social and Governance priorities. The

Sustainability and ESG Committee

will help accelerate our transition

towards 50% renewable energy in

our operations – a voyage on which

we have embarked as a responsible

corporate citizen striving to

decarbonise our mining operations.

From introduction of electric vehicles

in our mines to reporting based on

the Task Force on Climate-related

Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

framework, we have initiated a host

Dear Shareholders,

At Hindustan Zinc, our journey

towards sustainable outcomes is

marked by iconic milestones.

FY 2021-22 was a year of celebrating

many such landmark moments, each

of which inspired us to become even

more courageous in our approach.

Events encouraged us to become

more ambitious about our plans and

optimistic about our prospects. We

were motivated to embark on the next

phase of our journey to achieve every

big, hairy, audacious goal that we set

for ourselves to scale higher and more

sustainable growth, balanced with

greater value creation.

We drive ahead into FY 2022-23

with both pride and humility at the

enormous achievements we made

during the year, which have given us

the confidence to find more reasons

to celebrate our excellence-driven

voyage at Hindustan Zinc.

SCALING THE NEXT LEVEL

OF GROWTH

Notably, FY 2021-22 was the year

when we surpassed the one million

tonne production mark, to touch

a historic 1,017 kt in mined metal

production. We are also pleased

to report a record-breaking annual

refined metal production of 972

kt and the highest-ever mine

development of 107 kilometres. What

is remarkable is that we recorded

these feats while maintaining our

mine life at 25 years – a significant

achievement given the complex

backdrop in which we largely operate.

As you may be aware, when we

embarked on our production

expansion journey, we were looking

at renewed positivity in the external

environment. While we were hoping

that the worst of the pandemic was

behind us, the second and more

deadly Delta wave put roadblocks in

the way of realisation of our ambitions.

And yet, despite these challenges,

the sole bargaining agent at the apex

level with a clear-cut approach that –

‘If the company grows, our growth

ENVIRONMENT

Our organisation supports a

precautionary approach to

environmental issues. This includes

identification of any soil and

water contamination at any of

our sites, along with assessment

of the environmental impact and

remedies. We conduct systematic risk

assessments of materials used, as

well as the products and processes

deployed, to apply the precautionary

approach. We take measures to

prevent and reduce the production

of waste and ensure responsible

waste management.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

The Company takes a clear stand

against corruption. To train all our

workers and spread awareness on

this sensitive agenda is a key priority.

Every employee is mandated to

undergo the code of conduct training

at least once a year with focus on

ethical behaviour and conduct

along with our internal and external

stakeholders. To ensure that not a

single instance of unethical behaviour

goes unnoticed, we have formulated

the whistle blower policy to empower

workers to report any instance of

unethical behaviour or harassment

at the workplace. This policy

preserves anonymity and mentions

only the whistle blower contact

number for reporting instances of

unethical behaviour.
