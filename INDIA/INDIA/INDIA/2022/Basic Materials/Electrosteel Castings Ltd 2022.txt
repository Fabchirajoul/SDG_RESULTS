Joint: Managing

Letter of Intent granted by the State Government of

Jharkhand for execution of Mining Lease in this respect expired on 11 January, 2017. The Company had filed a Writ Petition

before the High Court of Jharkhand on 10 January, 2017 praying for exemption on the above Sunset Date and obtained

interim stay on 19 January, 2017. The above order has not been modified, vacated or altered till date.

The Forest Advisory Committee (FAC - an apex body of the Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)

in their meeting on 17 August, 2017 deferred their decision on Forest Clearance of Dirsumburu Mines of the Company till

outcome of Judgement from Ranchi High Court. FAC has not rejected the Company’s case on issue of validity period of: Letter of Intent (LOI) for Mining Lease.

In a similar case a major hurdle has been mitigated by Ministry of Mines – Government of India by accepting the judgment

of Delhi High Court in the case of Arcelor Mittal India Ltd (Arcelor Mittal). It was expected that the Ministry of Mines would

appeal against the High Court Order, but in fact gave a go ahead to MoEFCC to process the Forest Clearance proposal of

Arcelor Mittal. MoEFCC has given Forest Clearance to Arcelor Mittal on 4 October, 2021. However, the Courts will have to

restore the validity of LOI beyond 11 January, 2017 in all recommended cases of allocated Mines in Saranda of Jharkhand.

The Company is keeping a track of the decision of the Courts as and when it happens, in the case of Arcelor Mittal. This

action of the Ministry of Mines and revalidation by the courts will become a favourable precedence for us.

As required the Forest Department of the Government of Jharkhand is preparing a fresh report on Mining activities in

the Saranda Forest Division. It is expected that the Company’s Kodolibad Iron Mine Area will form a part of Mining Zone

as per this new Report. This however is a critical issue and dependent on State Government’s Report. Further this report

has to be accepted by the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) and subsequently by the committee

formed by MoEFCC.

Exports

In the FY 2021-22, the pandemic situation was still quite prevalent with some respite coming towards the end. However,

the Ukraine war has created another upheaval in international trade. Both these factors are still looming large with direct

effect on input cost, logistic cost, foreign exchange rates and disruptions as well as the economic impact in various

countries leading to the reduced order flow.

The Company has been working hard to find workarounds by diving deep into markets that are less affected and by

letter and in spirit,

the Company has adopted practices mandated by the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)

Regulations, 2015 (‘Listing Regulations’) and the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) and has established procedures and

of the accounts receivable and 10% of revenue as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.

due consideration of the customers credentials and financial capacity, trade practices and prevailing business and economic conditions.

across markets; consequently, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. All overdue customer balances are

evaluated taking into account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the customers etc. Company computes

credit loss allowance based on a matrix based historically observed default rates over the expected life of trade receivables and is adjusted

for forward-looking estimates.

Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired

between the Parent Company and its subsidiary “Srikalahasthi Pipes Limited” (SPL) whereby SPL has been merged with the parent company

w.e.f. October 01,2020 i.e. Appointed Date. Necessary filings with the Registrar of the Companies, Cuttack were made on December 31,

2021 and the scheme became effective from the appointed date. In view of the above, the corresponding previous year presented in these

consolidated financial statements have been restated to bring in line with the accounting prescribed as per the approved scheme. The impact

of such restatement on the group's results in the previous year ended 31st March 2021 is however not material.

SPL became the subsidiary of the Company w.e.f. September 18, 2020 and since then it has been consolidated in line with the guidelines

prescribed under Ind AS 110 “Consolidated Financial Statements”. In view of the above, the current year’s consolidated financial statements are

not strictly comparable with the comparative year results.

Further in view of the scheme, the holding company had issued 59 (fifty-nine) equity shares of Rs. 1 each fully paid up for every 10 (ten) equity

shares of Rs. 10 each held by the shareholders of SPL as on the record date.
