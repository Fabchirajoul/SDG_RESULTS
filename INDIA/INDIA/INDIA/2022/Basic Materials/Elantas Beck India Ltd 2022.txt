Sixty Seventh Annual Report | 2022:

Managing Director is involved in the day-to-day management of the Company, while the Non-

ExecuƟve Directors bring in the external perspecƟve and provide valuable guidance to the

management on various aspects of business, policy direcƟon, governance, compliance etc. and

independence in decision making.

As on the date of this report, all Directors of the Company meet the criteria of maximum number of

Directorship(s), CommiƩee Membership(s)/ Chairmanship(s) as laid down in the Act and LisƟng

RegulaƟons.

(a) ComposiƟon and funcƟoning:

The ComposiƟon of the Board of your Company is a fair mix of eminent ExecuƟve, Non-ExecuƟve,

and Independent Directors, which is appropriate for the size and operaƟons of your Company and

is compliant with the applicable rules and guidelines.

At ELANTAS Beck, the goal of Corporate Governance is to ensure fairness to every stakeholder.

Company believes that sound Corporate Governance is important in order to enhance

stakeholders’ trust. Company also believes that Ɵmely compliances with the requirements of the

applicable regulaƟons, including the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) and the SecuriƟes and

Exchange Board of India (LisƟng ObligaƟons and Disclosure Requirements) RegulaƟons, 2015

(LisƟng RegulaƟons) are ways and means for aƩaining this trust.

Company's governance framework is based on its eﬀecƟve independent Board, separaƟon of

Board's supervisory role from the execuƟve management team and consƟtuƟon of the
