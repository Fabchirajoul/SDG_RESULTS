Ordinary Resolution:

Dear Shareholders,

As I reflect on the year gone by, 2021 was

another difficult year when the second wave

of COVID-19 in India caused unprecedented

suffering that is hard to comprehend as it

devastated lives and livelihoods. As you

all know, the Government of India and the

State Governments, however, did respond

to the crisis in a very commendable manner

in various ways. All these measures and the

phased unlocking of the economy led to

a sharp recovery in the later part of 2021.

Fortunately, the 3rd wave of Covid-19 was

comparatively much milder than the earlier

variant and did not cause any notable

disruption.

In this backdrop, I am delighted to note

that your Company recorded a remarkable

performance in 2021 as it delivered total

revenues from operations of Rs. 21,120

million as compared to Rs. 14,711 million

in 2020. The Company’s revenues during

2021 have recorded a growth of 44% over

2020 despite the divestment of the South

Region Divestment Business. While the

Gases revenues grew by 38% from Rs.12,001

million to Rs.16,611 million, the revenues of

the Project Engineering Division recorded a

robust growth of about 66%, which rose from

Rs. 2,710 million during 2020 to Rs.4,509

million in the year 2021. This reflects a strong

REBOUND since the lows of 2020, during which

the Company demonstrated resilience of its

character.

The growth in the Gases revenues during the

year 2021 was mainly driven by liquid and

compressed medical oxygen during the 2nd

quarter led by significant surge in demand

during the 2nd wave of Covid-19. This demand

started to taper off during the subsequent

3rd and 4th quarters, which was replaced by

demand for industrial gases including higher

volumes of argon, helium and special gases.

On the other hand, the growth in the Project

Engineering business was driven by higher

revenues from steel and refinery sectors,

which was more conspicuous on account of

the lower base of the previous year. You will

recall that the prolonged nationwide lockdown

during the year 2020, had disrupted most

of the project sites resulting in deferment of

revenues.

During the year under review, your Company

achieved pre exceptional earnings before

interest, depreciation and amortisation

(EBITDA) of Rs. 6,013 million as compared to

Rs. 4,075 million during 2020. This increase

in the operating profit vis-a-vis 2020 was

mainly on account of higher volumes

and pricing impact across revenues from

onsite, healthcare, packaged and special

gases, productivity savings from plant load

optimization and operations as well as

efficiencies achieved in the distribution of

products. The PED business also contributed

to higher operating profits as a result of

significantly higher billings as compared to

2020. The operating profits were further

boosted by reduction of fixed costs, higher

dividend income from the Joint Venture and

interest income. Profit before tax (PBT) before

exceptional item amounted to

Rs. 4,168 million, which is significantly

higher as compared to Rs.2,252 million in the

previous year. Your Company’s profit after

tax for the year under review amounted to

Rs. 5,139 million, which includes exceptional

profit of Rs. 2,944 million from the sale of

closed factory land at Kolkata. The Directors

Report deals with the performance in more

detail.

Looking ahead, I must add that while the

subsequent potential waves of Covid continue

to pose some uncertainty, the ongoing conflict

between Russia and Ukraine that started in

February 2022 and other geo-political tensions

in some geographies continues to impact

economies across the globe. This conflict has

resulted in sharp increase in energy prices,

inflation and supply chain disruptions globally

and India is not an exception. The global

economies and the humanity are hopeful of an

early and peaceful resolution of this conflict as

it will ease the energy prices and supply chain

disruptions and usher peace.

Closer home, with an improvement in the

economic scenario in the last few quarters

in India, there has been an increase in

investments across various sectors of the

economy and new opportunities are emerging.

Both public and private capital investment in

core sectors are expected to drive consistent,

all-round economic growth, more particularly

improving capacity utilization and investments

in the manufacturing sector. Your Company

has been pursuing several opportunities for

profitable growth in the gases and the project

engineering businesses, many of which are

already in pipeline and covered in more

detail in this report. I am sure all these will

help Linde India to sustain and build on the

REBOUND in the year ahead.

With these thoughts, I wish you well and

thank you for reposing your confidence in

Linde India.

Warm regards,

R J Hughes

The Board of Directors has delegated the power of approving the

share transfers (as applicable), transmission, etc. to the Managing

Director and Company Secretary of the Company for expediting these

processes. During the year, the Committee of Delegates met at regular

intervals to dispose of all stipulated matters relating to share transfers,

transmission, issue of duplicate share certificates, etc. with a view to

meet the timeline for registering the transfer/transmission, etc. of

equity shares. SEBI had vide its press release no. 12/2019 dated

27 March 2019 mandated that with effect from 1 April 2019, requests

for effecting transfer of shares shall not be processed unless the

securities are held in dematerialized form with a depository, except in

case of transmission or transposition of securities.

Compliance Officer

Shareholders’ Complaints

During the year ended 31 December 2021, the Company received

10 complaints from the shareholders/investors. As on 31 December

2021, four shareholder/investor complaints were pending. It is the

endeavour of the Company to attend to all such complaints and

other correspondence within a period of 15 days, except in cases

constrained by disputes or legal impediments. During the year, the

average time for responding to shareholders queries/ complaints

was higher than internal standards set forth partly in view of the

challenging situation arising from most of the Company’s employees

working from home as per Company’s guidelines due to Covid-19

pandemic to prevent avoidable spread of the Covid-19 infections and

also due to unsatisfactory service levels of the erstwhile RTA to deal

with shareholder matters. During the year, the Board of Directors of

the Company had at its meeting held on 12 November 2021 appointed

KFin Technologies Pvt. Ltd. as its new Registrar and Share Transfer

Agent in place of Link Intime India Pvt. Ltd. to improve the overall

service levels to the shareholders. The Company hopes to improve the

investor services once the transition of the registry services is properly

completed to the new RTA.

Pending Share Transfers & Dematerialisation Requests

The Company’s shares are required to be compulsorily traded in

electronic form. In line with the press release no.12/2019 dated

27 March 2019 issued by SEBI, with effect from 1 April 2019, the

transfer of shares in physical form has been prohibited except in case

of transmission or transposition. During the year ended 31 December

2021, the Company did not process any shares for transfer in physical

form (re-lodgement cases). As on 31 December 2021, no request for

transfer and/or dematerialization of shares was pending.
