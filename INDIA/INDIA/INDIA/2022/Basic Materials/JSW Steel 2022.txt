certain minimum production quantities each year from commencement of mining lease. In the event the Company

is unable to fulfil the required minimum production quantities, it would be liable to pay penalty, as prescribed in

the MDPA, by appropriating the performance security given by the Company.

While determining the minimum production requirements of one of the mines for initial two years, Government

of Odisha has erroneously considered production quantities of erstwhile lessee including quantities of dump

rework, (which was not considered in the tender document of the said mine). Accordingly, the Company has

requested amendment/correction in the production quantities considered in the MDPA to re-determine the minimum

production required in the initial two years which is under consideration by the Government of Odisha.

Item No. 10:

Background, details and benefits of the transaction

Jindal Saw Limited (“JSL”) is a leading player in the manufacture of large diameter submerged arc welded pipes in India that is

primarily used for the transportation of oil, gas, slurry, water and in structural applications. JSL has eight pipe manufacturing

plants under operation, each equipped with requisite anti-corrosion coating facility. The combined capacity amounts to

approximately 2 million tonnes per annum (“MTPA”) for line pipes.

The Company undertakes the following major transactions with JSL:

•

Sale of hot rolled coils and other steel products, water and allied products;

•

Purchase of pipes and coke; and

•

Job work arrangement for conversion of coal into coke.

The Company supplies steel to many pipe producers. One of such pipe producers is JSL which is incidentally a related party.

Similarly, the Company also procures pipes for its various capex projects. The Company sells steel products such as Hot

Rolled Coils/ other steel products for further value addition in JSL’s manufacturing process of pipes and other products. These

transactions result in a ready market for sale of steel products of the Company. The Company would also benefit by way

of relatively higher net sales realisations as the freight cost of servicing JSL is low because of the close proximity of one of

JSL’s plants to the Company’s facility at Vijayanagar works.

The Company buys pipes from JSL for various ongoing capital expenditure projects. JSL has been supplying pipes consistently

as per the quality specifications of the Company and prices offered by JSL are competitive.

The Company also procures coke directly or through the conversion route from JSL to meet the shortfall in the requirement

of the coke pending commissioning of Company’s coke oven plants. JSL owns and operates a coke oven plant adjacent to

the steel plant of the Company at Vijayanagar. This arrangement ensures un-interrupted plant operations. The pricing of such

arrangements is also competitive relative to the terms offered by other third party suppliers/imports.

JSL is a listed entity and a related party of the Company. Mr. Prithviraj Jindal, brother of Mr. Sajjan Jindal (the Chairman and: Managing Director of the Company) is the

Managing Director of the Company is concerned or interested financially or otherwise in the resolution set out at Item

No. 10 of the Notice.

Your Directors recommend the resolution as at Item No.10 for your approval.

Item No. 11:

Background, details and benefits of the transaction

JSW Ispat Special Products Limited (“JISPL”), a joint venture of the Company, is a primary steel producer engaged in manufacture

of pellets, sponge iron, ferro alloys, slabs, billets and bars/rods. JISPL has an integrated steel plant at Raigarh in Chhattisgarh,

India with a capacity of 1.2 MTPA.

JISPL was acquired by the consortium of JSWSL and AION Investments Private II Limited ("AION") in August 2018. JISPL since

its acquisition, has taken the following steps to revive and turnaround its business operations:

•

Restarted the pellet plant, increased capacity to 2.2 MTPA and revamped it by installation of two filter presses, mixer

and evacuation system.

•

Increased the productivity in DRI plant by usage of own pellets and process improvement.

•

Refurbished the oxygen plant for consistent and reliable operations.

•

Blast Furnace was recommissioned, and process improvements were carried out to improve efficiency and to operate

at rated capacity.

•

Restarted the Steel Melt Shop and upgraded it to special steel production facility by modifying the caster with the

commissioning of vacuum de-gasifier

•

Commissioned slab caster and bloom caster to cater to the requirements of rail mills/bar/wire rod mills of the Company

located in Italy.

•

Modernised the rolling mill to produce special bar rods.

These initiatives led to turnaround of JISPL’s business operations and JISPL for the first time on an annual basis reported net

profit in FY 2021-22. JISPL has upgraded its production process from commodity steel to special steel products to meet the

needs of seamless pipe industries, automobile, ferro alloys and high-speed rails. It also developed the expertise to produce

special grade steel and high-grade blooms, the quality of which has been approved by railway authorities in Italy. JISPL has

been exporting to Italy.

The Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on May 27, 2022, considered and approved a Composite Scheme

of Amalgamation of JISPL and its parent Creixent Special Steels Limited ("CSSL") with the Company. The Scheme is subject to

regulatory and other approvals. Pending requisite approval for the Scheme of Amalgamation, the following material related

party transactions are required to be undertaken with JISPL :

441:

letter of comfort/ corporate guarantee to secure debt

financing for the project.

The Company has expanded its wire rod capacity at Vijayanagar from 0.6 MTPA to 1.8MTPA. It is proposed to sell wire rods to

NSPL for further value addition in NSPL’s manufacturing process of LRPC strands. This arrangement provides the Company with

an assured off take of wire rods by NSPL. These transactions result in a ready market for sale of the wire rods and enables

the Company to widen the basket of value-added products compared to direct sale of wire rods in open market. NSPL will

also get benefit of lower freight cost because of its proximity to Vijayanagar Works.

The Company has a wide customer base both in India and abroad. NSPL approached the Company to extend its marketing

services to sell LRPC products. Considering the wide marketing network of the Company, it is beneficial to use the network for

marketing of LRPC products of NSPL. The Company will charge NSPL a service charge of `2,000 per tonne for marketing services.

NSPL is also expanding its capacity to 1.44 LTPA in the next one year at a cost of `340 crores. While the debt of `220 crores

is being arranged, the equity of `120 crores is required to be brought in by partners. The proportionate equity to be brought

in by the company to finance this expansion project works out to `96 crores. The Company has agreed to invest `96 crores

by way of subscription to equity/compulsory convertible debentures (“CCDs”) in NSPL, out of which `83.32 crores has already

been invested as on 31 March, 2022 and the balance will be invested in one or more tranches during the project period by

way of equity/CCDs. The Company would also provide a: Letter of Comfort/Corporate Guarantee aggregating to `220 crores

to facilitate debt financing for the project.

NSPL also generates scrap during the LRPC manufacture process. Since NSPL is a value added facility and scrap generated

cannot be used directly, it is sold in the open market. The Company is having upstream facilities and scrap can be used as

raw material for steel making operations. Accordingly, JSWSL will procure scrap from NSPL on requirement basis to avoid

metallic losses.

committee of creditors. The Company had entered a subscription and Shareholders agreement with JSW Shipping & Logistics

Private Limited ("JSLPL") through which the Company and JSLPL held equity of Piombino Steel Limited ("PSL") in the ratio of

49% and 51% respectively. Further, the Company also held optionally fully convertible debentures (“OFCDs”) of PSL with a

right to convert them into equity. In accordance with the approved Resolution Plan, BPSL was acquired as wholly-owned

Item No. 17:

Background, details and benefits of the transaction

Bhushan Power & Steel Limited ("BPSL") is an unlisted subsidiary of the Company and manufactures flat and long steel products

in the state of Odisha. BPSL currently operates with an installed crude steel capacity of 2.75 MTPA. The steel manufacturing

facility comprises, inter alia, sinter plant, pellet plant, blast furnace, steel melting shop, oxygen plant, lime kiln plant, coke

MTPA to 5.0 MTPA in Phase-II with an additional investment of `2070 crores. These expansion projects will be commissioned

in phases in the current and the next financial year.

The Company currently holds an equity stake of 83.28% in BPSL. The acquisition is in the nature of strategic investment and

is expected to enhance the Company’s domestic presence, especially in the eastern region.

JSW Ispat Special Products Limited ("JISPL"), a joint venture of the Company, is a primary steel producer that manufactures and

sells sponge iron, steel, ferro alloys, along with slabs and pellets. JISPL has an integrated steel plant at Raigarh in Chhattisgarh,

India with a capacity of 1.2 MTPA.

JISPL was acquired by the consortium of JSWSL and AION in August 2018. Since then, JISPL has taken a number of initiatives

to revive and turn around JISPL operations. These initiatives led to turnaround of JISPL’s business operations and JISPL for the

first time on an annual basis reported net profit in FY 2021-22. JISPL has upgraded its production process from commodity

steel to special steel products to meet the needs of seamless pipe industries, automobile, ferro alloys and high-speed rails. It

also developed the expertise to produce special grade steel and high-grade blooms, the quality of which has been approved

by Italian railway authorities.

The Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on 27 May 2022 considered and approved a Composite Scheme

of Amalgamation of JISPL and its parent Creixent Special Steels Limited ("CSSL") with the Company. The Scheme is subject

to regulatory and other approvals. Pending requisite approval for the Scheme of Amalgamation, the following related party

transactions are required to be undertaken between BPSL and JISPL.

•

Job work for conversion of coal into coke;

•

Sale of coal and pellets; and

•

Procurement of pellets

JISPL, located in Chhattisgarh, is in the close vicinity of BPSL, which has its plant in the neighbouring state of Odisha, hence

logistics costs are comparatively lower compared to the other suppliers, and accordingly both BSPL and JISPL have logistics

cost advantages.

JISPL does not have a coke oven plant and requires coke for its steel making operations, which is supplied by BPSL on

conversion basis. This conversion arrangement enables optimum utilisation of coke oven plants and reduce the cost of

production of coke. Further, this arrangement provides BPSL with an assured offtake of surplus coke and generate additional

EBITDA. BPSL imports coal to the extent of coke conversion requirement for JISPL and sells coal to JISPL, which in turn provides

the same to BPSL for conversion of coal into coke.

Item No. 19:

Background, details and benefits of the transaction

JSW Steel Global Trade Pte. Limited (“JSW Global”) is a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of the Company engaged primarily in

trading and distribution of raw materials such as coal, fluxes, coke etc. Considering the huge requirement of imports of raw

materials and to bring in efficiency of time and costs, the Company has recently set up JSW Global for procurement of coal

and other raw materials for itself, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.

Bhushan Power & Steel Limited (“BPSL”) is an unlisted subsidiary of the Company and manufactures flat and long steel products

in the state of Odisha. BPSL currently operates with an installed crude steel capacity of 2.75 MTPA. The steel manufacturing

facility comprises, inter alia, sinter plant, pellet plant, blast furnace, steel melting shop, oxygen plant, lime kiln plant, coke

in phases in current and next financial year.

The acquisition is in the nature of strategic investment and is expected to enhance the Company’s domestic presence,

especially in the eastern region.

To bring greater efficiency, synergies of centralisation, cost reduction and simplification, BPSL enters into business

transactions with JSW Global. JSW Global procures and supplies required raw materials (coal, flux etc.) to BPSL to be used in

its manufacturing process. This arrangement enables BPSL to focus on the core business with procurement of raw materials

being handled on a consolidated basis for JSW Steel Group resulting in reduced overheads and discounts to index prices as

JSW Global is able to consolidate the requirements at a Group level and negotiate the prices effectively. Also, BPSL is able

to reduce its financing costs as freight financing (which is arranged by JSW Global) lowers interest cost compared to rupee

borrowing costs and helps manage cash flows.

As BPSL and JSW Global are part of the same JSW Steel Group, these transactions ensure seamless business operations for

both the companies, provide assured quality and quantity of goods for uninterrupted operations, and generate revenue for

both the companies and ensure achievement of group synergies.

The aggregate value of the proposed RPTs is estimated at USD 2,312 million (`17,571 crores, assuming `76/USD) in a financial

year which exceeds the materiality thresholds as per SEBI Listing Regulations. Accordingly, these RPTs between BPSL and

JSW Global require prior approval of Shareholders of the Company.
