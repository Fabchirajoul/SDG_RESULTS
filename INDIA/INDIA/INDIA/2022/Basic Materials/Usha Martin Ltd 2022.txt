Managing Director’s Desk

Building pathways to

sustainable growth: Dear shareholders,

We have had a pivotal year at Usha Martin, as we moved into a phase of growth

after significantly deleveraging our balance sheet over the past three years. We are

now poised for expansion – enhancing our product mix, focusing on building share in

international markets and investing in capacity increase.

The second and third waves of the pandemic during the year under review continued to

pose a serious challenge to our daily lives. As a responsible organization, Usha Martin

continued to prioritize the health and safety of its employees and their families, other

stakeholders and the community at large.

COVID-19 created significant supply

chain disruptions resulting in high

cost of logistics. Prices of many of our

key raw materials were also at record

highs. We, as an organisation, were

quick to anticipate these challenges and

undertook several mitigation measures

to ensure our businesses remained

resilient. We were successful in

maintaining our margins and profitability

by enriching our product mix to high-

value products, and also by increasing

our penetration in newer geographies

like Australia and South Africa.

Therefore, despite all the challenges,

on consolidated basis, our revenue

increased from Rs.2097.28 Crore to

Rs.2688.07 Crore, an increase of 28.17%

over the previous year. Our EBITDA

and PAT stood at Rs. 450.09 Crore and

Rs.291.43 Crore during the year under

review, compared to Rs.312.56 Crore and

Rs.151.50 Crore, respectively, for the

previous year. Our focus on increasing

exports by increasing market penetration

in newer geographies bore dividends,

as our revenue from exports on

consolidated basis grew from Rs.1034.26

Crore in the previous year, to Rs.1366.24

Crore during the year under review, an

increase of 32.10%.

Our strategic move of selling off our

steel business to Tata Steel had enabled

us to significantly deleverage our

Balance Sheet and focus on our core

competencies. This has already started

yielding results and has placed us in a

position of strength.

We are in the process of expanding our

capacities for rope production, focusing

on high-end ropes, specialised wires and

also LRPC. We have capital expenditure

planned to the tune of approximately

Rs.285 Crore and expect to complete

our expansion programme over the next

12-15 months.

More importantly, we will continue to

focus on our biggest asset: our people.

We will continue to recognise and groom

in-house talent and create a leadership

pool that would eventually benefit the

organisation in the long run. We will also

continue to focus in the areas of health

and sanitation, conservation of natural

resources, education and sustainable

livelihoods to ensure we are able to bring

about change for the society at large.

We believe that we are at an inflection

point. Having been able to stabilise our

business, we are truly on our way to

strengthen our operations and push

the boundaries. We would like to thank

every stakeholder associated with the

Company for their unwavering support.

We, as a company, are ready for this new

growth paradigm.

Warm Regards

Rajeev Jhawar

Outlook and Business

The next fiscal will continue to experience challenges in the

nature of slowdown of economic growth, slag in demand, high

input commodity prices, disruption in supply chain, increased

freight cost and escalation of Russia – Ukraine conflict. Amidst

all the uncertainties thrown up by the ongoing geographical

tensions, a few upsides could include an increase in activities in

oil & gas as well as energy segments, especially in non-affected

countries. The Company, post divestment of its Steel Business

Undertaking, has improved with renewed vigor with its focus on

capability building, debottlenecking of constraints and increase

in productivity of key products to remain agile and competitive.

In order to continue to be sustainable, resilient and future ready,

the Company is preparing for plans for augmenting capacity

and capability building. There is focused effort for planned

capability building by adding new machines for producing high

end ropes and value-added products. Further, the plans for

addition of capacity would focus mainly upon debottlenecking

constraint areas and increase productivity of key products. With

these plans in hand, the Company remains confident of making

deeper inroads into international markets with high contributory

products. It is also expected that with steady infrastructure

spending by the Indian government, specialty products used

in construction and infrastructural sector may become one of

the key growth drivers for the Company. The future outlook is:

Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer of the Company

have submitted the relevant certificate for the year ended 31st

third parties. Outstanding balances at the year-end are unsecured and settlement occurs through normal banking channels. For the

year ended 31st March, 2022 and 31st March, 2021, the Company has not recorded any impairment of receivables relating to amounts

1860 for allegedly trying to influence ongoing CBI investigation pertaining to the proceedings mentioned in 38(a) above.

The Company strongly refutes the aforesaid allegations made by the CBI. During the quarter ended September 2021, the

CBI had submitted necessary sanction with the designated CBI Court for cognizance of offence in terms of the interim

charge sheet. Such cognizance is yet to be taken and the matter is under investigation. The Company has been providing

information sought by the CBI in this regard and intends to take such legal measures as may be considered necessary

based on the outcome of the ongoing investigation. Supported by a legal opinion obtained, management believes that the

Company has a strong case in its favour on merit and law.

Company’s financial performance, the Company is engaged solely in the business of manufacture and sale of wire, wire ropes

and allied products. Accordingly, the Company has only one operating segment, i.e., “Wire & Wire Ropes”.
