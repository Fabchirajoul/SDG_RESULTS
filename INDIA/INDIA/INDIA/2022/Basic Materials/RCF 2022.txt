Joint Secretary, Dept. of Fertilizers,

New Delhi (upto 12.11.2022):

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to present the 44th Annual

Report on the performance of your Company for the year

2021-22. The past year 2021-22 was a period of recovery and

new uncertainties in equal measure for both the Indian and

the global economies. Indian agriculture sector has registered

positive growth in the past three consecutive years. The

performance of the agriculture and allied sectors has been

resilient in the face of impact of COVID 19 and its effects.

As we look forward, World’s geopolitical developments in

recent times has affected the supply chain which has also

pushed up the prices of all fertilizer related commodities.

Both government and industry have spared no efforts in

arranging supplies of fertilizers in every nook and corner of

the country. Government of India has also increased subsidy

on fertilizers so that farmers remain unaffected from the

skyrocketing prices of fertilizers.

It is expected that normal monsoon rain during the

remaining period of the ongoing kharif season will lead to

increase in sown area as well as positive growth in fertilizer

consumption. Arranging the increased demand of fertilizers

will remain a task both for industry and the government.

Industry is making all efforts to maximize production.

Government has made utmost efforts to facilitate import of

fertilizer raw materials and fertilizer products. This will help

to maximize domestic production and fill the gap between

demand and indigenous production

Overview of the Economy

The Indian economy grew 8.7% in 2021-22, with the gross

domestic product (GDP) expanding 4.1% in the March

quarter from a year ago. The GDP growth for 2021-22

takes the economy above its pre-pandemic level and is an

improvement after contracting 6.6 % in 2020-21. Incidentally,

the economic growth during the entire fiscal of 2021-22 has

gradually spiralled downwards with each quarter. In the

first quarter of 2021-22, the economic growth had been a

stupendous 20.1%, which however was mainly due to the low

base effect.

The fiscal year 2023 has begun on a sombre note, in the

backdrop of global challenges such as the Russia-Ukraine

conflict, the surge in crude oil and commodity prices and

renewed lockdowns in China. The estimate of real GDP

growth for financial year 2022-23 at 7.2% at the current

juncture, amidst expectations of slowing external demand, a

gradual increase in capacity utilisation levels through the year,

and a recovery in contact-intensive services. The rise in oil

and commodity prices have also heightened macro stability

risks for the Indian economy. We expect a deterioration in

the CAD and the CPI inflation and a mild overshooting in

the GoI’s fiscal deficit on account of a larger-than-budgeted

subsidy burden in financial year 2022-23. The recent excise

duty cut on fuels has mitigated some upside risks to the CPI

inflation projection and has distinctly lowered the probability

of highly front-loaded rate hikes. We foresee the MPC to

hike the repo rate by 35 bps each in the August 2022 and

September 2022 reviews, followed by a pause to assess the

robustness of growth.

The Budget 2022-23 has maintained continued and increased

focus on agriculture. The budget aims at boosting farmer’s

income and the viability of agriculture as a remunerative

economic activity. The Government is set to launch public

private partnership (PPP) model to incentivise agri-tech

players and other stakeholders in the agriculture value

chain. The objective is to deliver digital and hi-tech services

to farmers, which would enable them to cut costs, find new

markets and gain competitiveness in the global markets.

Overview of the Fertilizer Industry

Overall fertilizers production has increased by 0.79% during

financial year 2021-22 as against financial year 2020-21

due to increase in production of DAP & SSP. Imports have

the year net of current tax amounting to ` 3.09 crore (P.Y. ` 0.96 crore)

Nature and purpose of reserves

a. General Reserve: General reserve represents appropriation of profits. This represents a free reserve and is available for dividend distributions. As the general reserve

is created by a transfer from one component of equity to another and is not an item of other comprehensive income, items included in the general reserve will not be

reclassified subsequently to the statement of profit and loss.

b. Retained Earnings: Retained earnings are the profits that the Company has earned till date, less any transfers to general reserve, dividends or other distributions

paid to shareholders.

c. Equity Instruments through Other Comprehensive Income Reserve: This reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses arising on the revaluation of equity

and debt instruments on the balance sheet date measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The reserves accumulated will be reclassified to retained

earnings and profit and loss respectively, when such instruments are disposed.
