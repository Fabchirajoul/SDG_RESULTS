Di-Ammonium Phosphate (“DAP”) is a fertiliser imported by the Company for supply in its marketing territory. The prices of DAP

Dynamic sourcing strategy and review of demand and supply on regular basis;

Constant review of market conditions including costing of competitors.

The Company did not enter into any transactions to hedge the risk pertaining to fluctuation in prices of DAP.

Natural Gas is the major raw material for manufacture of Urea. The prices of natural gas are mostly linked to international

crude oil prices and vary with the fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, demand supply pattern, etc. The part of the natural gas

quantity required by the Company has also been purchased at fixed price. As per the guidelines for pooling of gas in fertilizer

(Urea) sector issued by the Government of India, the natural gas is available to the Urea manufacturers at uniform price. The

cost of natural gas is considered appropriately by the Government of India while determining subsidy on Urea payable to the

Company. The Company did not enter into any transaction for hedging the fluctuations in the prices of natural gas.:

Executive Summary of Impact Assessment Report

May 18, 2022

Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals Limited

Gadepan, District Kota

Rajasthan, PIN-325208

Dear Sir(s)

As per the provisions of the Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules, 2014 (“CSR Rules”), every company having average

Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) obligation of ten crore rupees or more in pursuance of sub-section (5) of section 135 of the Companies

Act, 2013, in the three immediately preceding financial years, shall undertake impact assessment, through an independent agency, of their CSR

projects having outlays of one crore rupees or more, and which have been completed not less than one year before undertaking the impact

study.

We have been engaged by M/s Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals Limited (“CFCL”) to carry out impact assessment of its CSR projects and

programmes in compliance of CSR Rules. Accordingly, we have carried out an Impact Assessment of CSR projects undertaken by Chambal

Fertilisers and Chemicals Limited.

The executive summary of our impact assessment findings is as under:

STUDY AREA

We have assessed impact of CSR projects and programmes amongst the stakeholders’ of CFCL in the core and peripheral areas of Kota, Baran and

Jhalawar districts in Rajasthan. 5 CSR projects of CFCL are eligible for conducting impact assessment study. These projects are Project Akshar

– Pre-primary and School Education, Project Saksham – Technical and Vocational Education, Project Arogya – Healthcare and Sanitation,

Project Saakar – Rural Development and Project Bhoomi – Environment Sustainability, Animal Welfare and Soil Health. Exploring the efficacy of

these projects has provided a coherent and clear image of the operational, processes and behavioral impact.

METHODOLOGY

The study adopted a descriptive research design and relied on both quantitative and qualitative data. It followed a four-step strategy, comprising

desk review and design of tools; field work; data entry; cleaning & analysis and report writing.

SAMPLE SELECTION

CFCL has undertaken various CSR projects and programmes mainly in Kota, Baran and Jhalawar districts and samples were selected for Impact

assessment study from these areas. The sampling was done under the COVID limitations in February - March 2022, which has thus hampered the

selection of the far-flung areas of the intervention and beneficiaries.

IMPACT OF PROJECT AKSHAR – PRE-PRIMARY AND SCHOOL EDUCATION

‘Project Akshar’ aims to strengthen the quality of education and upgrade infrastructures of Aanganwadi Centres and the Rural Government

Schools (Primary, Upper Primary, Secondary and Senior Secondary Schools) of Kota and Baran Districts of Rajasthan. The salient findings are as

under:

•

The project helped in augmenting Aanganwadi Centres and Government Schools’ infrastructures by renovating and constructing

classrooms, compound walls, building toilet blocks with water taps, drinking water stations with overhead water tanks, kitchens and

providing furniture.:

letter in an earlier year from

GAIL (India) Limited, informing about the possibility of levy of Central Sales Tax. The Company has been taking the

delivery of Gas in the State of Rajasthan and has been accordingly paying Rajasthan Sales Tax on the supply. Therefore,

the Company is of the view that no Central Sales Tax is payable by it. Further, the amount of such levy is not ascertainable.

However, in the event of its levy, it is reimbursable by FICC, Government of India under Subsidy Scheme.

(h)

Under the Jute Packaging Material (Compulsory use of Packing Commodities) Act, 1987, a specified percentage of

fertilisers dispatched were required to be supplied in Jute bags up to August 31, 2001. The provisions of the said Act

were challenged in the Supreme Court, which upheld the constitutional validity of this Act in its judgment in 1996. In

spite of making conscious efforts to step up use of jute packaging material, the Company had been unable to adhere to

the specified percentage, due to strong customer resistance to use of jute bags. The Company had received show cause

notice from the Office of the Jute Commissioner, Kolkata, for levying a penalty of Rs. 73.80 Crore (Previous Year: Rs. 73.80

Crore) for non compliance of the provisions of the said Act. The Company has obtained a stay order from Delhi High

Court against the above show cause notice and on the basis of the stay order the Company is of the view that the said

levy is not tenable in law and accordingly no provision has been considered.

Based on favorable decisions in similar cases, legal opinion taken by the Company, discussions with the solicitors, etc.,

the Company believes that there is fair chance of decisions in its favour in respect of all the items listed above and hence

no provision is considered necessary against the same.

In respect of above contingent liabilities, it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the timings of cash outflows,

if any, pending resolution of the respective proceedings.

letter in an earlier

year from GAIL (India) Limited, informing about the possibility of levy of Central Sales Tax. The Parent Company

has been taking the delivery of Gas in the State of Rajasthan and has been accordingly paying Rajasthan Sales Tax

on the supply. Therefore, the Parent Company is of the view that no Central Sales Tax is payable by it. Further, the

amount of such levy is not ascertainable. However, in the event of its levy, it is reimbursable by FICC, Government

of India under Subsidy Scheme.

(h)

Under the Jute Packaging Material (Compulsory use of Packing Commodities) Act, 1987, a specified percentage of

fertilisers dispatched were required to be supplied in Jute bags up to August 31, 2001. The provisions of the said

Act were challenged in the Supreme Court, which upheld the constitutional validity of this Act in its judgment

in 1996. In spite of making conscious efforts to step up use of jute packaging material, the Parent Company was

unable to adhere to the specified percentage, due to strong customer resistance to use of jute bags. The Parent

Company had received show cause notice from the Office of the Jute Commissioner, Kolkata, for levying a penalty

of Rs. 73.80 Crore (Previous Year: Rs. 73.80 Crore) for non compliance of the provisions of the said Act. The Parent

Company has obtained a stay order from Delhi High Court against the above show cause notice and on the basis

of the stay order the Parent Company is of the view that the said levy is not tenable in law and accordingly no

provision has been considered.

Based on favorable decisions in similar cases, legal opinion taken by the Parent Company, discussions with the

solicitors, etc., the Parent Company believes that there is fair chance of decisions in its favour in respect of all the

items listed above and hence no provision is considered necessary against the same.
