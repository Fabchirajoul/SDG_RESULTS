The Company’s capital management objectives are to ensure the long term sustenance of the Company as a going concern while maintaining healthy capital ratios,

strong external credit rating and to maximise the return for stakeholders.

The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions, to support the need of operations and to

mitigate the risks, if any. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may deploy cash accruals towards growth/ capital expansion, evaluate

new financing options including means of raising finance (bank loans, debt capital market), refinance existing loans, monetize assets, infuse capital (equity/

preference) through public offering/ private placement/ preferential allotment, adjust the amount of dividends, reduce equity capital etc. The Company also

judiciously manages its capital allocations towards different various purposes viz. sustenance, expansion, strategic acquisition/ initiatives and/ or to monetize

market opportunities.

The Company monitors its capital using gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total equity as given below:

The Code of Social Security, 2020 ("Code") relating to employee benefits during employment and post employment received Presidential assent in September

2020. Subsequently the Ministry of Labour and Employment had released the draft rules on the aforementioned code. However, the same is yet to be notified.

The Company will evaluate the impact and make necessary adjustments to the financial statements in the period when the code will come into effect.

Previous year’s figures have been regrouped/ reclassified wherever necessary, to conform to current period’s classification.
