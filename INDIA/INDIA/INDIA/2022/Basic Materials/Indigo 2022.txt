Impact of Covid - 19

Covid-19 continues to keep the world on alert, however countries all over the world and India have been continuously finding ways

to reduce the spread of the Covid-19, creating new processes to facilitate safety and security while ensuring business revival. Your

Company saw revival of business post the second wave, while managing with limited visibility of scheduled operations and change

in regulations month on month due to the dynamic spread of Covid-19 keeping operations fluid.

Employees: Your Company proactively communicated timely and accurate Covid-19 related messaging to its employees, providing the

workforce with up-to-date news and information to provide reassurance throughout the pandemic.

Operations: Your Company experienced a high demand for charters from UAE and managed the demand successfully, with strict travel

restriction, in terms of 03-point checks and reduced capacity.

Your Company, towards the end of 2021, saw excellent travel demand, however the sudden surge imposed a unique challenge of

managing manpower and available resources. Innovative planning and optimum utilisation of resources kept our operations tight and

turn arounds safe and quick.

Post the second wave, your Company continues to ensure that adequate crew/airport staff is available to ensure business continuity.

Additionally, new processes are continuously being implemented and reviewed in compliance with the Ministry of Civil Aviation

(“MOCA”) guidelines.

Measures taken to mitigate the impact: Being India’s largest carrier by market share and carrying the largest number of passengers

by air in India, we understood our responsibility to our customers, the industry, and the country.

Your Company continues disinfection and cleaning of all aircraft on arrival to help reduce the spread of the virus. Additionally, when

parked at night, all aircraft undergo deep cleaning with focus on all touch points such as tray tables, arm rests, seat belts, lavatory

doors and overhead nozzles. Every aircraft is fumigated once a week and all customer coaches are sanitized after each trip, to provide

a safe travel experience. Your Company, as prescribed by the DGCA, eased the requirement of wearing face shield, however continued

with wearing mask and maintenance of social distancing.

In FY 2022, your Company continued focus on contactless travel experience at the airports. Your Company created more awareness

among the passengers on how they can web check-in, fill the health declaration form online, pay for all ancillary products and add a

print baggage tags from home. These initiatives ensured that more than 83.1% check-ins were done online, and 37.80 million bag

tags had been printed by our passengers.

With the continuous changes in the state and international travel regulations, your Company created a centralised page on its

website which is updated regularly to help customers become aware of the latest travel guidelines. Additionally, relevant changes

in state and international travel regulations were communicated to the passengers through various digital channels such as social

media, emailers, SMS and WhatsApp. At the airports, we have introduced self-check-in and print baggage’s tags and also enabled UPI

payment option for a true contactless experience.

Your Company also enabled customers to self-board at the boarding gate, further reducing human contact. In these difficult times, your

Company announced a special offer – ‘Tough Cookie’ and offered a 25% discount on airfare for all doctors and nurses, as a gesture

to thank them for being at the forefront of the battle against the Covid-19 outbreak. These Covid Warriors were facilitated at various

touch points by the operations and the marketing teams.

Your Company has transported the highest number of Covid Vaccines in India since January 2021. With the end of FY 2022 and start

of summer schedule, your Company saw the opening of international markets and a steady revival of operations.

Your Company complied with the regulator regarding staggered meal service on board in order to restrict customers consuming meals

together. Discontinued food service on flights less than 02 hours as staggered service was not practical on these flights due to short:

letter of credits issued / deposits given to lessors.

The Group has recognised an expense of Rs. 3,116.84 (previous year Rs. 2,804.57) on account of short term leases which represents

leased aircraft and engines having a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as on transition date and other short term leases. The

portfolio of other short-term leases to which the Group is committed at the end of the reporting period is not materially different from the

portfolio of other short term leases for which expense has been recognised during the year.

The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The management has included termination options

in determination of lease term for contracts having such option. Extension options have not been included in determination of lease term

since the management is reasonably certain not to exercise these options. Potential cash flows in relation to such extension options

cannot be ascertained since the cash outflow for the extended period will depend on the negotiations with the lessors in the event of

exercising the extension options.

Under certain lease arrangements of aircraft and engines, the Group incurs variable payments towards maintenance of the aircraft which

are disclosed under "Supplementary rentals and aircraft repair and maintenance (net)".

The Group has entered into sale and leaseback arrangements, for certain aircraft and engines owned and controlled by the Group, to

increase its liquidity. The Group has recorded proceeds of Rs. 6,006.43 (previous year Rs. 18,833.68) (net) from the sale and leaseback

arrangements as disclosed in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. The profit (net of loss) on sale and leaseback arrangements is Rs.

750.96 (previous year Rs. 12.81) disclosed in Note 23.

Future cash outflows for leases not yet commenced amounts to Rs. 64,435.43 (previous year Rs. 62,343.06).

The maturity analysis of lease liabilities are disclosed in Note 29. Further, information about the Group's exposure to market risks is

disclosed in Note 29.

* Includes lease liabilities with related parties amounting to Rs. 5,093.61 (previous year Rs. 5,429.29). Refer to Note 35.:

(b) Availing of advisory services from Mr. Gregg Albert Saretsky, Non-Executive Director of the Company, in the capacity of Special

Advisor and payment of remuneration to him for the said services.

42. The managerial remuneration paid by the Company to its Whole Time Director and Chief Executive Officer in accordance with the limits

prescribed under Section 197 read with Schedule V to the Companies Act, 2013, was approved by the shareholders at the Annual

General Meeting held on 4 September 2020. Further, the revision in remuneration and minimum remuneration for the year ended 31

March 2021 on account of grant of the stock options in previous year, which amounted to a stock compensation charge of Rs. 19.22 in

previous year and Rs. 104.71 in current year, was approved by the shareholders through postal ballot on 10 April 2021. The approval

of shareholders covers the remuneration paid for the year ende 31 March 2022 as well.

43. The Group has established a comprehensive system of maintenance of information and documents that are required by the transfer

pricing legislation under section 92-92F of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Since the law requires existence of such information and

documentation to be contemporaneous in nature, the Group is in the process of updating the documentation for the international

transactions entered into with the associated enterprises during the financial year and expects such records to be in existence latest

by due date as required under the law. The management is of the opinion that its international transactions with the associated

enterprises are at arm’s length so that the aforesaid legislation will not have any impact on the financial statements, particularly on

the amount of tax expense and that of provision for taxation.

44. InterGlobe Enterprises Private Limited and Mr Rahul Bhatia (the “IGE Group”), as claimants, submitted a Request for Arbitration dated

1 October 2019 to London Court of International Arbitration under the Shareholders Agreement dated 23 April 2015 (as amended

on 17 September 2015) (the “Shareholders Agreement”) executed between inter alia the IGE Group, Mr Rakesh Gangwal, The

Chinkerpoo Family Trust, Ms Shobha Gangwal (together with Mr Gangwal and The Chinkerpoo Family Trust, the “RG Group”) and the

Company. The IGE Group and the RG Group are promoters of the Company. The Company was named as a respondent as it is a party

to the Shareholders Agreement. The Company was named as a proper party to the arbitration. However, no monetary claim, including

any compensation, was sought from the Company by the IGE Group or the RG Group. The arbitral award was issued in the Arbitration

proceedings on 23 September 2021 (the “Award”). As per the directions in the award the Company has received reimbursement of

costs, from the IGE Group in relation to the Arbitration.

45. During the current year the shareholders of the Company, at their extraordinary gen l meeting held on 30 December 2021, on the joint

requisition of the IGE Group and the RG Group, have approved the special resolution for amending the Articles of Association of the

Company by removing the Transfer Restriction Articles therefrom.

46. During the year ended 31 March 2022, the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic continued to adversely impact the Group’s operation and

the demand for air travel declined during the months of May-June 21 and in January 22, due to second and third wave of Covid 19.

While we did see some recovery of passenger traffic in the rest of the months, December 21 and the second half of the fourth quarter

witnessed strong recovery. The Group expects recovery of passenger traffic to continue.

We remain focused to keep improving on our cost leadership and strengthening our balance sheet. The Group continues to have sufficient

liquidity as of 31 March 2022, to meet our financial obligations. While preparing our financial statements we have assessed the recoverability

of the carrying value of the assets, by performing sensitivity analysis and we expect the carrying amount of these assets will be recovered. We

constantly monitor any material changes to the future economic conditions which potentially may impact our assessment and financial position.

47. No funds have been advanced or loaned or invested by the Group to or in any other person(s) or entity(ies), including foreign entities

(“Intermediaries”) with the understanding, that the Intermediary shall lend or invest in party identified by or on behalf of the Group

(Ultimate Beneficiaries). The Group has not received any fund from any party(ies) (Funding Party) with the understanding that the

Group shall whether, directly or indirectly lend or invest in other persons or entities identified by or on behalf of the Funding Party

(“Ultimate Beneficiaries”) or provide any guarantee, security or the like on behalf of the Ultimate Beneficiaries.:
