BOARD’S REPORT

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 Pandemic, International market

for iron ore Pellet was under severe pressure as manufacturing

and economic activities across the globe were affected. Further,

due to outbreak of 2nd and 3rd wave of COVID-19 pandemic in

India, movement of raw material was affected. KIOCL being

a shore-based pellet plant, could continue its sales activities

without much hindrance and service the contracts. Due

to outbreak of pandemic in India during the FY 2021-22,

lockdown was imposed across the countries and quarantine

measures were introduced for Indian Vessels in China. Further,

several international traders were not showing interest in

Indian Pellet cargoes due to quarantine restrictions. However,

your Company could overcome the challenges posed by

pandemic, by making specific agreements with its customers.

During the period, your Company faced two-fold responsibility

of uninterrupted operations of plant and protecting the

health and safety of its employees. The Company responded

with a mix of cautious engagement, social distancing, virtual

engagement and 100% vaccination of the employees including

contractual workers and their dependents.

While the country was on track to a healthy recovery from

the strict lockdown during 2020, India’s economy got another

shock from a more severe second wave in April-June 2021,

which caused output across all sectors to fall. However, the

economic impact of the third wave was much less severe

compared with the 1st and 2nd wave, due to more localized

lockdowns. Since July, a healthy recovery has resumed for all

sectors. As a result, India’s steel demand suffered only a minor

downward revision and showed a strong recovery in 2021.

(₹ in Lakhs):

letter No. H/C.474 Classification/11 dated 21st

October, 2011 raised an issue regarding the applicability of

distance-based charge (DBC) over and above normal freight on

Iron ore transported through railway network for manufacture

of pellets and their subsequent export. Both South Western

Railway (SWR) and East Coast Railway (ECR) have raised

demand of Rs.14,463.93 Lakhs and Rs. 10,361.38 Lakhs

respectively towards distance-based charge (DBC) over and

above normal freight on Iron ore transported.

As per the Company’s view, DBC should attract only for iron ore

fines and lumps which are directly exported and not on the Iron

Ore so moved and utilized in the steel plants for manufacture

of finished product and exported thereafter. The same is also

not applicable to Pig iron and Sponge Iron Industry.

Accordingly, against the demand of Rs 14,463.93 Lakhs of SWR,

KIOCL had filed writ petition before the Hon’ble High Court of

Karnataka. The writ petition was dismissed and KIOCL filed

writ appeal challenging the dismissal of the writ petition. The

Hon’ble High Court has granted interim order staying DBC,

subject to the condition that 50% of the demand excluding

penalty is to be deposited. Thus, Rs.8,325.16 Lakhs was paid

and for the balance amount of Rs.6,138.77 Lakhs provision has

been made in the books in the FY 2013-14.

Similarly, against the demand of Rs 10,361.38 Lakhs for DBC

and Rs 31,084.14 Lakhs towards penalty, of ECR which after

considering the freight already paid, DBC worked out to be Rs

6,740.94 Lakhs. KIOCL has filed WRIT petition before High Court

of Orissa and High Court granted stay subject to deposit of 50%

amount excluding the penalty. Against the worked-out liability,

the Company paid Rs.5,188.86 Lakhs and the balance amount

of Rs.1,552.08 Lakhs provision has been made in the books FY

2013-14. The balance demand toward DBC and penalty of Rs

34,704.58 Lakhs has been included in contingent liabilities.

Both the cases are not listed so far. Railway has filed transfer

petition before Supreme Court and both the cases are stayed

by Supreme Court.

28.3.2. During the FY 2008-09, the Company has claimed

refund of congestion surcharge amounting to Rs.6,877.86

Lakhs from South Western Railway (SWR) in respect of 573

rakes moved during 1st April, 2007 to 21st May, 2008 through

the Company’s private Railway Siding at Panambur, Mangalore

which was commissioned in January 2006. SWR refunded only

Rs.2,725.39 Lakhs till FY 2013-14 which includes Rs.206.70

Lakh adjusted by SWR towards DBC. During the FY 2014-15,

the Company had approached Railway Claims Tribunal (RCT),

Bangalore for refund of the balance amount of Rs.4,152.70

Lakhs with interest. The Tribunal allowed the claim by its order

dated 7th December, 2018 and directed SWR to compute and pay

the amount together with interest at 6% per annum and in case

SWR fails to comply with the order, interest at 9% per annum

is payable from 1st April, 2019. SWR has filed petition against

the order of Tribunal in Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka on 11th

April, 2019 vide case no MFA/3165/2019. The Company has

not recognized the above as income in line with the Company’s

significant accounting policy No.1.4, pending realization.

The Konkan Railway offered concessional freight to the

Company for movement of rakes through Konkan route

instead of shorter route i.e., Hassan-Mangaluru, which has

been accepted by the Company and 110 rakes were booked

for the Konkan route. Subsequently, Konkan Railway allowed

concessional freight for 92 rakes only and balance 18 rakes

were moved through shorter routes i.e., Hassan-Mangaluru.

Hence, during the FY 2008-09 the Company claimed refund

of Rs. 254.45 Lakhs from SWR towards differential freight.

However, SWR has not refunded the amount. Hence, during

the FY 2014-15 the Company approached RCT, Bengaluru

and has claimed Rs. 254.45 Lakhs with interest. The Tribunal

dismissed the claim and the Company filed appeal before:

letter no.

MS/CMG/Fe-38-52 dated 6th May, 2005. At the time of closure

of the mine, the Company filed a petition with prayers for

direction, inter-alia, to permit utilization of 54.01 hectares of

land required for the purpose of safety and slope stability of

the mine.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in its judgment (December 2006),

directed IIT Delhi to issue global tender for, inter-alia, re-

analyzing the stability of slopes, drawing up of mine closure

plan, implementation of the above plan and drawing up of

detailed terms for the work to be done, consistent with basic

paradigm of “no or minimal disturbance to un-broken area”.

The expenditure for this purpose was to be met out of Rs.1,900

Lakhs paid by the company before closure of mining i.e. 31st

December, 2005, which is presently lying with the adhoc

Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning

Authority (CAMPA).

The Hon’ble Supreme Court has also directed that if any

funds are required in excess of Rs.1,900 Lakhs, the agency or

the designated officer shall move to the Court for necessary

direction.

Ministry of Mines Government of India, vide: letter dated 7th

February, 2014, nominated the Regional Controller of Mines,

IBM Bangalore as the ‘Designated Officer’ to take possession

of Kudremukh Iron Ore Mines. Accordingly, the Company has

handed over the possession of the Kudremukh Iron Ore Mines

on 3rd April, 2014 to the Regional Controller of Mines, IBM

Bangalore.

Subsequently, officials of IBM Bangalore and IIT, Delhi inspected

the mine site on 20th May, 2014, in which IIT Delhi opined that,

keeping in view of the environment and safety concerns, the

residual task of mine closure is relatively minor as compared to

what was originally envisaged. Hence, the amount of Rs.1,900

Lakhs paid by the company to Central Empowered Committee

(CEC) already lying with the CAMPA would be utilized for

restoration of Kudremukh iron ore mine. In addition to above,

the Company has also made provision to the extent of Rs.600

Lakhs during the FY 2003-04 to 2005-06.

28.3.4. Total mining lease areas of 4,605.02 hectares of

land at Kudremukh include an extent of 1,220.03 hectares of

government revenue land, apart from forest land as well as the

Company’s free hold land. Regional Controller of Mines IBM, the

designated officer has taken over the entire mining lease area

on 3rd April, 2014 for carrying out the mine closure activities

in compliance with Hon’ble Supreme Court orders dated 15th

December, 2006. However, the infrastructure and buildings

located on Revenue land and other lands being the property

of the Company shall continue to remain in their physical

possession till the cessation of mine closure activities. Till the

year 2013-14, the land records of revenue land were in the

name of the Company. Meanwhile Government of Karnataka has

changed the revenue records removing the Company’s name.

Hence the Company was constrained to file a suit before Civil

Judge Court, Mudigere for an injunction against Government

and others, restraining them from dispossessing the Company

from the said revenue land. The court heard the arguments

and passed an interim order on 5th November, 2013 restraining

the defendants or anybody under them from dispossessing the

Company from the schedule property (i.e. Revenue land) in any

manner till the disposal of the suit or till the modalities have

been worked out and implemented as directed by the Hon’ble

Supreme court. The suit was dismissed on 20th November, 2017.

Taking into consideration of taking over the entire mining lease

area of 4,605.02 hectors comprising forest land, revenue land,

Company’s own land and other lands by the designated officer

IBM for carrying out the mine closure activities in the mine in

compliance with the Hon’ble Court’s direction, although their

physical possession held with the Company, the Company

depreciated all its township assets in full during the year 2014-

15 as a prudent measure.

28.3.5. Govt. of Karnataka vide its Gazette notification dated

23rd January, 2017 reserved an area of 470.40 ha in Devadari

Range in Bellary District for iron ore and manganese ore mining

lease in favour of KIOCL under the provisions of Section 17A (2)

of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.

The company is in the process of registration of Mining lease

deed in its favour. During the process, the company has to

obtain a prerequisite statutory clearance viz. Mining Plan,

Environment Clearance (EC) and Forest Clearance (FC).

Company has obtained Mining Plan approval from Regional

Controller of Mines, Indian Bureau of Mines, Bangalore and the

Environment Clearance from MoEF&CC, GoI. The Company has

also obtained in principle stage I forest clearance on 24.06.2021

from MOEF, Govt. of India with General and Specific Conditions

for compliance. As a compliance of one of the conditions, the

company paid Rs 17,414.22 Lakhs to Karnataka Campa fund

on 29.10.2021 towards NPV, Compensatory Afforestation

Charges and other forest dues. In addition to the above an

letter/ documents on 14th March,

2022 to Dy. Conservator of Forest, Bellary Dist for scrutiny and

forwarding the same to PCCF(HoFF), GoK. The Govt. of Karnataka

would recommend and forward the proposal to MoEF&CC, GoI

for grant of final Stage II FC.

28.3.6. Since the closure of mining activities, consequent upon

the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court w.e.f. 1st January, 2006,

Mangalore Pellet Plant and also Blast Furnace Unit continue to

draw the required water from Lakya Dam at Kudremukh. Hence,

dam maintenance activity from the safety point of view and

maintenance of water drawal system which include electrical

and pipeline maintenance are still continuing. Therefore,

Kudremukh installation is a working unit as on date as an

integral part of Mangalore unit.

28.3.7. In order to utilize the Blast Furnace Unit, the company has

made a project proposal for Backward and Forward Integration

of the Unit involving capital expenditure of Rs.836.90 Crore and

the same has been approved by the Board in its 255th meeting

held on 13th November 2018. The same has been approved by

Public Investment Bureau (PIB). Environment clearance has

been granted by MOEF&CC, GOI on 27th February, 2020. M/s

MECON has been appointed as EPCM contractor for the project.

The project consists of various packages like Site Levelling, Heat

recovery Coke Oven Plant, Co-Gen Power Plant, Ductile Iron Spun

Pipe, Upgradation of Blast furnace, Pulverized Coal Injection

system, Oxygen plant and Nitrogen plant. Site Levelling works

to the extent of 80% has been completed and balance works are

expected to be completed before the onset of monsoon. Work

order placed on M/s Tuaman Engineering Limited, Kolkata for

construction of heat recovery Coke Oven Plant on Lump sum

turnkey basis. The piling and civil works for foundations for

Coke oven plant are under progress at site. The tenders have

been floated for balance packages and are under process. The

tendering process is delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic and

subsequent travel restrictions imposed. As per the changes

in public procurement policy, the global tenders have been

cancelled and domestic tenders are floated.

During the year the Company has incurred Rs. 10.87 Lakhs

(Previous year Rs 16.06 Lakhs) towards Excavation and loading

of 1,215.96 MT (Previous year 3,131.28 MT) of auxiliary material

of Pig Iron at BFU. The said materials of 544.96 MT worth Rs.

114.60 Lakhs were sold during the year (Previous year 3,167.28

MT worth Rs. 355.35 Lakhs). As at the end of the year, Company

was holding a physical stock of 1355MT (Opening 684 MT

plus excavated 1,215.96 MT less 544.96 MT sold) of the same

(Previous year 684 MT). As the cost of production of the same

had been accounted for in earlier years, the same is valued at

nil cost as at the end of the year, although the market value of

the same is Rs. 284.94 Lakhs (Previous year Rs. 76.61 Lakhs) as

per last sale price of similar product. As a prudent accounting

measure, no value has been assigned to the stock in the Books

of Accounts.

28.3.8. (a) Expenses incurred towards generation of power

being a significant cost of production have been included under

the primary heads of account.

its obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The

Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that

it has sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without

incurring unacceptable losses. In doing this, management

considers both normal and stressed conditions. A material

and sustained shortfall in our cash flow could undermine the

company’s credit rating and impair investor confidence.:

Letter of Credit and/or Bank

Guarantee. Accordingly, based expected credit loss (ECL)

experience, the Company has grouped the trade receivable

into secured and unsecured.

The company has applied the simplified approach for calculating

ECL for both secured and unsecured trade receivables. During

the year ECL assessed for secured and unsecured trade

receivables are Nil and Rs 75 Lakhs respectively (Previous year

Nil and Nil) and provision made in the books and included in

Note no 9.1.

The carrying value of the financial assets represents the

maximum credit exposure. The Company’s maximum exposure

to credit risk is Rs 29,186.18 Lakhs and Rs 24,280.83 Lakhs as

at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 respectively.

IV. Foreign Currency Risk

The Company being an EOU, is exposed to foreign exchange

risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with

respect to the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Japanese Yen

(JPY). Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial

transactions and recognized assets and liabilities denominated

in a currency that is not the Company’s functional currency

(INR). The currency risk of the said underlying asset is

managed by entering into foreign currency forward contracts

(only on need basis).:
