Dear Shareholders,

The year 2021-22, marks the start of our transition towards

Integrated Reporting journey. It expresses our commitment to

both financial and non-financial indicators aligned to the IIRC

reporting guidelines. Our approach puts the value and impact

we create, as a company, in a broader perspective – beyond

reporting, beyond financials, beyond tomorrow.

2021-22 Performance

The reporting year continued to throw up challenges in

the form of successive waves of Covid-19 as well as cost

inflationary challenges. Despite the turbulent environment, we

achieved strong sales and improved profitability. We recorded

highest yoy revenue growth of 66%, while PAT and EBIDTA

witnessed 82% and 118% growth, respectively. We progressed

as per our strategic goals to make Fine Organics a stronger,

more agile, and higher value-creating organisation. We

continued to leverage our global presence by responding to

the ever-evolving customer demands and kept our capacities

engaged round the year. We are further intending to expand

our presence in Gujarat, also focusing on expansion of existing

facilities for new and present product lines with process

improvements and technology upgrades.

Growth & Sustainability

At Fine Organics, we have unlocked an exciting phase of

growth. The world over, companies are aiming to drive higher

levels of sustainability. Increasing consumer awareness for

environment and climate change, has led to an increasing

preference for ‘Green’ and ‘Sustainable’ products. As such,

the demand for oleochemicals-derived additives is increasing.

Our strong R&D and innovation capabilities has allowed us to

deliver FINE solutions to our customers. For instance, our FINE

green additives have been effectively replacing potentially

hazardous chemicals in wide range of industries such as

plastics, packaging, foods, cosmetics, rubbers and coatings

among others, without compromising on the performance.

Besides, our FINE additives are majorly bio-based, safe

to use and bio-degradable, offering the most effective

benefits through ‘Sustainability’ combined with excellence in

functionality and safety. Minimised waste generation, effluent

management through effective production process, usage of

natural gas and stringent compliance to regulations continues

to be our focus areas of sustainability.

Commitment to the People

The uncertainty and demanding conditions that came with the

pandemic throughout the year was enormous, but our team

was more experienced in dealing with it and could better read

into the situation. We are grateful to them for their commitment

to our Company and the extraordinary dedication they show

day-after-day. We consider our employees to be our most

valuable assets. Thus, we ensured their safety and a secure

business environment at workplace at all times, despite

challenges. Apart from fostering a confidence of job security,

we have also extended our assistance in providing health and

insurance benefits and several other facilities. We understand

our duty towards these key parameters, which encompasses

all the tenets of our business and makes us the employer they

can rely on.

Commitment Towards ESG

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices

are integrated into our value system and the way in which

we operate. The pandemic has highlighted the value of

companies integrating effective ESG practices into their

businesses to ensure longer-term sustainability and we

welcome the increasing use of ESG metrics by investors in

their Company analysis.

We believe in striking a balance between environmental

sustainability and socio-economic progress. As such, we

have established an ambitious sustainability strategy, with

targets and action plans to accelerate our sustainability

performance. Our CSR efforts strive to support communities by

enhancing their economic and social well-being. Besides, our

governance practices continue to be reviewed and enhanced

on a regular basis. We are convinced that our endeavours in

this areas will continue to create significant value for all our

stakeholders.

Forward Agenda

Moving forward, we are determined to continue achieving

new milestones by leveraging opportunities to further grow

and improve our business. Our strategic priority to build a

sustainable organisational eco-system continues to motivate

us to further enhance our capabilities, empower newer

growth avenues and focus on ensuring better service to our

customers.

Closing Note

I would like to congratulate our team who kept relentless

faith on us and have gone a long way in helping us create

a value-creating organisation. I am also grateful to all of our

stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, partners,

governments and regulators and community at large, who

have helped us grow and excel. We look into the future with

optimism and are well on our way to deliver strong free

cash-flow and returns for our shareholders.

Best wishes,
