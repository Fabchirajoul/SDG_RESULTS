Dear Shareholders,

The year 2021 has been challenging for each one of us.

The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant

impact on lives, livelihoods, and business. I would like to start

by expressing my deepest appreciation to all, particularly all

our front-line workers who have worked tirelessly to ensure

the safety of our people and communities.

Indian businesses are slowly gaining steady momentum with

increase in capital expenditure, capacity building, good real

estate demand, government push for infrastructure spending

and the recent launch of Gati Shakti scheme. Tier II and III

cities have become front runners in driving demand across

sectors. We are finally entering an era of inclusive,

bottom-up transformation.

OUR COMMITMENT TO

LANDMARK CLIMATE ACTION

Last year, we became the first company in the Indian

construction sector to sign the 'Business Ambition for 1.5°C'

commitment with 2030 intermediate targets approved by

the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). ACC partnered

with Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) India’s SBTi Incubator

Programme to develop its science-based targets. ACC’s SBTi

approved targets are aligned with the reductions required

to limit warming to well below 2°C. We have committed

to reduce Scope 1 GHG emissions by 21.3% per tonne of

cementitious material and Scope 2 GHG emissions by

48.4% per tonne of cementitious material by 2030, from a

2018 base year.

ACC has also taken several measures to reduce CO2 emissions,

such as reducing the clinker factor, improving Thermal

Substitution Rate (TSR), reducing Thermal and Electrical

Energy (TEE) intensity, implementing Waste Heat Recovery

System (WHRS) and increasing the rate of renewable energy

consumption by introducing new technologies.

We are committed to making a tangible difference in the

areas of carbon footprint reduction, circular economy,

protection of natural resources and welfare of our

communities in India. With a clear focus on becoming

the most sustainable company, ACC’s commitment to the

Net Zero road map is visible and on track.

STRONG COMMUNITY RELATIONS FOR

INCLUSIVE GROWTH

We continue to drive value creation with a focus on

sustainability, innovation, and inclusivity. ACC Trust - our

CSR arm continues to work in the areas of quality education,

health, sanitation, women empowerment and HIV/AIDS

that improve the quality of lives. This year, we have spent

`35.95 Crore on community development efforts, benefiting

more than 5 Lakh people, residing in more than 150 villages in

the vicinity of our plants.

OUR FOUNDATION FOR A BETTER TOMORROW

This year, as we marked our 85th Founder's Day, we

strengthened our commitment to build an even better

Company. ACC has maintained its reputation of being a

pioneering brand with a history of ‘category-first’ innovations

that have gone on to set new benchmarks. Optimised and

cleaner production methods, a vast range of innovative

products, more mainstream use of various circular methods

are all trends that will influence and steer our onward journey.

This year, we have recommended a dividend of `58 per share

for shareholders’ approval, with a dividend payout ratio of 60%.

We remain indebted to our large family of stakeholders

for their unstinting support during these troubled times.

As always, their faith makes us stronger and ambitious to

achieve more. We remain committed to make an even bigger

difference by reimagining and improving our work, investing

in our people and cementing a sustainable future.

Best regards,

Narotam Sekhsaria

ACC Limited Integrated Report 2021

Integrated Report Statutory Reports Financial Statements:

Dear Shareholders,

I hope you and your families are doing well. My heartfelt

gratitude to all our frontline teams who put aside their

individual priorities and worked selflessly to help others.

We also partnered with the government, medical care

facilities and our communities to mobilise all necessary

resources to save lives.

MACRO ECONOMY AND

HIGH GROWTH PROSPECTS

The cement sector has shown a healthy rebound in 2021.

We have witnessed a good demand in rural and semi-urban

affordable housing, supplemented by pent-up demand in

the urban housing and commercial segments. A prudent

budget with a focus on inclusive development, productivity

enhancement, energy transition and climate action will help

our country transition to the next phase of development.

Increased expenditure on infrastructure and capacity building

along with the launch of ‘Gati Shakti scheme’ will further

boost demand.

RECOVERY BACKED BY RESILIENCE

ACC’s robust performance and results have come with

improvements in EBITDA and free cash flows. Despite higher

fuel costs, our cost efficiency measures under ‘Project Parvat’

coupled with gains from numerous sustainability-led

initiatives, increased our bottom line growth. The demand

rebound in the sector is mirrored in our strong sales growth,

and a year of successful new product launches as well as

market acceptance of several of our value-added products.

Our Ready-Mix (RMX) concrete business is doing well and

we expect a strong demand with increase in commercial,

industrial and government spend. With healthy returns

on a debt-free balance sheet and clearly defined strategic

priorities, we continue to increase our outlays in sustainability,

growth and efficiency projects.

OUR RELENTLESS FOCUS ON ESG

The world now has a clear view of the social and

environmental challenges that we face. The need for action

has never been greater. We recognise this and are aware that

we, too, have an important role to play towards promoting

sustainable living.

SUSTAINABILITY AT THE HEART OF

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY

ACC has its 2030 carbon emission reduction targets endorsed

by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The Company

has signed the 'Business Ambition for 1.5°C' pledge and

to complete transparency and accountability to protect

stakeholder interests.

DIGITALISATION

Our sustained efforts initiatives around 'Plants of Tomorrow'

– application of automation technologies, robotics, artificial

intelligence, predictive analysis and maintenance continue

to get integrated across all our plants. With the Transport

Analytics Center, we have implemented a dashboard on

secondary lead analysis and direct dispatch. Our supply

chain automation and optimisation exercise built on the

Blue Yonder platform started delivering results this year.

This has led to better operational planning, leading to

increase in sales and profitability. These measures will also

reduce our carbon imprint and contribute towards our

sustainability targets.

OUR RAZOR SHARP FOCUS ON

HEALTH & SAFETY (H&S)

The ‘Boots on Ground’ initiative of the Company has

continued to be an integral part of the H&S governance and

assurance system. A health and safety scorecard system

was also implemented in 2021 to ensure standard operating

procedures were being followed. In 2021, we clocked

10,91,145 hours BOG hours compared to 7,87,233 hours

in 2020, boosting employee morale and increase in shop

floor engagement.

AIMING FOR A DIVERSE AND

INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE

We recognise the value of a diverse workforce.

We are committed to providing equal opportunities in

employment and creating an inclusive work culture in which

all employees are treated with respect, dignity and are able

reach their full potential.

ACC has taken steps and emerged stronger during the

crisis. As everyone is getting back to business, we are firmly

committed to also build a healthier world together. We hope

to receive the same level of support from our stakeholders

as we invest in growth, innovation and sustainability.

My deepest gratitude for all the support and confidence that

you have shown in ACC.

Here’s wishing every one of you a healthy, safe and fulfilling

year ahead.

Regards,

Sridhar Balakrishnan

POLICY FOR REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS, KMP AND MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Remuneration Philosophy

The collective responsibility of the Board of Directors is

the guiding principle in determining the compensation

for Non‑Executive Directors, whilst at the same time

recognising and adequately compensating the Chairman of

the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Audit Committee

and Members of the Audit Committee and Compliance

Committee for the additional responsibilities shouldered

by them. The Chairman of the Board is required to provide

leadership and balance conflicts of interest, if any, so that

decisions are taken in the best interests of the Company

and to ensure highest standards of governance. Likewise,

the Members of the Audit Committee and the Compliance

Committee have the onerous responsibility to respectively

ensure adequacy of internal controls, robustness of financial

policies and accounting/ principles and compliance with

applicable laws. The Members of the Audit Committee and

the Compliance Committee and particularly the Chairman of

the Audit Committee is required to spend considerable time

for providing guidance to the Management in dealing with

major issues.

Remuneration

The remuneration of the Non‑Executive Directors is

determined within the limits prescribed under Section 197

read with the rules framed thereunder and Schedule V to

the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter collectively referred

to as ‘the Act’) and SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure

‘SEBI Regulations’).

Meeting, payment of commission on an annual basis,

of such sum as may be approved by the Board on the

recommendation of the Nomination & Remuneration

Committee, subject to the ceiling prescribed under the

the Company;

iii.

the commission is generally paid on a uniform basis, to

reinforce the principles of collective responsibility of

the Board;

iv.

the Nomination & Remuneration Committee may

recommend a higher commission for the Chairman of

the Board of Directors, taking into consideration his

overall responsibility;

v.

in determining the quantum of commission payable

to the Directors, the Nomination & Remuneration

Committee shall make its recommendation after

taking into consideration the overall performance

of the Company and having regard to the onerous

responsibilities required to be shouldered by the

Director etc.;

vi.

the Nomination & Remuneration Committee may

recommend to the Board, for the payment of an

additional commission to those Directors who are

Members on the Audit Committee and the Compliance

Committee of the Board, subject to a ceiling on the total

commission payable as may be decided;

fees and pursuant thereto, no sitting fees are paid to

the Members of the CSR Committee for attending CSR

Committee Meetings.

Remuneration Policy for the Chief Executive Officer & Managing

Director (CEO & MD) and Executive Committee Members

The Company’s compensation philosophy for the CEO &

MD and the Executive Committee Members is broadly

guided by the fact that the Company gains a competitive

advantage in attracting, retaining and motivating talent.

This can be ensured by providing a remuneration structure

which when benchmarked with comparable companies

within the industry/ sector compares favourably so as to

attract talent. At the same time the reward proposition

is linked to the overall company’s performance, individual

performance, employee’s potential, criticality of the function

and its importance for achieving a competitive advantage

in business.

Remuneration Policy for the CEO & MD

i.

The CEO & MD shall be paid such remuneration as

may be mutually agreed between the Company (which

includes the Nomination & Remuneration Committee

and the Board of Directors) and the CEO & MD, within

the overall limits prescribed under the Act.

ii.

ACC Limited Integrated Report 2021

Integrated Report Statutory Reports Financial Statements

Independent Auditor's Report

To The Members of ACC Limited

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial

statements of ACC Limited ”the Parent” and its sub‑section,

(the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as

“the Group”) and includes the Group’s Share of Profit

in its associates and joint ventures, which comprise the

Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2021, and the

Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other

Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of Cash

Flow and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for

the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting

policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter

referred to as "the consolidated financial statements"), which

includes four joint operations of a subsidiary (consolidated on

a proportionate basis with the subsidiary).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and

according to the explanations given to us, and based on the

consideration of reports of the other auditors on separate

financial statements of the subsidiaries (which include four

joint operations), associates and joint venture referred to in

the Other Matters Section below, the aforesaid consolidated

financial statements give the information required by the

Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required

and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian

Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act

read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015, as amended (‘Ind AS’), and other accounting principles

generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs

of the Group as at December 31, 2021, and their consolidated

profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their

consolidated cash flows and their consolidated changes in

equity for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial

statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing

specified under Section 143 (10) of the Act (SAs). Our

responsibilities under those Standards are further described in

the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated

Financial Statements Section of our report. We are

independent of the Group, its associates and joint ventures

in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute

of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the

ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the

consolidated financial statements under the provisions of

the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled

our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these

requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that

the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence

obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports

referred to in the Other Matter Section below, is sufficient

and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the

consolidated financial statements.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to Notes 42(a) and 42(b) of the

consolidated financial statements, which describes the

following matters:

a)

In terms of order dated August 31, 2016, the

Competition Commission of India (CCI) had imposed

a penalty of `1147.59 Crore for alleged contravention

of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 (the

Competition Act) by the Company. On the Company’s

appeal, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal

(NCLAT), (which replaced the Competition Appellate

Tribunal (COMPAT) effective May 26, 2017), in its order

passed on July 25, 2018 had upheld the CCI’s Order. The

Company’s appeal against the said judgement of NCLAT

before the Hon’ble Supreme Court was admitted vide its

order dated October 05, 2018 with a direction that the

interim order passed by the Tribunal would continue.

b)

In a separate matter, pursuant to a reference filed by

the Government of Haryana, the CCI by its order dated

January 19, 2017, had imposed a penalty of `35.32

Crore on the Company for alleged contravention of the

provisions of the Competition Act. On Company's filing

an appeal together with application for interim stay

against payment of penalty, COMPAT had stayed the

penalty pending hearing of the application. This matter is

listed before the NCLAT for hearing.

Based on the Company’s assessment on the outcome of

these appeals supported by the advice of external legal

counsel, the Company is of the view that no provision is

necessary in respect of these matters in these consolidated

financial statements.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional

judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the

consolidated financial statements of the current period. These

matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the

consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming

our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion

on these matters. We have determined the matters described

below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in

our report.:
