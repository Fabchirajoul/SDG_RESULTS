(n) The company has made investments in four group companies amounting to ` 35,619 lakhs, one mutual fund scheme

amounting to ` 33,300 lakhs, granted unsecured loan to one subsidiary company amounting to ` 980 lakhs and 354

employees amounting to ` 507.31 lakhs, stood guarantee to a subsidiary company amounting to ` 73,845.82 lakhs and

provided security to one bank amounting to ` 25,000 lakhs.

(o) During the current year, the Company has granted additional loan aggregating to ` 980.00 lakhs to Jindal ITF Limited. This

additional loan amount has been repaid during year. The loan is covered under section 2(76) which is repayble on

demand.

61

The management has assessed the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the financial statements, business operations, liquidity

position, cash flow and has concluded that no material adjustments are required in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities

as at March 31, 2022. The impact of the pandemic may be different from that estimated as at the date of approval of these

financial statements and the Company will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.

62

Jindal ITF Limited one of the subsidiaries of the company had won an arbitral award allowing various claims to the tune of

` 1,891.08 crores plus interest and applicable taxes. During the financial year 2019-20, the subsidiary had filed enforcement

application under section 36 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, for the execution of arbitral award being pronounced in

favour of the subsidiary whereas the customer had preferred appeal under Section 34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,

challenging the said arbitral award. Both the aforesaid cases are presently sub-judice before Hon’ble High Court of Delhi. As per

interim relief granted by Hon’ble High Court, the subsidiary received ` 856.31 crores on submission of bank guarantees.

Based on the current status and the expert legal advice received, the company is expecting a favourable outcome which

would cover all the investments, loans and advances in Jindal ITF and consequently no adjustments have been made to the

carrying values of loans and investments in the books of the company.

63

The Board of Directors of the Company, Jindal Quality Tubular Limited (‘JQTL’), Jindal Fittings Limited (‘JFL’) and Jindal Tubular

India Limited (‘JTIL’) had approved the composite scheme of amalgamation of JQTL, JFL and JTIL into the Company at their

respective meetings held on March 16, 2022. The Board of Directors of JQTL and the Company had recommended exchange

ratio of 4,055 fully paid-up redeemable preference shares of ` 100 each of the Company for every 10,000 fully paid-up equity

shares of ` 10 each held in the JQTL and The Board of Directors of JFL and the Company had recommended exchange ratio of

1,018 fully paid-up redeemable preference shares of ` 100 each of the Company for every 10,000 fully paid-up equity shares of

` 10 each held in the JFL. The Company has submitted the aforementioned scheme of amalgamation to Stock Exchanges for

approval.

64

The Company had given an interest free loan of ` 1,500 lakhs (March 31, 2021 ` 1,500 lakhs) to Employee Welfare Trust during the

year ended March 31, 2022 for the purpose of employee benefits scheme. The trust had utilised ` 1,401.65 lakhs (March 31, 2021

` 1051.32 lakhs) for purchase of the Company’s own shares and ` 142.73 lakhs (March 31, 2021 ` 469.98 lakhs) lying in its bank

account. The company considers the Trust as an extension of the entity and hence has incorporated the assets and liabilities of

the Trust in the standalone financial statements of the company. The shares of the company held by the trust are shown under

'Treasury share' in 'Other equity'.

65

Exceptional item

Based on continued profits made in earlier years and an expectation of continued improvement in the business and sales of its

products, the Company has reversed the provision of ` 1,399.68 lakhs in relation to carrying value of investment in Jindal Fittings

Limited.

Further, owing to the decline in business of Jindal Tubular (India) Limited, the net worth has significiantly been eroded. The

Company has recognised the provision of ` 2,105.00 lakhs towards the carrying value of investment in the subsidiary.

66

These financial statements were approved and adopted by board of directors of the Company in their meeting dated May 30,

2022.

67

Events after the Balance Sheet Date

The Board of directors have recommended dividend for the financial year 2021-22, which is subject to the approval of the

shareholders in the ensuing annual general meeting. For details of dividend, refer Note 41.4.

assessed by the Group based on a legal opinion obtained by the management. Accordingly, the Group has arrived at the

conclusion that there is no significant impact of this matter and no provision has been made in the books of accounts.

It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigations with accuracy, the Group believes, based on legal

opinions received, that it has meritorious defences to the claims. The management believe the pending actions will not

require outflow of resources embodying economic benefits and will not have a material adverse effect upon the results

of the operations, cash flows or financial conditions of the Group.

v)

Reassessment proceedings have commenced in respect of certain earlier years based on notices received from Income

Tax Authorities consequent to which the Paprent Company has re-filed the returns in respect of assessment years 2015-16

to 2021-22 with no change to the originally returned income. Pending outcome of the proceedings by the Income Tax

Authorities, the Parent Company after considering all information available and legal opinions obtained, based on its
