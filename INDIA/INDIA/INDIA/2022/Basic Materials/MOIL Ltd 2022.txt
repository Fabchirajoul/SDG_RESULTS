letter no CS/NSE-BSE/2022-23/122 dated 30.08.2022 submitting the

Annual Report for the financial year 2021-22 and notice of 60th Annual General Meeting of the

Company.

While going through the Annual Report, we found some typographical errors mainly on non-statutory

page. Further, one of the pages is missing (i.e. page no. 145) which is additional information not forming

part of financial statements.

In view of above, we are submitting revised copy of Annual Report for the financial year 2021-22.

It is reiterated that corrections have no impact on the financial statements/performance which are

required to be reported statutorily.

We request you to kindly take the same on record of the Stock Exchange in place of earlier submitted

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,

For MOIL Limited,
