Managing Director’s perspective

Fast-tracking our progress

Evolving with a future-facing outlook: Dear Shareholders,

I am proud that our Company has navigated the

tough times with great resilience, ensuring the

health and safety of both our co-workers and

families. This determined effort from all has set us

on a journey towards achieving our future goals.

Dear Shareholders,

The resumption of economic activities across the

world, driven by favourable fiscal policies created an

enabling business environment at the beginning of

FY21-22. However, the onset of the second wave of

the pandemic, followed by a surge in energy prices

and supply chain constraints at the global level,

posed fresh challenges.

Our performance too has been

significant. Whereas volumes grew

by 17%, our revenues grew by 67%

reflecting a focus on value addition.

EBITDA @26% & PAT @37% also

represented healthy growth.

Exports continue to experience

a positive groundswell, with our

presence in European markets

going up. We launched our new

brand identity which is modern

and also reflects our organisation’s

future‑facing approach. The shift

is significant given that more than

35% of our portfolio today comprises

performance and specialty chemical

applications. Our new brand identity

and nomenclature is in alignment

with this business evolution.

To enable us to continue on this path,

our innovation centres in India and

Belgium, are unwaveringly working

towards new product development,

post‑treatment, fundamental

research and feedstock engineering

related initiatives in the specialty

chemicals space.

However, by leveraging our

learnings from FY20‑21, we

achieved two very significant

growth targets. A 17% acceleration

in volume translated into carbon

black revenues of `4,332 crores

during the year. Our continuous

focus on cost optimisation and

enhancing realisations led to a

26% improvement in EBITDA to

`660 crores in FY21‑22 – both our

highest‑ever!

The initiatives undertaken during

FY21‑22 were in alignment with

the new business themes of the

Company, which serve as a guiding

light in PCBL’s journey into the

future.

One of the key business themes

is digital transformation, where

multiple initiatives have been

executed across all functions. We

have invested in tools and software

modules that are supporting

us in better market prediction,

understanding customer behaviour,

ensuring a higher degree of

governance and protecting our

information systems from potential

cyber‑attacks. The objective is to

create an integrated business value

chain and inculcate a digital culture

in PCBL. Our upcoming Chennai

plant is being built with cutting‑

edge technology and is a smart

manufacturing unit. It leverages the

full potential of Industry 4.0, offering

lean and efficient operations.

As we advance towards achieving

our strategic priorities, we are

consistently focusing on mitigating

our carbon footprint and building

Environment, Social and Governance

(ESG) priorities are at the core of

our operations. We have published

our sustainability report to capture

the concrete steps we are taking

towards our commitment to our

wider universe of stakeholders. The

environment is a key focus area for

us, and we are unfailingly particular

about it, in addition to GHG, energy

and water conservation, and waste

management.

We are navigating through difficult

times. The pandemic may have

subsided, but a lurking threat

remains. In addition, the ongoing

conflict between Russia and Ukraine

is causing market disruptions,

especially as it relates to higher fuel

prices leading to inflation.

In India, our greenfield expansion in

Chennai is making steady progress,

which will add an additional

1,47,000 metric tonne to our overall

capacity. Despite the execution

challenges faced owing to external

factors, we expect to commission

the plant by Q3 FY22‑23.

a sustainable organisation. We are

the first carbon black company in

the world to receive carbon credits.

Further, we have set up green power

plants across our manufacturing

units to produce power from waste

heat. The Chennai plant being

set up will be a IGBC platinum‑

certified green unit with zero‑liquid

discharge, rainwater harvesting and

water conservation, reinforcing our

commitment towards lessening our

carbon footprint.

In addition, safety and well‑being

are of paramount importance to

us. We are constantly working

towards creating a safe and healthy

workplace for our employees. We

provided vaccination support and

stood by the families of colleagues

who were affected by the pandemic.

Investing in strengthening the

capabilities of our people and

aligning them with our business

themes have been our topmost

focus areas in the past year. Building

a robust leadership pipeline for

the future of PCBL has also been a

significant priority.

Our research and innovation centres

in India and Belgium have been

instrumental in enabling us to

expand our product portfolio, as well

as undertake process innovations

to cater to the evolving needs of our

customers in a competitive manner.

Our innovation activities comprise

fundamental research, feedstock

engineering, post treatment, and

development of new products. As

a result, we now have more than

20 products in the pipeline, set to

launch in the next three years, which

will help us in further strengthening

our position in the global market.

With all our partners in our supply

chain we hold constructive

dialogues across the spectrum

to improve decision making and

accountability of our partnerships.

A landmark initiative in FY21‑22

was the transformation in our name

to PCBL Limited and introduction

of our new brand identity. This will

enable us to establish ourselves

more firmly as a diversified producer

of quality products in the global

chemicals space.

We have embedded good

governance practices at the heart

of our sustainability journey, since

it is our responsibility to create

long‑term value for shareholders by

balancing the myriad interests of all

stakeholders whose lives we touch.

The pandemic has tested the

resilience of our business model,

but we were able to successfully

navigate these challenges, thanks to

our robust human capital, systems,

and processes.

We believe that the times ahead are

exciting and we are perfectly poised

to achieve our next phase of growth.

Warm regards,

Kaushik Roy

Managing Director

Additionally, we have also embarked

upon a brownfield expansion in

Mundra, Gujarat, with specific

focus on production of specialty

chemicals.

In a bid to reward our shareholders,

an interim dividend of `188.73 crores

(`10/‑ per Equity Share on the face

value of `2/‑ per share) was declared

on January 20, 2022, and paid

during the quarter ended

March 31, 2022.

I want to thank all PCBLites

and other stakeholders for their

continued support in achieving

our targets for the year gone by.

We believe we are at the cusp of an

exciting journey, which is expected

to create value for all of us.

MANUFACTURING

Carbon black production during FY22 was 4,56,484

MT as compared to 3,84,786 MT in FY21, which is

18.6% more on YOY basis.

As a manifestation of our commitment to

sustainability, we are continuously working towards

reduction in water and power consumption. We

are endlessly strategising towards conversion cost

reduction through inventory and spare management

as well as improving our reliability by strengthening

preventive measure compliances, condition-based

monitoring and periodic reviews of SOPs.

The greenfield project, spread over 60 acres of land in

Tamil Nadu, will have a carbon black manufacturing

capacity of 147 KTPA, along with a green power plant,

is in the process of being set-up and is expected to be

ready for production by the end of this current fiscal

year. Green power plant of 7.3 MW at Palej and 8 MW

in Mundra, respectively, got commissioned in FY22.

Subsequently, a 7 MW power plant at Kochi will be

commissioned within the first half of FY23.

on enhancing its ESG efforts by undertaking a

comprehensive and independent ESG strategy

and assessment exercise by adhering to certain

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) derived out of

energy and air quality management, management

of water use, solid waste management, health and

safety (across the value chain), product stewardship,

human rights and community development.

For the year 2021-22, the Company has conducted

a carbon footprint accounting process across all

manufacturing plants and offices. The GHG emissions

covered by the report includes both direct and

indirect emissions generated by the business. The

GHG intensity (tCO2 emission/MT production of

carbon black) was 1.76 in 2021-22.

The Company’s specific key risks and opportunities

relating to ESG material issues have been identified.

Action plans to mitigate these risks and exploring the

opportunities may have long lead times, but PCBL is

committed to this.

Your Company is now in the process of reviewing

its ESG strategy by balancing business needs with

sustainability needs and fine-tuning future KPIs.

To achieve the goals, the Company is identifying

remedial action plans for environmental, social and

governance specific issues.

CHANGE OF NAME OF THE COMPANY

The name of the Company has changed from ‘Phillips

Carbon Black Limited’ to ‘PCBL Limited’, pursuant

to the fresh Certificate of Incorporation dated 29th

December, 2021 issued by the Ministry of Corporate

Affairs, Office of the Registrar of Companies, Nizam

Palace, 2nd MSO Building 2nd Floor, Kolkata – 700020.

CHANGE OF LOGO OF THE COMPANY

During the year, Company has changed its logo i.e.

the brand identity. The elephant, which has been the

company’s icon since inception has been re-imagined

using lines and dots inspired from chemical bonds,

the domain in which PCBL operates and symbolise

the organisation’s digital approach. The stance

reflects dynamism, agility and moving forward with a

future-facing outlook. The raised trunk is symbolic of

PCBL’s respect towards customers and stakeholders

and echoes the philosophy of nurturing relationships.

The green hexagon, inspired from carbon’s molecular

structure, and the elephant reaching out for it,

embodies PCBL’s commitment towards sustainability.

The purple logo is arrived at by mixing the energy of

red and the stability of blue. It reflects the fine balance

of PCBL’s rich legacy and future-facing outlook. The

colour also takes inspiration from the palette of the

mother brand RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group.

The green is symbolic of sustainability and resonates

the company’s philosophy of pursuing growth in

harmony with the environment.

In accordance with SEBI Guidelines and Shareholders

Commodity price risk or foreign

exchange risk and hedging activities

1.

Risk Management Policy of the Company

with respect to the Commodities and Forex:

Commodities form a major part of the raw

materials required for the Company’s products

portfolio and hence commodity price risk is one

of the important market risks for the Company.

Commodity price risk results from changes in

market prices for raw materials, mainly carbon

black feedstock which forms the largest portion

of company’s cost of sales. The Company

endeavours to reduce such risks by maintaining

inventory at optimum level through a highly

probable sales forecast on quarterly basis and

also through worldwide purchasing activities.

Raw materials are purchased exclusively to

cover Company’s own requirements. Further,

a significant portion of Company’s volume is

sold based on formula driven price adjustment

mechanism which allows for recovery of the

changed raw material cost from customers. The

Company also endeavours to offset the effects

of increases in raw material costs through price

increases in its non – contract sales, productivity

improvement and other cost reduction efforts.

The Company has not entered into any derivative

contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in

commodity prices.

The Company operates in International markets

and therefore is exposed to foreign currency

risk arising from foreign currency transactions.

The exposure relates primarily to the Company’s

operating activities (when the revenue or expense

is denominated in foreign currency), borrowings

in foreign currencies and investment in overseas

subsidiaries. Over ninety percent of Company’s

foreign currency transactions are in USD while

the rest are in Euro, JPY and GBP. The risk is

measured through forecast of highly probable

foreign currency cash flows. The Company’s risk

management policy is hedging of net foreign

currency exposure at all points in time through

foreign exchange forward contracts, vanilla

option contract and cross currency interest

rate swaps. The objective of the hedging is to

eliminate the currency risk due to volatility in

exchange rates. The details of foreign exchange

exposures as on 31st March, 2022 are disclosed

in Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements.

2.

Exposure of the Listed Entity to commodity

and commodity risks faced by the entity

throughout the year:

The Company has not entered into any derivative

contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in

commodity prices.

Consolidated Basis

(Annexure ‘F’ to the Board’s Report):

Dear Stakeholders,

PCBL is pleased to present to you its first Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, FY’22 which supersedes BRR

developed previously. We are thankful to all our stakeholders for investing their trust & belief in us that has helped us to

grow exponentially over the past years.

Our approach to sustainability is not based on merely meeting compliances but goes a step beyond towards

institutionalization of sustainability practices. At its core, lies the robust governance systems and risk management

process including effective policies and processes, some of which even cascade down to our value chain partners. We

ensure all our business activities are conducted in accordance with ethical principles, internal policies, procedures, and

relevant laws and regulations. Hence prevention of corruption and promotion of fair competition is another important

dimension of the compliance efforts at PCBL. Sustainability lies at the heart of all our business processes. To ensure that

we conduct our operations in a responsible manner, we implemented Sustainability Policy in 2018, approved by the

Board of Directors.

We strongly believe that success and sustainable growth of any organisation depends on creating long-lasting

relationship with its stakeholders. We have created communication channels for all our stakeholders to ensure that they

are granted their very own right “to be heard”. Going beyond, we have also established the mechanism to receive their

concerns and grievances, if any. We also ensure that their concerns/grievances are resolved in the minimum possible

time to remain committed to our promise to provide them the very best.

On environment front, while we work rigorously on various aspects like resource management, energy management,

emission reduction, water and waste management to imbibe best practices, we specifically work towards integrating

ethical, environmental & social practices in our supply chain. We ensure adherence to all environmental and other

applicable compliances. Backed by our R&D expertise, we are constantly exploring sustainable and environment-friendly

products that can offer maximum value with minimum impact on the environment. Further, we focus on process and

manufacturing technology to produce superior quality products and minimise waste generation.

Employees constitute one of the most important elements of PCBL and their safety is always a top priority. Safety audits

are regularly carried out and systems are strengthened based on gaps identified. All possible learning & development

opportunities are extended to ensure their holistic development. Respect for human rights is at the foundation of

our business and ingrained in our culture, guiding our interactions with employees, suppliers, customers, and the

communities we serve. We make sure that all our employees and value chain partners have safe, supportive and

respectful workplaces where the dignity of every associate is recognized. While we can see significant changes in the

lives of people we work with, our efforts to enable the economic empowerment of our communities, and to making a

positive difference, will continue.

While we do all this, we believe that we are able to deliver value and contribute our bit in furthering the sustainable

development agenda. However, the aspirations are ever evolving and we look up to continue to keep ourselves committed

to the growth of our nation and our people at all times.
