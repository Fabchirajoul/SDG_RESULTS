Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of Solar Industries India Limited, I extend my warmest greetings

to you. I hope you and your family are safe and in good health. It gives me

great pleasure to present the Company’s 27th Annual Report for FY 2021-22.

The Indian economy is projected

to grow by 8.9% in FY 2021-22,

at the backdrop of favourable

reforms and increased domestic

consumption. The country’s strong

economic fundamental will help

withstand short-term pressures

of inflations and remain a fast

growing economy in the world.

The Union Budget of FY 2022-23

has focused on overall economic

growth, there has been an

increase of 35.4% in Capital

Expenditure as compared to

FY 2021-22 which is bound to

boost the economy. The budget

has laid a notable emphasis

on infrastructure as well as

increasing support for small and

medium businesses.

Additionally, the government has

bolstered the Indian defence

sector by allocating 25% of the

defence R&D budget to the private

sector, which will go a long way

towards breaking the public

sector’s monopoly on creating

cutting-edge military equipment.

In keeping with the government’s

Aatmanirbhar Bharat goal, 68% of

capex is designated for domestic

procurement, which is up by 10%

over the previous budget and will

reduce India’s dependency on

defence imports. The government

also catered to the long-standing

demand of the defence industry by

introducing a nodal umbrella body

for testing and certification.

Additionally, the

government has

bolstered the Indian

defence sector by

allocating 25% of the

defence R&D budget

to the private sector,

which will go a long

way towards breaking

the public sector’s

monopoly on creating

cutting-edge military

equipment.

Over the past two years, our resilience was put

to test and we emerged stronger by leveraging

our core capabilities and an ardent zeal to

by 57%. We are projecting a growth of 30% in

economic revival. The Company

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because

of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other

price risk, such as equity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings,

deposits, FVTPL investments and derivative financial instruments.

Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments. The finance department undertakes

management of cash resources, hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing mechanism and

ensuring compliance with market risk limits.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because

of changes in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates

primarily to the Company’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.

The Company manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and

borrowings. The Company borrows funds from domestic and international markets to meet its long-term and

short-term funding requirements. It is subject to risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates. To manage this,

the Company enters into interest rate swaps, in which it agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference

between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal

amount.

0.5% changes in LIBOR will increase/ decrease the borrowing cost by H Nil.

The Company has investment in Bank Deposits and hence is exposed to interest rate sensitivity. 0.5% changes in interest rate will increase/

decrease interest income by H 0.01

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because

of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates

relates primarily to the Company’s operating activities and the Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
