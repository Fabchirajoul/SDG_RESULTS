Dear Shareholders,

I hope this: letter finds you safe

and healthy. Over the past few

years, lives, livelihoods and

businesses have been severely

impacted by multiple waves of the

Covid-19 pandemic. It has been a

difficult period for everyone, from

individuals, businesses, and frontline

warriors to the economy and

country. I want to extend my heartfelt

gratitude to everyone, especially

our frontline personnel, who have

diligently fought to protect the safety

of our people and communities.

Their undying commitment and faith

have enabled us to see a time that

we call the ‘new normal’.

With this, I take great pleasure in

presenting Star Cement Limited’s

Annual Report for FY 21-22 to you.

The Macroeconomic

Landscape

After a period of challenges

and negligible to slow industry

growth, this year turned out to

be good one. It helped bring out

a relatively better side as the

economy gradually advanced

following an extraordinarily

difficult macroeconomic backdrop

and subsequent waves of the

Covid-19 pandemic. Despite

a very unpredictable previous

year, the economy grew by 8.7%

in FY 21-22, while presenting

a bundle of opportunities. This

growth was fuelled by a decline

in the Covid-19 infection rate,

widespread inoculation, a recovery

in commercial operations, and

an overall improvement in public

morale due to the upliftment of

restrictions and a partial return

to normalcy in daily life. The

Government's liquidity and stimulus

policies, the RBI's loan moratorium,

and lowered interest rate defences

also helped boost the economy

significantly.

India also had new growth spurts

during the year. As the year went

on, there was a substantial increase

in the key sectors as demand and

consumption mostly returned to

their pre-pandemic levels. Increased

levels of public and private

consumption helped to stimulate our

economy further. But in light of the

longer-lasting inflationary pressure,

the Reserve Bank of India raised its

repo rate by 90 basis points over

two instalments, bringing it from 4%

to 4.9% in May. This is expected to

have an impact on the interest rates

as well. These economic disruptions

have prompted us to undertake

strategies to provide stability to our

business and expand in the face of

uncertainties.

Industrial Overview

The cement industry is one of the

main industrial sectors in the nation.

Given the massive infrastructural

requirements of a developing

and urbanising nation and its

contributions in terms of direct

and indirect employment, cement

industry has a sizeable prominence

for a rising and transitioning

economy like India. Today, our

nation is the second-largest cement

producer worldwide, with over 7%

of the global installed capacity.

However, our per capita cement

consumption still remains extremely

low, which greatly increases the

possibility of future exponential

growth.

Due to a low FY 20-21 base and

a resurgence of construction

development in all sectors, cement

production increased in FY 21-22.

The cement industry's demand is

anticipated to go up due to rising

demand in a number of sectors,

including housing, commercial &

infrastructural development, and

industrial building. The demand

for affordable housing in rural

areas, pent-up demand in the

urban housing market, Government

infrastructure spending, the restart of

construction on public infrastructure

projects, and Government

programmes like the Pradhan Mantri

Awas Yojana (PMAY) are the main

factors driving cement consumption.

This is definitely good news for

the cement industry. In addition, it

calls for upgrades to ports, airports,

and rural infrastructure. Since its

inception, National Infrastructure

Pipeline (NIP) has added more

than 9,000 projects across 34

India has entered a period

of infrastructure growth. The

Government's unrestricted

push for infrastructure

development has allowed

the cement industry to

reach new heights. We

saw an increase in the

infrastructure spending

in the Union Budget FY

22-23's capital spending

allocation by more than

35%, from around ₹5.5 Tn

in FY 21-22 RE (Revised

Estimates) to ₹7.5 Tn in

FY 22-23 BE (Budget

Estimates).
