Managing Director

and CEO of Centre for Monitoring

Indian Economy tells “Companies will

pay very high wages to get skilled

labour, demand for lesser skilled

people is very low in the economy.”

This

is

also

followed

by

lack

of

financial resources which becomes

crucial

when

technical

and

professional courses and education is

concerned.

b.Lack of technical skills among the

youths and working groups: One of

the major reasons for unemployment

or

casual

employment

is

lack

of

technical

and

market

based

skills

among the potential working group of

people and youths. These courses are

quite cost intensive and families from

rural areas do not have capacity to

afford

the

courses.

Most

of

the

industries require skilled workers in

the required trades. Thus, it becomes

very difficult for the youths to find a

good job in industries with existing

skill set and knowledge. Also there is

growing market demand of technical

services

but

this

too

requires

technical

skills

for

self-

entrepreneurship.

c. Lack of interest among the youths:

Another crucial reason for youths with

low

employable

skills

is

lack

of

interest level in them. The main root

cause for this is poor sensitization

towards building the awareness and

interest level. Very minimal efforts

have been made by Civil Societies

towards motivating the youths to take

up vocational and job oriented skills.

a. Poor education: The education

status in rural areas of India is quite

low and especially this is a major

concern

area

among

males

and

females both. Poor educational status

results in loosing opportunities for

employment. Also lack of awareness

on

importance

of

education

is

concern

among

the

parents

and

community as a whole is one of the

key reasons for low education rate.
