Tata Steel continues to deploy industry-leading solutions

to reduce its carbon footprint. We commissioned India’s

first plant for CO2 capture from blast furnace gas at

Jamshedpur and conducted a first-of-its-kind trial for

continuous injection of Coal Bed Methane (CBM) in blast

furnace to reduce emissions. Further, we became the

first steel producer globally to join the Sea Cargo Charter

(SCC) to reduce Scope 3 emissions in ocean trade. We

also deployed our first biofuel-powered ship to transport

imported raw materials and pioneered the deployment

of electric vehicles (EVs) for transportation of finished

steel in India.

Basic Oxygen Furnace (BF-BOF) route accounts for 70% of

global steel production currently.

Tata Steel is committed towards reducing its carbon footprint

in production and through the life cycle of the product. We

are one of the first companies in India to have endorsed the

recommendations of Task Force on Climate-related Financial

Disclosures (TCFD), with our Executive Director and Chief

Financial Officer (ED&CFO) being a member of the Task Force.

We are continually strengthening our production processes,

supply chains, internal governance, disclosures, and policy

advocacy to facilitate a transition to a low-carbon future.

Operational level Governance

In 2018, a Centre of Excellence for GHG reduction and

mitigation (cross-functional team with members from

Operations, Technology and R&D, Sustainability, Finance

and Engineering) was constituted under the leadership of

Vice President Safety, Health & Sustainability to develop

a climate change response roadmap, suggest policy level

interventions, align our expansion/growth plans to a low-

carbon pathway and review implementation of projects.

The Company has also formed a Carbon Impact

Centre (CIC) that is responsible for formulating carbon

abatement projects. We use the Marginal Abatement

Cost Curve (MACC) tool for prioritisation of projects and

Internal Carbon Price (ICP) in India (in line with the EU

Emission Trading Scheme) to ensure that new projects

adequately reflect their intrinsic carbon price and also

benefits of any carbon reduction.

Climate Change risks are part of the enterprise risk

register and quarterly updates of these risks on likelihood,

impact and status of mitigation strategies are reviewed by

the Risk Management Committee of the Board.

Envisioning a decarbonised future

› Entry into Steel Recycling Business to create a formal

10. Audit Committee

The Audit Committee was constituted in the year 1986. The

Committee has adopted a Charter for its functioning. The

primary objective of the Committee is to monitor and provide

effective supervision of the Management’s financial reporting

process, to ensure accurate and timely disclosures, with

the highest levels of transparency, integrity and quality of

financial reporting.

The Committee comprises Mr. O. P. Bhatt (Chairman),

Mr. Deepak Kapoor, Ms. Farida Khambata, Mr. David W. Crane

and Mr. Saurabh Agrawal. The Committee met six times during

the year under review, the details of which are given in the

Corporate Governance Report forming part of this Report.

During the year under review, there were no instances when the

recommendations of the Audit Committee were not accepted

by the Board.

11. Internal Control Systems

The Company has internal control systems commensurate

with the nature of its business, the size, and complexity of its

operations and such internal financial controls with reference to

the Financial Statements are adequate. Details on the Internal

Financial Controls of the Company forms part of Management

Discussion and Analysis forming part of this Report.

12. Risk Management

Tata Steel’s Enterprise Risk Management (‘ERM’) process is

based on international standards like Committee of Sponsoring

Organization of the Treadway Commission (‘COSO’) and

ISO 31000.

Risk Management Committee (‘RMC’) of the Board provides

oversight and sets the tone for implementing the ERM

framework across the organization. It reviews the status of key

risks, progress of ERM implementation across locations and any

exceptions as flagged to it, on quarterly basis.

The risk appetite of the organization was approved by the RMC

and the Board during FY 2020-21. The risk appetite is aligned

to the Vision of the organization and is an important metric

governing all business actions and strategic decisions. The Risk

Appetite is driven by the following:

• Health and safety of our employees and the communities in

which we operate are our prime concern and our operating

strategy is focused on the above objective;

• All business decisions are aligned to the Tata Code

of Conduct;

• Management actions are focused on continuous

improvement;

• Environment and Climate Change impacts are assessed on

a continuous basis and business decisions support systems

including capital allocation consider impact of climate

change through the internal carbon pricing framework; and

• The long-term strategy of the Company is focused on

generating profitable growth and sustainable cashflows that

creates long-term stakeholder value.

Risk Owners may accept risk exposure to their annual and

long-term business plans, which after implementation

of mitigation strategies, is aligned to our risk appetite.

The risk appetite has been cascaded across the organization

including the Tata Steel Group Companies through focused

communication during the Annual Business Plan cycle.

For better focus on Risk Governance and ERM implementation,

the Company has set up a Management Committee called Apex

Risk Committee (‘ARC’). ARC has the primary responsibility

of implementing the Risk Management Policy of Tata Steel

3. Tata Steel Europe (TSE)

Economic growth recovered in all regions of the world in

2021 after the economy was strongly impacted in 2020 by

the COVID-19 pandemic. The recovery was strong despite

continuing supply chain issues and COVID waves. Global GDP

growth increased by 5.9% (2020: -3.4%). In China GDP growth

accelerated to 8.1% (2020: 2.2%). Whilst China achieved strong

GDP growth of 12.7% in the first half-year of 2021, the Chinese

economy decelerated sharply in the second half, recording only

4.0% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021. The deceleration

was mainly due to the weak real estate market and stagnant

infrastructure investment, together with continued COVID

waves. The EU economy grew by 5.3% (2020: -6.1%) and the

UK economy by 7.4% (2020: -9.3%). The EU and UK economies

recovered as vaccination allowed a progressive opening of the

economies. In the first part of 2021, the economies rebounded

strongly from the recession of 2020, but GDP growth

decelerated in the second half due to increasing energy prices,

inflation and supply chain issues.

Global steel demand increased by 2.7% in 2021 in line with the

improving macroeconomic conditions (2020: 0.5%). Demand

in China decreased by -5.4% (2020: 10.4%) as growth in the

construction sector slowed down. Demand in the EU recovered

by 16.8% (2020: -11.6%). In CY2021 the steel-using industries

in the EU experienced a strong rebound in output, which

peaked in the second quarter. The recovery of automotive

was particularly strong. However, issues with the supply chain

(especially shortage of semiconductors) negatively affected

output in the automotive sector in the second half of the

year. In 2021 global steel production increased by 3.6% (2020:

-0.1%). Steel production in China decreased by -3.1% (2020:

6.9%) and equated to 54% of global steel production. In the

EU production was increased by 15.4% (2020: -12.0%) as the

idled Blast Furnaces were brought back online.

The market reference price for iron ore fines (China CFR 62%)

increased in FY 2021-22 to US$154/t (+$26/t). The price was

particularly high in the first half of the year with an all-time high

in June 2021 of US$215/t as demand from Chinese mills was

strong. The hard coking coal spot price (Australia FOB) increased

to US$313/t (+$196/t). The price increased during the year due

to a combination of strong seaborne demand from India,

Japan, South Korea and Europe as industrial output improved,

high demand for non-Australian coals from China and limited

supply in the spot market. The price was at an all-time high of

594 US$/t in March due to the loss of supply from Russia as a

result of the war in the Ukraine. The German benchmark scrap

price (Sorte 2/8) increased to €437/t (+€196/t) compared to the

previous financial year. The price of CO2 increased in 2021-22

to €65/t (+€36/t), reaching an all-time high in February 2022

at €91/t. Increasing industrial output and reforms of the EU

Emissions Trading System, reducing the supply of permits, have

caused the price to rise. The European steel spot Hot Rolled Coil

price (Germany, parity point) increased in 2021-22 to €1,055/t

(+€520/t). The price increased strongly as demand for steel was

high whilst supply was limited. In March 2022 the steel price

was at an all-time high of €1,240/t due to the loss of supply from

Ukraine and Russia.

For 2022 the outlook is highly uncertain due to the war in the

Ukraine. The war in the Ukraine has a major impact on the

EU due to its reliance on Russian energy and its geographic

proximity to the conflict area. There are further downside risks

from COVID virus infections and rising interest rates. The World

Steel Association predicts that steel demand will increase 0.4%

globally. Demand in the EU is expected to decline by -1.3%.

TSE’s production in FY 2021-22 was up 0.6 MnT (6%) compared

to the previous year due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic

on demand in FY 2020-21 on the Group’s steel products. The

deliveries increased by 2% over the previous year driven by

broad based improvement in most steel consuming sectors.

During the year under review, the revenue stood at ₹90,023

crore reflecting a significant improvement of 61% over

FY 2020-21 primarily due to improved average revenue per

tonne and higher deliveries attributable to the recovery

of the European steel market aided by the improvement
