overall functioning of the Company. It is vested with the

ultimate responsibility of protecting and enhancing shareholder

value through strategic direction to the Company. The Board

collectively spearheads compliance and drives action on the

strategic objectives. At Centuryply, the Board of Directors is the

apex decision making body and hence, it is responsible to align

the Board’s decisions and actions with the Company’s interest.

The Company has an eminent and diversified Board to drive

Board Meetings serve as forum for Board decision making by

enabling discussions on matters placed before the Directors

and facilitating decision making based on their collective

judgment. The Board meets at regular intervals to discuss

and decide on strategies, policies and reviews the financial

performance of the Company. The Board generally meets once

Secretarial Standards and Listing Regulations with respect to

travel in most parts of the Country, the Company encouraged

the participation of the Directors at the meetings of the Board

In order to promote cohesiveness and better participation of

Directors, meetings are usually convened by giving advance

Notice for the Board Meetings, in compliance with Secretarial

the Directors to plan their schedules and to ensure meaningful

participation at the meetings. The Independent Directors

Committee meetings in which they act as a Member.

Your Company believes that a carefully planned agenda note is

pivotal for effective Board Meetings. The

letter and spirit. The Agenda for

the meetings is circulated well in advance to the Directors to

ensure that sufficient time is provided to Directors to prepare

for the meeting. Detailed presentations, wherever required, are

also made at the Board meetings by the respective executives

on the matters related to them. The Board is free to take up any

item not included in the Agenda with the permission of the

Chairman and with the consent of majority of Directors present

in the meeting. The Board is apprised of all major events/items

and decisions together with the overall performance of the

Company. As and when required, senior executives are invited

and its Committees, tracks and monitors proceedings of such

meetings to ensure that the Terms of Reference are adhered

to, ensures that decisions taken in such meetings are properly

recorded in the minutes. All the discussions and decisions

taken at meetings of the Board are entered in the Minute Book.

Directors within fifteen days from the date of the meeting

and suggestions or comments, if any, received from them

are suitably incorporated therein, in consultation with the

Chairman. The minutes are entered in the Minutes Book within

34. Exceptional Item – Expenses

Exceptional item of H1,181.04 lacs for the period ended 31st March, 2021, represents reversal of refund of 50% of differential

excise duty paid in cash, for its plywood unit in north-east India, claimed earlier on the basis of favourable decision by Hon’ble

Guwahati High Court, which was passed relying on the decision by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s V.V.F Limited &

others versus the Union of India. However, the Hon’ble Supreme Court, vide its judgement dated 22nd April, 2020 has reversed its

earlier decision in the case of M/s V.V.F Limited, mentioned herein, and allowed the subsequent and amended notifications issued

by revenue authority which replaced the 100% excise duty refund benefit as envisaged in original notification no. 20/2007, with

refund equivalent to specified percentage of excise duty payable based on value addition and held that the amended notifications

was clarificatory in nature and is not hit by doctrine of promissory estoppel. Further, based on the legal advice obtained by the

Company from External Counsel, as well as its own assessment, there is likelihood of the Company’s appeal being not considered

and consequent liability may arise for refund/reversal of amount so received/provided. Accordingly, income which was previously

recognized in the books of accounts is reversed.:
