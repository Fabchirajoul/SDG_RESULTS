Instruments with [ICRA]A1

Downgraded the short-term rating to

[ICRA]A1 (pronounced ICRA A one)

from [ICRA]A1+ (pronounced ICRA A

one plus)

Rationale for downgraded ratings are as mentioned below:

As per the rating agency ICRA the ratings downgrade factors in the continued moderation in Company’s

debt protection metrics due to a consistent decline in its operating margins in H1 FY2022, following a sharp

decrease in FY2021 owing to reduced spreads between raw material costs and end-product realisations.

Further the run up in commodity prices has dampened the profitability, however the Company is expected

to renegotiate its supply contracts due for renewal in March 2022 with certain key customers, which should

improve its profitability, going forward. The Company has ramped up its enhanced capacities and is expected

to achieve a volumetric growth in FY2022, pressure on the profitability is likely to result in subdued debt

protection metrics and return indicators in the near term.

(ii) Non-derivative financial assets

Non-derivative financial assets are initially

measured at fair value. If the financial asset

is not subsequently accounted for at fair

investment in unquoted securities.

(iii) Trade and other receivables

The fair values of trade and other receivables

are estimated at the present value of future

cash flows, discounted at the market rate

of interest at the measurement date. Short-

term receivables with no stated interest rate

are measured at the original invoice amount.

Fair value is determined at initial recognition
