Managing Director’s Message

Striding Ahead

with Integrity

With our integrated value

chain, diversified product mix,

strong technical capabilities, and

robust performance, we have been

striding ahead with excellence.: Dear Stakeholders,

According to IMF forecasts, India is expected to be among

the fastest growing economies by the end of the year. To

boost India’s prospects, the Government of India has pushed

for increased capital expenditure to support the medium-

term revival of the economy, while simultaneously building

capacities for long-term growth. Factors that are expected

to contribute to this growth are the Government’s continued

focus on reforms and infrastructure creation, and the

Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) calibrated monetary policy.

Despite significant various challenges last year, we

sharpened our focus on creating value for business by

continuing to build a company that is increasingly agile,

resilient, and future-ready. I am pleased to report that we

demonstrated flexibility and managed these pressures

to produce strong financial results during the reviewed

period. We reached new heights with the assistance of our

superior commercial enterprise, which has been developed

across close to four decades and has strong execution

capabilities.

With our integrated value chain, diversified product mix,

strong technical capabilities, and robust track record, we

emerged as a Global Partner of Choice. Our proposal for

demerger of Pharma business will result into two dedicated

and focused business segments i.e., Specialty Chemical

and Pharma without overlap of one business over the other.

ACCOMPLISHING PERFORMANCE

MILESTONES

During the year, our revenue increased by 58% to H7,919

crores, while EBITDA came in at H1,930 crores, higher by

96%. Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at H1,307 crores, higher by

150% over last year. The FY 2021-22 financials include an

impact of termination fees received with respect to the first

long-term contract to the tune of H631 crores. Excluding

termination fees, our annual revenues were at H7,288

crores, while EBITDA was at H1,320 crores. We achieved

the highest-ever EBITDA in the Company’s history in FY

2021-22 even after netting off the impact from termination

income.

CHEMICAL BUSINESS

The specialty chemical business revenue grew by 63% over

last year and stood at H6,619 crores in FY 2021-22. R&D

is a cornerstone of Aarti Industries' growth, and we are

constantly expanding our capabilities and competencies in

process research, product innovation, intellectual property,

and analytical references to provide integrated solutions

to our customers. The year saw a supply shortage of a

key raw material - nitric acid, which impacted production

of a variety of specialty chemical products. We propose

establishing a backward integration plant to convert

weak nitric acid to concentrated nitric acid. Commercial

manufacturing for the project related to the second long-

term contract began in Q4 FY2021-22

Even in an environment of global uncertainty, the chemical

industry remains an attractive source of opportunities.
