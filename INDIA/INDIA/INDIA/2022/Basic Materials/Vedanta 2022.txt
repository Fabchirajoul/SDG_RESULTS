Integrated Report and Annual Accounts 2021-22

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Dear Stakeholders,

At Vedanta, the pandemic challenged us to think differently and

act swiftly, both from the perspective of business continuity

and social responsibility. With decisive actions and a strong

stakeholder focus, we could mount the imminent challenges and

continue to deliver value for everyone.

Even as the pandemic tested our collective mettle, we have many

takeaways in our quiver both for business and life that will stay

with us. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow

Board members, all employees of Vedanta, our supplier partners,

our investor fraternity and all other stakeholders, who have stood

in solidarity with us as we navigated the COVID crisis.

Rebound, revival and opportunities

Post the pandemic, the world has nearly returned to

normalcy in terms of restored economic and business

activity, unrestricted mobility of people and re-opening

of spaces for work. This has enabled the International

Monetary Fund (IMF) to forecast a global growth rate of

4.4% in 2022. However, there are downside risks, which are

weighing upon optimism, in the form of the Russia-Ukraine

conflict and the COVID-19 outbreak in China. These have

caused a ripple effect across the globe including disruptions

to already battling supply chains, and in turn, muted

manufacturing activity in Europe and the United States.

In India, economic growth bounced back last year, with the

National Statistical Office (NSO) pegging GDP growth at a

strong 8.9% in its second advance estimates. Government

expenditure and domestic spending have shored up the

economy well, complemented by a long-term growth-

focused budget. The initiatives by the government in the

recent past, such as the commodity-intensive National

Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and Production Linked

Incentive (PLI) scheme to boost local manufacturing, are

also progressing well. This is encouraging, as such bold

and scalable programmes are instrumental in realising the

vision of a self-reliant India.

On the policy front, the Mines and Minerals (Development

and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021 is also an

encouraging move, which calls for private participation in

the exploration of key resources such as coal and gold.

This paves the way for better utilisation of India’s natural

resources potential and in ensuring better trade balance in

India’s favour. That said, there is significant space for import

substitution of minerals such as Zinc and Oil & Gas, where

India freely allows imports for domestic consumption.

Strengthening our performance and position

FY2022 witnessed a notable rebound in the commodity

markets with the release of pent-up demand and buoyant

prices. The demand was further accelerated by the global

energy transition, with OEMs and other players sourcing

metals and minerals at scale for deployment in renewable

energy infrastructure.

In this scenario, Vedanta reaffirmed its position as a

strong natural resources player that contributes to national

and industrial growth and to the global priority of carbon

neutrality. We saw substantial growth across all our

businesses, in terms of throughput and volumes, and in

improved financial results. Our strong liquidity position and

deleveraging focus peg our debt at a very comfortable level.

Reflecting this, both CRISIL and India Ratings upgraded our

credit rating to ‘AA’ with a stable outlook.

During the year, our individual businesses received several

accolades in recognised forums such as World Finance,

SABERA Awards, World HRD Congress and others. At the

Group level, we were awarded for our corporate reporting

practices and others. Our sustainability efforts were also

recognised with improved ratings and rankings in the MSCI

and CDP platforms.

In March 2022, we conducted focused interactions with

more than 100 investors and analysts. The engagements

were very successful as we conveyed to them our unique

position to create long-term sustainable shareholder value

through our growth plans across commodities, execution

capability, disciplined capital allocation, strong dividend

distribution policy and commitment to deleveraging.: Message from the

Dear Stakeholders,

It’s refreshing to write to you at a time of

rebound and cautious optimism, post the

peak of the pandemic that plagued us for

the past two years. At Vedanta, we are proud

to have weathered the COVID-19 situation

with prudence and empathy and are even

more confident of taking on challenges and

exceeding expectations.

I’m delighted to share that in FY2022,

we achieved yet another best-ever year,

with strong performance across all our

businesses and strategic priorities. It’s

noteworthy that we achieved this feat during

the recovery period from COVID-19, and

amid significant volatilities in the commodity

space. We also continued to undertake

value-accretive projects and improved our

operational excellence and overall efficiency.

Message from the CEO

A new ESG purpose

This was the year in which we unveiled our renewed

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Purpose,

‘Transforming for Good’, built on the three pillars of

‘Transforming Communities’, ‘Transforming the Planet’

and ‘Transforming the Workplace’. These pillars are further

indicative of Vedanta’s steadfast commitment to become

best-in-its-class, while ensuring that the communities

and the larger society also benefit from our existence.

These pillars are supported by nine aims that will serve as

guideposts and milestones in our journey, including our Net

Zero Carbon Vision 2050. Going forward, this purpose will

be the bedrock of our ESG strategy.

Safety, our fundamental priority

Across the organisation, we continue to instill safe work

behaviours. However, it’s with extreme regret that I report

12 fatalities during the year. Such incidents indicate that

our efforts towards safety requires continuous monitoring

and upgradation. We are cognisant of this and have taken

several novel steps to minimise incidents and improve

overall safety performance, starting from the senior

management. For example, at our respective businesses,

CEOs are driving critical risks. We have also initiated the

implementation of fatality learnings across businesses,

led by CEOs, together with increased leadership time on

field through Visible Felt Leadership (VFL) and personal

safety programmes. Further, we have onboarded DuPont

Sustainability Solutions for the implementation of Critical

Risk Management.

Setting new standards

of responsible growth

Record growth and margins

Overall, in FY2022, we continued to improve our performance

each quarter and closed the year with record performance

in most of our businesses. Strong volumes, supported

by a buoyant pricing scenario, primarily determined our

performance during the year. Even as input costs increased

due to commodity inflation, our focus on operational

excellence, digitalisation and innovation held us in good

stead, improving overall agility and efficiency.

At the close of the year, we recorded all time high revenue of

`131,192 crore, 51% higher than the previous fiscal. We also

registered our highest-ever EBITDA, which stood at `45,319

crore, with continued industry leading EBITDA margin of 39%.

Concomitant with our performance, we were also able to

distribute record dividends to our shareholders, to the tune of

`16,728 crore, delivered in three tranches through the fiscal.

Strong financial profile

Strong uptick in business performance and progress on

deleveraging have allowed us to deliver an RoCE of ~30%,

1.6x y-o-y. Our underlying liquidity position remained robust,

with a total cash and cash equivalents of `32,130 crore in our

books. We could also reduce our net debt by `3,435 crore to

`20,979 crore by the end of the year. This has helped bring

down our leverage ratio to 0.5x, one of the lowest in our

peer group.

Digital first. Future ready.

We continue to foster a digital-first approach across

businesses, establishing it as a culture that cuts through

levels and functions. We have established a digital Centre of

Excellence (CoE), automated 100% of enabling functions, and

achieved 100% digital literacy across the organisation.

We have also launched a Group-wide programme ‘Vedanta

Spark’ with the objective of scaling up the partnership

with innovative start-ups, to leverage their technological

capabilities and speed of execution. This will enable us in

achieving strategic goals under operational excellence,

new product development and 360-degree sustainability.

Through this programme, we aim to reimagine the role

of entrepreneurship in catalysing innovation by enabling

technology, talent, and entrepreneurial ambitions of

India’s youth by seeding world-class technology ventures.

The ventures will benefit from co-creation opportunities

with the Vedanta Group companies; access to massive

capacities and resources of the Group; availability of global

and expert mentorship; and opportunity to solicit funding

and investments.

Average sales realisation increased 35% y-o-y from

US$488 per tonne in FY2021 to US$659 per tonne in

FY2022. Prices of iron and steel are influenced by several

macro-economic factors. These include global economic

slowdown, US-China trade war, supply chain destocking,

government expenditure on infrastructure, the emphasis

on developmental projects, demand-supply dynamics, the

Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) in India and production

and inventory levels across the globe especially China. Even

though the NSR increased by US$ 171 per tonne, we were

unable to increase our EBITDA margin & landed to US$ 74

per tonne for the year (against US$ 95 per tonne in FY2021)

due to increased raw material prices of coking coal.

19% to ₹701 crore even after higher sales due to increased

letter dated 29 May

2018, cancelled 342.22 acres of the land allotted

for the proposed Expansion Project. Further, the

TNPCB issued orders on 07 June 2018 directing the

withdrawal of the Consent to Establish (“CTE”) which

was valid till 31 March 2023.

The Company has approached Madras High Court

by way of writ petition challenging the cancellation

of lease deeds by SIPCOT pursuant to which an

interim stay has been granted. The Company has also

filed Appeals before the TNPCB Appellate Authority

challenging withdrawal of CTE by the TNPCB, the

matter is pending for adjudication. Considering

the delay in existing plant matter and accordingly

delay in getting the required approval for Expansion

Project, management considered to make provision

for impairment for Expansion Project basis fair value

less cost of disposal. The net carrying value of ` 41

crore as at 31 March 2022 (31 March 2021: ` 97 crore)

approximates its recoverable value.

Property, plant and equipment of ` 1,213 crore and

inventories of ` 301 crore, pertaining to existing and

expansion plant, could not be physically verified,

anytime during the year, as the access to the plant is

presently restricted. However, since operations are

suspended and access to the plant restricted, any

difference between book and physical quantities is

unlikely to be material.

(iv) PSC Extension

Rajasthan Block

The Company operates an oil and gas production

facility in Rajasthan under a Production Sharing

Contract (“PSC”). The management is of the opinion

that the Company is eligible for automatic extension

of the PSC for Rajasthan (“RJ”) block on same terms

w.e.f. 15 May 2020, while Government of India (“GOI”)

in October 2018, accorded its approval for extension of

the PSC, under the Pre-NELP Extension policy as per

notification dated 07 April 2017 (“Pre-NELP Policy”), for

RJ block by a period of 10 years, w.e.f. 15 May 2020. As

per the said policy and extension: letter, the Company

is required to comply with certain conditions and pay

an additional 10% profit oil to GOI. The Company had

challenged the applicability of Pre-NELP Policy to the

RJ block. The Division Bench of the Delhi High Court

in March 2021 set aside the single judge order of May

2018 which allowed automatic extension of PSC.

Nevertheless, GOI, in their submissions to the Delhi

High Court, has not objected to Vedanta obtaining a

10-year extension of Rajasthan PSC. The legal dispute

only relates to additional 10% profit petroleum rather

than Vedanta’s right to obtain 10-year extension. In the

interim, without prejudice to the Company’s rights, the

Company has commenced paying the additional 10%

profit petroleum (“PP”) claimed from 15 May 2020 to

the Government. The Company has also filed an SLP

in Supreme Court against above Delhi HC order and

revised date for SLP listing is awaited.

In parallel, the Company is in discussion with the

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (“MoPNG”) on

execution of the PSC addendum. On the other issue

related to DGH audit exceptions, discussions are

ongoing to agree on the position that this issue will be

dealt with as per ongoing arbitration with GOI as per

PSC mechanism.

One of the conditions for extension of PSC relates

to notification of certain audit exceptions raised for

FY 2016-17 as per PSC provisions and provides for

payment of amounts, if such audit exceptions result

into any creation of liability. The Company had also

clarified that the same should be de-linked as a

condition for the extension which had been granted

vide letter dated 26 October 2018.

The

letter dated 26 October

2018 upholds with all conditions addressed and no

material liability would devolve upon the Group.

Simultaneously, the Company is also pursuing with

the GOI for executing the RJ PSC addendum at

the earliest. In view of extenuating circumstances

surrounding COVID-19 and pending signing of the

PSC addendum for extension after complying with

all stipulated conditions, the GOI has been granting

interim permission to the Company to continue

Petroleum operations in the RJ block. The latest

permission is valid up to 14 May 2022 or signing of the

PSC addendum, whichever is earlier.

(v) Oil and Gas reserves

Significant technical and commercial judgements

are required to determine the Company’s estimated

oil and natural gas reserves. Reserves considered

for computing depletion are proved reserves for

acquisition costs and proved and developed reserves

for successful exploratory wells, development wells,

processing facilities, distribution assets, estimated

future abandonment cost and all other related costs.

Reserves for this purpose are considered on working

interest basis which are reassessed at least annually.

Details of such reserves are given in note 44. Changes

in reserves as a result of change in management

assumptions could impact the depreciation rates and

the carrying value of assets (refer note 5 )

(vi) Carrying value of developing/producing oil and gas

assets

Management performs impairment tests on the

Company’s developing/producing oil and gas assets

where indicators of impairment are identified in

accordance with Ind AS 36.

The impairment assessments are based on a range of

estimates and assumptions, including:

Estimates/

assumptions

Basis

Future production

proved and probable reserves,

production facilities, resource

estimates and expansion projects

Commodity prices

management’s best estimate

benchmarked with external sources

of information, to ensure they are

within the range of available analyst

forecast

Discount to price

management’s best estimate based

on historical prevailing discount and

updated sales contracts

Extension of PSC

granted till 2030 on the expected

commercial terms (Refer note 3(c)

(A)(iv)

Discount rates

cost of capital risk-adjusted for the

risk specific to the asset/ CGU

Any subsequent changes to cash flows due to changes

in the above mentioned factors could impact the

carrying value of the assets.

Details of carrying values and impairment reversal

and the assumptions used are disclosed in note 5 and

34 respectively.

(B) Significant Judgement

(i) Contingencies:

In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities

may arise from litigation, taxation and other claims

against the Company. A provision is recognised when

the Company has a present obligation as a result of

past events and it is probable that the Company will be

required to settle that obligation.

Where it is management’s assessment that the

outcome cannot be reliably quantified or is uncertain,

the claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities

unless the likelihood of an adverse outcome is remote.

Such liabilities are disclosed in the notes but are not

provided for in the financial statements.

When considering the classification of legal or tax

cases as probable, possible or remote, there is

judgement involved. This pertains to the application

of the legislation, which in certain cases is based

upon management’s interpretation of country specific

applicable law, in particular India, and the likelihood of

settlement. Management uses in-house and external

legal professionals to make informed decision.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the final

outcome of the legal proceedings, the Company does

not expect them to have a materially adverse impact

on the Company’s financial position or profitability.

These are set out in Note 38.

(ii) Revenue recognition and receivable recovery in

relation to the power division:

In certain cases, the Company’s power customers

are disputing various contractual provisions of Power

Purchase Agreements (“PPA”). Significant judgement

is required in both assessing the tariff to be charged

under the PPA in accordance with Ind AS 115 and to

assess the recoverability of withheld revenue currently

accounted for as receivables.

In assessing this critical judgement, management

considered favourable external legal opinions that

the Company has obtained in relation to the claims.

In addition, the fact that the contracts are with

government owned companies implies that the credit

risk is low [refer note 7 (c)].

(iii) Exceptional items:

Exceptional items are those items that management

considers, by virtue of their size or incidence

(including but not limited to impairment charges

and acquisition and restructuring related costs),

should be disclosed separately to ensure that the

financial information allows an understanding of the

underlying performance of the business in the year,

so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods. Also

tax charges related to exceptional items and certain

one-time tax effects are considered Exceptional. Such

items are material by nature or amount to the year’s

result and require separate disclosure in accordance

with Ind AS.

The determination as to which items should be

disclosed separately requires a degree of judgement.

The details of exceptional items are set out in note 34.

3(d) Business Combination and others:

Ferro Alloys Corporation Limited

During the previous year ended 31 March 2021,

the Company acquired control over Ferro Alloys

Corporation Limited (“FACOR”). FACOR was admitted

under Corporate insolvency resolution process in

terms of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016

of India. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)

vide its order dated 30 January 2020 approved the

resolution plan for acquiring controlling stake in

FACOR. Pursuant to the approved resolution plan,

FACOR has become a wholly owned subsidiary of the

Company. FACOR holds 90% equity in its subsidiary,

Facor Power Limited (FPL).

FACOR is in the business of producing Ferro Alloys

and owns a Ferro Chrome plant with capacity of

72,000 TPA, two operational Chrome mines and 100

MW of Captive Power Plant through its subsidiary,

FPL. The acquisition will complement the Group’s

existing steel business as the vertical integration of

ferro manufacturing capabilities has the potential to

generate significant efficiencies.

(iv) PSC Extension

Rajasthan Block

The Company operates an oil and gas production

facility in Rajasthan under a Production Sharing

Contract (“PSC”). The management is of the opinion

that the Company is eligible for automatic extension

of the PSC for Rajasthan (“RJ”) block on same terms

w.e.f. 15 May 2020, while Government of India (“GOI”)

in October 2018, accorded its approval for extension of

the PSC, under the Pre-NELP Extension policy as per

notification dated 07 April 2017 (“Pre-NELP Policy”), for

RJ block by a period of 10 years, w.e.f. 15 May 2020. As

per the said policy and extension: letter, the Company

is required to comply with certain conditions and pay

an additional 10% profit oil to GOI. The Company had

challenged the applicability of Pre-NELP Policy to the

RJ block. The Division Bench of the Delhi High Court

in March 2021 set aside the single judge order of May

2018 which allowed automatic extension of PSC.

Nevertheless, GOI, in their submissions to the Delhi

High Court, has not objected to Vedanta obtaining a

10-year extension of Rajasthan PSC. The legal dispute

only relates to additional 10% profit petroleum (“PP”)

rather than Vedanta’s right to obtain 10-year extension.

In the interim, without prejudice to the Company’s

rights, the Company has commenced paying the

additional 10% profit petroleum claimed from 15 May

2020 to the Government. The Company has also filed

an SLP in Supreme Court against above Delhi HC order

and revised date for SLP listing is awaited.

In parallel, the Company is in discussion with the

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) on

execution of the PSC addendum. On the other issue

related to DGH audit exceptions, discussions are

ongoing to agree on the position that this issue will be

dealt with as per ongoing arbitration with GOI as per

PSC mechanism.

One of the conditions for extension of PSC relates

to notification of certain audit exceptions raised for

FY 2016-17 as per PSC provisions and provides for

payment of amounts, if such audit exceptions result

into any creation of liability. The Company had also

clarified that the same should be de-linked as a

condition for the extension which had been granted

vide letter dated 26 October 2018.

The

letter dated 26 October

2018 upholds with all conditions addressed and no

material liability would devolve upon the Group.

Simultaneously, the Company is also pursuing with

the GOI for executing the RJ PSC addendum at

the earliest. In view of extenuating circumstances

surrounding COVID-19 and pending signing of the

PSC addendum for extension after complying with

all stipulated conditions, the GOI has been granting

interim permission to the Company to continue

Petroleum operations in the RJ block. The latest

permission is valid upto 14 May 2022 or signing of the

PSC addendum, whichever is earlier.

(v)

ESL Steel Limited (“ESL”), had filed application for

renewal of CTO on 24 August 2017 for the period

of five years which was denied by Jharkhand State

Pollution Control Board (“JSPCB”) on 23 August 2018,

as JSPCB awaited response from the MoEFCC over

a 2012 show-cause notice. After a personal hearing

towards the show cause notice, the MoEFCC revoked

the Environment Clearance (“EC”) on 20 September

2018. The High Court of Jharkhand granted stay

against both revocation orders and allowed the

continuous running of the plant operations under

regulatory supervision of the JSPCB. Jharkhand

High Court, on 16 September 2020, passed an

order vacating the interim stay in place beyond

23 September 2020, while listed the matter for final

hearing. ESL urgently filed a petition in the Hon’ble

Supreme Court, and on 22 September 2020, ESL was

granted permission to run the plant till further orders.

The Forest Advisory Committee (“FAC”) of the

MoEFCC granted the Stage 1 clearance and the the

MoEFCC approved the related Terms of Reference

(“TOR”) on 25 August 2020. ESL presented its proposal

before the Expert Appraisal Committee (“EAC”) after

completing the public consultation process and the

same has been recommended for grant of EC subject

to Forest Clearance by the EAC in its 41st meeting

dated 29 and 30 July 2021. Vide: letter dated 25 August

2021, the MoEFCC rejected the EC “as of now” due to

stay granted by Madras High Court vide order dated

15 July 2021 in a Public Interest Litigation filed against

the Standard Operating Procedure which was issued

by the MoEFCC for regularisation of violation case

on 07 July 2021. The Hon’ble Supreme Court vide

order dated 09 December 2021 decided the matter by

directing the MoEFCC to process the EC application of

ESL as per the applicable law within a period of three

months. The MoEFCC vide its letter dated 02 February

2022 has deferred the grant of EC till Forest Clearance

(“FC”) Stage-II is granted to ESL. ESL has submitted

its reply against the MoEFCC letter vide letter dated

11 February 2022 for reconsidering the decision of

linking EC with FC as the grant of FC Stage – II is not

a condition precedent for grant of EC. As per Stage

1 clearance, the Group is required to provide non-

forest land in addition to the afforestation cost. The

Group, based on the report of an Environment Impact

Assessment consultant, had recognised a provision

of ` 213 crore as part of exceptional item during the

year ended 31 March 2021 with respect to the costs

to be incurred by it for obtaining EC and an additional

` 7 crore has been provided against final order relating

to wildlife conservation plan received during the

current year.

(vi) Oil and Gas reserves

Significant technical and commercial judgements

are required to determine the Company’s estimated

oil and natural gas reserves. Reserves considered

for computing depletion are proved reserves for

acquisition costs and proved and developed reserves

for successful exploratory wells, development wells,

processing facilities, distribution assets, estimated

future abandonment cost and all other related costs.

Reserves for this purpose are considered on working

interest basis which are reassessed at least annually.

Details of such reserves are given in note 44. Changes

in reserves as a result of change in management

assumptions could impact the depreciation rates and

the carrying value of assets (Refer note 6).

(vii) Carrying value of developing/producing oil and gas

assets

Management performs impairment tests on the

Company’s developing/producing oil and gas assets

where indicators of impairment are identified in

accordance with Ind AS 36.

The impairment assessments are based on a range of

estimates and assumptions, including:

Estimates/ assumptions

Details of carrying values and impairment charge and

the assumptions used are disclosed in note 6 and

36 respectively.

B.

Significant judgements

(i)

Determining whether an arrangement contains a

lease:

The Group has ascertained that the Power Purchase

Agreement (PPA) entered into between one of the

subsidiaries and a State grid qualifies to be an

operating lease under Ind AS 116 “Leases”. Accordingly,

the consideration receivable under the PPA relating

to recovery of capacity charges towards capital cost

have been recognised as operating lease rentals and

in respect of variable cost that includes fuel costs,

operations and maintenance, etc. is considered as

revenue from sale of products/services.

Significant judgement is required in segregating the

capacity charges due from the State grid, between

fixed and contingent payments. The Group has

determined that since the capacity charges under the

PPA are based on the number of units of electricity

made available by its Subsidiary which would be

subject to variation on account of various factors like

availability of coal and water for the plant, there are

no fixed minimum payments under the PPA, which

requires it to be accounted for on a straight line basis.

The contingent rents recognised are disclosed in

Note 27.

(ii) Contingencies

In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities
