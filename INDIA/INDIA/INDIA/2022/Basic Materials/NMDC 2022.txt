The company has filed writ petition no: 9859/2017 dated 4th Mar 2017 in the Hon’ble

High Court of Karnataka challenging the demand notice issued by the Director, Mines

and Geology Department, Bangalore (DMG) demanding the interest on the alleged

delayed payment of royalty.

The Honorable High Court of Karnataka has directed to list the matter on 27th March

2018, which was further adjourned to 26th April 2018. On 26.04.2018, the Hon’ble High

Court was informed that Director, DMG had issued a notice to parties to appear on

03.05.2018. In the said meeting on 03.05.2018, NMDC was asked to submit certain

information / records by 16.05.2018.

On 16.05.2018, the Director, DMG had recorded views of DDMG, Hospet and adjourned

the meeting to 12.06.2018 to submit information / records by 12.06.2018 for onward

submission to the Hon’ble High Court. The said meeting was postponed on 29.06.2018

and in the said meeting, NMDC had submitted the documents and requested to waive

off the interest. It was informed by Director, DMG, Bangalore that since NMDC is a PSU,

they will peruse the issue in detail and pass suitable orders accordingly. The matter

was listed for hearing on 03.01.2019, 10.01.2019 & 21.01.2019.

During the hearing on January 2019, the Counsel of Govt. of Karnataka informed the

Hon’ble Court that the DMG had passed the order on the representations of NMDC on

07.12.2018 and rejected the request of NMDC. Accordingly, NMDC has to file a fresh

Writ Petition challenging the orders dated 07.12.2018.

The Standing Counsel informed to Hon’ble Court that as there is no change in the

stand of Govt. of Karnataka, there is no need to file a fresh Writ Petition.

The matter was adjourned and the case was listed for hearing on 23.04.2019 and later

on 27.05.2019.

During the hearing, Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka in their order dated 06.06.2019

had cancelled/disposed the writ petition filed by NMDC Ltd and also granted liberty to

NMDC to challenge the order passed by Respondent on 07.12.2018. Writ Petition filed

by NMDC with Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka on 25.10.2019 and numbered as WP no

51121/2019.

The hearing was adjourned to later dates. Meanwhile, Govt Advocate had sought time

for filing statement of objections. The Hon’ble Court granted and proposed to list the

matter for hearing on 02.07.2020. However, the matter/case could not be listed for

hearing due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Present Status/ATN

The case is still pending to be listed for hearing.

Further, the following is proposed.

“As the above matter is under subjudice and all judicial proceedings normally take long

period for settlement and the present pandemic situation further adding to the delay,

Audit may be kindly requested not to pursue the above para further”.

e) Vide the said: letter it is clarified that the

stamp duty for the said transfer of lease is

applicable as per Article 63 of Schedule-1 A

of stamp Act. Moreover, section 3 of stamp

Duty Act 1899, clearly states that stamp

duty is not chargeable on instruments

executed by or on behalf of or in favour of

the Government. (Annexure-II).

letter

that since NMDC has paid the stamp duty

charges during the lease deed, the same

rate shall be applicable in case of transfer

of lease as per Article 63 of Schedule 1 A of

Stamp Act of Chhattisgarh (Annexure-IV).

h) As regards non-inclusion of the clause

relating to waiver of stamp duty in the

shareholder agreement, it may be noted

that the agreement was signed between

NMDC and CMDC on 01.07.2006 and no

record is available for the reasons for not

including the specific condition regarding

waiver of Registration Charges and Stamp

duty for registering the same mine twice is

not known and is not recorded. However, It

may be noted that in view of the reply given

by the Registrar of Stamps, Government

of Chhattisgarh to the CAG, it is ample

clear that if it cannot be legally waived off,

inclusion or non-inclusion of the same in the

agreement hardly matters.

Return on Equity (ROE):

ROE is a measure of financial performance of companies calculated by dividing

net income by shareholders' equity. The CPSE wise details of ROE are given in

Annexure-X. The consolidated ROE of 425 Government companies and corporations

during the period from 2017-18 to 2019-20 is given in Table 1.18.

It was observed that ROE of 425 Government companies and corporations slightly

increased in the year 2018-19 in comparison to that for the year 2017-18. However,

ROE of Government companies and corporations decreased significantly in the year

2019-20 in comparison to that for the year 2018-19 mainly due to decrease in net

profit.

ROE in respect of Monopoly and Non-monopoly CPSEs is given in Table 1.19.

Return on Equity is a derivative of Average Selling Price (ASR)

of Iron Ore and Sales Quantity.

In FY 2019-20, average selling price of Iron Ore was reduced

from ` 3, 708/Ton to ` 3, 671/Ton and sales quantity was

reduced from 323.57 LT to 315.14 LT due to non-renewal

of mining lease of Donimalai Complex by Government of

Karnataka.

However, in 2020-21 ROE has increased as compared to 2019-

20 from 14.01% to 22.36% due to increase in average selling

price from ` 3,671/Ton to ` 4,581/Ton and also due to increase

in sales quantity from 315.14 LT to 332.52 LT as shown in the

Adding back of CSR expenditure while calculating the net profit under Section

198

Section 198 of the Act elaborates the manner of calculation of net profit which

is adopted for determining CSR expenditure for a year. Audit observed that

while the section mentions particularly the expenses and incomes which are

allowed as deduction, it does not explicitly state whether the CSR expenditure

incurred in the preceding three years and already deducted while drawing the

financial statements of the company is allowed to be deducted or not from the

net profit. If it is not allowed as deduction, then it has to be added back while

calculating net profit for the preceding three financial years. Audit observed

that CPSEs are following different practices in respect of CSR expenditure while

calculating the net profit under Section 198 of the Act. As per the information

received in respect of 26 CPSEs out of 95 CPSEs, nine CPSEs have added back

the CSR expenditure while calculating the net profit resulting in allocation of

CSR expenditure higher by ` 11.95 crore whereas, 17 CPSEs have not added

back the CSR expenditure resulting in allocation of CSR expenditure less by

` 23.47 crore (Annexure XXIX). The clarification given by the CSR committee

of the ICAI in April 2020 stated that the net profit is to be calculated after

deducting CSR expenditure.

NMDC is complying with requirements of Section 198 of the

Companies act regarding the manner of calculation of net

profit which is adopted for determining the CSR expenditure

for a year which is 2% of PBT (as per the average of three

preceding financial year). The PBT and CSR thereon after

adding CSR to PBT is given as under:

As it can be observed from the above table, that even after

to the PBT, NMDC has spent an amount of ` 199.99 crore i.e.

more than 2% of the average revised PBT for immediately

preceding three financial years.

passed an interim order directing the Company to pay 50% of FDT, consisting of 25% in cash and balance 25% in the

form of Bank Guarantee. As against the total FDT demand of ` 487.37 Crore ( from August 2008 to Sep-2011), the

Company has deposited an amount of ` 121.84 Crore (25%) in cash which has been shown as amount recoverable and

submitted a bank guarantee for similar amount. An amount of ` 365.53 Crore (balance 50% amount of ` 243.69 Crore

plus 121.84 Crore paid and accounted as amount recoverable) is included under disputed claims at 1.1.A. The amount

of ` 121.84 Crore for which BG was given is included under contingent liability on BGs’ at 1.2.

Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka vide order dated 03.12.2015 has quashed the orders of Government of Karnataka

levying the FDT and ordered refund of the tax collected within three months and accordingly the Company has lodged

refund claims. However, Government of Karnataka has filed a Special Leave Petition with Hon'ble Supreme Court of

India, challenging the orders of Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka. Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has accepted the

same and imposed stay on refund of the FDT amount.

Meanwhile Karnataka State Govt. had enacted Karnataka Forest (Amendment) Act 2016 vide Gazette notification

dated 27.07.2016. The amendment substituted the word ‘Tax’ in the principal act to ‘Fee’ w.e.f 16th day of Aug 2008.

Based on this the Monitoring Committee had started billing the Forest Development Fee in its invoices. Meanwhile

consumers in Karnataka had filed separate Writ Petitions in Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka on the above. Karnataka

High Court vide its order dated 20th Sept. 2016, had ordered that State Govt may restrain from collecting FDF during

the pendency of the writ petition, subject to the condition of furnishing bank guarantee in respect of 25% of the

demand in relation to future transactions. Karnataka State Govt. had approached Hon’ble Supreme Court on this.

Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 13.02.2017 modified the order of High Court of Karnataka and ordered for

payment of 50% of the demanded amount and furnish Bond for balance amount.

The amount billed by the monitoring committee amounting to ` 93.85 crore towards FDF has been accounted under

sales revenue during the Financial year 2017-18. As, the Karnataka High Court vide its judgement dated 4th October

2017 has declared the Karnataka Forests (Amendment) Act, 2016 which was introduced for collection of Forest

Development Fee (FDF) as unconstitutional, No FDF was collected nor paid with effect from 5th October 2017.

passed an interim order directing the Company to pay 50% of FDT, consisting of 25% in cash and balance 25% in the

letter issued by Monitoring committee and as per the guidelines given by Hon’ble Supreme Court of India,

Pellet plant is paying Basic value, Royalty Value and bulk permit fee value to MC and GST amount to NMDC Donimalai

account. After receipt of GST amount from Pellet Plant, DIOM/KIOM is issuing advance receipt confirming the receipt

of GST from Pellet Plant along with necessary statutory Documents to MC in the prescribed format. Based on the

advance receipt issued by DIOM/KIOM, Monitoring Committee is issuing bulk permit to Pellet Plant for lifting of

materials. DIOM/KIOM is raising Tax invoice on Pellet Plant for the dispatched quantity, showing it as sales and also

paying GST to Government.

Simultaneously, Pellet Plant is recognizing the same as purchases and availing input credit. The above procedure is

followed due to Compulsion made by MC as they have denied permission for Pellet Plant to lift the Iron Ore without

participating in auction and accordingly, separate GST registration is also taken as per MC instructions.

However, the entry for un-realized profit on sale of Iron Ore to Pellet Plant is accounted.

This amendment is applicable to all the Iron Ore Mines of NMDC except Kumarswamy Iron Ore Mines at Karnataka
