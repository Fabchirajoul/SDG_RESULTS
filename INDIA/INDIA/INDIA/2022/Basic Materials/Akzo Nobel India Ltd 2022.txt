Managing Director’s statement

Shifting gears: From new

highs to the next

Nothing makes me

more determined

to succeed than

someone telling

me something’s

impossible.

Looking in the rearview

mirror, uncertainty

in FY 2021-22. For

businesses worldwide,

the year gone by was

a real stress test of

operational resilience.

I am delighted to share

held its ground but

i.

(a) (A) The Company is maintaining proper records

showing full particulars, including quantitative

details and situation, of property, plant

and equipment.

(B) The Company is maintaining proper records

showing full particulars of intangible assets.

(b) The property, plant and equipment are physically verified

by the Management according to a phased programme

designed to cover all the items over a period of three

years which, in our opinion, is reasonable having regard

to the size of the Company and the nature of its assets.

Pursuant to the programme, a portion of the property,

plant and equipment has been physically verified by

the Management during the year and no material

discrepancies have been noticed on such verification.

(c) The title deeds of all the immovable properties (other than properties where the Company is the lessee and the lease

agreements are duly executed in favour of the lessee), as disclosed in Note 3.1 on property, plant and equipment to the

Standalone Financial Statements, are held in the name of the Company, except for the following:

(d) The Company has not revalued its property, plant and

equipment (including right-of-use assets) or intangible

assets or both during the year. Consequently, as stated

in Note 38 to the Standalone Financial Statements, the

question of our commenting on whether the revaluation

is based on the valuation by a Registered Valuer, or

specifying the amount of change, if the change is 10%

or more in the aggregate of the net carrying value of

each class of Property, Plant and Equipment (including

right-of-use assets) or intangible assets does not arise.

(e) Based on the information and explanations furnished

to us, as stated in Note 38 to the Standalone Financial

Statements, no proceedings have been initiated on or

are pending against the Company for holding benami

property under the Prohibition of Benami Property

Transactions Act, 1988 (as amended in 2016) (formerly

the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 (45 of

1988)) and Rules made thereunder, and therefore the

question of our commenting on whether the Company

has appropriately disclosed the details in its Standalone

Financial Statements does not arise.

ii.

(a) The physical verification of inventory (excluding stocks

with third parties) and goods in transit has been

conducted at reasonable intervals by the Management

during the year and, in our opinion, the coverage

and procedure of such verification by Management

is appropriate. In respect of inventory lying with third

parties, these have substantially been confirmed by

them. The discrepancies noticed on physical verification

of inventory as compared to book records were not

10% or more in aggregate for each class of inventory.

(b) During the year, the Company has not been sanctioned

working capital limits in excess of H 5 crores, in

aggregate from banks and financial institutions on the

basis of security of current assets and accordingly, the

question of our commenting on whether the quarterly

returns or statements are in agreement with the

unaudited books of account of the Company does not

arise. Also refer Note 38 to the Standalone

Financial Statements.:

Managing Director, Chief

Financial Officer, Head HR, Company Secretary) which

has been identified as the chief operating decision maker

(CODM), to assess the financial performance and position of

the Company and make strategic decisions. Refer note 33

for reportable segments determined by the Company.

r) Leases

As a lessee

Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a

corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset

is available for use by the Company. Contracts may contain

both lease and non-lease components. The Company

allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and

non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone

prices. However, for leases of real estate for which the

Company is a lessee, it has elected not to separate lease

and non-lease components and instead accounts for these

as a single lease component.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially

measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include

the net present value of the following lease payments:

a.

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments),

less any lease incentives receivable

b.

variable lease payments that are based on an index or a

rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the

commencement date

c.

amounts expected to be payable by the Company

under residual value guarantees

d.

the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company

is reasonably certain to exercise that option and

e.

payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the

lease term reflects the Company exercising that option

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain

extension options are also included in the measurement

of the liability. The lease payments are discounted using

the interest rate implicit in the lease. If the rate cannot be

readily determined, which is generally the case for leases

in the Company, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is

used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have

to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of

similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic

environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Company

obtains the general purpose borrowing rates and makes

necessary adjustments specific to the lease e.g. lease term,

security etc.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance

cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the

lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of

interest on the remaining balance of the liability for

each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the

following:

a.

the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability

b.

any lease payments made at or before the

commencement date less any lease incentives received

c.

any initial direct costs, and

d.

restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the

shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on

straight-line basis. If the Company is reasonably certain

to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is

depreciated over the underlying assets useful life.
