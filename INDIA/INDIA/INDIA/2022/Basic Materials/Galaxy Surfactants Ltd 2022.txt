Managing Director

While Financial Year 2020-21 tested resilience of Galaxy,

Financial Year 2021-22 was about Acceptance, Adaptation &

Agility. The year involved:

1.

‘Accepting’ the new normal.

2.

Enhancing “Agility” within processes to respond to the

elevated challenges of the new normal.

While Financial Year 2020-21 taught us to deal with the

Pandemic, Financial Year 2021-22 required us to navigate

a hyper-dynamic supply chain environment racked by

feedstock outages, raw material unavailability, logistical

disruption, delays and regulatory bottlenecks. These factors

tested every aspect of our business in terms of service and

responsiveness to customers.

What remains of more importance is how the Galaxy

team prepared itself to overcome these challenges and

become future-ready.

GLOBAL MACRO SCENARIO, INFLATION, SUPPLY

CHAIN AND FEEDSTOCKS

Globally, one of the biggest factors in the past two years has

been the non-availability of personnel. The frequent restrictions

and lockdowns imposed by the economies coupled with

COVID-19 illnesses resulted in manpower shortages at various

ports severely impeding both, cross-border and domestic

movement of goods. Scores of container ships remained idle

at ports globally, worsening the supply chain scenario further.

The restricted movement of goods was the primary cause of

demand-supply imbalances, giving rise to the high inflationary

scenario that the world is currently experiencing.

Our Global Customer Delight process had a huge role to play in

this trying year. Strategic long-term tie-ups with shipping lines

“While Financial

Year 2020-21

tested resilience of

Galaxy, Financial

Year 2021-22 was

about Acceptance,

Adaptation & Agility”

“Agility is the

ability to adapt and

respond to change.

Agile organisations

view change as an

opportunity, not

a threat”
