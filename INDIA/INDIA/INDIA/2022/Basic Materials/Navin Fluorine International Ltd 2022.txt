General Meeting:

Managing Director’s review

Execution

excellence

12 I Annual Report 2021-22:

Dear shareholders,

The financial year 2022 was very

good for the Company and its

partners (employees, customers,

suppliers and shareholders).

Our Company revenues grew

H271 crores to H1,404 crs and our

Specialty business revenue crossed

H500 crores during the year under

review. Besides, we are excited about

the quality and quantum of the

growth opportunities in the pipeline

that would translate into profitable

growth over the foreseeable future.

We closed the financial year under

review with a capital expenditure

of more than H1000 crores (and

another capex announcement of

more than H500 crores thereafter).

These consolidated investments will

help build a robust foundation for

our future growth. Some of these

investments have been directed

towards the development of

capabilities and scale in our building

blocks, positioning us strongly for

prospective collaborations and

partnerships.

We are also investing in the

upgradation of our R&D and pilot

plant infrastructure in Surat. This will

enhance our ability to undertake

complex projects with global

multinationals in existing and new

segments. While we increase our

investments in hardware, it is critical

we continue to develop our people

capabilities as well. During the year

under review, the company engaged

in significant recruitment in the T&D,

R&D, Projects and Operations across

locations and businesses.

Let me now provide a quick update

on the progress, we have made

during the year on the business

framework of 3Ps.

In the area of Partnerships, we

now have two client relationships

fast approaching revenues of US$

100MM a year and another two

shaping into potential US$ 100MM+

relationships.

In the area of Products, we started by

focusing on three value chains and

building blocks, out of which two are

scaling up well. We identified two

new building blocks of substance

that we expect to grow. These

building blocks offer us opportunity

to own critical value chains, offering

our customers with clear risk

mitigation.

In the area of Platforms, we have

been working on new chemistry and

engineering technologies which can

be widely applied across businesses,

reinforcing our technology

leadership.

These products and platforms will

help Navin Fluorine deepen its

position as a partner of choice for

our select clients.

As we enter a new financial year, we

see some challenges on the horizon.

Inflation, supply chain disruptions

and interest rate increases could test

our execution excellence. In the past

few years, we demonstrated strong

ability to weather similar challenges.

With strong teamwork and support

from all our stakeholders, we remain

confident of doing so yet again and

sustaining our journey in becoming a

billion-dollar enterprise.

Warm regards,
