Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present to you the 64th Annual Report

for Bayer CropScience Limited. The report looks back

on the Financial Year 2021-22, a year characterized by

significant digital transformations, social developments

and adverse climatic conditions.

We saw the Indian Government emphasize the need

for strong digital transformation in agriculture and a

growing passion around the world for sustainability,

driven in part by an increase in extreme weather

conditions such as unseasonal rains, droughts

and floods.

For Bayer, it was ultimately a successful year.

We achieved our operational objectives and pushed

ahead diligently with our efficiency, scale-up of

alternate business models and new product launches.

We also continued to receive recognitions from key

stakeholders and customers in 2021-22, a testimony

of our accomplishments. We achieved several

milestones that will aid sustainable growth in the

future. These include the rollout of customer centricity

and digitalization initiatives. Your Company adopted

digital technologies, such as drones, which is a step

forward in our efforts to provide a strong impetus to

farmers’ prosperity sustainably.

In 2021-22, new product launches and overall strong

crop sentiments were key drivers for our sales

growth in Q4 and enabled us to post strong growth

of 11% in Revenue from Operations. To strengthen

competitiveness, your Company continued to optimize

its business portfolio with the divestment of the seed

distribution business viz. mustard, cotton, millet and

sorghum seeds, which resulted in an exceptional

income of ` 585 Million from the sales.

For our shareholders, we had declared a Special

Dividend of ` 125 per Equity Share of ` 10 each

amounting to ` 5,618 Million as recommended by the

Board of Directors on November 30, 2021. Further, the

Board of Directors has recommended a final dividend

payment of ` 25/- per equity share of ` 10/- each for

the financial year ended March 31, 2022, which is

subject to shareholders’ approval.

As we look ahead, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I

take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation

to our Shareholders, Banks & Financial Institutions,

Employees, Distributors and Farmers for their support

and trust. I seek your continued support to grow and

progress our Company to even greater heights.

Best wishes,

Pankaj Patel

Chairman & Non-Executive Independent Director

For Bayer, it was ultimately a successful

year. We achieved our operational

objectives and pushed ahead diligently

our efficiency, scale-up of alternate

business models and new product

launches.

Bayer CropScience Limited

Annual Report 2021-22

12:

Dear Shareholders,

I hope each one of you is doing well and staying safe!

The agriculture sector today is as challenging and

as full of possibilities, as it can be. To a large extent,

the positive momentum is gaining ground because

of a strong impetus from the Government to create

a conducive Agri policy environment to help improve

smallholder farmers’ income.

Even the recent regulatory guidelines on gene editing

and deregulation of drones in agriculture are positive

steps forward that will advance the digitization and

mechanization of Indian agriculture. You are already

aware of our efforts in advancing drone applications

in India and making them accessible to smallholder

growers. We are pleased to share with you that, we will

be rolling out our drone commercial operations from

the Kharif season of 2022 across key states in India.

Another critical trend that is starting is the emergence,

especially in horticulture, of a more connected supply

chain linked to city clusters and for Agri exports, which

could also see the need for produce certification.

All these trends directly lead to the opportunity for

establishing crop-focused value chains that are able

to address the major pain points of smallholders of

accessing good quality inputs, agronomy knowledge

and labor shortage, driving mechanization with a

strong linkage to produce markets.

Hence, a major push towards collectivization through

Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and Agri

Entrepreneur-led last-mile farmer connect models

will accelerate this transformation with digital connect

being a key enabler across the entire chain. At the

organizational level, we are already working with more

than 1,500 FPOs and have over 75 food value chain

partnerships in place delivering value to nearly 500,000

smallholders across the country.

All these models will also help deliver on our

sustainability goals of improving water efficiency, soil

health and reduction of environmental emissions at

scale which is mission-critical in the context of climate

change. We are positive that our DirectAcres and

Sustainable Rice projects piloted across states will

be able to gain significant ground towards introducing

sustainable practices in agriculture.

I firmly believe we are moving to a decade that will see

significant growth in Indian agriculture. Having said

that, it’s important to factor in the dynamics of the world

around us. While we are still recovering from the major

impact of COVID-19 globally, the global supply chains

continue to be stressed and the current war waging

in Europe has compounded the issue. A number of

import-dependent countries around the world are likely

to face significant challenges to food security.

For us, in India, we need to manage through these

emerging challenges, especially for input availability

and the impact on globally connected supply chains

for the crop protection industry.

Added to this is the challenge of inflation despite the

strong efforts of the government to keep it in check.

As an industry, we will have to weather this storm with

prudence to meet the cultivation needs of millions

of smallholders of India and the food security of the

country. Which I am sure we will, especially after

successfully overcoming the enormous challenges of

COVID-19 over the last 2 years.

However, we have reasons to rejoice, we did deliver a

great result despite the ongoing challenges and your

support and trust in us went a long way in ensuring we

deliver sustainable performance year-on-year.

Best wishes,
