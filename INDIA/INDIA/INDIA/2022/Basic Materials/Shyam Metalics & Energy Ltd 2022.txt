Dear Shareholders,

2021-22

Annual Report

6:

Dear Shareholders,

China in 2021. The recovery was driven by an infrastructure

push as part of recovery programmes in many countries, and

investments related to the energy transition will likely drive

the construction sector’s growth for years to come.

The domestic steel industry, which grew between 5% to

7% on a year-on-year basis, is expected to play a bigger role

in enabling India to achieve the 5 trillion economy target

by 2025. We anticipate that the recent government policy

announcements about railways, roads, civil aviation, gas

pipelines for affordable housing, and increased budgetary

allocation to this sector would support a relatively solid

demand recovery and drive the need for iron & steel products.

Different positioning

At Shyam Metalics, we are favourably placed to capitalise

on these emerging realities. We have, across the last four

decades demonstrated our ability to grow and in doing so

we remained EBITDA positive since commencement of our

operations in 2005; our revenue & profits (PBT) grew at a five-

year CAGR of 21.98% and 36.02% respectively; we had one

of the lowest gearing (0.09X Debt:Equity Ratio); received AA-

(Positive) Credit Rating from CRISIL & CARE for Long-term

Bank facilities and A1+ (Positive) for Short-term Bank facilities

from CRISIL & CARE; and thus we outperformed our industry

growth for differentiated – even contrarian – reasons.

•

We sourced our raw materials within a 250 km radius of

our operations and with long-term agreements.
