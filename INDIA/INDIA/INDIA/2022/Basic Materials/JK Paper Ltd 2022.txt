Controls.

• Controls over the validation, completeness, implementation

and usage of valuation models.

Independent reperformance:

• Our own valuation specialists independently challenged

management on the valuations where they were found outside

our expected range.

Methodology choice:

• In the context of observed industry practice, our own valuation

specialists assisted us in challenging the appropriateness of

significant models and methodologies used by an independent

valuer in calculating fair values, risk exposures, completeness of

risk factors, and in calculating Fair Value Assessments (FVAs).

opinion on the financial statements.

judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone
