Dalmia Bharat Limited:

Dear Stakeholders,

Today, in light of the global realignment of resources and supply

chains, our nation stands at the crossroads of ground-breaking

changes, economic and social, and we see this opening up new

opportunities for India and us. We are proud to partner our country

in furthering its rise through our strengthened growth aspirations

and consistent nation-building efforts. Alongside the execution

of our strategic growth plans, we continue to stay focused on our

journey towards sustainability and innovation and deliver consistent

and increased value to all our stakeholders.

Dalmia Bharat aims to realise its purpose and ambition to

nation-building and creating value through the strategic objectives

of becoming a global leader in sustainable cement production, by

decoupling the growth from GHG emissions, and to remain a top

quartile cement producer in the country. Our growth objectives are

well aligned with global and national development policies, where

we continue to play our unique role of a sector catalyst in the fight

against climate change.

At Dalmia Bharat, we firmly believe that having a positive economic,

social and environmental impact through our operations, helps in

creating sustainable long-term value.

We progressed further on strengthening our risk framework in

alignment with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures

(TCFD). We have also set-up an executive committee to monitor

and enhance the overall value creation to meet the growth,

sustainability and decarbonisation objectives, across the verticals in

the group.

Governance:

Dear Stakeholders,

The coordinated global response to the COVID-19

pandemic, powered by innovation and collaboration,

have catalysed many solutions to save lives and improve

the social infrastructure in FY22. Historically, such once-

in-a-lifetime exigencies have served as a mirror to the

role we play as members of society. The extraordinary

circumstances made it imperative for businesses to

focus on their commitment to people, communities and

towards sustainable growth. The world today is better

prepared to mitigate unknown risks, with businesses

playing a greater role in serving society through

innovation and collaboration in a more connected world.

The year in review

At Dalmia Bharat, this year brought several unique

experiences that presented immense scope for

learning. All through the successive COVID-19 waves,

we encountered new set of obstacles. But I am happy to

share that with our highly diligent and passionate team,

we performed well and ended the year with industry

leading volume and revenue growth, supplemented by

best-in-class cost management. Our company delivered

a healthy EBITDA margin of 21.5% owing to our efficient

and adaptable operating mode.

We have also progressed well on our commitments to

have 100% renewable energy by 2030 and complete

fossil fuel replacement by 2035. With a strong and

deeply embedded philosophy of ‘clean and green is

profitable and sustainable’, our solar, waste heat recovery

power generation capacity, along with green fuels

consumption increased significantly in FY22. This has led

to a reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission intensity by 9%

and 30% respectively, from FY19 base year. Our team’s

foresightedness, swift actions and relentless efforts

resulted in a broad-based revenue growth across every

area of our operations. We are happy to share that we

have also successfully expanded the installed cement

capacity by 17% to 35.9 MTPA. During the year, we also

actioned our commitment to the shareholders and

completed the divestment of our non-core businesses

(Refractory and Hippo Stores) and have also divested part

stake in IEX. We are on a clear path to eventually emerge

as a pure-play Pan India cement company.

2.

Other income

Other income primarily comprises of dividend income,

interest income, gain on sale and fair valuation of financial

instruments and others.

Other income has reduced by ₹26 crore to ₹155 crore

mainly attributed due to: (a) decrease in income on treasury

assets (bonds/ fixed deposits/ mutual funds) by ₹47 crore,

interest income accrued in last year of ₹6 crore on loan

given to non-related party and reversal of impairment

provision in value of investment of ₹3 crore. Reduction

is partly offset by higher dividend income of ₹14 crore,

write back of liabilities no longer required by ₹17 crore and

interest income of ₹3 crore on investment in NCDs received

as a part of consideration on sale of Hippo Stores.

3.

Cost of raw materials consumed

4.

Changes in inventories of finished goods,

work-in-progress and stock in trade

The increase in inventories of finished goods and work-

in-progress in current year as compared to decrease in

previous year, was mainly due to increase in closing stock

quantity and the fuel impact on closing stock.

5.

Employee benefits expenses

The employee cost increased by 13% in FY22 mainly due

to increment in the annual salaries, which was in line

with the industry, fully operations of MIL cement plant

at Maharashtra and commissioning of new grinding units

in East region during the year, introduction of voluntary

separation scheme for all eligible employees/workers at

Dalmia DSP and further grant of 1,52,640 ESOP to eligible

employees during the year.

6.

Power and fuel cost

Power and fuel costs of the Group have increased by 44%

from ₹801/T in FY 2020-21 to ₹1,157/T in FY22 due to

increased prices of coal and pet coke during the year.

Power and fuel costs accounted for 22.8% of revenue in

FY22 as against 16.4% in the previous year.

7.

Cement despatches increased by 8.8% as compared to

Freight charges on finished goods accounted for 18.2% of

revenues in FY22 as against 18.0% in FY21.

8.

Finance costs

Finance cost has decreased by ₹101 crore to ₹202 crore

mainly due to repayment of borrowings of ₹586 crore

during the year, and lower weighted average cost of total

borrowings from 6.7% p.a. to 5.6% p.a. either on account

of refinancing of term loans or other measures taken to

reduce the interest cost during the year.

Managing Director, Clearing Agent and its business head for committing various offences under Indian

Penal Code and further, Trial Court has already taken cognizance of the matter.

EOW filed supplementary charge sheet on November 9, 2021, wherein EOW confirmed that the stolen securities became free from collateral

and the same are liable to be released back to DCBL on the ground that ISSL already settled trades out of funds of Allied. Consequently, ISSL

does not have any claim/right over the stolen securities. The matter is pending consideration on framing of charges before Trial Court.

Further, Serious Fraud Investigation Office, New Delhi, (“SFIO”) after conducting its own investigation, has filed its interim investigation

report dated August 26, 2021. Pursuant to said report, SFIO has filed Petition on December 2, 2021 before NCLT, Mumbai seeking freezing

of assets of various officials of ISSL involved in conspiracy with Allied.

Pursuant to order dated March 16, 2021 passed by Hon’ble Supreme Court, the Securities were released to DCBL upon furnishing bank

guarantee of ` 344 before Trial Court. The Securities were later redeemed by DCBL during the financial year 2021-22. Further, Hon’ble

Supreme Court vide its order dated April 11, 2022 has modified its earlier order permitting DCBL to replace its existing bank guarantee of

` 344 with fresh bank guarantee of ` 100 and corporate guarantee of ` 300.

The Group is fully confident that there will be no loss to DCBL and hence, no provision is considered necessary in these financial statements.
