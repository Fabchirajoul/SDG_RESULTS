Dear Shareholders,

FY22 began with a deadly hold of the pandemic,

making it feel like we were still trapped in the middle

of a year that started several months ago. But as is

the nature of challenges, they invariably push people

and societies to adapt and evolve. The exigencies of

the pandemic freed thinking from its conventional

shackles and pushed the boundaries of innovation.

But these changes did not take place in a vacuum.

Without the resilient presence of frontline workers

across sectors, such innovation would not hold ground.

The convergence of the new with the old was a key

element in our collective quest to emerge stronger

from the pandemic. Even though, the near-term global

outlook remains uncertain, the promise of this decade

still holds.

The global economic backdrop

Global economies recovered from the pandemic

shock in 2022 on the back of supportive fiscal and

monetary policies and mass vaccination programmes.

However, at the end of FY22, the war in Ukraine

and the subsequent economic sanctions on Russia

posed a large shock. It disrupted energy markets

and supply chains and added to the already evolving

inflationary pressures and concerns over consumer

demand. Consequently, growth forecasts have been

slashed. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) now

expects the world economy to grow by 3.6% in CY22,

that is 0.8 percentage points slower than its pre-

war projections.

Many economies have experienced a sharp surge in

inflation recently, particularly in food and fuel prices,

taking their inflation rates well beyond the targets of

central banks. Taking cognizance of the rapid pick-up

in inflationary momentum, interest rates have been

hiked and are poised to go up further. The pace of

rate hikes is turning out to be quite swift as monetary

authorities attempt to catch up with the rising inflation

from their ultra-accommodative stance during

the pandemic.

As the stance of monetary policy shifts, there is

greater turbulence in currency markets. The dollar has

been strengthening, while emerging economies have

witnessed downward pressure on their currencies. At

the same time, energy and commodity markets have

witnessed heightened volatility. Global supply chain

disruptions due to pandemic induced lock downs have

been replaced by new disruptions due to the war in

Ukraine and the economic sanctions.

While the global economic backdrop is challenging

there are reasons to remain optimistic. First, despite

the slowdown, IMF’s projection of world GDP growth

in CY22 is still tracking the pre-pandemic average

during 2010s. Second, fiscal support in developed

economies remains above the pre-pandemic trend,

even if somewhat diluted versus past years. Third,

mega-trends around sustainability, green investments,

digitization, and disintermediation remain well-

entrenched and will support growth and productivity

enhancement in the medium-term.

Thus, while businesses will need to remain on guard

regarding financial market volatility and cost pressures

this year, one could expect the medium-term growth

recovery to remain on track.

A new and stronger India

Despite the global macro-economic challenges, I

believe, in India we are at the cusp of an extraordinary

decade. With the roll out of economic reforms as

profound as those introduced in 1991, a new generation

of Indian entrepreneurs are embarking on audacious

journeys. With the twin-balance sheet problem of

stressed loans and over-leveraged corporates behind

us, the coming decade will see an upsurge in capital

expenditure across several sectors. The private sector

is on the pathway of what I like to call, the ‘double-

engine growth’, riding high on both the conventional

and the new economy. Investors are excited about

growth prospects in core sectors as well as sunrise

sectors. However, in my view, the word sunrise sector

virtually applies to the entire landscape in India,

including conventional sectors like cement, steel,

power, and auto, along with emerging areas like digital

and renewables. Both hold the promise of high and

sustained growth.

Innovation to shape the ideas of tomorrow:

Dear Shareholders,

With recurring waves of COVID-19, the fiscal year 2022

tested the resilience and agility of the country. The

deadly Delta wave and the sharp shock of Omicron

variant challenged the new normal. However, fast

tracking of large-scale vaccination drives, sustained

fiscal and monetary support, and a better adapted

ecosystem kept the economy on track, albeit with

some speed bumps. India is poised to be the fastest

growing major economy for the next couple of years

according to projections made by the International

Monetary Fund (IMF). Before we move forward,

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the

medical fraternity for making this recovery a possibility.

Reviewing FY22

Employee safety being the topmost priority at CTIL,

we focused on vaccination of all our employees. With

the learning of past waves of pandemic in place, our

responses were more nuanced and calibrated, enabling

us to minimise impact on our operations. Our key

focus was to increase our operational efficiency and

implement robust capital management programs to

conserve our strong cash position.

We saw broad-based recovery across all three business

segments and closed the year with a revenue of `4,068

crore up by 58.5% as compared to `2,567 crore in FY21.

Our EBITDA grew by 93.8% to `498 crore in FY22

from `257 crore in FY21. Our PAT stood at `162 crore in

FY22 as compared to the negative PAT of `34 crore in

FY21. We made exceptional rebound considering the

backdrop of demanding operating environment, which

included navigating supply chain challenges, volatile

raw material prices and complying with multiple

COVID-19 restrictions. As the COVID-19 moves to

become an endemic, it’s time to harness the learnings

of the last two years to further fast-track recovery.

BIRLA CENTURY

After the lull of last year, we saw a strong revival in

demand reflected in a capacity utilisation of 91% for FY22.

Revenues were `1,037 crore in FY22 as compared to `582

crore in FY21 and `735 crore in FY20. This was driven by

a strong product mix and well-diversified demand across

the geographies. Our EBITDA was `29 crore in FY22 as

compared to the negative `48 crore in FY21. Our EBITDA

was impacted marginally by extreme price inflation seen

in cotton prices during the year, combined with increase

in power cost, even though we were able to partially pass

on the cost increase to the consumers. During the year,

we further raised our benchmark performance at STeP

(Sustainable Textile Production audit), which was already

amongst the best in industry, to 88%.

BIRLA ESTATES

The positive market sentiment indicates that it is on an

upcycle and the same is reflected in our performance.

Our booking value grew by 208% to `1,913 crore in FY22

driven by new launches. During the year we launched

Birla Tisya in Bengaluru, which received stellar market

response, creating a benchmark with `250 crore worth

booking in just the first four days. Our flagship project,

Birla Niyaara in Worli, Mumbai was also launched this

year through an exclusive red-carpet event with a unique

and innovative show of 300 drones lighting up the night

sky. The property was successful in attracting buyers,

receiving bookings worth `1,200+ crore within just a few

days of the launch.

CENTURY PULP & PAPER

The business reached the pre-covid level despite multiple

restrictions being in place in application industry for larger

part of the year. The production capacity was fully utilised

with average capacity utilisation at 99%, to meet consumer

demand. We clocked a revenue of `2,818 crore in FY22 as

compared to the `1,774 crore in FY21, marking a substantial

growth of 58.8%. EBITDA also saw a strong growth of

91.9%, growing to `424 crore in FY22 as compared to the

`221 crore in FY21. Efforts to re-align the product mix and

increase efficiencies enabled robust performance, partially

mitigating the impact of increasing raw material cost. We

also took multiple efforts to manage the volatility in the

inputs cost, including usage of substitute inputs, inventory

management, and induction of new supply partners in

addition to re-negotiations with the existing suppliers.

TAKING THE LEGACY FORWARD

2022 marks the 125th year of CTIL’s exciting journey.

During this time, it has seen its fair share of economic

challenges and achievements, all of which have been

A key marker of our success is most definitely the way

in which you have always reposed faith in CTIL. I would

and expectations which provide us the strength to

move forward with added vigour. I would also like to

take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude

40 RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURE (Continued):

Letter of Credit and/or insurance cover on export outstanding

is also taken. Generally deposits are taken from domestic debtors. Apart from deposit there is a

commission agent area wise. In case any customer defaults the amount is first recovered from

deposits, then from the agent’s commission. Each outstanding customer receivables are regularly

monitored and if outstanding is above due date the further shipments are controlled and can only

be released if there is a proper justification. The carrying amount and fair value of security deposit

amounts to ` 53.11 Crores (31 March 2021: ` 48.00 Crores) as it is payable on demand.

The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its

customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent

markets and their credit worthiness are monitored at periodical intervals. The maximum exposure to

credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.

The Company has recognised loss allowance provision on trade receivables amounting to ` 1.60 Crs

during the year (31 March 2021 ` 3.31 Crs) as there was no reasonable expectations of recovery and

were outstanding for more than 360 days from becoming due.
