Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to share with you the stellar performance of your

Company in the year 2021-22. It is a matter of pride that this

was possible despite being another year flled with challenges

due to geo political turmoil and economic uncertainty.

Russia- Ukraine war created a massive set of challenges ranging

from supply chain disruption to steep escalation in commodity

and food prices. Post COVID recovery has been hampered by

unprecedented global infation. Central banks across the world

have been tightening monetary policy to combat the menace

of infation while trying to avoid recession.

During these uncertain times, India has continued its journey

towards becoming one of the fastest growing economies in the

world. The Government of India under the visionary leadership

of Prime Minister has shown tremendous faith in the Indian

entrepreneurship. Initiatives like Ease of doing business and PLI

schemes have encouraged fresh investments and capacity

building.

Our twin goals of maximising shareholders’ value and customer

satisfaction have propelled us to the position of leadership in

our business. Our acquisition of United Seamless Tubulaar Pvt.

Limited has become EPS accretive this year and we expect

continued growth in coming years.:

Dear shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to state that your Company has

declared fnancial results which is quite satisfactory in view of

global recession due to COVID and tense geo-political situation

in Russia-Ukraine and China-Taiwan and other issues elsewhere.

This has been possible due to the hard work put in by the

management and staf of the Company supported by other

stakeholders of the Company.

We believe in merit and progress through sincerity and honesty,

we do not believe in corrupt practices and low character work.

This philosophy has made us market leader today after more

than three decades of operation. We have grown through our

dedication towards our Company and the industry, we value

progress and happiness for our people and the society at large.

MSL continues to add value through consolidation and relevant

acquisitions, the merger of USTPL which is planned this year is a

step in this direction.

This will save us on our tax expense and give us operational

synergy to cut costs and become more competitive in our

industry.
