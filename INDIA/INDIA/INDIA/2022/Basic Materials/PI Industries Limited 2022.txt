Dear Shareholders,

In my last: letter, which coincided with your

Company’s 75th anniversary year, I emphasised

about the world needing a healthier planet.

While envisioning our journey for the next

75 years, we chose to refresh our guiding

lights to embed environmental and societal

responsibilities much deeper in PI’s DNA. An

organisation-wide rethink involving our Board,

leadership and the entire PI family culminated

into a new doctrine, PI Compass, one that

leads us now into a promising and exciting

future. With middle class cohort growing at

a much faster clip than the world population,

consequent consumption growth would need

to be met in a sustainable manner. Considering

finiteness of resources, the environmental

efficacy of technological advances becomes as

paramount as is its pace. More so in the light of

ecological, nutritional and social discernment

of today’s consumers.

PI being a responsible corporate citizen, we

have chosen to rise to the occasion. Making

sustainability central to our business, we

have adopted an inspiring new purpose –

Reimagining a healthier planet. Dedicating

our Annual Report 2021-22 to this new

purpose, we are fast recalibrating our

business priority and goals with a firm

resolve to make PI, as one of the most

sustainable and responsible companies in

the global specialty chemicals landscape.

At PI, we have been a pioneer in implementing

new technologies with a digital mind-

set and continually innovating processes

for efficiency, effectiveness, and speedy

scale with a strong focus on innovation.

Adherence to world class industry standards

for manufacturing enables us to lead the

development of chemistries that make India

proud.

We will harness cutting edge science and

technology while remaining ESG anchored.

Our fundamental action is to be green.

Adopting ESG as a way of life, we are making it

the omnipresent PI agenda – of everyone and

at every step of our operations. Our drive to

bring about the cumulative shift in mindset –

towards embracing and practicing ESG on a

day to day basis is progressing well. I am sure

its business benefits would become visible in

the coming years.

Our new vision – Lead with science,

technology and human ingenuity to create

transformative solutions in life sciences

– has attracted one of the most talented

employee pools. We want to enthuse our

employees and the broader community

to live and strive towards our purpose. On

behalf of our Board and leadership teams, I

wish you and your families’ peace, harmony

and progress. Let’s come together to add

force to our new purpose. Let’s reimagine a

healthier planet!

Dear Shareholders,

PI being a science and tech

driven

Company,

we

have

an enviable track record in

partnering global innovators for

well over seven decades. At the

same time, PI enjoys the trust of

millions of farmers across India.

Our evolution has always kept pace

with the fast changing world. A finer

alignment of our own aspirations with the

shifting human needs and preferences

led us to our newly adopted purpose –

Reimagining a healthier planet.

Consolidated Performance

Having started under the shadow of

severe Covid second wave and ended

under the cloud of Russia-Ukraine

conflict, FY 2021-22 tested our agility,

resilience and ingenuity. At PI, we

weathered supply chain disruptions,

rising input cost and unfavourable

climatic conditions to deliver a robust

financial performance in line with our

guidance made much earlier than the

commencement of the year.

A resounding FY 2020-21 performance

(~35% and ~39% growth in exports

and domestic businesses respectively)

had meant a higher base for FY 2021-

22. On a higher base and in spite of

aforementioned

constraints

in

our

operating environment, PI delivered

revenue, EBITDA and net profit growth of

16%, 13% and 14% respectively. Revenue

growth was powered by price increase

and volume growth, both. Exports

revenue grew by 20% while domestic

revenues recorded a 4% growth.

PI countered cost pressure with a

favourable product mix and prudent price

increase. We improved our gross margin

by 103 bps and maintained our EBITDA

margins of around 22%. The Company’s

cash generation from operations before

tax stood at ~` 7,038 million.

organisation.

Item No. 12

The shareholders at the 72nd Annual General Meeting held on 9th September, 2019 had approved the payment of remuneration by way of

commission to Non-Executive Directors of the Company not exceeding one per cent of the net profits of the Company for the relevant financial

year. In line with the Remuneration Policy of the Company, the compensation to the Non-Executive Directors takes the form of commission on

profits. Though shareholders have approved payment of commission up to one per cent of net profits of the Company for each year, the actual

commission paid to the Directors is restricted to a fixed sum within the above limit. This sum is reviewed at the end of financial year after taking into

consideration various factors such as business/ financial performance of the Company, activities handled /supervised, time spent for attending to

the affairs and business of the Company, extent of responsibilities shouldered by each Director and evaluation of performance made by the Board.

Keeping in view all these factors, a considerable amount of time has been spent by Mr. Narayan K. Seshadri in strategic meetings held during the

year, evaluating various M&A opportunities, reviewing the business with leadership team, mentoring the leadership team, member of Steering

committees, Nomination and Remuneration Committee, Risk Management Committee apart from being the Chairperson of the Audit Committee

as well as the Board, the duties and responsibilities of Mr. Seshadri have increased manifold. Accordingly, a higher amount of commission has been

proposed for Mr. Narayan K. Seshadri, Chairperson for devoting his valuable time to the organisation. Accordingly, the Board of Directors on the

recommendation(s) of Nomination and Remuneration Committee has approved a higher amount of commission to him in the capacity of Non-

Executive Chairperson as compared to other Non-Executive Directors.

Under his chairmanship, the Company revenues have grown from Rs.23,087 Mn. to Rs.50,769 Mn. in a span of 5 years. Pursuant to Regulation

17(6)(ca) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, the approval of shareholders by special resolution is required

to be obtained every year, in which the annual remuneration payable to a single Non-Executive Director exceeds fifty per cent of the total annual

remuneration payable to all Non-Executive Directors.

Since, the commission amount payable to Mr. Narayan K. Seshadri exceeds fifty per cent of the total remuneration payable to all Non-Executive

Directors for the year ended March 31, 2022, approval of the shareholders is sought by way of special resolution.

In light of the role that he is expected to play, the Board believes that the remuneration payable to Mr. Narayan K. Seshadri commensurate with

the efforts and the time spent by him on behalf of the Company. Accordingly, the Board has recommended remuneration payable to Mr. Narayan

K. Seshadri for the year ended March 31, 2022 in excess of fifty per cent of the total annual remuneration payable to all Non-Executive Directors of

the Company and accordingly recommends passing of resolution at item No. 12 for approval of the shareholders as a special resolution.

Except Mr. Narayan K. Seshadri none of the Directors, Key Managerial Personnel of the Company and their relatives is in any way concerned or

interested financial or otherwise, in the said resolution.
