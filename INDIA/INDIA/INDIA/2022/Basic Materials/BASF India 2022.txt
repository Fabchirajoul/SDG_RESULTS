Managing Director

Dear Members,

At the outset, I express my sincere gratitude for your support and confidence over the last years where

we have successfully charted the path towards profitable growth. It is with immense pride that I report

the all-time record high sales and profits achieved by your Company in the financial year 2021-22. Topline

growth achieved through strong volume growth and higher price realizations coupled with agile margin

management, prudent fixed cost and working capital management were the fundamental levers driving

the success of your Company. You may be pleased to note that your Company ended the year with

zero debt and is well positioned to leverage on its strengths in the coming years. Several unexpected

challenges faced over the course of the year significantly amplifies the importance of these achievements.

Our teams have demonstrated tremendous resilience during turbulent crisis times to deliver the extra-

ordinary results that we have witnessed during the year. I humbly salute and thank each and every

member of the BASF family for their invaluable contributions towards an outstanding year.

The Indian economy registered a smart recovery during the FY 2021-22 by registering a GDP growth

of 8.7%, as per World Bank estimates, after a contraction of 7.3% witnessed in the preceding year.

Despite erratic schedule and uneven geographical spread of the monsoon impacting agricultural activity

in several parts of the country, this important segment which contributes a fifth to India’s GDP grew by

3.95% in the reporting year. Industrial activity registered a sharp rebound in the year growing by 11.8%

with robust growth in the automotive, construction and consumer durables segments. Your Company

outperformed the market in every segment to register revenue from operations of Rs.130,997.3 million,

a growth of 37% Y-o-Y. Keeping our customers as our top-most priority and delivering high quality

products & services on a sustained basis, your Company recorded significant growth in volumes and

price realizations in every quarter of the financial year 2021-22 in comparison to prior year.

Excluding exceptional items, Profit before tax grew by 71% to Rs. 7,473.6 million against

Rs. 4,378.7 million in the previous year. Higher asset utilization, a strong focus on margin improvement

and fixed cost discipline set the foundation for this significant improvement in the overall earnings of

your Company. Additionally, effective planning and management enabled reduce the working capital

requirements to 8.3% of revenue from 8.8% in the previous year. The significant increase in earnings

and prudent capital management enabled increase the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) to a record

high of 35.8%. Your Company also ended FY 2021-22 with zero debt, a significant achievement given the

overall macroeconomic scenario. Based on the improved financial performance, the Board of Directors

of your Company have recommended a dividend of Rs. 6/- per equity share i.e. 60% for FY 2021-22.

Your Company continues to invest in its competencies to meet the growing demands of its customers.

Capacity expansion projects executed in the field of Cellasto® and Dispersions will enable meet the

growing demand from automotive, construction, paint and paper industries. Your Company continues to

launch new products and solutions across our segments. I am pleased to inform you about the launch

of our first Herbicide for the Sugarcane market and a new insecticide targeting multiple crops for the

upcoming season. New products and solutions from the engineering plastics and polyurethane portfolio

targeting the automotive, consumer appliances, construction and footwear industry are being developed

through co-creation activities with our customers. Novel ingredients and formulations developed at our

innovation centers form the basis of our growth in the Nutrition and Care segment.

As I write this message to you, I cannot help but reflect on the fact that this is third consecutive year

that we live under the shadow of COVID. As was the case in the past two years the number of cases

is rising across the country and near-term uncertainty is a matter of concern for the Company and all

its stakeholders. Thankfully, unlike the Delta variant that severely impacted the nation as well as your

Company with high severity infections and unfortunate fatalities during the first quarter of FY 2021-22, the

Omicron variant, though highly transmissible, has resulted in significantly lower cases of severe infections.

Your Company provided vaccination to all employees and contract staff including their families which

contributed to their wellbeing and enabled them to operate seamlessly through these challenging times.

As reported earlier your Company concentrated its CSR activities towards COVID relief activities during

the FY 2021-22 contributing through our Chemistry by donating oxygen generating molecular sieves

which was a dire need during the Delta wave. We also donated diagnostic and life-saving equipment such

as ventilators & oxygen plants to hospitals in the vicinity of our stake holder communities. Additionally,

we continued to engage our neighboring communities with our well-established programs in the areas of

sanitation, water, hygiene and education.

We are currently in times of high business uncertainty. While COVID is still prevalent, geo-political

tensions with the war in Ukraine, persisting supply chain challenges, global inflationary pressures and

rising interest rates casting a shadow on demand development are major factors that will influence our

business in the coming year. The resilience of our team and the mitigation measures developed to deal

with the uncertainties and challenges give me the confidence that we are well positioned to continue to

perform well even in these uncertain times. I thank you once again for your support and confidence and

look forward to continuing our path of Sustainable and Profitable Growth.

Stay safe and take care,

With Best Wishes
