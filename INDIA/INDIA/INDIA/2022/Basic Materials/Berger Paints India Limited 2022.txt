Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great

pleasure to present our

accomplishments in

FY 2021-22. It has been

a year of good progress,

a year that seemingly

began with challenges

but, ended with

considerable success –

all of which I attribute

to our team’s diligent

efforts.

Passion is very

important, and the team

at Berger Paints India

has always been very

passionate about their

work and growth. We

aim to grow higher and

higher!

Abhijit Roy

We have retained our position as the

market leader in protective coating

segment. Announcements on signi cant

infrastructure spending in the Union

Budget 2022-23 have also opened newer

avenues of growth for our business.

Additionally, the government’s focus

on ‘Make in India’ is expected to add

impetus to the protective coating and

paint segment. We are, therefore,

optimistic about capitalising on emerging

opportunities and further establishing

our reputation.

We also continue to pioneer innovative

ways to  nd exceptional solutions for our

consumers. In line with this, we launched

an array of new products in the decorative

segment to meet the diverse needs of our

customers. One such product is ‘Weather

Coat Long Life Flexo’, high performance

exterior paint with elastomeric properties

that help cover hairline cracks on the

exterior walls and has silicon additives

which help protect from heavy rains.

It comes with an 8 years’ performance
