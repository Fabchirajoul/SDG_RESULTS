Letter

Bajaj Auto Limited l 15th Annual Report 2021-22

10

l

Profit after tax (PAT) recorded a growth of 10.2% to H 5,019 crore. This was your Company’s second

highest PAT.

l

Surplus cash and cash equivalent as on 31 March 2022 increased by 7.9% to H 19,090 crore after

a dividend pay-out of H 4,051 crore in FY2022.

One more kudo is in order. That has to do with your Company’s outstanding export performance. This is

not new, but FY2022 was special. First, we crossed the export milestone of 2.5 million vehicles. Second,

motorcycle exports touched new highs – at almost 2.2 million units, showing a growth of 22% over

FY2021. Third, in 10 of the 12 months, your Company exported over 200,000 units. And fourth, exports

accounted for 52.7% of net sales — something that we have never witnessed before. Bajaj Auto is truly

The World’s Favourite Indian.

I believe that your Company’s: Managing Director, Shri Rajiv Bajaj, his entire team and each and every

employee deserve congratulations for such results.

Having rightly applauded the management, I should also share with you a short term concern. There is

no doubt in my mind — nor should it be in yours — that Bajaj Auto has a complete suite of profitable

two-and three-wheelers that can significantly increase the domestic and international market shares

and earn higher sales, revenues and profits. However, in all my years as a fiduciary of your Company,

I have never seen it face such a global supply constraint that it has in terms of the sheer scarcity of

semiconductors. No modern automobile can exist without a slew of semiconductor chips. Motorcycles

and top-of-the-line electric vehicles like the Chetak are no exceptions. It is difficult to predict when this

supply scarcity will end. But till then, this will constrain your Company’s production volumes, as it will

for all other automobile manufacturers.

That said, I have no doubt whatsoever about the medium-and long-term view of your Company. It is

a great enterprise in excellent hands — and forever capable of delighting customers, employees and

shareholders alike. Which is why it is Hamara Bajaj!

With my best wishes,

letter from the management is sent to all shareholders of the Company.

letter, Management Discussion and Analysis, Corporate Governance and Directors’ Report, but does not include the

standalone financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and in

doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge

obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude

that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in

this regard.

Responsibilities of Management for the standalone financial statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of

these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other

comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally

accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting

records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting

frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates

that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that

were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and

presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether

due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a

going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless

Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable

assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a

material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in

the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone

financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the

audit. We also:

l

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,

design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to

provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one

resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of

internal control.

l

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the

circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company

Managing Director who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Core Management Committee examines

performance both from a product as well as from a geographical perspective and has identified two operative reportable

segments from which significant risks and rewards are derived viz. Automotive business and Investments.

20 Fair value measurement

The Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each Balance Sheet date. Fair value is the

price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at

the measurement date.

The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes

place either:

l

In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

l

In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the

asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their best economic interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits

by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest

and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to

measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair

value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

l

Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

l

Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly

or indirectly observable

l

Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is

unobservable.

The Company has set policies and procedures for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurement of financial assets,

which includes valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.

For fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities based on the nature, characteristics and

risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes.

l

Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions (note 1 clause 1)

l

Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy (note 32)

l

Investment properties (note 3)

l

Financial instruments (including those carried at amortised cost) (note 32)
