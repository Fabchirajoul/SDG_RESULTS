Integrated Report 2021-22

Lemon Tree Hotels Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to present to you

the first Integrated Report of Lemon Tree

Hotels (LTH). In an effort to be future-ready,

we have been building on a key strategic

aspect of our company – our ESG approach.

Sustainable management of resources as well

as transparent and responsible management

processes are crucial for the success of

businesses in the future. We have already

made a great beginning and are happy to

share our progress in FY22 with you through

this Integrated Report.

Our agility in making the best of a

difficult situation led to a recovery

of some of our fixed costs through

these bulk bookings.

As we emerge out of two difficult

years, our focus remains firmly on

variablising our fixed costs together

with a recovery in occupancy and

in ARR, so that we can run a leaner

and more agile operating model.

During the year, we successfully

turned the corner as revenue

from operations increased by

60% from ` 251.7 crore for FY21

to ` 402.2 crore for FY22. This

revenue recovery was driven by a

growth in ARR, which increased by

32.2% YoY. Our strategy of going

asset-light i.e. managed/franchised/

manchised hotels has served us well

and this year our total revenue from

managed hotels increased by 128%

from ` 7.7 crore in FY21 to ` 17.6

crore in FY22. Over the next few

years, we will continue to focus on

expanding our presence across India

and addressing demand across the

upper upscale, upscale, midscale

and economy segments - through

our portfolio of seven brands.

Boosting growth through expansion, variabilized costs and

a lean operating model

This year had its fair share of

reversals and new beginnings.

With a comprehensive vaccination

program me and the dwindling

impact of COVID waves, we saw

a revival in destination weddings,

staycations and to some extent in

Meeting, Incentives, Conferences

and Exhibitions (MICE) demand.

Corporate travel is being redefined

and will build back to a new level of

demand in FY23 and beyond. LTH

now focuses on the retail segment

i.e. those who book directly (and not

through a company or travel agent)

based on a few important criteria,

including location, hygiene and

safety, pricing and more.

During the 2nd wave in Q1 FY22,

demand for hotel rooms came

to a sharp halt. We sought

alternate demand and functioned

as a surrogate medicare facility

through our tie-ups with hospitals

and with corporates to cater to

quarantine requirements for mild

and asymptomatic cases. Such

arrangements also helped the

nation tide over the oxygen crisis,

particularly in cities with very

high caseloads.

Corporate Insight

Integrated Report 2021-22:

Managing Director

32.2%

YoY improvement in ARR

leading to higher flow

through to EBITDA

With occupancy expected

to return to pre-COVID

levels of 70%+ by mid

FY23 and with rapid

expansion underway

in the industry, we are

now at the cusp of the

next upward cycle. The

increasing traction in

corporate travel will

benefit us to a great

extent. We expect to

deliver strong growth in

revenue and a significant

net EBITDA margin

expansion on the back of

improved ARRs, higher

occupancy and favourable

cost dynamics.”

Integrated Report 2021-22

Lemon Tree Hotels Limited:

Managing Director, Senior

Vice President-Sustainability &

ESG and Senior Vice President-

Human Resources.

We have addressed large forums

of industry leaders, emerging

leaders, students, companies from

various sectors including hospitality,

retail, ecommerce, IT/ITES, BFSI,

pharma, manufacturing, education

and skilling, etc. The best practice

sharing typically includes why any

organization should adopt inclusion,

what business benefits does diversity

offer, a dialogue around the seven-

pillar model and more. Some

companies have done 2-3 rounds of

discussions including a familiarization

visit to a Lemon Tree hotel and

then gone ahead and started hiring

persons with disability.

Another impactful activity has been

the engagement we have had with

organizations in different parts of the

world including:

• Glasgow, Scotland with a

university under the UK India

Educational Research Initiative:

This sharing has been on since

2016 and is focussed on training/

hiring people with Down Syndrome

KNOWLEDGE SHARING WITH INDUSTRY

IN INDIA AND ABROAD

Target 8.5

By 2030, achieve full and

productive employment and decent

work for all women and men,

including for young people and

persons with disabilities, and equal

pay for work of equal value

• Singapore with a leading hotel

chain and a large regional player

in banking: This was around

inclusion best practice sharing

and understanding of industry

practice. Lemon Tree also gave

the Keynote Address at an HR

leaders conference

• Switzerland with the International

Labor Organization (ILO): This

was a round table discussion

regarding sensitization, training,

awareness building around hiring

persons with disability (PwD).

• Globally, with the World Travel

& Tourism Council (WTTC): We

shared our diversity best practices

at a global event and won the

Tourism For Tomorrow Award for

people practices.

Lemon Tree has emerged as a leader

in diversity and inclusion as a result

of these extensive interactions with

both industry and academia in India

and across the world.

Talent Management

Our employees play a critical role

in driving our business growth and

strengthening the brand. Our talent

management focuses on employee

productivity and empowerment,

as well as nurturing and retention

RETAINING OUR

TALENT POOL

Our workforce turnover for the

FY22 was 54% for Men and 7%

for Women, marking a significant

reduction from the pre-COVID years,

of talent. As mentioned earlier in

this report, our employee growth

program identifies high-performing

employees i.e., Super High Achievers

(SHAs, typically top 5-10%) and

High-Potential Employees (Hi-Pots,

typically next 15-20%), who display

the attitude and competencies

to grow into leadership positions

over time. The program motivates

employees to perform well and give

their best at work.

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS

AND

SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.1 Basis of preparation

These financial statements are prepared in

accordance with Indian Accounting Standard (Ind

AS), and the provisions of the Companies Act ,2013

('the Act') (to the extent notified) The Ind AS

are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read

with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment

rules issued thereafter.

The consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on a going concern basis using historical

cost convention and on an accrual method of

accounting, except for certain financial assets

and liabilities which are measured at fair value/

amortised cost (refer note 39).

Accounting policies have been consistently applied

except where a newly issued accounting standard is

initially adopted or a revision to an existing account

standard required a change to the accounting

policy hitherto to in use.

The consolidated financial statements are

presented in Indian Rupees (INR) and all values

are rounded off to the nearest lakhs, expect where

otherwise indicated

2.2 Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise

the financial statements of the Company, its

subsidiaries, associates and limited liability

partnership (together referred as “The Group”) as

at March 31, 2022. The Group controls an investee

if and only if the Group has:

•

Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights

that give it the current ability to direct the

relevant activities of the investee)

•

Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from

its involvement with the investee, and

•

The ability to use its power over the investee

to affect its return

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority

of voting rights result in control. To support this

presumption and when the Group has less than

a majority of the voting or similar rights of an

investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and

circumstances in assessing whether it has power

over an investee, including:

•

The contractual arrangement with the other

vote holders of the investee

•

Rights arising from other contractual arrangements

•

The Group’s voting rights and potential

voting rights

•

The size of the group’s holding of voting

rights relative to the size and dispersion of

the holdings of the other voting rights holders

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls

an investee if facts and circumstances indicate

that there are changes to one or more of the three

elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary

begins when the Group obtains control over the

subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control

of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and

expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of

during the year are included in the consolidated

financial statements from the date the Group gains

control until the date the Group ceases to control

the subsidiary.

Consolidated financial statements are prepared

using uniform accounting policies for like

transactions and other events in similar

circumstances. If a member of the Group uses
