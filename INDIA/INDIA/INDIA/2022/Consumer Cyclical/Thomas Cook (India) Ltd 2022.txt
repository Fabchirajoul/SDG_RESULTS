Dear Shareholders,

As I sit down to write this message, I am filled

with three distinct emotions. Optimism,

Confidence and Satisfaction.

Optimism – because of the powerful

resurgence of the travel and tourism

economy post pandemic.

Confidence – inspired by our demonstrated

ability to stand and deliver under the most

trying circumstances.

Satisfaction – with the way we have,

transformed ourselves over the past two odd

years to emerge stronger and with reinforced

Customer Centricity as our priority.

While the pandemic brought the world to

a standstill, we chose action over inertia,

to use the downtime to pivot rapidly and

adapt - Reimagining and Reengineering each

of our businesses. This strategy, coupled

with our strong brands, passionate teams

brands, passionate teams, incessant drive

towards customer delight and significantly

strengthened and significantly strengthened

digital capabilities, is paying back richly.

Our reimagined “New” enterprise is now

more resilient and better prepared for the

exciting future ahead. As an organisation,

we will focus on delivering the needs of the

customer and are upholding “customer focus

& centricity” to achieve this goal.

MACRO-ECONOMIC SCENARIO

The global economy started with a rebound in CY 2021, on the

trail of effective vaccination drives across the world & support

from central banks to their economies. However, the second wave

proved challenging, dampening sentiments towards Q2 CY 2021.

Despite this setback, the year witnessed a growth of 6.1% (albeit

from a lower base), against a 3.1% de-growth in CY 2020 (Source:

International Monetary Fund).

In India, FY22 witnessed continued revival, even as the effect

of the second wave posed downside risks. The acclaimed

mega-scale vaccination drive accelerated recovery, together with

favourable government policies and programs that sustained

economic activity. These measures enabled an 8.7% GDP growth

in FY22. (Source: International Monetary Fund).

As far as the global Travel & Tourism industry is concerned, the

post pandemic rebound is evident. According to the World Travel

and Tourism Council (WTTC), the global travel and tourism sectors

are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023 and grow

at a rate that will outpace global gross domestic product (GDP)

growth. The industry is projected to post an annual average

growth rate of 5.8% from 2022 to 2032, and create 126 million

new jobs. Clearly, pent-up demand and the desire to break free

after lockdown restrictions are triggering a carpe diem reaction -

as more people travel and yearn to travel for enjoyment and work

than ever before.

From an India standpoint, the travel market is projected to reach

$125 billion by FY27. India’s tourism industry in 2020 accounted

for 31.8 million jobs, which is likely to grow to 53 million jobs by

2029 and international tourist arrivals are expected to touch 30.5

billion by 2028 (Source: FICCI). Over the next decade, India’s travel

and tourism’s GDP is expected to grow at an average of 7.8%

every year. India’s steady economic growth has already made

Indians one of the most ubiquitous travelers in the world and that

trend is gathering momentum as the world opens up once again.

DEI Holdings Ltd

Traction in key geographies, new partnerships, with strong

renewals of existing contracts, led to income from operations

growing by 177% y-o-y. The business also reported positive

EBIT in Q4 FY22.

Financial Services

Strong growth in FY22 in Foreign Exchange with 60% y-o-y

growth in turnover. Exiting the year, the segment reported

recoveries of 56% in Q4 FY22 compared to pre-pandemic

levels across retail, corporate and wholesale segments. The

corresponding recovery in Q1FY23 stood at 66%, showcasing a

progressive improvement in outlook.

Travel Segments

Corporate Travel

In FY22 reported 4.4x growth in turnover Vs. FY21. During

the last quarter of FY22, the segment saw a recovery of 46%

compared to pre-pandemic levels with an even higher recovery

of 87% in Q1FY23.

Leisure Holidays

Recovery from the pre-pandemic levels in the domestic

business was trending at 63% in the last quarter of the year and

this improved to 78% in Q1FY23. International travel, due to its

limited opening at the end of the year, witnessed a constrained

uptick. FY22 sales in domestic and international increased by

3.7x and 1.9x from FY21.

MICE

Led by the impact of lockdown and resurgence of Covid-19

variants, there was limited MICE related activity across

industries, which resulted in a low recovery in the segment

during the year. However, the segment is incrementally growing

as engagement needs and interactions bounce back with rigour.

At the end of Q1FY23, the MICE business reported a recovery of

44% compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Destination Management Specialists

3.8x y-o-y increase in sales in FY22 led by improvement in

select DMS entities; Desert Adventures and Private Safaris

(East Africa) reported strong growth in sales as well as positive

contribution to EBT. We have witnessed a slow recovery in

Private Safaris (South Africa), Asian Trails and TCI.

“There’s an innate optimism around the

powerful resurgence of resurgence of

travel & tourism post pandemic.”

FY22 & BEYOND: CLEAR SIGNS OF STRONG

RECOVERY & GROWTH

During the year, we grew our income from operations by 138%

to touch INR 18,882 mn and nearly halved our operating level

losses. We turned in an operating profit of INR 239 million in Q4

FY22, signaling sequential profit recovery going forward too.

Foreign Exchange, Business Travel, Sterling Holidays, Desert

Adventures (our DMS subsidiary in the Middle East) and DEI

(our Digital Imaging Solutions subsidiary) held us in good stead

during the year, contributing significantly.

Sterling Holiday Resorts

Reported a growth of 58% in FY22 over the previous year, with

six consecutive quarters registering EBITDA level profitability

with 37% operating margin. This performance assumes greater

significance, amid the fact that the year saw two waves of

pandemic, affecting 5 months of operations. This was enabled by

strong restructuring and cost optimisation measures adopted.

Report of the Directors on Corporate Governance

1.

COMPANY’S PHILOSOPHY ON THE CODE OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Thomas Cook (India) Limited (‘TCIL/Company’) philosophy on Corporate Governance is to conduct its business in a manner

which is ethical and transparent with all stakeholders of the Company. The Company believes in providing a structure

that works for the benefit of everyone concerned, by ensuring that the Company adheres to ethical standards, laws and

best practices. The Company’s policy on Corporate Governance is to make it a way of life by, inter alia, adopting standard

Corporate Governance practices through continual improvement of internal systems and satisfaction of customers and

shareholders. The Company in its approach to adopt the best possible practices of Corporate Governance and keeping

adherence to the latest rules and regulations prescribed by various regulatory authorities, has taken all the necessary

steps to stay in line with the continuously progressing governance demands.

TCIL endeavours to demonstrate the highest standards of Corporate Governance and ethical behaviour across all levels

within the organisation with a zero- tolerance policy towards any deviation from these standards. Our ethical framework

focuses on long term shareholder value creation through responsible decision making. As a global organisation, the

Corporate Governance practices followed by the Company and its subsidiaries are compatible with international standards

and practices.

Our Corporate Governance framework ensures that we make timely disclosures and share relevant information regarding

our financial performance, as well as disclosure related to the leadership and governance of the Company. At TCIL,

Corporate Governance is more than just adherence to the statutory and regulatory requirements. It is equally about

focusing on voluntary practices that underline the highest levels of transparency and propriety.

Over the years, the Board of Directors (“Board”) has developed Corporate Governance guidelines to help fulfill our

corporate responsibility towards the Company’s stakeholders. These guidelines ensure that the Board will have the

necessary authority and processes to review and evaluate the Company’s operations when required. Further, these

guidelines allow the Board to make decisions that are independent of the Management. The Board may change these

guidelines as and when required, to achieve the Company’s stated objectives.

2. BOARD OF DIRECTORS (‘BOARD’):

TCIL, as a Company believes that an active, well informed and independent Board is necessary to ensure the highest

standards of Corporate Governance. The Company believes that the Board is at the core of Corporate Governance and thus

as optimum mix of Executive and Non-Executive Directors; including a Woman Director, which plays a significant role in

ensuring the highest standards of Corporate Governance practice in the Company.

Size and Composition of the Board:

The Composition of the TCIL Board as on March 31, 2022 included Ten (10) members with two (2) Executive Directors and

eight (8) Non-Executive Directors, of which Five (5) were Independent Directors including a Woman Independent Director,

comprising of experts from various fields/professions.

The composition of the Board of Directors of the Company is in accordance with Securities & Exchange Board of India

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and the Companies Act, 2013, read with applicable

rules made thereunder, as amended from time to time.

Key Skills, Expertise and Competencies of the Board

The Board of Directors of TCIL comprises of qualified members who have the skills, expertise and competence to make

effective contribution to the growth of the Company as well as on the various business and governance matters discussed

in the Board and Committee meetings. The Board members are committed to ensuring that the Company is in compliance

with the requisite standards of Corporate Governance.

Managing Director, the Chief Financial Officer, and the heads of the business units

and support services’ units) has the overall responsibility for the risk management framework and its effectiveness, with the respective

heads of business units/support services’ units, being responsible for its implementation and day-to-day monitoring. The Company’s

policy is to place cash and cash equivalents and short term deposits with reputable banks and financial institutions.

The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk

limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect

changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities.

The Company’s Board of Directors oversees how management monitors compliance with the company’s risk management policies and

procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The audit

committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management

controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Board of Directors.

(A) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual

obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from customers and investments in debt securities. Credit risk

primarily arises from financial assets such as trade receivables, Investment in mutual funds, derivative financials instruments, balance

with banks and other receivables.

Credit risk arising from investment in mutual funds, derivative financials instruments and balance with banks is limited because the

counterparties are bank and recognised financials institution with high credit ratings.The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced

mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the factors that may influence the credit

risk of its customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate.

The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other

receivables.

The average credit period on sales of services is less than 30 days. Credit risk arising from trade receivables is managed in accordance

with the Company’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. The concentration of credit

risk in limited due to the fact that the customer base is large.

Independent Auditors’ Report

To the Members of Thomas Cook (India) Limited

Report on the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of

Thomas Cook (India) Limited (hereinafter referred to as the

‘Holding Company”) and its employee welfare trust, which

comprise the standalone balance sheet as at 31 March 2022,

and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries

together referred to as “the Group”) and its associates,

which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31

March 2022, and the consolidated statement of profit and

loss (including other comprehensive income), consolidated

statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement

of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the

consolidated financial statements, including a summary

of significant accounting policies and other explanatory

information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated

financial statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and

according to the explanations given to us, and based on

the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate

financial statements of such subsidiaries, and associates as

were audited by the other auditors, the aforesaid consolidated

financial statements give the information required by the

Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and

give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting

principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated

state of affairs of the Group and its associates as at 31 March

2022, of its consolidated loss and other comprehensive loss,

consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows

for the year then ended.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards

on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act.

Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in

the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated

Financial Statements section of our report. We are

independent of the Group and its associates in accordance

with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit

of the consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code

of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants

of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have

fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with

these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence

obtained by us along with the consideration of audit reports

of the other auditors referred to in paragraph (a) of the “Other

Matters” paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to

provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial

statements.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to Note 2 to the consolidated financial

statements,

which

describes

economic

and

social

consequences the entity is facing as a result of COVID-19

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional

judgment and based on the consideration of reports of

other auditors on financial statements of components

audited by them, were of most significance in our audit of

the consolidated financial statements of the current period.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit

of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and

in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a

separate opinion on these matters.

(c)

Uniform accounting policies

As far as possible, the Consolidated Financial Statements of

1.2

Principles of consolidation of subsidiaries, associates and

joint ventures

Subsidiaries:

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over

which the group has control. The Group controls an entity

when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns

from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to

affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant

activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from

the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are

deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group combines the financial statements of the parent

and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of

assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intergroup

transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions

between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses

are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence

of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies

of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure

consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Equity accounted investees:

The Group’s interests in equity accounted investees comprises

interests in associates and joint ventures.

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant

influence but not control or joint control. This is generally the

case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the

voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for

using the equity method of accounting, after initially being

recognised at cost.

A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint

control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the

equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the

consolidated balance sheet.

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are

initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise

the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of

the investee in the consolidated statement of profit and loss,

and the Group’s share of other comprehensive income of the

investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received

or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised

as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted

investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity,

including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the

Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred

obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its

associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of

the Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are

also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of

an impairment of the asset transferred.

Non-controlling interests (NCI):

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of

subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated

statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes

in equity and consolidated balance sheet respectively.

Loss of control:

When the Group looses control over a subsidiary, it

derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and

any related NCI and other components of equity. Any interest

retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value

at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is

recognised in profit or loss.

1.3

Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with

the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision

maker (‘CODM’). The Board of Directors, the chief executive

officer and the chief financial officer have been identified as

being the CODMs. Refer Note 29 for segment information.

1.4

Foreign currency translation and transactions

(a)

Functional and presentation currency

A Group’s functional currency is the currency of the primary

economic environment in which an entity operates and is

normally the currency in which the entity primarily generates

and expends cash.

Resolution as set out in Item No. 3 of the accompanying Notice

Item Nos. 4 & 5:

Background:

Employee Stock Options (ESOP’s) are considered as an effective tool

to attract and retain the best talent and also serve to incentivise and

motivate professionals and reward exceptional performance.

Accordingly, with a view to rewarding and motivating the Execom

and the senior management employees of the Company and its

subsidiaries and also foster ownership towards the growth and

profitability of the Company and the Thomas Cook India Group, the

Company, inter alia, rolled out the ‘Thomas Cook Employees Stock

Option Scheme 2018 – EXECOM (‘ESOP 2018 – EXECOM’) vide

special resolution passed by the Shareholders dated 11th April,

2018.

Pursuant to a composite scheme of arrangement and amalgamation

between certain companies (the “Scheme”) given effect to in

November 2019, matters that were forming an integral part of the

Scheme relating to the ESOP mechanism prescribed in Clause 38

of the said Scheme, the 1754458 stock options of the ESOP 2018

– EXECOM were subsumed into the Thomas Cook (India) Limited

Employees Benefit Trust for implementing the terms of the Scheme

with IDBI Trusteeship Services Limited being appointed as a Trustee

for the purpose.

The change brought about by the pandemic and the rationale for

the proposed variation:

Every great event in the history of mankind has had a physiological,

psychological and emotional impact. COVID-19 is a once-in-a-

lifetime pandemic, and the effects have been felt all over the globe.

Happy and successful employees are a crucial asset for the success

of any organization. While companies must consider how to retain

employees at the best of times, employee retention became a

pressing topic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extreme uncertainty

from the highest level of organization, coupled with devastating

statistics from across the globe and the almost overnight shut down

of countries forced the companies to change their strategies and set

new structures and systems to bring about a version 2.0!

As, we yet ride through these unprecedented times, it is a difficult

time for recruiting and retention in the Travel & Hospitality industry

as it took the fair brunt of the pandemic-led apprehension in the

market. Today it is even more important for the people who make

up an organization to know, with utmost faith, that their employer is

right there for them.

Stock Options, as a tool of retention, especially in the light of the

rebound after the pandemic, is critical for retention of talent and to

keep them with the organisation.

Proposal of the variation:

In light of the above, it is being proposed to factor the disruption

caused by COVID 2019 virus, to the travel and hospitality industry

and vary the Clause 6 - Vesting Period as mentioned below for better

flexibility in vesting schedule for the options already granted/ to be

granted henceforth:

Existing Clause 6
