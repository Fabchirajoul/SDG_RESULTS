MANAGEMENT

TEAM

.in:

Dear Shareholders,

Hope that this communication ﬁnds

you and your loved ones safe and in

good health.

As we entered this ﬁscal year, we see

the pandemic, which had impacted all

and sundry and caused huge all-round

chaos, is turning into more like an

endemic. We express our gratitude

to our government for its humongous

efforts towards successfully carrying

out the world’s largest vaccination

drive. We do sincerely hope for this

transition to be more manageable,

resulting in a return to normalcy in our

personal and professional lives.

Bata Shoe Organisation (BSO), the

founder and parent entity, has always

been guided by a strong set of beliefs

in its journey of over 125 years. As a

Group, we have always kept pace with

the changing times, calibrating and

consolidating as we moved forward.

What has remained unchanged is

its inherent resilience and ability

to emerge stronger, out of such

turbulent times.

The unprecedented COVID-19

pandemic has had wide-ranging

ramiﬁcations, upsetting and displacing

the consumer. We, at Bata India, have

been quick to adapt, re-calibrate and

re-orient our resources, which has

not only ensured business continuity,

but has also paved the way for a

quick revival of the business to pre-

pandemic levels. The challenges

notwithstanding, our employees and

management stood undeterred, trying

to learn the new emerging reality of

consumer needs.

The pandemic brought health

and wellness at the forefront for

consumers, as the formal shoe

market was reshaped by the adoption

of remote working by India Inc. and

digital emerged as the new way to

go. Through the troughs and peaks of

the multiple waves of infections, the

recovery of sentiment was intermittent.

Responding to these changing market

behaviours, we reworked our business

case, through the key pillars of market

penetration by larger network of

franchisees, focus on digital channels

and multi brand outlets (MBOs) and

product expansion through casual

footwear and sneakers. This has

2 Lakhs+

pairs of footwear donated under our

global shoe donation drive of 1 Million

pairs worldwide.

resulted in higher footfalls across our

retail network, supported by brand

positioning and marketing investments.

Campaigns such as ‘Relaxed Work

Wear’, ‘Unlimited Sneakers at Bata’,

‘24x7 Casual Collection’ and ‘Neo

Casual Collection for Neo Leaders’

were launched to attract the relevant

target segments. We have increased

our presence on e-commerce

marketplaces as well as our own

portal. We have also invested in

technologies to increase customer

delight on our website and to provide

the complete Bata product catalogue

to online shoppers. All orders received

on our website are now largely shipped

through our stores.

This strategy has enabled Bata

India to record a swift recovery of its

business as well as to seek growth.

It also helped us register signiﬁcant

growth in sales and proﬁtability

despite intermittent interference

due to the second and third wave of

the pandemic.

CHAIRMAN’S

MESSAGE:

Dear Shareholders,

As we waded through one of the most

unforeseen and disruptive pandemics

in recent history, setting our eyes on

the new and emergent has been of

utmost necessity, to build conviction

and remain resilient. The last two

years have tested everyone’s mettle

in myriad ways, but through it all, we

have managed to stand up to the

challenges, with a globally coordinated

and collective approach. The large-

scale vaccination drives across the

world, government policies aimed

at reviving economic activity and

consistent investments from business

entities to aid in the endeavor has

truly come together to spark life back

into global markets and consumer

sentiments. And it goes without saying,

that our frontline team members have

continued to play a key role in this

journey through their tireless efforts.

We at Bata India Limited have also

stood strong and remained committed

to our aspirations of scaling newer

heights, despite the odds. Our

steadfast nature and deep market

understanding has helped us to

not only navigate the uncertainties

presented by the pandemic but have

made it possible for us to rise above

them. It is truly a testament to our

longstanding legacy as well as the

potency of our effective strategies.

Remarkable Performance

Across Segments

After experiencing several pandemic-

induced disruptions since March 2020,

the last ﬁnancial year began with

the hope of strong recovery. These

sentiments were quickly dampened

with the intermittent resurgence

of infections throughout the year

in different degrees, along with

other global issues like heightened

geopolitical tensions, supply chain

challenges as well as inflation and the

rising prices of commodities which

complicated the economic revival.

However, Bata India stood strong,

remained resilient and continued to

courageously step forward and beat

the odds.: MANAGING DIRECTOR’S
