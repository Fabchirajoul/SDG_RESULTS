(viii) The borrowing from financial institutions have been used for the purposes for which it was taken at the balance date.

50. Exceptional Items:

(a) The exceptional income of `11.90 crores in FY 2020-21 refers to the reversal of provision for export obligations of

the acquired business made in the previous years, as the same stands fulfilled.

51. Certain figures apparently may not add up because of rounding off, but are wholly accurate in themselves.

52. The social security code enacted in year 2020 has been deferred by a year. When enacted, this code will have an impact

on Company’s contribution to Provident Fund, Gratuity and other employee related benefits. The Company proposes to
