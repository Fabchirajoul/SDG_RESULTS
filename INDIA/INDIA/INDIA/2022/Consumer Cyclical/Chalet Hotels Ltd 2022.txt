Message from the Managing:

dear Shareholders,

I am proud of the remarkable work our team has

accomplished since the beginning of the pandemic. This

has been the most challenging period in our Company’s

history, but the resilience of our associates and our

business model that integrates hospitality revenues

with annuities from commercial assets has never been

more evident. Thanks to the exceptional leadership of

your Management, Chalet Hotels Limited has emerged

much more focused and better positioned than ever for

growth.

Your Company started witnessing improvements in

performance from the third quarter of 2021-22. In

this quarter, the hospitality portfolio crossed the 60%

occupancy mark for the first time since the beginning

of the pandemic and recorded occupancies of 64%

in December 2021. From mid-February onwards, the

industry saw significant improvement in travel. As per an

HVS report, the hospitality industry witnessed a sharp

recovery in March and occupancies pan-India breached

60% and ADRs were between ` 5,400 to ` 5,600,

driven by improvement in corporate travel, big ticket

conferences and the demand for leisure destinations.

As a result of the above, your Company ended the year

on a decent note with occupancies of 51% and ADR of

` 4,576.

During the year, the Management initiated several

initiatives with a view to optimize earnings and Return on

Assets. Chalet initiated re-purposing of some of its retail

properties as office buildings. The commercial projects

in Mumbai and Bengaluru and the residential project at

Bengaluru were recommenced. Expansion of rooms at

Novotel in Pune is also underway. On completion of the

first phase of renovation, the iconic ‘The Renaissance

Mumbai Convention Center Hotel’ at Powai Lake was re-

branded as ‘The Westin Mumbai Powai Lake’ on March

1, 2022. The Westin Powai is now a 600-room asset with

contemporary spaces offering distinctive experiences to

our guests.

In response to the changing business needs, we have

embraced digitisation and automation in our business

to effectively cater to the needs of our customers in the

ways that best suit them. We have also kept a strong

focus on our ESG front as we reaffirm the commitment to

a sustainable tomorrow.

With our renewed strategy in place, we are geared up

for growth, while keeping our focus on the environment

to preserve nature for our future generations. We trust

that all our stakeholders would accompany us on this

journey.

Yours Sincerely,

Hetal Gandhi

Chairman and Independent Director

ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22

CHALET HOTELS LIMITED

CoRpoRate oveRview: message fROm THe CHaIRman’s desK

Managing director’s desk: dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present the annual report of Chalet

Hotels Limited for FY 2021-22 which reflects your

Company’s ability to navigate through the new normal

and lay out a strategy for the future that focuses on

‘Return on Capital Employed’.

The resilience of the travel and hospitality industry was

evident as the industry came to the end of a challenging

second consecutive year of the impact of the COVID-19.

The industry is now seeing a sharp recovery despite

the turbulences and an unprecedented business

environment, we have been able to tread the path of

revival. This has been driven by the return of travel

confidence and a strong resurgence of business travel,

MICE and wedding segments.

The FY 2022 unfolded with the onset of the second wave

of COVID-19 in March 2021. The state of Maharashtra

imposed a complete lockdown from April 4, 2021,

till June 7, 2021, thus, impacting two-thirds of Q1

2021-22. The hospitality business was hit hard due to

restrictions across various cities. However, the months

of June and July 2021 saw a sharp pickup in business

and leisure segments. Restrictions in major business

cities were eased and domestic corporates went back to

working from office resulting in business travel gaining

momentum. From August 2021, the hospitality industry

continued on the path of recovery with a revival in

demand.

Your Company had a very promising Q3. The hospitality

portfolio crossed the 60% occupancy mark for the

first time since the beginning of the pandemic with

December clocking 64% occupancy. With the travel

confidence improving significantly, domestic airlines

witnessed an 84% recovery to pre-COVID levels in the

third quarter.

Travel confidence bounced back in the second half of

the fourth quarter, with the impact of Omicron fading.

Your Company saw an ADR growth of 7% from the

preceding quarter and occupancies touching a healthy

70% in March 2022. The months of April and May

continued with occupancies higher than the comparable

pre-pandemic period of 81% and 79%, respectively, with

ADRs at ~` 7,600 in May.

With its country-wide impact, the pandemic potentially

changed how we think and perceive the world. We have

unlearned and learned new ways of working. To match

the steps of the new and modern hospitality industry

and stay on top of the game, we have considered

adoption of advanced technologies and IoT-based

solutions such as Touchless Mobile Key and QR Code-

enabled digital In-room-dining menus & other services.

To control the spread of the virus and ensure the

safety of our guests and colleagues, your Company

implemented strict hygiene protocols and invested in

touchless technologies such as Contactless Front Office

Operations for Check-in/Check-out and contactless F&B

Operations.

Your Company re-strategized assets by exiting the

retail segment. Both the commercial projects, in

Mumbai and Bengaluru were restarted. Focusing on

asset optimization, we started work on repurposing

the space at Inorbit Mall in Bengaluru and The Orb at

Sahar, Mumbai, by converting them into commercial

office assets, thus adding another 0.4 million sq. ft.

of rent-yielding commercial assets to our existing

portfolio of 0.5 million sq. ft. In addition, the work on

two new commercial assets with a total of 1.4 million

sq. ft. at Whitefield in Bengaluru and Powai in Mumbai

is progressing well with completion targeted by Q2 FY

2023 and Q4 FY 2023, respectively.

We reassessed the proposed 150 room ‘W Hotel’

project at Powai and considering the demand dynamics

of hospitality and commercial rental spaces in the

micro-market, have decided to change the end use to

a commercial building. Subject to requisite regulatory

approvals, this project could potentially add another

~0.75 million sq. ft. of leasable space to our commercial

portfolio.

All fixed set patterns are incapable

of adaptability or pliability. The

truth is outside of all fixed patterns.
