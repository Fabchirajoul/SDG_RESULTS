Dear Shareholders

I am pleased to present, on behalf of our Board of

Directors, the Annual Report of your Company for

the financial year ended 31st March, 2022.

The year presented us with huge uncertainties

induced by the COVID-19 pandemic during

the first and last quarter of the year in

combination with supply chain disruption and

unexpected inflation in the commodity prices.

Nonetheless, agile measures such as warehouse

modernisation, maintaining supply availability

and ramping up new product development

helped us to mitigate these challenges. Further,

cost optimisation, product mix improvement and

suitable pricing actions countered the commodity

led input cost and helped us to deliver excellent

business performance.

Inauguration of a state-of-the-art research and

development facility in Vikhroli, Mumbai sprawling

50,000 square feet was a significant development

this year. Butterfly acquisition was yet another

important milestone which will add immense value

to our product portfolio, driving cost synergies

and enhancing our manufacturing footprint.

We continued to invest in strategic investments

which we believe would reap positive outcomes

over the mid and long term. We continued to

increase our spends considerably in brand

building activities leading to expanded market

reach and enhanced brand recall. Channel

development reach expansion and people

development remained major focus areas.

Looking back, we feel proud to have shown

extraordinary resilience and quickly adopted

to

the

changing

business

landscape,

thereby

maintaining

business

continuity

as well as recording healthy margins and

enhanced profitability.

Despite the impact of COVID-19

crisis and various other challenges,

we registered robust double-digit

growth and were amongst the most

profitable companies in the industry.
