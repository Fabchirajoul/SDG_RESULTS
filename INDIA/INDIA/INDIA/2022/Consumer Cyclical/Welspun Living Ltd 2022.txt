Dear Stakeholders,

Welspun had a historic year in FY22. I am

pleased to share yet another milestone with

the Home Textile business exceeding the

$1 billion mark in revenue. Over the last two

years, the industry has witnessed significant

structural changes; the shift in consumption

patterns, the dominance of online platforms

and the peak in commodity prices worldwide,

which called for resilience in the business

models. We have enhanced our business

operations to capture the benefits from this

shift by strengthening our value enablers of

innovation, digitalisation, and ESG.

Our principles and vision guide us in creating

inclusive value, enhancing our positive impact

on the environment, and contributing to

societal wellbeing. ESG will continue to be

a critical component of our value creation &

growth strategy. Our sustainability approach

is based on stakeholder engagement to

determine focus areas and our strong

governance structure is helping turn our plans

into reality. We expect FY23 to be marked by

inflationary pressures and possible softening

of consumer demand in Western economies.

Notwithstanding, our business fundamentals

will remain strong as we enter the new

fiscal year, and we expect our operating

performance to reflect the strength of our

business model

Warm regards,

Dipali Goenka

JMD and CEO: Dear Stakeholders,

At Welspun, our Board of Directors constantly

endeavour to deliver the highest forms of governance

while protecting the interest of our stakeholders.

Staying true to our vision for good governance, we

have made significant progress with our deliberations,

interventions, and activities. I am pleased to share

with you the Board’s key priorities and activities

implemented during FY22.

Board priorities and activities

Risk, ESG, and digitisation continue to be the top

priorities for the Board. I am pleased to announce that

the Board of Directors have continued to integrate

ESG considerations in our governance structure and

business operations. We have voluntarily published

a Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report

(BRSR) in the reporting year to pro-actively comply

with emerging regulatory requirements on non-

financial disclosures.

We implemented ESG Compass - An Integrated

Digital Platform to measure, monitor, and report

on ESG KPIs. This is part of our focus on ESG data

governance, which leverages digitisation to embed

ESG metrics into an internal controls framework and

internal audit programme. Employing digitisation

in the area of ethics and compliances, we have

created a whistleblower web portal to facilitate

anonymous reporting and strengthen transparency and

accountability throughout the organisation.

Committed to creating stakeholder

value

During the year, the Board expanded the scope

of the Stakeholders Relationship Committee from

shareholders to include all stakeholders. With this,

the committee can now maintain oversight of our

stakeholder engagement programme, stakeholder

feedback, and grievance redressal. This is a reflection

of our commitment to consistently identify and

address material issues that can affect our long-term

value creation capabilities. A key outcome of our

efforts was an improvement of the Company's ESG

score on the Corporate Sustainability Assessment

survey carried out by Dow Jones Sustainability Indices

this year.

Closing remarks

Together with the organisation’s Management, we

look forward to actively participating in realising

sustainable growth for Welspun. We would like

to thank all our stakeholders for their continuing

engagement with us.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the year ended March 31, 2022

1. Corporate Information

Welspun India Limited (herein referred to as “WIL”

or “the Company”) is public limited company

incorporated and domiciled in India. The address

of its registered office is “Welspun City”, Village

Versamedi, Tal. Anjar, Dist. Kutch, Gujarat - 370110,

India. The Company is listed on the Bombay Stock

Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange

(NSE). The Company is a leading manufacturer of

wide range of home textile products, mainly terry

towels, bed linen products and rugs. The financial

statements were authorized for issue by the board

of directors on May 10, 2022.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

This note provides a list of the significant

accounting policies adopted in the preparation

of these financial statements. These policies

have been consistently applied to all the

years presented.

2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements

The standalone financial statements has been

prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting

Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133

of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) read with

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015, as amended from time to time. The financial

statements have been prepared on an accrual and

going concern basis. The financial statements have

been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for

certain assets and liabilities that is measured at fair

value as stated in subsequent policies.

2.2 Foreign currency translation

a.

Functional and presentation currency

The financial statements of the Company are

presented in INR, which is also its functional

currency and all items included in the financial

statements of the Company are measured

using the same functional currency.

b.

Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated

and recorded into the functional currency

using the exchange rates prevailing on the

date of the transaction. Foreign exchange

gains and losses resulting from the settlement

of such transactions and from the translation

of monetary assets and liabilities denominated

in foreign currencies at year end exchange

rates are generally recognized in Statement

of Profit and Loss. They are deferred in equity

if they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges.

Foreign exchange differences regarded as an

adjustment to borrowing costs are presented

in the Statement of Profit and Loss, within

finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains

and losses are presented in the Statement of

Profit and Loss on a net basis within other

expenses or other income, as applicable.

Non-monetary items that are measured in

terms of historical cost in a foreign currency

are translated using the exchange rates at

the dates of the initial transactions. Non-

monetary items measured at fair value in

a foreign currency are translated using

the exchange rates at the date when the

fair value is determined. The gain or loss

arising on translation of non-monetary items

measured at fair value is treated in line with

the recognition of the gain or loss on the

change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation

differences on items whose fair value gain

or loss is recognized in OCI or profit or loss

are also recognized in OCI or profit or loss,

respectively).

2.3 Revenue recognition

Revenue from contracts with customers is

recognized when control of the goods or services

are transferred to the customer at an amount that

reflects the consideration to which the Company

expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods

or services. The Company has generally concluded

that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements

because it typically controls the goods or services

before transferring them to the customer.

Revenue excludes amounts collected on behalf of

third parties.

The disclosures of significant accounting

judgments, estimates and assumptions relating

to revenue from contracts with customers are

provided in Note 2.23.

Sale of goods

For sale of goods, revenue is recognized when

control of the goods has transferred at a point

in time i.e. when the goods have been delivered

to the specific location (delivery). Following

delivery, the customer has full discretion over the

responsibility, manner of distribution, price to sell

the goods and bears the risks of obsolescence

and loss in relation to the goods. A receivable is

recognized by the Company when the goods are

delivered to the customer as this represents the

point in time at which the right to consideration

becomes unconditional, as only the passage of

time is required before payment is due. Payment

is due within 30-120 days. The Company considers

the effects of variable consideration, the existence

of significant financing components, noncash

consideration, and consideration payable to the

customer (if any).

Variable consideration:

If the consideration in a contract includes a

variable amount, the Company estimates the

amount of consideration to which it will be entitled

in exchange for transferring the goods to the

customer. The variable consideration is estimated

at contract inception and constrained until it is

highly probable that a significant revenue reversal:

Note:

(i) The working capital loans, which includes cash credit, packing credit and short term loan from banks, are

generally secured by hypothecation of raw materials, stock-in-process, finished, semi finished goods, stores,

spares and book debts and current financial assets of borrowing companies and second charge on entire

fixed assets of borrowing companies and by corporate guarantees issued by certain companies within

the Group.

(f) FVOCI equity investments

The group has elected to recognise changes in the

fair value of certain investments in equity securities

in other comprehensive income. These changes are

accumulated within the FVOCI equity investments

reserve within equity. The group transfers amounts

from this reserve to retained earnings when the

relevant equity securities are derecognised.

(g) Hedging reserve

The group uses hedging instruments as part of its

management of foreign currency risk associated

with its highly probable forecast sale and inventory

purchases and interest rate risk associated with

variable interest rate borrowings as described

within note 26. For hedging foreign currency risk,

the group uses foreign currency forward contracts

and foreign currency option contracts, both of

which are designated as cash flow hedges.To the

extent these hedges are effective; the change in

fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised

in the cash flow hedging reserve. Amounts

recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is

reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged

item affects profit or loss (e.g. sales and interest

payments). When the forecast transaction results

in the recognition of a non-financial asset (e.g.

inventory), the amount recognised in the cash flow

hedging reserve is adjusted against the carrying

amount of the nonfinancial asset.

The group designates the spot component

of foreign currency forward contracts and

the intrinsic value of foreign currency option

contracts as hedging instruments in cash flow

hedge relationships. The group defers changes in

the forward element of foreign currency forward

contracts and the time value element of foreign

currency option contracts in the costs of hedging

reserve. The deferred costs of hedging are

included in the initial cost of the related inventory

when it is recognised or reclassified to profit or

loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss.

(h) Foreign currency translation reserve

Exchange differences arising on translation of

the foreign operations are recognised in other

comprehensive income as described in accounting

policy and accumulated in a separate reserve within

equity. The cumulative amount is reclassified to

profit or loss when the net investment is disposed-

off.

Note 34: Leases

Group as Lessee

The Group has lease contracts for various items of commercial property, plant and machinery, vehicles and other

equipment used in its operations. Leases of commercial property generally have lease term between 2 and 16

years and leases of plant and machinery have lease term of 13 years, while motor vehicles and other equipment

generally have lease terms between 2 and 5 years. The Group’s obligations under its leases are secured by the

lessor’s title to the leased assets. Generally, the Group is restricted from assigning and subleasing the leased

assets and some contracts require the Group to maintain certain financial ratios. There are several lease contracts

that include extension and termination options and variable lease payments, which are further discussed below.

The Group also has certain leases with lease terms of 12 months or less and leases with low value. The Group

applies the ‘short-term lease’ and ‘lease of low-value assets’ recognition exemptions for these leases.
