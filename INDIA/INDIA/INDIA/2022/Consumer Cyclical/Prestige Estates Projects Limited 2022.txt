Prestige Estates Projects Limited:

Managing Director

As the Co-Founder of Prestige Estates Projects Ltd.,

Mr. Rezwan brings in over four decades of experience in

the business of property development. Mr. Rezwan is the: Managing Director of the Prestige Group, India’s leading

property developer, where he has played a pivotal role in

taking the Company to its present level.

The second son of Mr. Razack Sattar, Mr. Rezwan entered his

family’s retail business in 1975 and diversified into property

development in 1985. Clearly, he has inherited his father’s

zest for excellence and is a high flier from the word go.

Mr. Rezwan’s pleasant demeanour and affable nature has

been an asset for the Group’s team building efforts. He

handles all construction and engineering activities of the

Prestige Group, where he has built a highly motivated team.

His excellent people skills have created an environment

where team members can execute assignments with

confidence and effectiveness.

Mr. Rezwan is not a person to be limited by business goals

alone. A philanthropist by nature, he dedicated himself to

coordinating the ‘Terry Fox Run’– a fundraising event in

aid of Cancer Research in Bengaluru. For this effort, the

Governor General of Canada, Mr. David Johnston, during

his State visit in 2014, awarded a Medallion and Scroll to

him. Mr. Rezwan staunchly supports the PRAY (Pain Relief

and You) Foundation, which provides medical assistance to

the underprivileged.

Among a host of other hats that Mr. Rezwan dons, he is an

avid golfer, a music aficionado, a wildlife photographer,

a keen ornithologist, an F1 motor sports buff and a free-

wheeling cook. His interests have stemmed from his wide

travels across the globe.

The most remarkable facet of Mr. Rezwan’s personality is his

passion for collecting Indian Banknotes and Paper Money.

His collection of Indian Paper Money is unrivalled and the

most comprehensive in the world today.

This hobby, fuelled by Mr. Rezwan’s relentless passion and

zest for knowledge, has created the most accomplished

collection of Indian Paper Money from its inception to

the present. His collection has been built over a period of

50 years, which saw in-depth research and study of this

subject. This culminated in him coauthoring an encyclopedic

book, The Revised Standard Reference Guide to Indian

Paper Money, which was released in 2012. This guide has

become the single most reliable point of reference on

Indian Paper Money and can verily be said to be the Bible

for Indian Paper Money.

In 2017, Mr. Rezwan authored a second book, One

Rupee - One Hundred Years 1917-2017, to mark the 100th

anniversary of the issue of the One Rupee note in India.

Mr. Rezwan is the

Managing Director, Mr. Irfan Razack. Appointed as

an Executive Director of the Company in August 2015,

he is attached with the CMD’s office. Whilst assisting the

Chairman, he is also responsible for sales and marketing.

and investor relations within the Company. In addition to

has over 47 years of experience. He currently heads Public

Relations and Liaison affairs of the Company and is an

interface between the Company, government departments

and statutory authorities. He is also member and Employer

Representative of regional committee of Employee

Provident Fund Organisation, Karnataka.

NAYEEM NOOR

Executive Director-Government Relations

his full time role, he is spearheading an important urban

transformation project aimed at improving public spaces

and uplifting community life. He is also driving the Group’s

and Training Centre.’ He serves as part of the Governing

Body of CREDAI-Bengaluru where he contributes to policy

discussions impacting the real estate industry, and engages

with relevant stakeholders to address industry concerns.

He was at the forefront of the group’s covid-relief efforts,

helping facilitate donations to enhance facilities at

underprovided hospitals in the Bengaluru region and

assisting the company’s workforce to get urgent medical

care during the pandemic.

Award at the Realty+ 40 Under 40 Conclave & Awards 2021,
