been identified as the chief operating decision

maker of Elgi Equipments Limited who assesses

the financial performance and position of the

Company

and

makes

strategic

decisions.

Refer

note 41 for segment information presented.

(c) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting

(i) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured

entities) over which the group has control. The group

controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has

rights to, variable returns from its involvement with

the entity and has the ability to affect those returns

through its power to direct the relevant activities of the

entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date

on which control is transferred to the group. They are

deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account

for business combinations by the group.

The group combines the financial statements of

the parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding

together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income

and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances

and unrealised gains on transactions between group

companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also

eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence

of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting

policies of subsidiaries have been changed where

necessary to ensure consistency with the policies

adopted by the group.

(ii) Joint arrangements

Under Ind AS 111 Joint Arrangements, investments in joint

arrangements are classified as either joint operations

or joint ventures. The classification depends on the

contractual rights and obligations of each investor,

rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.

Elgi Equipments Limited has both joint operations and

joint ventures.

Joint operations

The group recognises its direct right to the assets,

liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and

its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities,

revenues and expenses.

Joint ventures

Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using

the equity method (see (iii) below), after initially being

recognised at cost in the consolidated balance sheet.

Significant accounting policies (Continued...):

letter of credit (SBLC) backed by margin deposits made by the

Holding Company.

(ii) The Other facility of ` 1257.75 million (EUR 15 million) as on March 31, 2022 (` 745.60 million i.e. EUR 8.70 million

as on March 31, 2021) availed by Elgi Compressors Europe SRL from Citi Bank (United Kingdom) and ` 383.19 million

(EUR 4.57 million) as on March 31, 2022 (` Nil as on March 31, 2021) availed from HDFC Bank are secured by a corporate

guarantee issued by the Holding Company and a pari passu charge on the specific assets of Holding Company.

Also refer note 46 for value of assets pledged as security.

There are no defaults in the repayments of above borrowings during the current year.

The group has not been declared wilful defaulter by any bank or financial institution or government or any

government authority.
