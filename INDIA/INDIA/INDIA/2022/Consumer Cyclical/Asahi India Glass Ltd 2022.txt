Dear Shareholders,

FY 2021-22 has been eventful on various

fronts. The beginning of year marked

the lethal second wave of the COVID-19

pandemic for India and the world,

ushering newer challenges for healthcare

systems, as well as channeling economic

growth. However, business continuity

coupled with rapid vaccination coverage

led to a stronger resilience, propelling

GDP growth of 8.7% for FY 2021-22,

the highest amongst the world’s large

economies. Various parameters such as

total GST collections, UPI transactions,

FASTag revenues, demand for electricity,

passenger and freight traffic via rail and air,

and metal and coal production displayed

a positive trajectory, pointing towards

continued economic recovery. Resilience

in the agriculture sector and reducing

unemployment levels also added to the

positive outlook of Indian economy.

The Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)

showed a year on year (y-o-y) growth for

April, 2022 up by 8.4% over last year.

Further, several sectors are reaping the

benefits of the government’s push towards

the Production Linked Incentive Scheme

(PLI), promoting local manufacturing and

developing global competitiveness. The

improving economic environment, better

employment availability and household

income supported a rise in the consumer

confidence index whereas an overall

improvement in the business environment

and demand supported a rise in the

business confidence index.

The Indian automotive industry witnessed

steady growth to reach the pre-pandemic

levels of sales volume, having built a

solid foundation in FY 2020-21, despite

the semiconductor shortage curtailing

production. India’s automotive sales

were the strongest across Asia-Pacific in

FY 2021-22. The year gone by has presented

several challenges but Indian auto industry

has worked hard against these challenges

to continue improvement in maintaining a

robust supply chain, increasing localization,

control cost, investing in new technologies,

and enhancing exports. The Government

also supported the industry with the PLI

Scheme as well as extension of Faster

Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid

and Electric Vehicles (FAME).

The pandemic had imposed severe

restrictions on human mobility and

people were compelled to stay indoors

for a significant part of the past two years.

This vastly increased the perceived value

of one’s home in the overall scheme of

things, and along with the prevailing low

interest rates, it sparked then and sustained

homebuyer interest in the residential

market. As consumer desires have changed

to adapt to the conveniences of the new

normal, bigger homes, better amenities

and competitive prices will keep the

residential real estate sector to grow at a

stable pace. India’s commercial real estate

market has been fast growing following

the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the

Chairman’s Message

Built for sustainable growth

Statement of Changes in Equity

88

AsAhi indiA GlAss liMiTEd:

Managing Director and Chief

Executive Officer of the Company has been identified as

CODM and responsible for allocating the resources, assess

the financial performance of segments and position of the

Company and makes strategic decisions.

The Company has identified two reportable segments

“Automotive Glass” and “Float Glass” based on the

information reviewed by the CODM. Refer note.39 for

“Segment Information” presented.

s)

Provisions and Contingent Liabilities

A provision is recognized if as a result of a past event, the

Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive)

that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an

outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the

obligation. Provisions are recognized at the best estimate of

the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at

the Balance Sheet date. If the effect of time value of money

is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre tax

rate that reflects, when appropriate the risks specific to the

liability.

A contingent liability exists when there is a possible but

not probable obligation, or a present obligation that may,

but probably will not, require an outflow of resources, or

a present obligation whose amount cannot be estimated

reliably. Contingent liabilities do not warrant provisions but

are disclosed unless the possibility of outflow of resources

is remote. Contingent assets are neither recognized nor

disclosed in the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements.

However, when the realization of income is virtually certain

then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its

recognition is appropriate.

t)

Research and Development

Revenue expenditure on research and development is

charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss of the year in

which it is incurred.

Capital expenditure incurred during the period on research

and development is accounted for as an addition to Property,

Plant and Equipment.

u)

Rounding of Amounts

All amounts disclosed in the Standalone Ind AS Financial

Statements and accompanying notes have been rounded

off to the nearest lakhs as per the requirement of Schedule

III of the Companies Act, 2013 unless otherwise stated.

v)

Dividends

Dividend proposed (including income tax thereon) is

recognized in the period in which interim dividends are

approved by the Board of Directors or in respect of final

dividend when approved by shareholders.

w)

Borrowing Cost

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or

construction of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the

cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily

takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended

use. All other borrowing costs are charged to the Statement

of Profit and Loss for the period for which they are incurred.

x)

Use of Estimates and Critical Accounting Judgements

The preparation of Financial Statements is in conformity with

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles which requires

management to make estimates and assumptions.

The estimates and the associated assumptions are based on

historical experience, opinions of experts and other factors

that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ

from these estimates.

Significant judgements and estimates are made in areas

relating to useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment,

impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment, Investments,

actuarial assumptions relating to recognition and

measurement of employee defined benefit obligations

and recognition of provisions and exposure of contingent

liabilities relating to pending litigations or other outstanding

claims etc.

y)

Recent Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)

Ministry of Corporate Affairs notifies new Standards or

amendments to the existing Standards. On 23rd March, 2022,

MCA issued the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules, 2022, applicable from 1st April, 2022 and has made

amendments to Ind AS 16, Ind AS 37, Ind AS 103, Ind AS
