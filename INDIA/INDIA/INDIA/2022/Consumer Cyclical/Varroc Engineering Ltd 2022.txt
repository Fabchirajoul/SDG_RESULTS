CHANGE

Seeing the Big Picture

The past two years have witnessed immense structural

shifts in the way mobility is experienced. Globally, the

pandemic accelerated the push towards a more ethical

mode of transportation, with growing awareness among

consumers about the carbon footprint generated by

automotives. This has led to increased demand for the

adoption of EVs, both by users and regulators. We have

enhanced our business operations to capitalise on the

benefits arising from this shift, with the incorporation of

EVs into our product portfolio. To capture the growth

from Mega Trends, we are happy to announce that

the government has approved our application for

Production Linked Incentive, and we will be investing

around `2,800 Million over 5 years under the scheme

At the same time, the policy environment is supportive

towards the adoption of EVs, with the Government

of India launching FAME II amendments and the PMP

scheme. Our EV product portfolio will help facilitate this

transition and it is a matter of honour to be able to work

with leading OEMs for transitioning to a greener and

better world.

Business units such as electrical-

electronics and polymer in India, and

the electronics business in Romania,

are prepared to capitalise on the

emergent trends and experience a

high growth trajectory.

Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to present to you the FY2022 Annual

Report of Varroc Engineering Limited. I hope this letter

finds you in good health. We continue to progress

towards sustainable organisation in extraordinary

circumstances.

The year in review

Over the last two years, businesses, and the

society at large, have been faced with unique and

unprecedented challenges. We have been living in

a VUCA environment – volatile, uncertain, complex,

and ambiguous. Looking at the past year, while we

all were anticipating a rapid recovery in volumes,

the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic struck,

impacting both the supply and demand side. Just as

we were coming out of the second wave, we saw a

worsening of the supply side challenges, particularly

the semiconductor shortages, which is continuing

and might take till the end of FY23 to get normalised.

Higher fuel prices, commodity inflation and tightening

of financing has resulted in higher cost of ownership

of vehicles, impacting demand. We are also

witnessing geo-political issues like the Russia-Ukraine

conflict impacting the global economic recovery.

All this has made the operating environment for the

business very challenging, impacting the profitability

of the operations significantly.

In the background of these challenges, the Company

took the decision to divest its 4 wheeler lighting

business in Europe & Americas and signed an SPA

with Plastic Omnium for an Enterprise value of Euro

600 Million in April’22. The transaction will take

5 months to get completed as we need approval

from the shareholders, regulatory bodies in various

geography and from the lenders. This divestment will

help the company to strengthen its balance sheet and

invest in identified focus areas to drive future growth.

Our business model proved resilient, and our strategic

interventions enabled us to consolidate and grow in

a disruptive year. We achieved a revenue of `58,422

Million in FY2022, as compared to `43,739 Million in

the previous year, registering an annual growth of

33.6% for our continued operations.

The future is ours. Together we can usher in an era

of sustainable growth. Together we can make next

happen.

Looking Ahead

The external business environment is expected to

further normalise by the second half of FY2023. As

we enter the new financial year, we are confident

that our business fundamentals remain strong and

our operating performance is bound to reflect the

resilience of our business model.

We are focused on pursuing a combination of growth

and margin improvements for our business units.

There are several growth opportunities and favourable

mega trends that will help secure our businesses. To

this end, we will continue to focus on our medium

to long-term strategic priorities and growth pillars.

Business units such as the electrical-electronics

and polymer in India, and the electronics business

in Romania, are geared up to capitalise on specific

growth opportunities. We are looking to improve

the profitability of some of the business unit like

IMES in Italy, Metallic Business in India, 4W lighting

business in India and 2W global lighting business by

mix of improving internal efficiency, higher capacity

utilisation and price increase from customers.

I express my sincerest gratitude to our customers,

employees, bankers, and investors for placing their

trust in our abilities, through an exceptionally difficult

year. I look forward to your continued support as we

keep pushing boundaries to reach newer heights.

Dear Shareholders,

The Directors of your Company take pleasure in

presenting the 34th Annual Report on the business

and operations of the Company together with financial

statements for the Financial Year ended March 31, 2022.

FINANCIAL RESULTS & APPROPRIATION

In a bid to transform itself into a high‑tech Company and

focus on the growth areas of electronics, connectivity,

electrical vehicles (EVs) product lines and the 2‑wheeler

segment globally, Your Company, Varroc Engineering

Limited (VEL) alongwith its wholly owned Subsidiary,

VarrocCorp Holding B.V. on April 29, 2022 signed a

Securities Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Compagnie

Plastic Omnium SE of France to divest its 4‑wheeler

lighting systems operations (“VLS Business”) in the

Americas and Europe at an enterprise value of Euro

600 Million. The proposed divestment is part of your

Company’s strategy to align its resources with the high

value and high growth markets in China, India and the

two‑wheeler sector globally. This transaction will see

VEL’s divesting its lighting System operations in the

USA, Brazil, Mexico, Poland, Czech Republic, Germany,

Turkey, and Morocco.

Your Company will continue to operate its China JV

and the international 2‑wheeler lighting business in

Countries like Italy, Romania and Vietnam as well as

the electronics business in Poland and Romania. Your

Company is retaining the 4‑wheeler lighting operations

in India. The planned divestment of Varroc’s 4‑wheeler

lighting systems businesses in the Americas and Europe

will ensure enhanced Shareholders’ value, ability to

invest in high growth potential businesses and further

development of its R&D facilities and engineering

capabilities.

In our financials, VLS Business is now accounted

as discontinued operations (“VLS business”) which

satisfies the criteria prescribed under Indian Accounting

Standards (Ind AS) 105 “Non‑current Assets held for

Sale and Discontinued Operations” for classification

as discontinued operations as at March 31, 2022.

presented as discontinued operations and the previous

period/year figures for statement of profit and loss in the

Consolidated Financial Statements have been restated.

The above financial statements were authorised for

issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of

directors on May 30, 2022.

Note 2: Summary of significant

accounting policies

This note provides a list of the significant accounting

policies adopted in the preparation of these financial

statements. These policies have been consistently

applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise

stated.

Basis of Preparation

(i) Compliance with Ind AS

These financial statements comply in all material

aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind

AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies

Act, 2013 (the Act) [Companies (Indian

Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] and other

relevant provisions of the Act.

All amounts included in these financial statements

are reported in Million of Indian rupees (` In

Million) except earnings per share data and unless

stated otherwise.

All amounts in the financial statements have been

rounded off to the nearest Million or decimal

thereof.

(ii) Use of estimates and assumptions

The preparation of the Financial Statements

requires the management to make certain

judgments, estimates and assumptions. It also

requires the management to exercise judgement

in the process of applying the accounting policies.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgement

or complexity, or areas where assumptions

and estimates are significant to the financial

statements are disclosed in Note 2A.

(iii) Historical cost convention

The financial statements have been prepared on

a historical cost basis, except for the following:

• certain financial assets and liabilities (including

derivative instruments) that are measured at

fair value; and

• defined benefit plans, plan assets measured

at fair value;

(iv) Current/non-current classification:

All assets and liabilities have been classified as

current or non current as per the company’s

operating cycle and other criteria set out in

Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Based

on the nature of products and the time between

the acquisition of assets for processing and their

realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the

Company has ascertained its operating cycle as

12 months for the purpose of current/non‑current

classification of assets and liabilities.

A) Property, plant and equipment

Tangible assets

Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other

items of property, plant and equipment are stated

at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost

includes expenditure that is directly attributable

to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s

carrying amount or recognised as a separate

asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable

that future economic benefits associated with

the item will flow to the Company and the cost of

the item can be measured reliably. The carrying

amount of any component accounted for as a

separate asset is derecognised when replaced.

All other repairs and maintenance are charged

to profit or loss during the reporting period in

which they are incurred.

Depreciation methods, estimated useful

lives and residual value

Depreciation is calculated using the straight‑line

method to allocate their cost, net of their residual

values, over their estimated useful lives or, in

the case of certain leased furniture, fittings and

equipment, the shorter lease term as follows:
