Dear Shareholders,

H.V. Goenka

Chairman

We firmly believe

growth must

be ‘green’ and

sustainable and

are committed to

enable a planet

positive future.

I

ndia, having overcome many

hurdles during the pandemic,

did well to achieve a high degree

of vaccination coverage and

also adopt measures to generate

reasonable demand for goods and

services. As a result core sectors

are growing, GST collections are

at an all-time and India has now

earned the mantle of the world’s

fastest-growing major economy.

The

tyre

industry

witnessed

significant rise in input costs

and CEAT was no exception.

Sales continued to grow, backed

by

cutting-edge

technology,

innovative product portfolio and

higher

efficiencies.

Margins,

however, came under significant

pressure and led to lower profits.

Customer

centricity,

employee

wellness, good governance and

societal welfare remain at the

core of our business ethos. We

continued to extend significant

support to the nation in its fight

against the pandemic through

various

interventions

including

the setting up of fever clinics and

testing infrastructure.

It is our endeavour to be among the

world’s most advanced production

facilities. After winning the Deming

Prize in 2017, CEAT has now

embarked upon an ambitious plan

for the ‘Lighthouse’ certification

of its plants at Chennai, Halol and

Nagpur by adopting Industry 4.0

technologies. We firmly believe

growth

must

be

‘green’

and

sustainable and are committed to

reduce CO2 emissions by 2030,

to move towards a planet positive

future.

As we strive for a better future, we

continue to set new paradigms

every

day.

In

a

challenging

business

environment,

agility,

innovation, and adaptability are

key to staying successful and true

to our mission of ‘Making Mobility

Safer & Smarter. Every Day.’

Message:

Managing Director

CEAT is continuously working on

exploring possibilities of adding

more green raw materials, renewable

energy to create tyres with focus on

customer safety.

W

hile

the

year

2020-

21 saw sharp impact

on businesses due to

nationwide

lockdown

imposed, the beginning of financial

year 2021-22 saw sudden surge in

the COVID cases and loss of life. The

year progressed with depletion in

number of COVID cases and gradual

increase in personal mobility but there

were several other roadblocks such

as supply chain disruption, shifts in

the business paradigm in the last two

years due to the COVID-19 pandemic,

sharp rise in commodity prices,

sluggish demand and finally the geo-

political conflict between Russia-

Ukraine.

Learning from the year 2020-21 and

moving into 2022, we at CEAT feel

immense pride in our purpose and

culture coupled with the focus on

building stronger association with

Safer,

Smarter

and

Sustainable

mobility.

With every new day,

the world is stepping

into

a

new

reality

with

unprecedented

challenges.

We

are

experiencing a world

with increasing volatility

and uncertainty due to

global pandemic and

geo-political

tensions.

CEAT has constantly

adapted

with

speed

and agility to manage

the changes in macro-

economic factors and

has

evolved

into

a

stronger brand.: Dear Shareholders,

in advance to facilitate them to plan their schedule and to

ensure meaningful participation in the Meetings. However,

in case of a special and urgent business need, the Board’s

approval is taken by passing resolutions by circulation, as

permitted by law, which are noted and confirmed in the

subsequent Board Meeting.

The notice of Meetings are given well in advance to all the

Directors. Owing to difficulties involved due to COVID-19

pandemic and the relaxation granted by Ministry of

Corporate Affairs (‘MCA’) via Circular dated December 30,

2020 and pursuant to the Companies (Meetings of Board

and its Powers) Amendment Rules, 2021 dated June 15,

2021, all the Meetings of the Company were held through

Video Conferencing/Other Audio-Visual Means allowing

seamless participation in the Meeting. Formal notice of

the Meetings were issued at least 7 days in advance in

accordance with the provisions of the Act and Secretarial

Standard-1 issued by the Institute of Company Secretaries

of India (‘ICSI’) and no Meetings were held during the

year with shorter notice. The Board Agenda includes an

Action Taken Report comprising of actions emanating

from the Board Meetings and status updates thereof.

The Management endeavours to provide the Board with

sufficient information apart from the items as mandated for

discussion by the Board under Regulation 17(7) read with

Part A of Schedule II to the Listing Regulations. Through

various information being placed or presented at the Board

Meetings, the Board is kept well informed about the overall

functioning of the Company, which enables the Board

to contribute to the growth of the Company and helps

them to take informed decisions. Prior approval from the

Board is obtained for circulating the agenda items with

shorter notice for matters that form part of the Board and

Committee Agenda and are considered to be in the nature

of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information.

The Board periodically reviews the updates on the projects,

business performance, risk management, strategies,

people, processes, compliance with applicable laws and

other key affairs of the Company having impact on the

business. The Board is satisfied that plans are in place for

orderly succession for appointment to the Board and to

Senior Management Personnel.

The Agenda of the Meetings is set by the Company

Secretary in consultation with the Chairman, Managing

Director and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The

Company Secretary is responsible for collation, review

and distribution of all papers submitted to the Board and

Committees thereof for consideration. The Company

Secretary attends all the Meetings of the Board and its

Committees to assist the Board and its Committees on

Compliance and Governance principles and ensures

appropriate recording of minutes of the Meetings.

The adoption of a digital platform has enabled the

Company to conduct paperless Meetings, thereby

improving governance while simplifying the process of

conducting such Meetings. This involves conducting the

Meetings efficaciously, with the Board being able to access

information directly on their digital devices. The platform

meets high standards of security and integrity that are

required for storage and transmission of Board / Committee

agenda and pre-reads in electronic form.

The Independent Directors of the Company have also

appreciated the quality, quantity and timeliness of flow of

information between the Company Management and the

Board.

SECTION E: PRINCIPLE-WISE PERFORMANCE

Principle 1: Ethics, Transparency and Accountability

The Company is part of the RPG Group, a group that

has always stood for conducting business responsibly,

honestly and ethically. RPG Group has laid down the

Code of Corporate Governance and Ethics ('the Code')

applicable and adopted by the Company. The Code has

outlined the principles of corporate governance that will

apply in managing day to day affairs of the Company. The

Group has set up the Corporate Governance and Ethics

Committee ('the CGEC') which acts as a central body for

monitoring this Code. The Code, inter alia, prescribes that

all the activities and business affairs conducted by the

Company should be free from the influence of corruption

and bribery. The Code is extended to its subsidiaries, joint

venture and its business partners to a certain extent.

The Company believes in an environment of mutual respect,

fairness, transparency and integrity and is committed

to conduct its business with ethics and transparency.

Towards this goal, the Company has devised various

policies including the Code, covering principles of business

ID ethics@rpg.in is provided for reporting grievances and

violations of the said Code to the CGEC. The report of the

CGEC is placed before the Audit Committee as deemed

necessary.

Additionally, the Company has formulated a Code of

Conduct for Board Members and Senior Management for

ethical and transparent behaviour to achieve the highest

standards of corporate governance.

The Company has adopted a Whistle Blower Policy

which provides a framework through which the Directors

and employees as well as external stakeholders viz.

customers, vendors, suppliers, outsourcing partners

etc. may report, directly, their concern, suspected fraud

or any irregularity in the Company practices which

are in violation of the Code of Conduct prescribed in

this regard.

During FY 2021-22, 1 (one) complaint was received in

last quarter of FY 2021-22 by the Ethics Committee under

Whistle Blower Policy and Vigil Mechanism and the same

was pending at the end of the financial year.

Principle 2: Product Lifecycle Sustainability

The lifecycle of the product covers the entire value

chain from sourcing of raw materials to manufacturing,

distribution, consumer use and disposal. The Company

has focused on integrating sustainability at each stage of

the product life cycle. This concept is important and vital

to the Company’s success. The Company emphasizes on

concepts in designing and manufacturing of tyres enabled

with digital technology, extended mobility, tyres with longer

life, fuel-efficient environmentally friendly tyres which also

ensures customer safety and comfort.:

Risk

Exposure

Interest

The plan exposes the Company to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will

result in an increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in

an increase in the value of the liability (as shown in financial statements).

Investment

The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any

particular investment.

Demographic

The Company has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability.

The Company is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared

to the assumption.

Salary

Escalation

The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary

increase rate of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future

for plan participants from the rate of increase in salary used to determine the present value of

obligation will have a bearing on the plan's liability.

These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Demographic

Risk and Salary Risk.

assigning appropriate useful economic lives to respective

assets.

equipment capitalised by the Company to verify that

the assets capitalised meets the recognition criteria

set out in Ind AS 16

letter approving

the incentive amount in accordance with the respective

State Industrial Promotion Subsidy.

The Group has chosen to adjust grant under the Export

Promotion Capital Goods (‘EPCG’) scheme from the

carrying value of non-monetary asset pursuant to

amendment in Ind AS 20.

Export Incentive under Merchandise Export from India

Scheme (‘MEIS’) is recognised in the consolidated

statement of profit and loss as a part of other operating

revenues.

2.8 Taxes

2.8.1 Current tax

Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the

amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the

taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used

to compute the amount are those that are enacted or

substantively enacted, at the reporting date in India where

the Group operates and generates taxable income.

and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based

on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any

impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit or

loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not

reversed in subsequent periods.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating

unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed

of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation

is included in the carrying amount of the operation

when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill

disposed in these circumstances is measured based

on the relative values of the disposed operation and the

portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

2.4 Investment in joint venture and associate

A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby

the parties that have joint control of the arrangement

have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint

control is the contractually agreed sharing of control

of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions

about the relevant activities require unanimous consent

of the parties sharing control.

An associate is an entity over which the Group has

significant influence. Significant influence is the power

to participate in the financial and operating policy

decisions of the investee but is not control or joint

control over those policies.

The considerations made in determining whether joint

control are similar to those necessary to determine

control over the subsidiaries.

The Group’s investments in joint venture and associate

are accounted for using the equity method. Under

the equity method, the investment in a joint venture or

associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying

amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise

changes in the Group’s share of net assets of joint

venture or associate since the acquisition date.

Goodwill relating to joint venture or associate is

included in the carrying amount of the investment and

is not tested for impairment individually.

The consolidated statement of profit and loss reflects

the Group’s share of the results of operations of joint

venture and associate. Any change in OCI of those

investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In

addition, when there has been a change recognised

directly in the equity of joint venture or associate, the

Group recognises its share of any changes, when

applicable, in the statement of changes in equity.

Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions

between the Group and joint venture or associate

are eliminated to the extent of the interest in joint

venture or associate.

The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of a

joint venture and associate is shown on the face of the

consolidated statement of profit and loss.

The financial statements of joint venture and associate

are prepared for the same reporting period as the

Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring

the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

After application of the equity method, the Group

determines whether it is necessary to recognise an

impairment loss on its investment in its joint venture

or associate. At each reporting date, the Group

determines whether there is objective evidence that

the investment in joint venture or associate is impaired.

If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the

amount of impairment as the difference between the

recoverable amount of joint venture or associate and

its carrying value and then recognises the loss as

‘Share of profit of a joint venture and associate’ in the

statement of profit or loss.

2.5 Current versus non-current classification

The Group presents assets and liabilities in the Balance

sheet based on current/ non-current classification. An

asset is treated as current when it is:

•

Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or

consumed in normal operating cycle

•

Held primarily for the purpose of trading

•

Expected to be realised within twelve months after

the reporting period, or

•

Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from

being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at

least twelve months after the reporting period

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

•

It is expected to be settled in normal operating

cycle

•

It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

•

It is due to be settled within twelve months after the

reporting period, or

•

There is no unconditional right to defer the

settlement of the liability for at least twelve months

after the reporting period

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-

current assets and liabilities.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition

of assets for processing and their realisation in cash

and cash equivalents. The Group has identified twelve

months as its operating cycle.
