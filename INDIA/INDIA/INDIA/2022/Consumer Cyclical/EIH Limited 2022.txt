Dear Shareholders,

I am deeply honoured and

humbled to be bestowed with

the responsibility of Executive

Chairman of our iconic Company

and to follow in the footsteps of our

Founder, Rai Bahadur M.S. Oberoi

and our Chairman Emeritus, Mr.

P.R.S. Oberoi.

Mr. P.RS. Oberoi has been globally

recognised as one of the finest

hoteliers of his generation. His

legendary commitment to quality

and foresight set the Company

on a path of global recognition

and excellence. We are fortunate

to have been led by his wisdom,

attention to detail and deep

understanding of guest needs

and people aspirations. We are

also fortunate to have access to his

counsel and guidance that will help

us build on our reputation as one of

the world’s finest luxury hospitality

brands. His visionary leadership will

remain an inspiration for many of us

who had the privilege of working

closely with him and remain a

guiding force for the Company as

we chart our journey into the future.

At EIH, we are fortunate to have a

legacy that spans many generations.

Resilience is ingrained in our ethos

and work ethic. During a period

of uncertainty and sustained

headwinds, we continued on our

path of delivering world class

service while meeting challenges

and ensuring the well being

of our guests, employees, and

communities. This was made

possible by the unrelenting efforts

of our colleagues and partners to

protect health, value and customer

experience.

We owe our thanks to governments

and the medical fraternity across

the world for their swift action on

rolling out vaccination programs.

This undoubtedly shaped and

accelerated a recovery with

renewed confidence and a return to

relative normalcy.

Experience, Resilience,

Excellence

Our performance during the year

is consistent with our expectations,

and a strong improvement over

the previous year. An undiluted

commitment to customer

satisfaction and safety remain

cornerstones of our growth.

We are investing in our brand,

upskilling our people, improving

our infrastructure, and introducing

new locations and formats to bring

the best global experiences to

our guests in the signature Oberoi

style. Internationally validated safety

processes and procedures reinforce

our commitment to the highest

levels of hygiene and cleanliness.

Our technology interventions

are aimed at introducing next-

generation conveniences and are

designed to ensure we remain

the leading standard in luxury

hospitality and innovation.

Looking to the Future

We recognise and are constantly

reminded that climate change

remains one of the key challenges

for the travel and hospitality

industry. Our commitment to

decarbonisation of activities and

fostering sustainable behaviour

amongst travellers and tourists will

be key to ensuring the growth of

our industry and its contribution

to a more robust and regenerative

global future.

Your Company has prioritised

sustainability as one of our strategic

pillars and an increased emphasis

on sharpening our Environment,

Social and Governance (ESG)

goals. Guided by our Board, EIH

is executing on these ambitions

by proactively implementing our

sustainability policy.

EIH endeavours to meet

international benchmarks of

The year in review

The global travel and tourism

industry has historically been

sensitive to macro and micro

economic developments as well

as socio economic and political

influences. The financial year

was significantly impacted by

the uncertainty and volatility of

the pandemic. In spite of high

expectations, the post pandemic

recovery did not develop as

quickly as was hoped. Whilst the

second and third Covid-19 waves

prevented a strong return to travel,

geo-political tensions, global trade

disruptions and multiple supply

side economic events created

uncertainty for the global economy.

The current year is likely to see the

industry attain a value of US$8.4

trillion and an expected return to

its pre-pandemic levels of US$9.6

trillion in 2023. There will, in parallel,

be a far-reaching transformation

of the hospitality industry across

formats, customer experience,

technology and locations. The

industry is fast adapting and

continues to be proactive and

agile in its response with traditional

hospitality models also remaining

resilient and strong.

In India, tourism and hospitality

remains one of the largest service

industries, contributing an average

7% of GDP across the last decade.

Increased business activity, a rise

in domestic tourism, better road

and airport infrastructure across

the country are spurring a growth

in travel. Whilst the pandemic did

affect the first half of the year, we

started seeing green shoots in the

third quarter, culminating in strong

growth in the final three months,

aided by extended holidays and

positive consumer sentiment.

At EIH, we are fortunate to have a legacy that

spans many generations. Resilience is ingrained

in our ethos and work ethic. During a period

of uncertainty and sustained headwinds, we

continued on our path of delivering world class

service while meeting challenges and ensuring

the well being of our guests, employees, and

communities.

Arjun Singh Oberoi,

Executive Chairman

An unmatched legacy

EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

excellence, responsibility and

sustainability by deploying the most

energy efficient technology across

our hotels. We are also building

a bigger sense of community

through our commitment to

charitable engagements at local

and national levels. As we focus

on the next phase of growth, our

ESG ambition and approach will

continue to mature and a growing

number of hotels will operate on

renewable sources of energy for

their requirements.

In conclusion

EIH has always stood for excellence

across its 70 year history. I am

optimistic about the opportunities

that lie ahead of us and encouraged

by the goodwill that has been built

over many decades. Our experience

and expertise shall continue to

grow our business by building a

community of loyal guests across

multiple destinations. There is

renewed energy and optimism,

validated by a resilient performance

across two successive and

challenging years. We will, with the

help of our colleagues and partners,

continue to be at the forefront of

innovation and create lasting value

for our stakeholders.

My sincere thanks to members

of the Board for their guidance

and invaluable advice and to our

colleagues for their dedication and

commitment to excellence.

Finally, my thanks to you for your

unwavering and continuous

support. I am confident that we

shall continue to lead the way with

outstanding hotels and services

that have been the hallmark of our

exceptional Company and illustrious

history.:

Dear Shareholders,

The past few years have perhaps

indelibly altered the idea of

normal among businesses and

communities. On the one hand, it

has underscored new and unique

challenges that we now have to

solve and on the other hand, the

pace of change has thrown up

unprecedented opportunities.

To leverage these challenges and

opportunities, organisations need

to demonstrate quick thinking,

sharp strategy and innovative

business model.

At EIH, we are building on our

foundation of eight decades in

order to create pathways to win in

the new world. The financial year

2021-22 was a validation of a few of

these initiatives and a launchpad

for many of them. At all times, we

remained committed to the safety,

well-being and health of our guests

and colleagues, made possible

as a result of a courageous and

determined response to challenges

from our people and partners.

The hospitality industry was

severely impacted during the

Covid-19 years. However,

the industry has been able to

demonstrate remarkable resilience

to bounce back from this period

of unprecedented disruption.

This recovery was aided by

large-scale vaccination initiatives

and corresponding easing of

travel restrictions. This resulted in

significant demand for domestic

leisure tourism. For the first time

in two years, nationwide hotel

occupancies crossed 60% during

the fourth quarter of the year

under review. Increased economic

activity, celebrations and events

and a rebound in tourism provided

stimulus to the sector, aided by

improved consumer sentiment. We

also believe that the Government’s

Incredible India campaign and

extension of e-tourist visas to 171

and benefits for members. We

entered into a strategic alliance with

Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group for

Oberoi Hotels & Resorts, through

which both the groups will curate

new and exclusive experiences,

available at Oberoi and Mandarin

Oriental hotels. We introduced

‘Oberoi Select’ a subscription

based program that encouraged

and rewarded guests to select

Oberoi Hotels over other hotel

options. This was subsequently

extended to Trident Hotels with the

introduction of Trident Subscribe.

We also explored new avenues of

revenue growth, through a variety

of Food & Beverage innovations,

such as immunity enhancing menus,

in-suite celebrations, customised

culinary curations and private dining

experiences, among others.

During the year, we launched our

first ever café, Cou Cou at the Jio

World Drive, Bandra Kurla Complex.

A first-of-its-kind French style café, it

is built around The Oberoi Group’s

philosophy of quality and customer

obsession. It is a brand that looks

forward to building affinity with a

younger segment of customers.

Besides a focus on our Dharma,

and strategy, responsible and

sustainable is a key cornerstone

of our purpose. Sustainability

and social inclusion continue to

be important focus areas for our

organisation and our colleagues.

The Oberoi, Gurgaon and Trident,

Gurgaon have solar-run operations

to fulfil the electricity needs of

both hotels. We have also installed

captive solar power generation

projects at several other hotels that

are owned or managed by EIH.

At these hotels, ~30%-70% of the

power is generated through solar

energy. We continue to look for

opportunity for clean energy across

our hotels driven by favourable

state legislation for renewable

power.

We have successfully implemented

Project Saksham in various cities

where our hotels are located

in collaboration with SOS

Children's Villages of India. This

programme was launched to

provide marginalised children

with quality education and

healthcare. Additionally, we support

primary healthcare services, basic

countries will drive recovery in

inbound global tourism.

We delivered a strong rebound

in performance during the year

with revenues increasing by 92%

to `9,107.58 million, compared to

`4,736.42 million in FY 2020-21. This

was led by higher occupancy as

well as better Average Room Rates.

Despite business being impacted

by the onset of the second and

third waves, revenue improved

during the latter half of the year,

attributable to occupancies driven

by domestic travellers. There was

all-round sustained improvement

in operational efficiencies with

reduction in fixed costs by 15% and

overall reduction in expenses by

22% respectively in FY 2021-22 vs.

FY 2019-20. As a result, our EBITDA

came back to green at `298.91

million compared to a negative

figure of `2,336.73 million in the

previous year. During the financial

year 2021-22, we also initiated

careful evaluation of non-core assets

of the company and disposed one

such asset, the EIH Printing Press.

The Company’s net loss reduced

from `3,431.24 million in FY 2020-21

to `1,182.05 million in FY 2021-22.

One of the key enablers of this

performance is our alignment to

The Oberoi Dharma. Our guests

have and will always remain at the

heart of our efforts. With this in

mind, exacting standards on health

and safety were implemented

at the very beginning of the

pandemic and we listed detailed

safety measures on the Oberoi and

Trident websites. We imparted

extensive training to equip our

colleagues with best practices on

safety. We integrated technology

for high-touch processes at check-

in, check-out, at restaurants and

in room dining menus and billing,

besides centralising finance and

other back-office functions at The

Oberoi Centre of Excellence. Many

of these initiatives are now being

institutionalised into our way of

working for the future.

We embarked on several new

initiatives in line with our strategy

to ensure business continuity and

improved revenue. We launched

‘Oberoi One’, a unique guest

recognition programme aimed at

enhancing guest experiences at

our hotels with special privileges

At EIH, we are building on our foundation of

eight decades in order to create pathways to win

in the new world.

mechanism flows from The Oberoi Dharma, which states

that “We, as members of The Oberoi Group, are committed

to a conduct which is of the highest standards – ethical,

intellectual, financial and moral”. Adequate internal control

processes have been laid down at the entity level as well as

at the process level to provide an assurance on the orderly

and efficient conduct of operations, safeguarding of assets,

prevention and detection of fraud and errors, accurate and

timely completion of accounting records, timely preparation

of reliable financial information and compliance towards

laws and regulations.

Appropriate checks and balances have been built in

the internal control mechanisms to reflect its necessary

concomitance to the principle of governance without

affecting the ease of operations and management.

BUSINESS

As the owner and operator of leading luxury and five

responsible business practices which are fully aligned with

the principles enunciated under the Business Responsibility

Reporting framework on social, environmental and economic

responsibilities of business. The context of these principles

are embedded firmly within the “The Oberoi Dharma” and

“The Oberoi Group Mission” guiding our business practices

and corporate governance. This philosophy allows us to work

relentlessly towards delighting our guests and enriching the

lives of our employees through an open and participative

work culture and by providing opportunities for learning,

The Company continuously reviews and improves its policies

of service and business practices.

This Business Responsibility Report details the various

initiatives undertaken by the Group during the Financial

Year.

PRINCIPLE 1: Businesses should conduct and

govern themselves with Ethics, Transparency and

Accountability

The Company’s guiding philosophy on ethics, transparency

and accountability is articulated in the “The Oberoi Dharma”

and specific details are provided in the Company’s “Code

of Conduct and Ethics Policy”. The Oberoi Dharma extends

to the entire Company and is central to all that we do,

individually and as an organisation. It binds all employees

to act with honesty, integrity and ethics at all times. Every

year, Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and Senior

Management Personnel of the Company, give a written

affirmation of compliance to “The Oberoi Dharma”.

All employees are required to sign “The Code of Conduct

and Ethics Undertaking” at the time of joining the Company.

“The Code of Conduct and Ethics” espouses honest and

ethical conduct, while also emboldening the Company to

act strongly against:

• Theft, pilferage and fraud;

• Violence and abuse;

• Physical harm or assault;

• Sexual harassment of women at the workplace;

• Vandalism of Company property or assets.

The Company also has a “Whistleblower Policy” which

allows the Company to adhere to the highest standards of

ethical, moral and legal conduct of business operations.

The Policy provides a mechanism for the Directors and

employees of the Company to raise concerns regarding any

violations of legal or regulatory requirements, incorrectness

or misrepresentation of any financial statements, reports,

fraud etc. The Policy applies to all employees of the hotels,

business units and corporate office of “The Oberoi Group”

in India.

The Policy enables and facilitates an employee and other

stakeholders to report instances of misconduct, leakage

of unpublished price sensitive information, fraud, and

misdemeanour to the Whistle Officer, CEO or Chairperson

of the Audit Committee.

The implementation of the Whistleblower Policy is anchored

by the Vice President, Human Resources and is overseen by

the MD & CEO of the Company.:

Standalone Statement of Changes in Equity

for the year ended March 31, 2022:

letter dated April 4, 2012 requested MRL to account for

the entire amount of INR 1,361.93 Million provided to

MRL upto March 31, 2012 as ‘Advance Towards Equity’,

including INR 130.00 Million being the opening balance

of ‘Advance Towards Equity’. In view of the above, the

Company has shown the said amount of INR 1,361.93

Million as ‘Advance Towards Equity’ under Other non-

current financial assets in its books of account.

The High Court, by virtue of an order dated February

25, 2016 which was made available to the Company

in May 2016, decided not to interfere with the order

of the Arbitrator. The Company amongst others, have

preferred an appeal before the Division Bench of the

High Court of Himachal Pradesh. By an Order dated

June 27, 2016, Division Bench has stayed the Single

Bench Judge Order dated February 25, 2016 and directed

the parties to maintain status quo till the matter is

finally heard and disposed off. The matter is pending

before the Division Bench of the High Court of Himachal

Pradesh for adjudication.

(iii) Claims, provisions and contingent liabilities:

The Company has ongoing litigations with various

regulatory authorities and third parties with respect to

tax/legal matters. Where an outflow of funds is believed

to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome

of the dispute can be made based on management’s

assessment of specific circumstances of each dispute

and relevant external advice, management provides for

its best estimate of the liability. Contingent liabilities

are possible obligations whose existence will be

confirmed only on the occurrence or non-occurrence of

uncertain future events outside the Company’s control,

or present obligations that are not recognised because

it is not probable that a settlement will be required

or the value of such a payment cannot be reliably

estimated. These are subjective in nature and involve

judgement in determining the likely outcome of such

tax/legal matters.:

along with costs to sell amounting to INR 512.01 million (MUR 320.40 million) to arrive at fair value less costs

to sell. Accordingly, the Company has accounted for an impairment loss in investment in EIHFSL amounting to

INR 694.23 million during the year 2021-22 which has been recognised and disclosed as “Exceptional item” in

the standalone financial statements (refer note 40-Exceptonal items).

Management has assessed the conditions required to be satisfied for classification of investment as assets held for

sale as per Ind AS 105, “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” and has assessed that the

sale is highly probable and that no significant changes are expected to be made to the plan. The necessary steps

for sale of the aforementioned subsidiary including execution of the share purchase agreement and necessary

regulatory approvals will be taken and the management expects the sale to be completed in the next twelve months

from the end of the financial year. Accordingly, the investment in EIHFSL has been classified as “assets held for

sale” in the standalone financial statements.

(b) As at March 31, 2021, EIHFSL’s total liabilities had exceeded total assets, resulting in a shareholder’s deficit of

INR 262.67 million.

The Company had performed an impairment assessment at the previous year end and concluded that the carrying

amount exceeded the recoverable amount and accordingly, the Company had recognised an impairment loss of

INR 464.92 million during the previous year which had been disclosed under “Exceptional items” in the Statement

of Profit and Loss (refer note 40-Exceptional items).

The Company had assessed that the operations of EIHFSL represented a single cash-generating unit (CGU). The

recoverable amount of the CGU at the previous year end had been determined based on the value-in-use using

discounted value of projected future cash flows approved by the Board of Directors. The projected cashflows beyond

the five year period were extrapolated using a steady long term growth rate (estimated based on the country and

passenger growth rate). The future cash flows considered potential risks given the then economic environment

(COVID-19 Pandemic) and key assumptions, such as volume forecasts and margins. The discount rate was based

on the weighted average cost of capital comprising the risk-free rate based on 10 year yield of Government of

Mauritius bonds and a market participant risk premium and an additional risk premium to factor in the risk of

achieving the projections.:

Letter of Offer dated September 21, 2020 offered 53,794,768 shares by way

of Rights issue at a face value of INR 2 each and at a price of INR 65 per equity share (including a premium of INR

63 per equity share). The issue opened on September 29, 2020 and closed on October 13, 2020 with a subscription of

1.60 times the issue size. Subsequently, the Company allotted 53,794,768 shares on October 20, 2020, on the basis

of allotment approved by the Rights Issue Committee of the Board of Directors aggregating to INR 3,496.66 million

including securities premium of INR 3,389.07 million. Issue expenses incurred in connection with the Rights issue,

amounting to INR 32.02 million have been charged to securities premium.

Proceeds from the rights issue have been utilised towards the objects stated in the: Letter of Offer in the following

manner:

58 The Company had recognised an impairment loss in respect of certain property, plant and equipment amounting to

INR Nil (March 31, 2021: INR 24.93 million) on account of continuing losses in respect of, The Oberoi Motor Vessel

Vrinda, a luxury cruiser in the backwaters of Kerala. The same had been charged in the Statement of Profit and Loss,

which had been disclosed under “Exceptional items” (Refer Note 40-Exceptional Items).

The recoverable amount of the aforementioned luxury cruiser was determined by the Company’s management based

on a value-in-use calculation of the recoverable amount which uses cash flow projections and a discount rate of 11.47%

per annum. The recoverable amount has been calculated as per the provisions of Ind AS 36, “Impairment of Assets”.

Cash flow projections are based on the expected future occupancy, average room rate, expected payroll and other costs.
