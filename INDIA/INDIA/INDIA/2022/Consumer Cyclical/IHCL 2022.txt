Dear Shareholders,

With another year having passed us by, I begin this message with the

hope that this finds you and your loved ones safe and healthy.

The world has begun to gain respite from the pandemic and we are

clearly seeing light at the end of the tunnel. The results of the past

year are testament to the resilience and strength showcased by IHCL

and our people as we have continued to focus on and develop our

business on multiple fronts with rapid agility and flexibility.

I am pleased to present to you our fourth integrated annual report

that demonstrates the progress we have made and showcases our

ability to continue to create value for our stakeholders, now and in

the future.

Achieving industry-leading milestones

While FY 2020-21 was a year of reckoning, its challenges brought

with it many opportunities, unlocking which helped us tide through

what was a challenging start to FY 2021-22. IHCL not only survived but

emerged stronger, with a number of industry leading achievements

that are noteworthy.

We achieved global recognition with our iconic brand Taj being rated

as the World’s Strongest Hotel Brand by Brand Finance in 2021

– the first Indian brand to win this honour. This has been further

strengthened with Taj regaining its position as India’s Strongest

Brand across all sectors as per Brand Finance in 2022, the first being

in 2020; therefore further re-iterating the continued loyalty and trust

all our stakeholders have in us.

We outperformed and recorded industry-leading recovery over the

last two years with an increasing market share and widening RevPAR

premium. This was matched by industry-leading portfolio growth

with the signing of close to 100 new hotels and opening of over 40

hotels across brands in the past five years. Moreover, we recorded

the highest number of new hotels signed in two consecutive years

(2020 and 2021) as per HVS Anarock. Today, with an industry-leading

pipeline of over 60 hotels with 7,500+ rooms across brands, we

have continued to focus on portfolio growth while maintaining

an asset-light strategy, making us the fastest growing hospitality

company in India. This development strategy has seen us venture into

over 25 new destinations across India in the last five years to reach

an industry-leading footprint at 100 destinations across the country.

Our industry-leading recovery and growth have been complemented

with industry leading innovations such as -our new and

re-imagined businesses like Ginger, Qmin, amã Stays and Trails

among others.

All of these efforts, combined with the capabilities of our

strong hospitality ecosystem, saw us achieve an 85% growth

in our revenue over FY 2020-21 and record a positive EBITDA

of ₹ 560 crores in FY 2021-22. Importantly, we achieved our

highest ever EBITDA margin of 25.3% in Q4 of FY 2021-22

despite the quarter being impacted by the Omicron wave.

With the aim to strengthen our balance sheet, the company

raised ~ ₹ 4,000 crores through rights issue and QIP, thereby

becoming net cash positive. In addition, we simplified

our holding structure with the acquisition of 100% shares

of Roots Corporation Limited, making it a wholly owned

subsidiary of IHCL.

Putting the extra in extraordinary – TAJ and PAATHYA

While our focus on business performance has remained

unwavering, we have not lost sight of our values of

Trust, Awareness and Joy, which guide our every action.

This includes keeping community at the heart of all that we

do, inspired by the philosophy of our founder. With COVID

leaving a significant impact on lives over the course of two

years, IHCL was humbled to be able to play a small role in

joining the nation in its battle against the pandemic. We

not only provided over 4.5 million meals to healthcare and

migrant workers across the country but also hosted over

125,000 bed nights for the medical fraternity at our hotels.

With the firm belief that the time to chart a new tomorrow

for the Indian travel and tourism industry – one that is

more sustainable and inclusive – is now, IHCL has launched

Paathya, an industry-leading ESG+ framework. Under the six

pillars of Environmental Stewardship, Social Responsibility,

Excellence in Governance, Preserving Heritage, Value Chain

Transformation, and Sustainable Growth, IHCL will drive all

its sustainability and social impact measures under Paathya.

This includes setting robust targets that we will endeavour to

achieve by 2030.

Our focus on encouraging and driving diversity both,

within and outside the organisation, has seen us launch

‘She Remains The Taj’, a holistic framework of women-centric

initiatives for all stakeholders including guests, employees,

partners and the community. This encompasses enhanced

experiences for women travellers at our hotels, in addition to

setting a goal to raise women participation in our workforce

to 25% by 2025, and supporting women led businesses

and partners.

In our continued effort to unlock synergies and tap into

the potential of the Tata ecosystem, this year also saw IHCL

"With Ahvaan 2025, it is our

objective to scale new pinnacles of

success while staying true to the

trust that our stakeholders have

bestowed upon us."

embark on a pioneering journey with the super app – Tata

Neu. As a founding member of Tata Neu, we migrated our

global loyalty program, Taj InnerCircle, to NeuPass, allowing

us to leverage the app’s vast reach and engage with millions of

Indian consumers.

IHCL has also been a leading voice of the industry, be it our

active participation through the Hotel Association of India

(HAI) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) or our

constant dialog with the government, which has resulted in

a number of landmark changes in governance, policies and

procedures – an example being the granting of industry status

to hotels by some state governments.

Geared for the future – AHVAAN 2025

IHCL will continue to march forward as we chart an ever

stronger and better future. The beginning of this future

is marked by the launch of IHCL’s strategic roadmap for

profitable growth – Ahvaan 2025.

A rallying call to action, Ahvaan 2025 will see us re-engineer

our margins, re-imagine our brandscape and re-structure

our portfolio. Guided by the vision of Ahvaan 2025, we will

aim to sustain our growth momentum to reach a portfolio of

300 hotels. We will continue to stay focused on profitability

with a target to achieve 33% EBITDA margin by FY 2025-26.

We will continue to re-engineer margins with an emphasis on

sustained revenue growth, cost optimisation and operational

excellence. We will further strengthen the balance sheet with

focus on free cash flows and be a zero net debt company.

Under our re-imagined brandscape, Ginger will continue to

be an important growth vehicle and will scale to 125 hotels

while amã Stays & Trails will grow to a portfolio of over

500 properties. Qmin will expand to 25 plus cities. We will

also re-structure our portfolio with asset light growth,

simplification and monetisation to achieve a 50:50 mix

between our owned/leased and managed hotels.

Ahvaan 2025 will help us further accelerate IHCL’s journey

of re-imagination with our iconic and strongest brand Taj,

our ESG+ framework Paathya, and a strong focus on digital

acting as key enablers. As we embark on the next frontier of

our journey, we look forward to your continued support as

always and extend our sincere thanks for being our biggest

brand ambassadors.

Sincerely,

Puneet Chhatwal: Managing

Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, IHCL

We launched a well-founded strategy for our environmental and social

impact measures under the title ‘Paathya’. Derived from the Sanskrit

term प ्य, which means a path, this framework encapsulates initiatives

aimed at bringing a positive change based on our organisation’s core

values of Trust of all stakeholders, Awareness around the needs of our

ecosystem and Joy at heart.

Paathya has taken the century-old legacy of IHCL and forged a journey

that focuses on Environmental Stewardship, Social Responsibility,

Excellence in Governance, Preserving Heritage, Value Chain

Transformation, and Sustainable Growth.

We defined several short- and long-term goals to be fulfilled

by 2030 under Paathya.

Sustainability governance

We have developed a robust, cross-functional ESG governance framework, which is an integral part of the overall strategy as it

deals with the accountability of implementing the ESG strategy. This framework is aimed at assisting internal stakeholders to steer

and implement the ESG strategy across our hotels along with elaborations on respective roles and responsibilities.

Cybersecurity and information governance

With the world shifting to the digital paradigm, a trend that

was further accelerated due to the pandemic, there is a

rise in data security and cyber related risks. Our business

is governed with robust and comprehensive Information

Technology (IT) policies and procedures, which cover

information security management as per ISO 27001, General

Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Payment Card Industry

(PCI) compliance, among others. Ensuring safe and protected

business operations is our utmost priority.

Our enterprise risk management framework helps us identify

the information security risks and mitigation processes.

Our Board and senior management regularly review the

identified risks and closely monitor the information security

landscape and prevailing threats across the globe while

lending expertise on various security projects. We undertake

regular audits by third-party providers and implement

their recommendations to ensure that our risk register,

policies and processes are keeping our information security

landscape secure.

Apart from these baseline security measures, we deployed

advanced technology to protect our hotels and corporate

offices from data intrusions. These include firewalls, web

filtering tools and VPN, among others across all hotels

and offices.

We follow a rigorous vulnerability assessment schedule

to ensure resilience against cyberattacks and protect the

information stored in servers and endpoints. We subscribed

to cyber risk insurance to safeguard the interest of our

stakeholders, in case of an unprecedented situation.

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2022

Note 1: Corporate Information

The Indian Hotels Company Limited (“IHCL” or the “Company”),

is primarily engaged in the business of owning, operating &

managing hotels, palaces and resorts.

The Company is domiciled and incorporated in India in 1902

and has its registered office at Mandlik House, Mandlik Road,

Mumbai – 400 001, India. It is promoted by Tata Sons Private

Limited (formerly Tata Sons Limited), which holds a significant

stake in the Company.

The financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022

were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for

issue on April 27, 2022.

Note 2: Basis of Preparation, Critical Accounting

Estimates and Judgements, Significant Accounting

Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The financial statements have been prepared on the following

basis:

(a) Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in

accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”)

as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act,

2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules, 2015 and other provisions of the Companies Act,

2013 as amended from time to time.

(b) Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared on

a historical cost basis, except for certain financial

instruments which are measured at fair value at the

end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally

based on the fair value of the consideration given in

exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price

that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer

a liability in an orderly transaction between market

participants at the measurement date.

All assets and liabilities are classified as current and

non-current as per company’s normal operating cycle

of 12 months which is based on the nature of business

of the Company. Current Assets do not include elements

which are not expected to be realised within 1 year and

Current Liabilities do not include items which are due

after 1 year, the period of 1 year being reckoned from

the reporting date.

(c) Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of these financial statements in

conformity with the recognition and measurement

principles of Ind AS requires management to make

judgements, estimates and assumptions, that affect the

reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures

relating to contingent liabilities as at the date of the

financial statements and the reported amounts of

income and expenses for the years presented. Actual

results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed

on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates

are recognised in the period in which the estimates are

revised and in any future periods affected.

In particular, information about significant areas

of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements

in applying accounting policies that have the most

significant effect on the amounts recognised in the

financial statements pertain to:

• Useful lives of property, plant and equipment

and intangible assets: The Company has estimated

useful life of each class of assets based on the

nature of assets, the estimated usage of the asset,

the operating condition of the asset, past history

of replacement, anticipated technological changes,

etc. The Company reviews the useful life of property,

plant and equipment and Intangible assets as at the

end of each reporting period. This reassessment may

result in change in depreciation expense in future

periods.

• Impairment testing: Property, plant and equipment,

Right-of-Use assets and intangible assets that are

subject to depreciation/amortisation are tested

for impairment periodically including when events

occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the

recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is

less than its carrying value. The recoverable amount

of cash generating units is higher of value-in-use and

fair value less cost to sell. The calculation involves

use of significant estimates and assumptions which

includes turnover and earnings multiples, growth

rates and net margins used to calculate projected

future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future

economic and market conditions.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2022

Note 1. Corporate information

The Indian Hotels Company Limited (“IHCL” or the “Company”),

and its subsidiaries (referred collectively as the “Group”) is

primarily engaged in the business of owning, operating &

managing hotels, palaces and resorts. These consolidated

financial statements of the Group also include the Group’s

interest in associates and joint ventures.

The Company is domiciled and incorporated in India in 1902

and has its registered office at Mandlik House, Mandlik Road,

Mumbai –400 001, India. It is promoted by Tata Sons Private

Limited (Formerly Tata Sons Limited), which holds a significant

stake in the Company.

These consolidated financial statements for the year ended

March 31, 2022 were approved by the Board of Directors and

authorised for issue on April 27, 2022.

Note 2. Basis of preparation, Principles of

consolidation and equity accounting, Critical

accounting estimates and judgements, Significant

accounting policies and Recent accounting

pronouncements

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared

on the following basis:

(a) Statement of compliance

These consolidated financial statements have been

prepared in accordance with Ind AS as prescribed

under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read

with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015 and other provisions of the Companies Act, 2013

as amended from time to time.

(b) Basis of preparation

The Consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain

financial instruments that are measured at fair value

at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is

generally based on the fair value of the consideration

given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is

the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid

to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between

market participants at the measurement date.

All assets and liabilities are classified as current and non-

current as per company’s normal operating cycle of 12

months which is based on the nature of business of the

Group. Current Assets do not include elements which

are not expected to be realised within 1 year and Current

Liabilities do not include items which are due after 1 year,

the period of 1 year being reckoned from the reporting

date.

(c) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting

(i)

Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities (including structured entities)

over which the Group has control. The Group controls

an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to,

variable returns from its involvement with the entity and

has the ability to affect those returns through its power

to direct the relevant activities of that entity. Subsidiaries

are fully consolidated from the date on which control is

transferred to the Group.

The Group combines the financial statements of the

parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like

items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses.

Intra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains

on transactions between entities within the Group are

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless

the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of

the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries

have been changed where necessary to ensure

consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of

subsidiaries are shown separately in the Consolidated

Statement of Profit and Loss, Consolidated Statement of

Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Balance Sheet

respectively.

(ii) Joint ventures, associates and equity method

accounting

Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the

parties that have joint control of the arrangements have

rights to the net assets and obligations for the liabilities,

relating to the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures

are accounted for using the equity method, after initially

being recognised at cost in the Consolidated Balance

sheet.

Associates are entities over which the Group has

significant influence but not control or joint control.

Investments in associates are accounted for using

the equity method of accounting, after initially being

recognised at cost.
