Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present to you the

Annual report for the fiscal 2021-22.

During FY 2021-22, the macroeconomic

landscape proved to be far more volatile

than anticipated. While the global

economy recovered more quickly than

expected and consumer sentiments

improved considerably, the impact of

Covid-19 was evident on the economic

environment as well as on businesses.

Disruptions in the global supply chain

and widespread inflation impacted

businesses globally. While the economy

has not been able to overcome the

turbulence completely, new challenges

in the form of the Russia-Ukraine war

aggravated geopolitical stress. Further,

supply chain disruptions resulted in

surging commodity prices.

In India, swift fiscal and monetary policy

action in the first half of the fiscal acted

as a tailwind for a visible economic

recovery in the second half of the year.

However, despite staging a strong

rebound, with a GDP growth that was

the fastest among major economies,

the geopolitical upheavals impacted

India’s growth prospects for the near

term, with inflation continually treading

over positive sentiments.

For the textile sector, the fiscal 2021-

22 was a year of recovery due to pent

up demand effect. However, the same

could not be sustained for long due to

rising cotton prices and reduction in

cotton production in India. These factors

spoiled the prospects of a full recovery

in the first half of current financial year

2022-23. It is apprehended that the

same may continue for the rest of the

year also amidst uncertainty and high

inflation all over the world. The poor

demand from global retail chain in terms

of lower orders and prices which do not

absorb the rise in raw material prices

confirm this apprehension. Accordingly,

the textile manufacturers are forced to

scale down the production capacities

and Vardhman is no exception to this

broad trend.

The global cotton production outlook

especially in USA and Pakistan is not

encouraging and may put strain on

global cotton supply and cotton prices.

To sail through this difficult period

we would be optimising production

capacities in sync with demand and

improvement in operational efficiencies.

At Vardhman, we place a strong

emphasis on making a positive

contribution to society. With a strong

focus on achieving sustainable

development, we aspire to make

a positive and lasting difference to

people’s lives. We are constantly trying

to improve the infrastructure of schools,

hospitals, and communities where we

operate, to help marginalised sections

gain access to safe and hygienic

living conditions, good education and

healthcare facilities.

In the end, I would like to extend my

gratitude to all our stakeholders for their

continued support and confidence in us

which inspires us to continuously strive

hard to achieve better performance.

Regards,

Shri Paul Oswal

2.22 Leases

The Group as Lessee

The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases

for land and buildings. The Group assesses whether a

contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A

contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the

right to control the use of an identified asset for a period

of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a

contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified

asset, the Group assesses whether: (i) the contract involves

the use of an identified asset (ii) the Group has substantially

all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through

the period of the lease and (iii) the Group has the right to

direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group

recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding

lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a

lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months

or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these

short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the

lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line

basis over the term of the lease.

Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend

or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term.

ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options

when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost,

which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability

adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the

commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct

costs less any lease incentives and an estimate of costs to

be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the

underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on

which it is located. They are subsequently measured at cost

less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use

assets

are

depreciated

from

the

commencement date on a straight-line basis over the

shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying

asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability

whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that

their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the

purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e.

the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-

in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless

the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely

independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the

recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating

Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.:

managing director

and no significant business decisions relating to debts

restructuring and business restructuring in the above

said associate can be implemented without prior

approval of the Company.

2.24.2

Key sources of uncertainty

In the application of the Group accounting policies,

the management of the Group is required to make

judgements, estimates and assumptions about the

carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not

readily apparent from other sources. The estimates

and associated assumptions are based on historical

experience and other factors that are considered to be

relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are

reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting

estimates are recognised in the period in which the

estimate is revised if the revision affects only that

period or in the period of the revision and future periods

if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The following are the areas of estimation uncertainty

and critical judgements that the management has

made in the process of applying the Group's accounting

policies and that have the most significant effect on the

amounts recognised in the financial statements:

2.24.3

Defined benefit plans

The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-

employment benefits and the present value of such

obligation are determined using actuarial valuations.

An actuarial valuation involves making various

assumptions that may differ from actual developments

in the future. These include the determination of the

discount rate, future, salary increases, mortality rates

and future pension increases. Due to the complexities

involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a

defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes

in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at

each reporting date.

2.24.4

Useful lives of depreciable tangible assets and

intangible assets

Management reviews the useful lives of depreciable/

amortisable assets at each reporting date.

As at March 31, 2022 management assessed that the

useful lives represent the expected utility of the assets

to the Group.

2.24.5

Fair Value measurements and valuation processes

Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured

at fair value for financial reporting purposes. The Board

of Directors of the respective Company approves the

fair values determined by the Chief Financial Officer

of the respective Company including determining the

appropriate valuation techniques and inputs for fair

value measurements.

In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the

Group uses market-observable data to the extent

is available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available,

the Group engages third party qualified valuers to

perform the valuation. The Chief financial officer works

closely with the qualified external valuers to establish

appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the

model.

Information about the valuation techniques and inputs

used in determining the fair value of various assets and

liabilities are disclosed in notes 37.:

The amounts shown above represents the best possible estimates arrived at on the basis of available information. The

uncertainties and possible reimbursements are dependent on the outcome of the different legal processes which have been

invoked by the Group or the claimants as the case may be and therefore cannot be predicted accurately or relate to present

obligations that arise from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle or a

reliable estimate cannot be made. The Group has been advised that it has strong legal positions against such disputes.

d.

The Payment of Bonus (Amendment) Act 2015, notified on December 31, 2015, had revised the thresholds for coverage

of employee eligible for Bonus and also enhanced the ceiling limits for computation of bonus retrospectively from April 1,

2014. Based on legal opinion, the Company has filed a writ petition in Hon’ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana contesting its

retrospective applicability and the said jurisdictional High Court has granted stay on its retrospective operation. In view thereof,

the Parent Company has not provided differential bonus pertaining to the period from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015 amounting

to H 8.21 crores. However, the Company has provided/paid bonus w.e.f. April 1, 2015 according to the amended provisions of

the Payment of Bonus (Amendment) Act 2015.

e.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court in a ruling during the year 2019 had passed a judgement on the definition and scope of ‘Basic Wages’

under the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provision Act, 1952. Pending issuance of guidelines by the regulatory

authorities on the application of this ruling, the impact on the Group, if any, cannot be ascertained. The Group will update its

provision, on receiving further clarity on this subject matter.
