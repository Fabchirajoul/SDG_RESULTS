Dear Shareholders,

This is a very special year for all of us. The financial year

2021-22 marks the completion of 25 years of your Company’s

operations. From being incorporated on 20 September 1996

and opening its first Club Mahindra resort at Munnar (Kerala)

in April 1998, your Company now has close to 266,000

members and a room inventory of 4,568 units spread across

84 resorts. Together with its Finnish subsidiary, Holiday Club

Resorts (HCR), it has over 325,000 members and provides

them access to over 100 resorts in India, Asia, Europe and

the USA. In these 25 years, your Company has become the

largest vacation ownership company in terms of membership

outside the USA.

Like you, I am honoured to be a part of this journey.

When I wrote my last: letter to you, India was still in the deadly

second wave (Delta) of the Covid-19 pandemic. I am happy

to share with you that your Company overcame the serious

odds created by both Delta and Omicron waves, to deliver

strong performance in 2021-22.

This is attributable to a couple of factors: (i) the flexibility and

adaptability of your Company including its ability to scale-up

and scale-down resort operations depending on the demand,

the implicit trust in the Club Mahindra brand, continuing

commitment towards its members and the inherent strength

and resilience of the Company’s business model; and (ii) the

huge demand for travel as families headed for Club Mahindra

Resorts throughout the country to rediscover the joy of

vacationing with their near and dear ones.

Let me now focus on three important aspects. First, your

Company’s operational and financial results. Second, its

commitment to health, safety and the environment across

all its properties. And third, a brief snapshot of where your

Company is expected to be in the next few years.

Your Company, in spite of all uncertainties due to the

second and third waves of Covid-19, added 12,764 members

to its vacation ownership business in 2021-22, taking the

cumulative membership base to 265,980 as on 31 March

2022. It added 385 rooms on a gross basis during the financial

year 2021-22, taking the total room inventory to 4,568 units

across 84 resorts. With this, your Company has added over

800 room units in the last two years, which you will agree, is a

commendable achievement and I would like to congratulate

the management for this accomplishment.

Your Company also expanded its international footprint

during the year by adding destinations such as Bali (Indonesia),

Bentota (Sri Lanka) and Pattaya (Thailand). Further, through

its ‘Horizon’ Holiday Exchange Programme, your Company is

offering stays in over 280 top-rated hotels and resorts across

more than 100 locations in India and abroad.

Improvement in your Company’s operational performance

showed up in superior financial results for 2021-22. These are

given below.

•

Standalone Performance: Total income grew by 17.8%

to ` 1,070.7 crore in 2021-22. Profit before taxes (PBT)

grew by 20.1% to ` 203.5 crore in 2021-22. Profit after

taxes (PAT) grew by 20.3% to ` 151.3 crore in 2021-22.

Diluted EPS increased from ` 6.30 in 2020-21 to ` 7.55

in 2021-22.

•

Consolidated Performance: Total income increased by

18% to ` 2,178.9 crore in 2021-22. PBT, after including

share in profit/loss of joint ventures and associate

companies, improved to ` 110.6 crore in 2021-22. PAT

stood at ` 67.6 crore in 2021-22, versus a net loss of

` 14 crore in the previous year. Accordingly, the diluted

EPS was ` 3.37 in 2021-22, compared to (` 0.66) in

2020-21. This is despite of multiple waves of Covid-19

in Finland during the year, affecting both timeshare

construction and sales at HCR. Following a very good

recovery in resort operations, after the restrictions on

restaurants, spa, sports and indoor activities were eased

off from mid-February-2022, HCR reported a creditable

performance, registering almost break-even EBITDA in

2021-22.

Please allow me to congratulate the management on your

behalf for this creditable performance. That it came in the

most challenging of times, particularly for the travel and

tourism industry, makes it truly special. During the year, your

Company also issued Bonus Shares in the ratio of 1:2 i.e. one

bonus share for every two shares held by the shareholders to

reward them on the occasion of the Company’s silver jubilee.

Dear Shareholders,

Your Directors are pleased to present their Twenty Sixth

Report together with the Audited Financial Statements of

your Company for the year ended March 31, 2022.

1.

Operations and Financial Overview

Your Company was founded in the year 1996 and during the

year under review, it has reached a milestone of completing

the journey of 25 years. Your Company has been a leading

player in the leisure hospitality industry in India and with

its subsidiary Holiday Club Resorts Oy (“HCR”), is the largest

vacation ownership company outside the USA. Being the

Silver Jubilee year, the year under review was one of the

best years in the history of the Company. Though the

financial year 2021-22 started amidst strict lock down in

India with severe restrictions on travel and economic activity

to contain the health emergency posed by the second

wave of Covid-19 (Delta wave), your Company registered a

creditable performance given the subdued macroeconomic

environment and relatively poor consumer sentiment towards

discretionary spending.

The Delta wave at beginning of the year under review was

more severe than the third wave of Covid-19 (Omicron wave)

in January 2022. Your Company was better prepared to deal

with the challenges posed by both the waves of Covid-19

and was able to restart and ramp-up operations rapidly

once the restrictions were lifted, minimising their impact

on performance. Your Company had developed processes

and capabilities in the financial year 2020-21 to operate in

pandemic conditions for ensuring business continuity under

lockdowns. These resulted in a considerable improvement in

the performance during the year under review.

The Company has delivered a strong operational and financial

performance during the year under review and has surpassed

the pre-pandemic levels with high level of resort occupancies,

high resort revenues along with a healthy growth in member

additions and room inventory. The cash position has further

improved during the year under review. The creditable

performance of your Company brings out the resilience of its

business model and at the same time highlights its ability to

move swiftly in tough conditions. It also underscores the trust

and confidence its members repose in the Mahindra brand,

which is a crucial differentiator and contributes immensely to

your Company’s performance in these uncertain times.

During the year under review, your Company added 12,764

new members to its vacation ownership business. Addition in

the members is a result of continued success of Company’s

pull-based digital and referral leads as well as reaching out to

prospects by way of engagement through more innovative

technological platforms, alliances and corporate partnerships.

During the year under review, your Company has been

reinventing its marketing strategy around digital formats and

platforms as media consumption has shifted towards mobile

devices.

During the year under review, your Company added 385

rooms on a gross basis, taking the total inventory to 4,568

room units across its 84 resorts as of March 31, 2022. Along

with HCR’s 33 resorts, your Company is offering the Club

Mahindra members an access to over 100+ resorts in India,

Asia, Europe and USA.

Your Company’s total income (including other income) was

` 1,070.72 crore in 2021-22 compared to ` 908.76 crore in

2020-21. During the year under review, your Company sold

its entire stake in Nreach Online Services Private Limited

(“Nreach”), resulting in a gain of ` 26.30 crore, which is

reflected in Other Income for the year. Other Income for

2021-22 also includes an income of ` 12.40 crore (` 30.75

crore in the previous year) resulting from waiver of lease rents

due to the pandemic and interest income from Income Tax

refund of ` 4.40 crore.

Profit Before Tax (PBT) grew to ` 203.53 crore in 2021-22

from ` 169.46 crore in 2020-21. PBT (excluding profit on

sale of investment in Nreach, lease rent waiver and interest

on income tax refund) also grew to ` 160.40 crore in

2021-22 from PBT (excluding lease rent waiver) of ` 138.70

crore in 2020-21. Profit After Tax (PAT) grew to ` 151.30 crore in

2021-22 from ` 125.76 crore in 2020-21. Diluted Earnings Per

Share (EPS) for 2021-22 stood at ` 7.55 compared to ` 6.30 in

2020-21.

Further,

your

Company’s

Consolidated

total

income

(including other income) was ` 2,178.85 crore in 2021-22

compared to ` 1,847.26 crore in 2020-21. Consolidated PBT

was ` 110.56 crore in 2021-22 compared to ` 2.47 crore in

2020-21. Consolidated PAT was ` 67.64 crore in 2021-22

compared to Consolidated Loss After Tax of ` 14.00 crore in

2020-21. Consolidated Diluted EPS for 2021-22 stood at ` 3.37

compared to (` 0.66) in 2020-21.

During the year under review, your Company has issued

Bonus Shares in the proportion of 1:2 i.e. 1 (one) Bonus Equity

Share of ` 10 each for every 2 (two) fully paid-up Equity

Shares of ` 10 each held, by capitalizing ` 66.82 crore from
