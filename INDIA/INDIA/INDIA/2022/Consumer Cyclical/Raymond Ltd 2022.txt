Dear Shareholders,

The emergence of a new

world order seems palpable

with geopolitical shifts in

a bid to evaluate lucrative

economic alternatives which

shall define the coming

decades for the global

economy.

Chairman and: Managing Director’s message

Shaping A Stronger Tomorrow

Gautam Hari Singhania

Managing Director,

Raymond Ltd.:

Dear Shareholders,

In today’s age, corporations

across the world are

confronted with the challenge

of achieving the right balance

of leveraging opportunities

while averting volatility that

threatens supply chains.

With the pandemic altering

geopolitical definitions, the

time is opportune for India

to grab the centre stage to

emerge as a preferred factory

for the world.

Group Chief Financial Officer's message

Catapulting the rise

of new age Raymond

Amit Agarwal

Group Chief Financial

Officer

revenues of `3,648 Crores. Highest

consolidated EBITDA was achieved

with `881 Crores and a margin of 13.9%

and net income `260 Crores during

the year.

Building Cost Resilience

As an organisation that is at an

inflexion point, sustaining financial

discipline was crucial for substantial

reduction in our operating costs by

`453 Crores, which were reduced

by 20% as compared to pre-COVID

levels of FY19-20. Additionally, in

an endeavour to maintain healthy

liquidity, NWC days were lower by

over 50% to 45 days in March-22 from

peak levels of 98 days in Sep-19. The

above measures resulted in `940

Crores of net debt reduction through

free cash flow generation during the

the pandemic impacted period of

FY20-21 and FY21-22. Building financial

resilience is a way of life at Raymond

and we strive to create a debt-free

company that thrives in the dynamic

age.

Retail Reset in the New

Normal

Consumer spending during the

second half of the year was back with

a vengeance. Barring the first quarter

that was impacted due to second

wave of pandemic, the resumption

in economic activity and re-opening

of physical workspaces, celebrations

and weddings contributed to positivity

in the market. Branded Textiles

witnessed growth across categories

and emerged as a viable choice as

gifting options at attractive price:

managing director, all of them

constitute as chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’).

(o) Borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at net of transaction

costs incurred and measured at amortised cost. Any

difference between the proceeds (net of transaction

costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in

the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the

period of the borrowings using the effective interest

method.

Preference shares, which are mandatorily redeemable

on a specific date are classified as liabilities. The

dividend on these preference shares is recognised in

Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as finance

costs.

(p) Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs consist of interest, ancillary costs and

other costs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

Interest and other borrowing costs attributable to

qualifying assets are capitalised upto the date such

assets are ready for their intended use. Other interest

and borrowing costs are charged to Statement of Profit

and Loss.

(q) Provisions and contingent liabilities

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a

present legal or constructive obligation as a result of

past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources

will be required to settle the obligation and the

amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not

recognised for future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of

management’s best estimate of the expenditure

required to settle the present obligation at the end

of the reporting period. The discount rate used to

determine the present value is a pre tax rate that

reflects current market assessments of the time value

of money and the risks specific to the liability. The

increase in the provision due to the passage of time is

recognised as interest expense.

Contingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect of

possible obligations that arise from past events but

their existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or

non occurrence of one or more uncertain future events

not wholly within the control of the Group or where

any present obligation cannot be measured in terms of

future outflow of resources or where a reliable estimate

of the obligation cannot be made.

A contingent asset is disclosed, where an inflow of

economic benefits is probable. The Group shall not

recognize a contingent asset unless the recovery is

virtually certain.

(r) Revenue recognition

The Group derives revenues primarily from sale of

manufactured goods, traded goods and related

services. The Group has also engaged in real estate

property development.

Revenue is recognized on satisfaction of performance

obligation upon transfer of control of promised

products or services to customers in an amount that

reflects the consideration we expect to receive in

exchange for those products or services.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price,

which is the consideration, adjusted to discounts,

incentives and returns, etc., if any.

The Group operates a loyalty programme for the

customers and franchisees of the Group for the

sale of goods. The customers accumulate points for

purchases made which entitles them to discount on

future purchases. A contract liability for the award

points is recognized at the time of the sale. Revenue is

recognized when the points are redeemed or on expiry.

The expenditure of loyalty programme is netted-off to

revenue.

The Group recognises provision for sales return, based

on the historical results, measured on net basis of

the margin of the sale. Therefore, a refund liability,

included in other current liabilities, are recognized for

the products expected to be returned.:
