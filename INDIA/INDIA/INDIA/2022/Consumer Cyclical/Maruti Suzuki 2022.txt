Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Managing Director and Vice Chairman when your company was incorporated. The joint

venture with Suzuki was created under his leadership. He was the person who guided all of us during our initial

years and laid the foundations for establishing a new management culture that led to the future success of your

company. I personally learnt a great deal from him and will always remember him with deep respect.

We have also had a change in our: Managing

letter by paying tribute to our first MD and Vice-Chairman, Mr. V.

Krishnamurthy, who laid down the foundation of this successful organisation, which

completely modernised and expanded the Indian automobile Industry. He will always

have a special place in the history of this Company.

The year FY 2021-22 was the last year of my 9 years long stint in the Company as MD.

The Board has kindly elevated me to Executive Vice Chairman position. In the glorious

history of 40 years of the Company, I got a chance to contribute to almost one fourth of

its time.

I vividly remember my first media interview after taking the role of MD in 2013. A journalist

asked me about my plans for Maruti. I told him that I wanted to write a new chapter in the

glorious history of this great Company. I came with that thinking.

How much I was able to succeed in writing a new chapter, the stakeholders of the

company: customers, employees, shareholders, business partners, journalists etc. will

be able to judge better.

My first priority was to take the employee-company relations to an altogether new level.

The company took various initiatives to enhance the bond between management and

workmen and make them feel part of one family. I personally used to meet the workmen

union every month without exception to understand and address their expectations and

to convey them the business situation. This helped me better understand their needs and

as a result some industry leading welfare measures like housing scheme, post-retirement

medical scheme, best in class health-care support etc. were implemented. Today, if

I look back, the enthusiasm, with which the employees had supported the Company

in successfully navigating several significant disruptions, is a testimony to healthy and

harmonious industrial relations.

The other major task was to manage size and growth without diluting management’s

attention to details. This led to the establishment of Suzuki Motor Gujarat (SMG), a 100%

subsidiary of SMC to produce cars for the Company on no-profit-no-loss basis. With

this support coming from SMC, the Company could better focus on customer-centric

initiatives. This unique arrangement was thought to strengthen the future competitive

position of the Company. I thank our minority shareholders for approving the SMG

project with overwhelming majority. Within a 5-year period, 3 production lines were

established in SMG with a combined production capacity of 7.5 lakh cars per annum.

MESSAGE FROM MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO

This is my first address to you after taking the role of MD & CEO of the Company. First,

I would like to thank and compliment my predecessor, Mr. Kenichi Ayukawa for his

valuable contribution in strengthening the Company. He wrote a new chapter in the

history of Maruti Suzuki by transforming many business areas of the Company and

enhancing the quality of business. During his tenure of 9 years as MD, the Company

faced rough weather on many occasions but navigated smoothly under his able

leadership and kept progressing. It is my honour and privilege to take this journey of

Maruti Suzuki’s growth ahead.

Coincidentally, it is also the 40th anniversary since the signing of the joint venture

agreement between the Government of India and Suzuki Motor Corporation, Japan. The

Company was incorporated to put India on wheels, and it gives me immense happiness

to see that it has been true to its raison d’être even today. It can’t be a stroke of luck that

a Company is continuing its leadership journey for 4 decades. It’s a thoughtful strategy

crafted by its visionary leaders, with a winning culture.

One such visionary leader was Mr. V. Krishnamurthy, our first MD and Vice-Chairman,

whom we unfortunately lost recently. I express deep gratitude to him for laying a strong

foundation of the Company without which it would have been difficult for the Company to

reach its present height and stature.

If we look back, one of the key success factors in our journey has been the strong

focus on understanding and fulfilling the needs of customers by offering them relevant

products, technologies, and services. Over the years, customers have evolved and

accordingly our products, services, and business processes too have aligned, keeping

the customers at the heart of it.

The other factor has been how we have always thought of the long-term in all our

actions. In the 1980s, if we had to scale up our volumes and keep the cars affordable,

we needed to develop a component industry to localise the manufacturing of the same

for us. India has a vast geographical spread; so, a wider dealer network with focus on

service was developed for customer convenience. All management decisions today are

based on the long-term interests of our customers.

The Company has already laid down the Dividend Distribution

Guidelines (‘Dividend Guidelines’) which were approved by the

Board of Directors of the Company (‘Board’) on 30th October, 2014.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India has amended the

Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and

Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘Listing Regulations’)

under which the Company is required to formulate a dividend

distribution policy.

Pursuant to the aforesaid change in the Listing Regulations, the

Board has approved this Dividend Distribution Policy (‘Policy’) of

the Company on March 23, 2017.

The Company shall declare and pay dividend in accordance with

the provisions of the Companies Act 2013, rules made thereunder

and Listing Regulations as amended from time to time.

Following points shall be considered while declaring dividend:

•

Consistency with the Dividend Guidelines as laid out by the

Board

•

Sustainability of dividend payout ratio in future

•

Dividend payout ratio of previous years

•

Macroeconomic factors and business conditions

Retained earnings are intended to be utilized for:

•

Investments for future growth of the business

•

Dealing with any possible downturns in the business

•

Strategic investment in new business opportunities

The Company currently has only one class of shares i.e. equity

shares. As and when it proposes to issue any other class of shares,

the policy shall be modified accordingly.

Dividend guidelines

Background: Many shareholders have opined that the company

should provide a dividend policy in the interest of providing greater

transparency to the shareholders.

The Board, at the time of approving the annual accounts in each

year, also decides the dividend to be paid to the shareholders

depending on the context of business in that year. A policy stated

by the current Board cannot be binding on future Board. However,

the current Board can form a guideline on dividend payout in future

in the interest of providing transparency to shareholders.

Board approval

The Board accordingly approved the following guidelines for

dividend payment:

The Company would endeavour to keep the Dividend payout ratio,

except for reasons to be recorded, within the range of 18% to 40%.

The actual dividend for each year would be decided by the Board

taking into account the availability of cash, the profit level that year

and the requirements of capital investments.

Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

executives in setting strategic direction for the Company and

CEO/ CFO Certification

The Company has institutionalised the framework for CEO/

CFO certification by establishing a transparent “controls self

assessment” mechanism, thereby laying the foundation for

development of the best corporate governance practices

which are vital for a successful business. It is the Company’s

endeavor to attain the highest level of governance to enhance

the stakeholders’ value. To enable certification by CEO/CFO

for the financial year 2021-2022, key controls over financial

reporting were identified and subjected to self-assessment by

control owners in the form of completion of self-assessment

questionnaires through a web based online tool called “Controls

Manager”. The self-assessments submitted by control owners

were further reviewed and approved by their superiors and

the results of the self-assessment process were presented to

the auditors and the audit committee. The whole exercise was

carried out in an objective manner to assess the effectiveness

of internal financial controls including controls over financial

reporting during the financial year 2021-2022.

and monitoring of all compliance activities across the Company.

Code for Prevention of Insider Trading Practices

in compliance with the SEBI regulations on prevention of

insider trading. The code lays down guidelines, which advise

Portfolio diversification

The financial risk management of the Company is carried out under the policies approved by the Board of Directors. Within these

policies, the Board provides written principles for overall risk management including policies covering specific areas, such as foreign

exchange risk management, commodity risk management and investment of funds.

(A) Credit risk

Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter party may not be able to settle their obligations. To manage trade receivable,

the Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial conditions, economic

trends, analysis of historical bad debts and aging of such receivables.

Financial instruments that are subject to such risk, principally consist of investments, trade receivables, loans and advances and

derivative instruments. None of the financial instruments of the Company results in material concentration of credit risks.

Other than financial assets mentioned above, none of the finanacial assets were impaired and there were no indications that defaults

in payment obligations would occur.

(B) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company can not meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management

is to maintain sufficient liquidity and to ensure funds are available for use as per the requirements.

The Company operates with a low Debt Equity ratio. The Company raises short-term rupee borrowings for cash flow mismatches

and hence carries no significant liquidity risk. The Company has access to the borrowing facilities of INR 49,700 million as at

31.03.2022 (INR 43,450 million as at 31.03.2021 ) to honour any liquidity requirements arising for business needs. The Company has

large investments in debt mutual funds which can be redeemed on a very short notice and hence carries negligible liquidity risk.

(i)

Financing arrangements

The Company had access to the following borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:

As at

Maturities of financial liabilities

The tables below analyse the Company’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities:

The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying

balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

Sensitivity analysis

Portfolio diversification

The financial risk management of the Group is carried out under the policies approved by the Board of Directors. Within these

policies, the Board provides written principles for overall risk management including policies covering specific areas, such as foreign

exchange risk management, commodity risk management and investment of funds.

(A) Credit risk

Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter party may not be able to settle their obligations. To manage trade receivable,

the Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial conditions, economic trends,

analysis of historical bad debts and aging of such receivables.

Financial instruments that are subject to such risk, principally consist of investments, trade receivables, loans and advances and

derivative instruments. None of the financial instruments of the Group results in material concentration of credit risks.

Financial assets for which loss allowance is measured:

Financial assets other than mentioned above, none of the financial assets were impaired and there were no indications that defaults

in payment obligations would occur.

(B) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group can not meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is to

maintain sufficient liquidity and to ensure funds are available for use as per the requirements.

The Group operates with a low Debt Equity ratio. The Group raises short term rupee borrowings for cash flow mismatches and hence

carries no significant liquidity risk. The Group has access to the borrowing facilities of ` 49,853 million as at 31.03.2022 (` 43,590

million as at 31.03.2021) to honour any liquidity requirements arising for business needs. The Group has large investments in debt

mutual funds which can be redeemed on a very short notice and hence carries negligible liquidity risk.

(i)

Financing arrangements

The Group had access to the following borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:
