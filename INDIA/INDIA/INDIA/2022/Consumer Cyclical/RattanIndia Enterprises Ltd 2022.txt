Dear Shareholders,

Fiscal year 2022 turned out to be a challenging period for the country. What started with resurgent second wave of COVID-19 turned into a

significant inflationary surge in inputs prices, and then the Russia : Ukraine conflict disrupted the global supply-chain and resulted in spike in global

prices of crude oil and other related petrochemical intermediates. Our journey into the future will be shaped by our ability to adapt to the new

normal and address emerging challenges with agility, innovative capabilities, inclusivity and resilience. While the COVID-19 crisis has caused

unprecedented disruptions to human life and economic activity, it has also provided multi-dimensional learnings which will power transformational

change going forward.

For us, this was an eventful year with several milestones as we made substantial inroads as regards to our stated objective of foraying into new-age

businesses that required limited capital expenditure but are highly scalable.

During the period under review, we formed 100% wholly owned subsidiary Cocoblu Retail Limited (‘Cocoblu’) to house our ecommerce venture.

Apart from being a seller on Amazon platform, Cocoblu is focused on helping brands succeed in ecommerce marketplaces by achieving scale. Post

launch in Feb 2022, we partnered with several leading brands across the country to bring them onto the leading online platform. We have invested

` 350 crore in Cocoblu to develop and nurture the business, and in a short span of time, it has served 19,000+ PIN Codes in India with more than

2 cr. orders fulfilled. Additionally, it has signed up with 540+ top brands whereas additional signings are underway. We have created cutting-edge

technology with fully integrated systems, detailed data driven customer insights, automated inventory management, robust supply chain network

and dedicated software for custom fulfilment. There are abundant opportunities available to Cocoblu that will be harnessed at an appropriate

time. Overall, we are committed to scale up this venture and seek to be a dominant seller in multiple categories on online retail platforms in the

country.

Taking advantage of the enormous opportunity to create financial inclusion across the country, we forayed into FinTech business through our 100%

wholly owned subsidiary Neotec Enterprises Limited (‘Neotec’). Neotec is positioned as India’s premier, all-digital, one-stop financial solutions

provider bringing together lending institutions on a real-time platform to fulfil customer requirements instantly. Accessible through an app across

all OS platforms and online through a website, Neotec currently offers Personal & Two-wheeler Loans, Credit Cards and Bill discounting services,

while more product launches are underway. It has tied up with 30 leading banks, NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) and FinTechs and has

disbursed more than 2,400 loans aggregating to ` 85+ crores, with no capital at risk. Neotec is designed with a tech-driven approach, to analyse

multiple life-stage and financial parameters of customers and to come up with tailored solutions, which are well-priced for their requirements. As

the model evolves, we shall introduce new features, products, and partners through the platform. We believe that our solutions-based approach is

bound to have a positive multiplier effect on the economy, as customers begin to self-service financing, to match their aspirations and needs.

With the strategic intent of dominating the drone market in India, we formed a 100% wholly owned subsidiary company branded as NeoSky, which

will aim to build a leadership presence with offerings spanning across every aspect of the drone industry. Drone as a Product (DaaP - drone

hardware), Drone as a Service (DaaS – drone service solutions) and Software as a Service (SaaS – drone software) segment will be the focus areas

for NeoSky, while export opportunities will also be targeted. In a major development, we acquired a majority stake of 60% in India’s leading drone

company Throttle Aerospace Systems Private Limited (TAS). This is in addition to a strategic investment approved by shareholders in Matternet, US

which is the global leader in drone deliveries. TAS is among the market leaders in drones in India, and the first drone manufacturer in the country

to be approved by Directorate General Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Ministry of Defence (MoD) for manufacture of civil and military grade drones. TAS

has a world-class team with proven product capabilities both on hardware and drone software platforms. This acquisition will give NeoSky a full

360-degree presence across drone solutions in India. With the Govt. banning drone import in all forms, i.e., CBU, SKD & CKD, there will be tremendous

opportunity for Indian players to lead and indigenize the core manufacturing facilities, formation of the component ecosystem, & research and

product development capabilities.

Our strategic investment in Revolt Intellicorp Pvt. Ltd. (‘Revolt’), a leading manufacturer of electric motorcycles in India has started paying off. We

have fortified our presence across the nation by strengthening the distribution infrastructure to 22 cities with 27 stores. In FY 22, Revolt has
