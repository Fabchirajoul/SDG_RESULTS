OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS – CONSOLIDATED:

Managing Director

Eicher Motors Limited

As Royal Enfield completed 120 years in

2021, we also showcased a major center-

piece of our anniversary celebration at

the EICMA, with the unveiling of ‘Project

Origin’, a faithful working replica of the

brand’s very first ‘motor-bicycle’. This

was the very machine that built the

foundations upon which we have created

the enduring legacy of pure motorcycling.

The enduring 120-year old legacy of the

brand is nothing without the community,

and so to pay an ode to all Enfielders

who’ve dared to explore beyond the

ordinary, the company undertook 90°

South - a first-of-its-kind motorcycle

expedition that dared to go where no

brand has gone before - the South Pole.

We successfully completed this quest on

December 16 last year, as two of our riders

reached the geographic South Pole after

an arduous, but historical 15-day ride from

the Ross Ice Shelf.

In commemoration of 120 years of

pure motorcycling, we also launched

special Anniversary Edition models of

the Interceptor and Continental GT 650

motorcycles. With a stunning black-

chrome colour scheme and hand-made

brass tank badges, these motorcycles

were unveiled at EICMA with an exclusive,

limited run of just 480 units for global

markets. We also launched an exclusive

range of bespoke, limited-edition helmets,

consisting of 12 designs - one for each

decade of the brand’s legacy.

Royal Enfield has been committed and

making consistent efforts to foster a pure

motorcycling ecosystem for enthusiasts

globally. Our robust plans for both apparel

and accessories business continue to

enable options for self expression and

personalization for our consumers and

yield impressive business results for the

company. In 2021, our focused initiatives

resulted in a 45% year-on-year growth in

our non-motorcycling business backed by

razor sharp focus on growing service and

spares business, as well as our motorcycle

apparel and accessories business.

As we move forward, we remain focused

on creating a strong business vision, a

robust product portfolio and experiences

that stay true to our philosophy of pure

motorcycling and also tie back into our

larger mission to REBALANCE.

VECV

Despite the challenges posed by two

waves of the Covid pandemic, supply

chain disruptions caused by lockdowns

and the situation in Ukraine, VECV

registered handsome growth both in

volumes as well as total income. Sales

of our trucks and buses grew by 38.3%

to 57,077 units during FY22. Despite the

pandemic, we also brought on-line the

Industry 4.0 compliant Bhopal Plant with

a total capacity of 40000 vehicles per

annum.

VECV also continued on our journey to

become a whole-hearted customer-

centric organization - something we

started in 2018. Customer- centricity is

taking deep roots within VECV and we

note initial recognition by our customers

and dealers as demonstrated by being

Ranked No.1 in Dealer Satisfaction Survey

2021 by the Federation of Automobile

Dealer Associations, India. We treat this

as just the beginning and it remains

our constant endeavor to consistently

keep improving our partnership with

dealers and customers and to set new

benchmarks in the industry. Our initiatives

of Retail Excellence, Uptime, Network

development backed by a strong industry

infrastructure, a strong product line up,

and an efficient digital backbone provides

us with a strong foundation in our journey

towards being a truly customer-centric

organization.

As part of our quest of becoming an

Uptime company and No.1 in customer

satisfaction we have also focused on

creating a very agile and efficient dealer

network. Last year alone we added close

to 150 new touch points with state-of-

the-art facilities for enhanced customer

experience across the country. Majority

of our workshops are now Uptime

Certified delivering remote diagnostics

and predictive maintenance to our 100%

connected truck and bus fleet by linking

these in real-time to our Uptime Center.

VECV is also happy to share that

digitalization has taken firm roots within

the company with the industry leading My

Eicher App launch in FY22 being the latest

in a series of initiatives being taken.

We continued to have a granular and

immersive go to market approach with

the introduction of several new products

in different segments. To address the

growing demand of CNG trucks we

launched India’s biggest CNG truck, Pro

2114XP and industry’s first 11.5T GVW

CNG truck- Pro 2095XP ‘PLUS’ CNG. We

also created a new segment with the first

17.5TGVW truck, Pro 3015XP, a hallmark

of our customer centric product planning.

First fruits or synergy with Volvo Bus were

delivered with Eicher front engine Intercity

Coach and Sleeper buses.

We also successfully launched the all

new range of Volvo Trucks’ of FM & FMX

Range. These new range of trucks have

the most modern features optimally

designed to push the limits of productivity

and uptime.

And just as the financial year was ending,

we received further recognition that our

Volvo 9400 B8R won Coach of the Year,

Eicher Skyline Pro Staff 3010 L CNG won

the L&ICV People Hover of the Year and

Eicher Pro 2114XP CNG has won both

the ICV Cargo Carrier of the Year, and the

Apollo CV of the Year:

FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2022

NOTES

1. Corporate Information

Eicher Motors Limited (“the Company”) is a public company

domiciled and incorporated in India under the provisions of

the Companies Act, 1956. The Company is engaged in the

manufacturing and selling of motorcycles, spare parts and

related services. The Company has its registered office at

New Delhi, India and its corporate office at Gurugram,

Haryana, India. The Company has its equity shares listed

on the BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of

India Limited. The standalone financial statements were

authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of the

Board of Directors on May 13, 2022.

2. Basis of preparation and presentation

2.1 Statement of Compliance

The financial statements have been prepared in

accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)

notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013

read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to time) and the

presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule

III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant

Schedule III), as applicable to the financial statements.

2.2 Accounting convention

The financial statements have been prepared on

the historical cost basis except for certain financial

instruments that are measured at fair values at the end

of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting

policies below. Historical cost is generally based on

the fair value of the consideration given in exchange

of goods and services. The financial statements are

presented in Indian Rupees and all values are rounded

to the nearest two decimals of crore, except otherwise

indicated.

2.3 Operating cycle

Based on the nature of products / activities of the

Company and the normal time between acquisition of

assets and their realization in cash or cash equivalents,

the Company has determined its operating cycle as 12

months for the purpose of classification of its assets

and liabilities as current and non-current.

3. Significant Accounting Policies

3.1 Current versus non-current classification

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the

balance sheet on current / non-current classification.

An asset is treated as current when it is:

•

Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or

consumed in normal operating cycle

•

Held primarily for the purpose of trading

•

Expected to be realised within twelve months

after the reporting period, or

•

Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from

being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at

least twelve months after the reporting period

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

•

It is expected to be settled in normal operating

cycle

•

It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

•

It is due to be settled within twelve months after

the reporting period, or

•

There is no unconditional right to defer the

settlement of the liability for at least twelve

months after the reporting period

The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-

current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-

current assets and liabilities.

3.2 Fair Value Measurement

The Company measures financial instruments, such as,

derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell

an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly

transaction between market participants at the

measurement date. The fair value measurement is

based on the presumption that the transaction to sell

the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

•

In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

•

In the absence of a principal market, in the most

advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must

be accessible by the Company.:

letter of Grant, subject to such other conditions and exceptions

as provided under Company’s RSU Plan, 2019. Any RSU remaining unexercised at the end of the exercise period shall lapse. At the

time of exercise, the participant may pay the exercise price in a form as approved by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee in

accordance with the terms of the RSU Plan, 2019.

Each RSU, when exercised, is convertible into one equity share of the Company. No amount is payable by the RSU grantee on grant of

RSU. RSU carry neither rights to dividends nor voting rights until they are exercised & converted into shares.

The following share-based payment arrangements were in existence during the current year

The weighted average fair value of the stock units granted during the financial year is Rs. 2,526.34 (March 31, 2021 : Rs. 1,270.18). Options

were priced using Black Scholes options pricing model. Where relevant, the expected life used in the model has been adjusted based

on management’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions (including the probability of meeting market

conditions attached to the option), and behavioral considerations. Expected Volatility was determined by taking the daily volatility of the

share price on NSE, over a period prior to the date of grant, corresponding to the expected life of the options for each vesting.

NOTES

1. Corporate Information

Eicher Motors Limited (“the Holding Company”) is a public

Company domiciled and incorporated under the provisions

of the Companies Act, 1956. The Holding Company and

its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as “the Group”) are

engaged in the manufacturing and selling of motorcycles,

spare parts and related services. The Holding Company has

its registered office at New Delhi, India and its corporate

office at Gurugram, Haryana, India. The Group is a leading

two wheeler manufacturer and has a dominant presence

in domestic market. The consolidated financial statements

were authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of

the Board of Directors on May 13, 2022.

2. Basis of preparation and presentation

2.1 Statement of Compliance

The financial statements have been prepared in

accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)

notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013

read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules, 2015, as amended and the presentation

requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the

Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III),

as applicable to the consolidated financial statements.

2.2 Accounting convention

The consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain

financial instruments that are measured at fair values

at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the

accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally

based on the fair value of the consideration given in

exchange for goods and services. The consolidated

financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees

and all values are rounded to the nearest two decimals

of crore, except otherwise indicated.

2.3 Operating cycle

Based on the nature of products/activities of the Group

and the normal time between acquisition of assets and

their realization in c ash or cash equivalents, the Group

has determined its operating cycle as 12 months for the

purpose of classification of its assets and liabilities as

current and non-current.

3. Significant Accounting Policies

3.1 Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements incorporate

the financial statements of the Holding Company and

entities jointly controlled by the Holding Company and

its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:

•

has power over the investee;

•

is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its

involvement with the investee; and

•

has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an

investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there

are changes to one or more of the three elements of

control listed above.

When the Group has less than a majority of the voting

rights of an investee, it has power over the investee

when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the

practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the

investee unilaterally. The Group considers all relevant

facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not

the Group’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to

give it power, including:

•

The size of the Group’s holding of voting rights

relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of

the other vote holders.

•

Potential voting rights held by the Group, other

vote holders or other parties; rights arising from

other contractual arrangements; and

•

Any additional facts and circumstances that

indicate that the Group has, or does not have,

the current ability to direct the relevant activities

at the time that decisions need to be made,

including voting patterns at previous shareholders’

meetings.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group

obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when

the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically,

income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or

disposed of during the year are included in the

consolidated statement of profit and loss from the date

the Group gains control until the date when the Group

ceases to control the subsidiary.

Fair value of share options granted in the year

The weighted average fair value of the stock units granted during the financial year is Rs. 2,526.34 (March 31, 2021 : Rs. 1,270.18). Options

were priced using Black Scholes options pricing model. Where relevant, the expected life used in the model has been adjusted based

on management’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions (including the probability of meeting market

conditions attached to the option), and behavioral considerations. Expected Volatility was determined by taking the daily volatility of the

share price on NSE, over a period prior to the date of grant, corresponding to the expected life of the options for each vesting.:
