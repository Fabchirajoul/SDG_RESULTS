Dear Shareholders,

Over the years, we have primarily

focused on enhancing the organisation’s

core and deepening our capabilities. I am

happy to inform you that this strategy

has enabled us to put up an exceptional

performance in FY22, despite a

multitude of challenges.

If we look at the global macro

environment, the post-pandemic recovery

started taking shape from the second

quarter of FY22, which was subsequently

impacted by the escalation of geopolitical

tensions during the third and fourth

quarter of the year.

Commodity prices shot up and supply

chain pressures, which were set to ease,

began to rise again. The surge in global

commodity prices has exacerbated

inflationary pressures across advanced

economies (AEs) and emerging market

economies (EMEs) alike, causing a

sharp upward revision in their inflation

projections. India was also severely

impacted, where rising inflation continues

to be a cause for concern.

Despite inflationary pressures weighing

on real growth forecasts, the Indian

economy continues to rank among the

fastest growing economies of the world.

However, the threat from Omicron, supply

chain disruptions, and an overall subdued

sentiment had a broader adverse impact

on all vehicle segments and categories.

In this context, I must reiterate

that Spark Minda has been able to

outperform the industry, owing to its

diversified product portfolio, strong

engagement with global customers,

robust manufacturing capabilities and

advanced R&D, backed by six decades of

automotive experience.

The pandemic has put us on a steep

learning curve, wherein we have

strengthened our business model by

focusing on cost and capex as well as

ensuring risk mitigation, basic hygiene

to ensure good health and safety of our

teams, and transparency in our operations.

During the year under review, we

continued to leverage operational

efficiency to navigate through the

challenges faced by the auto industry.

Our primary focus has been to create a

very strong order book, elevate operating

efficiency, strengthen free cash flow and

work towards disruptive technologies.

We delivered a consolidated revenue of

H 29,759 million with 25.7% Y-o-Y growth

against an industry growth of 1.2% in

FY22. Our EBDITA for the year stood at

H 2,946 million with 9.9% EBIDTA margin.

Our Profit After Tax from continued

operations for the year stood at 1,919

million as against H 935 million in FY21.

We have also made some strategic moves

to drive innovation. Our partnership with

Ride Vision and the joint venture with

INFAC Elecs are examples to this thought.

We continue to monitor the scenario

of high input costs and semiconductor

shortages, impacting domestic

manufacturing and exports. We remain

cautiously optimistic about the Indian

auto sector as well as the country’s

economic growth.

With an absolute intent to drive

value for our shareholders as well as

customers, we are sharpening our focus

on technology and innovation. Keeping in

mind the changing landscape of mobility

worldwide, we at Minda are aiming to

become a one-stop solutions provider.

For moving on to our next course of

growth, we have proactively developed

our technological abilities to stay ahead

of the curve. Our 3-pronged approach

describes our efforts to bring about

palpable change

• We have been heavily investing in R&D

and have already set up our state-of the-

art in-house R&D facility for advanced

solutions, while simultaneously scouting

for partners to bring in quality, scalable,

cost-effective solutions

• We intend to establish technological

partnerships to further strengthen our

core business and maintain dominance

in our legacy product business.

• To introduce latest technologies and

products to the Indian customers,

we are on lookout for new JV

opportunities with global suppliers

who would give us access to new

technology

We are very well positioned to combat

the technological shift owing to a change

in customer requirements, emerging

market trends, and even government

regulations. Our investments in new

technologies such as light weighting,

electronics and EV related products are

some of our most recent endeavours.

With our firm foothold in segments of two

wheelers, aftermarket operations, and

off-road vehicles, we are now enhancing

our focus on four-wheeler segment by

strengthening our passenger vehicle

offering.

For the long term, we will put the extent

of our focus on the electric vehicle

space and drive our strategic growth

endeavours.

With our strategic investments in place

and priorities defined, I am confident that

our ideas will keep contributing to the next

generation of electric mobility and we will

continue to Innovate, Disrupt and Lead.

I have always been proud of the

contribution of my talent pool. This

year it has been reinforced due to their

commitment to scale the Company to new

heights. I want to thank all my colleagues

for their efforts and engagement. In the

coming years, we will continue to improve

our technologies, processes and sustain

our commitment towards ‘right capital

allocation’ to provide best-in-class quality

products to our customers and deliver

sustainable profitable growth.

Regards,

Ashok Minda
