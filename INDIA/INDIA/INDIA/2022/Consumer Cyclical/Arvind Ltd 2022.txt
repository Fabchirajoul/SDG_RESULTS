Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 43 : Capital management:

For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity

holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains an efficient capital structure and

healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions or its business requirements to

optimise return to our shareholders through continuing growth. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend

payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The funding requirements are met through a mixture of equity,

internal fund generation and other non-current borrowings. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total

capital plus net debt. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and short-term deposits (including

other bank balance). The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
