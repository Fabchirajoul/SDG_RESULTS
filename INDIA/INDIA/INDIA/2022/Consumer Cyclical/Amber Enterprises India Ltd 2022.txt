LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

I hope you

all are keeping safe

and healthy.

I am delighted to present

to you Amber’s Annual

Report for the

FY 2021-22.

12:

Dear Stakeholders,

The year 2021 began with global recovery prospects

from

COVID-19

pandemic

and

usherd

new

opportunities for a brighter future. With massive

vaccine drive the lives are returning to normal and

the economy and industries are building back fast,

undettered by significant labor and supply chain

challenges. The recovery gained momentum in

2nd half of the year where production and capacity

utilisation started gaining traction. As a result of

which the order books started to reflect a healthy

growth signalling a strong demand for FY 22. Being

an optimist, I can only say that what lies ahead of us

is only going to get better than what we have been

through already!

economy overview

The outbreak of pandemic tought all of us be it an

organisation or an individual to always be prepared,

respond and adapt to the changing environment.

On the heels of massive vaccination drive, easing

restrictions and revival of demand led to a faster than

expected recovery of the economy. The second half of

the year registered growth in business activities, in the

economy and better sentiments overall. However, the

geopolitical crisis resulting from the conflicts between

Russia and Ukraine led to an inflationary pressures

on commodity prices, slowing the economy further.

However, a positive spurt of growth is anticipated

after the second half of FY 2022-23. Despite all the

turbulences and lows, AEIL performed well across all

business segments, registering considerable growth.

industry Overview

The Indian RAC market showed a muted growth in the last

five years. During the year 2021-22 the first quarter which

remains the peak season for business went negative

due to onslaught of the pandemic. Whereas, quarter 2

and quarter 3 witnessed a sluggish growth. Penting up

the demand, quarter 4 marked a robust growth thereby

leading the industry to a total of approximately 6.4 million

units as compared to approximately 5.2 million units of

the preceeding year. Out of this ~6.4 million units, the

estimated market size of RAC Industry at OEM level

excluding GST is valued at ` 12,160 Crores of which

Amber enjoys an approxumately ` 3,229 Crores. This

translates to 26.6% of the overal market share in value

terms. It is also worthwhile to mention various initiatives

undertaken by the government to facilitate economic

activities and restore customer confidence which

inculcated demand in the Consumer Durables market.

Further with India inching towards a 5 trillion dollar

economy, the per capita income of the country is going

to be doubled and the demand for air conditioners are

destined to grow at a double digit growth in the years

to come. As per various industry reports, it will not be

a surprise that India by 2030 may witness a domestic

market of 24 million units and emerge strongly as

global sourcing destination.

Our Step towards Collaborate. explore. expand.

Despite all the external challenges, we, at Amber,

remained committed to creating synergies through

our strategic collaborations. Driven by an industry

experience of three decades and robust capabilities,

we continue to explore better opportunities with an

intent to expand beyond our current geographical

presence.

Despite all the

turbulences and lows,

AEIL performed well

across all business

segments, registering

considerable growth.
