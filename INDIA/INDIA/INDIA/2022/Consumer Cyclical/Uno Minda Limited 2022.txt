Dear Stakeholders,

The recent challenges have tested our resilience as the

COVID-19 pandemic and simultaneous supply-chain

constraints disrupted industrial production. But we, as

an organisation ensured all our employees were safe

and our active response in tackling the challenges

enabled our customers to continue building vehicles.

The beginning of the year 2022 marks the third year

of the COVID-19 pandemic for India and the world,

ushering newer challenges for healthcare systems

as well as channelling economic growth; however,

business continuity coupled with rapid vaccination

coverage led to a strong resilience pointing towards

the GDP growth of 8.7% FY 2021-22, the highest

among the world’s large economies.

In tandem with the Indian economy, auto industry

also made a smart recovery with all major vehicles

segment i.e. Passenger Vehicles, Commercial Vehicles

and 3-wheelers registered a remarkable growth

of around 20% in FY 2021-22. The only exception

was 2-wheelers’ segment where demand remained

subdued amidst higher fuel prices, and a steep

increase in the acquisition cost of the vehicle driven by

higher commodity prices and insurance costs.

Having built a strong foundation in FY 2021-22, the

auto industry would now be targeting to breach the

pre-pandemic levels in the coming year supported

by easing supply chain challenges and commodity

inflation. Besides volume-led growth, premiumisation

of vehicles and focus on localisation will translate into

healthy growth for the auto component industry as

well.

The Government of India has also been taking various

policy initiatives to boost demand, and encourage the

production and export of clean technology vehicles.

Favourable Government policies such as the recently

announced ` 76,000 Crores for semiconductor

manufacturing scheme, the extension of the FAME-

II scheme till 2024, the production-linked incentive

(PLI) scheme for the auto and auto component sector

for ` 26,000 Crores, PLI for advanced chemistry cell

for ` 18,000 Crores and the vehicle scrappage policy

will provide enormous support to the sector as they will

implement innovative technologies.

The PLI scheme introduced by the Government saw an

overwhelming response from the industry with a total of

around 115 companies applying for the scheme and more than

70 getting approvals for Government support. Uno Minda has

also been granted approval under the PLI Scheme. Multiple

advanced technology products from Uno Minda’s portfolio are

eligible for advanced technology products, and more.

On the Company front, we have also been impacted by

disturbances in the industry supply chain but with a strong

alliance with suppliers and customers, we were able to

quickly adapt to the new normal. Our teams worked very hard

and went the extra mile to support our customers in these

challenging situations and ensured continuous supply for

smooth operations.

We, at Uno Minda, have been at the forefront of technology

trends in the automotive industry. Our relentless focus on

innovation has continued to differentiate Uno Minda from

the rest. This has helped us design products with prime

importance and relevance with respect to the future.

We take pride in having a strong local presence and propelling

the Make in India campaign to greater heights in this sector.

We’ve developed infrastructure for R&D expansion and this,

combined with local manufacturing, has also proved to be an

advantage for us as a technology leader.

We are also progressing from just being a component supplier

to a system supplier with robust software capabilities. The

majority of the components today have embedded software

for the ability to communicate with various systems and

diagnostic purposes. With the right capabilities and strategies,

we are fully aligned with the megatrends that will shape our

markets and drive future growth.

driving the new

While transforming the industry, we have also been

transforming ourselves. Last year, we embarked on our

organisation and business transformation that has reimagined,

redesigned and realigned our businesses, processes,

systems and structures to be a future-ready and Sustainable

Organisation. The results of the exercise have started to reap

benefits with increasing efficiency, sharpened customer focus,

and increased exports, among others.

OVERVIEW:

Dear Shareholders,

India’s economy has scripted a robust recovery in FY

2021-22 where India’s GDP grew by 8.7% at its fastest

pace in nearly 22 years. To put the numbers in context,

the 8.7% expansion comes against the backdrop of

a very low base as the economy contracted by 6.6%

in the previous period due to one of the strictest

lockdowns in the world to prevent the spread of the

COVID-19 pandemic. Recovery is broad based with pre-

pandemic levels of activity captured in several sectors.

India is on track to become the fastest-growing major

economy, driven by robust exports, reviving consumer

demand, and supportive fiscal and monetary policies

once again. This has been further catalysed by a

rebound in the Service sector, Mining sector, and a

complete recovery of the Manufacturing sector.

Industry

The overall automobile domestic production volumes

in FY 2021-22 registered only 1% growth YoY basis.

However, except 2-wheeler category, the other three

major categories i.e. Passenger vehicles, Commercial

vehicles and 3-wheelers have registered a remarkable

growth of 19%, 29% and 23%, respectively on the low

base of FY 2020-21. Despite this growth, production

of all four major vehicle segments is even below

the FY 2018-19 level marred by several headwinds

like supply chain bottlenecks and semiconductor

shortages. The increased cost of ownership, driven by

higher commodity prices (both raw material prices and

oil prices), insurance costs and geopolitical tensions,

further disrupted the momentum. The impact caused

by the successive waves of the COVID-19 pandemic

and the consequent lockdown restrictions by various

states across the country, adversely affected the rural

and urban markets.

The Indian automotive industry is driving into FY 2022-

23 with a positive mindset in its quest to reach the pre-

pandemic level in terms of volume as semiconductor

supply constraints have eased up with pick up in

private consumption and rising discretionary spends.

Domestic auto industry is poised for strong growth in

the coming years.

financials

Showcasing great resilience and strength, we navigated

successfully through the challenges during the financial

year. Further, we seized better opportunities during the

year’s second half, backed by strong revival of the industry.

The second wave of the pandemic did bring a new set of

challenges but we continued to move ahead with the same

vigour as last year.

During the year, we continued to strengthen our balance

sheet and recorded a sales growth of 30% at ` 8,313 Crores

as compared to FY 2020-21. Our Switches business has been

the largest contributor with 28%, followed by the Lighting

business at 22% of revenue this year. We recorded an EBITDA

of ` 885 Crores, higher by 22% YoY from ` 725 Crores in FY

2020-21. Our EBITDA margins were seen at 10.7%, while PAT

margins improved by 104 bps, reaching 4.3%. These margins

were achieved by the continuous backing from business

enhancement and higher capacity utilisation. We believe that

these margin levels are sustainable, and hence we continue to

focus on managing the costs while ensuring profitable growth.

segmental highlights

Switching Systems

This segment generated a top line of ` 2,324 Crores in

FY 2021-22, led by strong growth in export of 2-wheelers

switches and an increase in content per vehicle consequent to

an increase in the number of switches in both 2-wheelers and

4-wheelers. It further, won multiple orders for the generation

switches — sunroof, cruise control, paddle switches and

vehicle stability switches, among others. Building on our

growing export momentum, we started supplies to marquee

American 2-wheeler OEM and won a key order from an Italian

2-wheeler OEM. Over the years, switches have become a lot

smarter, with an ability to communicate with other parts,

such as in-built diagnostics, connectors, and boot loaders.

The continuing incremental orders for these next generation

switches validate our ability to innovate and stay ahead of the

technology curve.

Lighting Systems

Our Lighting business contributed ` 1,847 Crores to the

total revenue, thereby, contributing 22% of our consolidated

revenue. The Lighting segment has become one of the most

exciting segments with very promising growth outlook. With

the augmented lighting technologies and capabilities added
