2000, on the recommendation of the Nomination and

Remuneration Committee at its meeting held on 29th April

2022.

Except Mr Venu Srinivasan, CE & MD, Mr Sudarshan Venu,: Managing

Managing Director

of the Company.

At the same meeting, the Board appointed Prof Sir Ralf Dieter

Speth, Non-Executive Director as Chairman of the Board,

effective 1st April 2022.

Elevation of Mr. Sudarshan Venu as: Managing Director

The Board of Directors at its meeting held on 5th May 2022

elevated Mr. Sudarshan Venu as Managing Director of the

Company, effective that date, on the recommendation of

Nomination and Remuneration Committee at its meeting held

on 29th April 2022.

Mr Sudarshan Venu has been charting the future of the

Company and has made it the most awarded two-wheeler

Company. He has played a pivotal role in the Company's

growth in India and key international markets, including Asia,

Africa and more recently Europe. Considering all his dedicated

efforts, the Board decided to elevate him as Managing Director.

Directors' appointment / re-appointment / cessation

During the year under review, Mr Prince Asirvatham, tendered

his resignation as a Independent Director of the Company with

effect from 20th August 2021 due to health reasons.

In terms of the provisions of sub-section (6) read with explanation

to Section 152 of the Act, 2013, two-thirds of the total number

of Directors i.e., excluding IDs, are liable to retire by rotation

and out of them, one-third is liable to retire by rotation at every

AGM. Mr H Lakshmanan and Dr. Lakshmi Venu, Directors are

liable to retire by rotation, at the ensuing AGM. However, Mr

H Lakshmanan, director, has expressed his desire not to offer

himself for re-appointment at the ensuing AGM, due to old age.

In terms of Section 152 of the Act, 2013, that, if the vacancy

of the retiring director was not filled up, it would be required

to be resolved expressly by the shareholders not to fill the

vacancy of the retiring director.

As, Mr H Lakshmanan has expressed his desire not to offer

himself for re-appointment at the ensuing AGM, the composition

of the Board has reduced below the minimum level of having

2/3rd Directors liable to retire by rotation.

Hence, it has been proposed to re-appoint Mr Venu Srinivasan,

Chairman's appropriateness and proactive nature of his

interventions for developing strategic plans aligned with

the vision and mission of the Company; aggressive

vision on electric mobility, succession plan for the

Company's sustainability in challenging global

environment; and provides exceptional and critical

leadership and provides robust leadership for the Board

to take on diverse challenges in a disruptive market,

contributing to clean / green mobility.

They also commended his high level of integrity &

objectivity and very judicious approach, and brings his

vast experience to bear on steering Board discussions

and decisions for the benefit of the Company and

Shareholders.

c) Board

The IDs also evaluated the Board's composition, size,

the mix of skills and experience, meeting sequence, the

effectiveness of discussion, decision making, and follow-

up action, so as to improve governance and enhance

the personal effectiveness of Directors.

The evaluation process focused on Board Dynamics.

The Company has a Board with a wide range of expertise

in all aspects of business and outstanding diversity of

the Board with the presence of varied personalities with

an expert in each domain viz., Engineering, Finance,

Marketing, Legal, Information Technology, Administration

and International trades and is well balanced with the

addition of directors, with domestic and international

experience and also from new industries

The IDs were always kept involved through open and

free discussions and provided additional inputs in

emerging areas being forayed into by the Company;

and also noted that the board had timely information and

full disclosures for meaningful and open discussions at

all meetings and forums.

They also expressed their satisfaction with presentations

on major litigations, a regular update on the performance

of Subsidiaries, EV businesses which have been fairly

made to all IDs with open door discussions.

The Company's management is well guided by the Non-

Executive Directors; and Board benchmarks well in terms

of its overall composition and the value it adds to the

business.

As far as shareholders' interest is concerned, IDs noted

that a proper system has been established to ensure

that the Company is prompt, relevant and transparent.

They were satisfied with the Company's performance in

all fronts and finally concluded that the Board operates

with best practices.

d) Quality, Quantity and Timeliness of flow of

information between the Company, Management and

the Board

All IDs have expressed their overall satisfaction with the

support received from the management and the excellent

work done by the management during the year under

review and also that the relationship between the top

management and Board is smooth and seamless.

The Company is in compliance with the statutory

requirements under both the Companies Act and the

Listing Regulations and all the information provided to

the Directors are very wholesome.

The information provided for the meetings were clear,

concise and comprehensive to facilitate detailed

discussions and periodic external presentations on
