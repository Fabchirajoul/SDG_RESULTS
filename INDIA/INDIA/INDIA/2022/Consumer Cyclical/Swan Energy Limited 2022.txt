Managing Director

Dear Stakeholder,

The past couple of years have been a period of intense action and reflection. We have seen a global pandemic,

geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, the rise of cryptocurrency and many other public and

private upheavals. As the dust settles, and a clearer picture of the world ahead emerges, I believe we are

standing at the threshold of a period of great opportunity and growth.

For Indian businesses, the year 2021-22 started off on a somber note as the Delta variant led to colossal loss

of lives and livelihoods. Many fellow citizens and families lost their loved ones despite heroic efforts by our

healthcare workers and civic authorities. Fortunately, as the year progressed, and the vaccination program

gained momentum, the deadly strain subsided. Come the festive season, and the country’s mood and

business environment became quite upbeat.

Your textile business began operating at the newly installed capacity levels on schedule during the second

half of the year, and was able to take advantage of the same. A boost in the sector, along with cost cutting

measures to ensure optimal efficiencies, saw the unit post a net profit, reversing the trend from the year

gone by. The road ahead remains with many twists and turns for the certified unit, as it continues to innovate

and perform at the highest levels of environmental and social governance.

The realty business remains on track to deliver the residential project in Bengaluru in FY24. Along with

that, your Company is evaluating other similar alliances and projects in Bengaluru and Mumbai.

The Swan LNG Project is moving ahead towards successful commissioning during the next financial year.

Cyclone Tauktae, the second cyclone in the area in as many years, wreaked havoc at the site. Fortunately,

there was no loss of life, and with damage control measures in place, the project is seeing minimal delays.

The world energy outlook remains volatile and we are primed to take advantage of these uncertain times.

Your Company has been moving steadily with financial conservatism, but is also evaluating new growth

engines for the future. It has been short listed as a primary bidder for the erstwhile Reliance Naval Shipyard

– a business that could see your Company foray into the shipping and defence sector.

As FY2023 progresses ahead, we expect the business environment facing your Company to remain

challenging and uncertain. We intend to continue disciplined operations that have helped guide us through

these difficult times, while also ensuring the Company capitalizes on any growth opportunities.

I look forward to sharing with you more milestones in this journey in the coming years. On behalf of the

Board of Directors of Swan Energy, I want to thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and support.

With Warm Regards,

Nikhil V. Merchant:
