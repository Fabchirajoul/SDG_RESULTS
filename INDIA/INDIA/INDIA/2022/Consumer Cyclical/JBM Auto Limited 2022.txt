LETTER FROM

THE CHAIRMAN’S DESK

SURENDRA

KUMAR ARYA

CHAIRMAN: Dear Shareholders,

It is a momentous occasion as I express my thoughts

on the 26th Annual General MeeƟng of your

company as we celebrate Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav

on the occasion of 75 years of Indian Independence.

As an organisaƟon we are commiƩed towards our

pledge to relentlessly contribute to our NaƟon’s

prosperity by curaƟng sustainable products and

soluƟons in India, much in line with our honorable

Prime Minister’s Shri. Narendra Modi’s vision of

building an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. With the ‘Har

Ghar

Tiranga’

campaign

iniƟated

by

the

government, it was indeed a welcoming sight to see

our Tricolor proudly being hoisted by ciƟzens at

their homes as well as workplaces PAN India. The

senƟment heralded by ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’

did bring about a cheery environment overall.

Renewed Hope

From the gloom and economic slowdown caused by

the pandemic, the auto industry’s slow-yet-steady

revival and the lively atmosphere created by the

Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav celebraƟons have infused

a new hope for the future. And it is with this

‘renewed hope’ that we have been passionately

paving the path ahead for JBM Auto. Your Company

recorded a total income of INR 3,193.05 crores

during the ﬁnancial year 2021-22 with an increase

of 61.10% from last year’s revenue is a witness to

that hope.

The much-awaited 2022 Union Budget announce-

ments—in terms of enhanced allocaƟon of capital

expenditure, EV baƩery policy, naƟonal highway

projects, support for MSMEs and tax incenƟves for

startups, focus on localizaƟon, and impetus to the

local economy—have been warmly received by the

auto industry. Yet much has been leŌ wanƟng in

regard to the raƟonalizaƟon of GST on automobiles.

NaƟonal and Industrial Economic Growth Prospect

According to ICRA, the Passenger Vehicle (PV)

industry is expected to grow by 9-12% in FY2023,

aided by improvement in semiconductor supplies

vis-à-vis the previous ﬁscal. The Commercial Vehicle

(CV) segment has seen an opƟmisƟc growth trajecto-

ry despite fuel inﬂaƟon, geo-poliƟcal conﬂicts, and

“Hope lies in dreams, in imagination, and in the courage

of those who dare to make dreams into reality.”

– Jonas Salk

chip famines. As economic acƟviƟes improve, we expect EV penetra-

Ɵon in the Indian market and lithium-based EV adopƟon to boost

with the fall in the price of the baƩery packs.

The CV industry has traversed toward the road to recovery with

30.69% higher units being sold in FY22 compared to FY21. This

barometer signals our economic growth as a naƟon and as an

industry. With renewed conﬁdence, the industry has been moving

ahead since commercial acƟviƟes, government push on rural

projects, and the general senƟment have gained impetus. The

automobile and auto parts segment has been in a constant state of

evoluƟon for having emerged as a driver of growth prospects in

developing countries, owing to the industry’s extensive interconnec-

Ɵons with other industries.

Strategizing for LocalizaƟon

For all OEM manufacturers, localizaƟon has become a primary

long-term strategy. And our government via Make in India and

Atmanirbhar Bharat iniƟaƟves is acƟvely supporƟng this move. This

has been a crucial step to allow backward integraƟon, create

protecƟon against exchange rate ﬂuctuaƟons and streamlining the

supply chain. At JBM Auto Ltd, your Company’s strategic focus has

been to develop a robust localizaƟon strategy and oversee its

implementaƟon to beƩer manage delivery schedules, thereby,

opƟmizing the producƟon costs.

Human Resource – Our Top Priority

The loom of COVID-19 has not yet subsided. Your company’s robust

Human Resources department has taken proacƟve steps to ensure

that all employees are fully vaccinated. Necessary safety and hygiene

protocols like wearing of facemasks, adhering to social distancing

norms, maintaining workplace sanitaƟon, and employee awareness

programs were followed in compliance with the regulaƟons of the

local authoriƟes.

Our people have been the most valuable asset always and, this year,

your company has adopted and implemented a Human Resource

iniƟaƟve aptly named ‘PCMM- People Capability Maturity Model’.

This is the ulƟmate step toward building capabiliƟes across the

employees at various levels. Moreover, we are engaging our employ-

ees through monthly learning and development calendars. Planned

mentorship programs, focused training on POSH, Whistleblower

policy, ISQ, organizaƟon thrust areas, and SANKALP Siddhi have been

our iniƟaƟves to build a future-ready workforce and leaders.

Our prerogaƟve has not only been to build the appropriate skill-sets

but also seriously take into consideraƟon the social and mental

well-being of our people, and Sankalp Siddhi 2.0 has been able to

achieve that with internal and individual based resoluƟons which

have been pursued with self-discipline and accountability.

Training and ApprenƟceships to Up Talent AcquisiƟon

During the ﬁnancial year 2021-22, your Company has trained and placed

more than 1800 candidates and, in the last seven years, the count has

reached to 10,000 people. We signed an MoU with the Government of

Madhya Pradesh to engage 500 apprenƟces on yearly basis and extend our

support under the Dual System Training. We took the iniƟaƟve to sign an

MoU with the Department of Skill Development, Government of Arunachal

Pradesh for providing apprenƟceship to 100 candidates, and this is the

ﬁrst-ever occasion when candidates from Arunachal Pradesh are under

going ApprenƟceship in Manufacturing. We hope that we are able to bring

many new states from the North-East into this Skill Development program

in the future.

We have adopted Government ITI Sonipat under Strive Project and also

signed MoUs with diﬀerent Government ITIs and other technical training-

centers to support OJT through ApprenƟceship and Dual System Training.

Your company has been supporƟng Shri Vishwakarma Skill University as an

Industry Partner to oﬀer B. Voc. in Tool & Die Manufacturing and RoboƟcs

& AutomaƟon. 79 candidates have completed B. Voc. out of which 12

candidates have been provided employment in the Company. This is our

small yet determined step towards living the atmanirbhar dream.

Financial Performance

I am glad to report a 209% growth, recorded in your company’s net proﬁt

of Rs. 155.65 crore in FY22. Your company’s net worth as on March 31,

2022 increased by 20.20% to Rs. 896.21 crore reﬂecƟng a corresponding

increase in the book value per share to Rs. 75.79 as compared to Rs. 63.06

per share in the previous year.

Closing Words

Finally, I would like to express my graƟtude to the management and

employees for their conƟnual and valuable contribuƟons. We are grateful

to you, our esteemed stakeholders. Your conﬁdence in our abiliƟes inspires

us to change and become stronger and stronger.

Stay safe and healthy.

Thank You and Jai Hind!

S. K. Arya

MANAGING DIRECTOR

NISHANT ARYA

V I C E C H A I R M A N &: MANAGING DIRECTOR

“Growth is never by mere chance; it is

the result of forces working together.”

— James Cash Penney

Dear Shareholders,

The automoƟve manufacturing is currently facing what might be its most

supreme revoluƟon. This transformaƟon is characterized by digitally enabled

integraƟon of global product standards, evolving alternate usage paƩerns and

hi-tech services in the world of transportaƟon. Technology driven learnings

have conƟnuously been developing the approaches in how companies react to

customer needs.

Modern technological advancements in the automoƟve manufacturing

domain are radically redeﬁning the business landscape, right from strategy to

execuƟon and the ﬁnal outcome stage. Technologies, such as ArƟﬁcial

Intelligence, Machine Learning, Digital Manufacturing, etc. are rapidly

perpetraƟng to the shopﬂoors, thereby, disrupƟng and innovaƟng the process-

es and systems. InnovaƟve business models have become imperaƟve for

business growth. They are a source of compeƟƟveness for ﬁrms, especially in

the dynamic auto sector, that oﬀers a value proposiƟon which is not based on

price. At JBM Auto, we have 10 comprehensive pillars of excellence, and they

factor in everything that must be considered for a world-class product. These

range from Technology to TCO to performance to manufacturing base to global

deployment. Then other elements that must be considered are safety, new

technologies, waste management, and ﬁnancial equilibrium. We have already

entered the era of the next-gen mobility soluƟons that are not only sustainable

but also clean. Over the last couple of years, India has witnessed massive

thrust towards the deployment of electric vehicles both in private as well as

public mobility domains.

As India aƩains its 75 years of independence, JBM pledges to conƟnue

contribuƟng more and more innovaƟons to put the naƟon’s interest and

sustainability as our primary business agenda. Our journey, from launching our

ECOLIFE Electric bus back in 2018, to being known as a pioneer in developing

the end to end e-mobility ecosystem in India, has been truly rewarding. As an

organizaƟon, we strived and developed products and soluƟons to suit the

sustainability needs of our ciƟes and country. While the Industry was adapƟng

to electric vehicles, we rapidly evolved to oﬀer comprehensive EV soluƟons to

various state transport corporaƟons for their in-city public transport soluƟons.

As we compete at the global stage, we would like to see our products compet-

ing across all geographies and segments. We see greater opportuniƟes in the

green transport space as much of the world is looking to reduce its

dependence on fossil fuels. Our R&D eﬀorts stand us in good stead to grab this

rising opportunity across the world. As an OEM combined, the year has been

stupendous from a growth perspecƟve, which is reﬂected by a 61% growth in

our revenues, 68.5% growth in EBIDTA and a 209% surge in comprehensive

income.

Post-COVID Economy

Geƫng over the pandemic eﬀects, we see a posiƟve resurgence, and the

Indian auto industry is anƟcipated to experience rapid growth between

2022–2033. Correspondingly, EV sales will have a high trajectory growth, and

30% EV vehicles on road by 2030 is not a distant dream. By 2025, it is predicted

that India's EV market will be worth Rs. 50,000 crores (US$ 7.09 billion). UnƟl

2026, according to a report by India Energy Storage Alliance, the country's EV

industry is anƟcipated to grow at a CAGR of 36%. It has also been projected

that, within the same Ɵme period, the EV baƩery market will grow at a CAGR

of 30%. The GOI implemented a baƩery-swapping policy in the Union Budget

2022–2023, allowing depleted baƩeries to be switched for charged ones at

speciﬁc charging points, increasing the viability of EVs, and this is a good

trigger for EV adopƟon on the whole. As per NITI Aayog, by 2030, the Indian EV

ﬁnance market will likely be worth Rs. 3.7 lakh crores (US$ 50 billion). These

indicators point toward how the future of mobility will shape up, and I am

happy to represent JBM Auto Ltd. as an EV Bus manufacturer that oﬀers

holisƟc Electric Vehicle soluƟons.

Sustainability and Scalability

JBM Auto has constantly focused towards bringing in best-in-class technol-

ogy, adapƟng to the environment, and re-invenƟng each day. We moved

our focus from products to sustainability, thus also venturing into zero

emission 100% electric buses. This product deﬁnes luxury, comfort and

safety. We wanted to make buses in India a conveyance of choice, not

necessarily need, with enhanced comfort, innovaƟve features and

aﬀordability.

The larger agenda in our mind, then, was to create an inhouse integrated

EV Ecosystem that would enable the rapid deployment of electric vehicles

in India. To insƟtuƟonalize this, we developed the “Well to Wheel” (W2W)

concept of JBM. W2W not only drives business across JBM’s various

verƟcals but also propels the group’s iniƟaƟves towards sustainability and

green manufacturing. Our mulƟple businesses like Renewable Energy,

Environment Management, EV Charging Infrastructure and Electric

Vehicles have strategically synergized towards creaƟng a seamless

soluƟon from generaƟon to consumpƟon of clean energy. We drive

business sustainability with a mulƟ-focal approach towards energy

conservaƟon, people skill enhancement and societal development that

leads to scalability for JBM.

With the introducƟon of the new business verƟcals, JBM Group is undergo-

ing a transformaƟon and re-innovaƟng itself with greater awareness

amongst end consumers, thereby re-posiƟoning the JBM brand with a

larger spread amongst the masses. We believe there are three key aspects

towards ensuring an organizaƟon’s consistent growth. An organizaƟon of

the future must aim at customizing its products and soluƟons to ensure

compeƟƟveness, total cost of ownership and quality, i.e. synergies must

be built around design to cost, design to funcƟonality and design to

manufacturing. Another key aspect that is criƟcal is reducing the ‘Time to

Market’.

Technology Driving Value

Technology, InnovaƟve business models and People (TIP), happen to be

our springboard for achieving our vision 2025. World over, disrupƟve

innovaƟon is driving the narraƟve of the enƟre manufacturing ecosystem.

At JBM we have swiŌly aligned ourselves to these emerging trends and are

becoming more robust by adopƟng frugal engineering pracƟces, digitaliz-

ing producƟon and enabling enhanced processes, thereby reducing the

Ɵme to market. In line with our consistent focus towards upgrading our

processes and systems with the most advanced technologies, graduaƟng

to AI and Digital Manufacturing has been seamless across our various

businesses. Data based decision making is being undertaken across our

various verƟcals by way of deployment of technologies such as Industry

4.0, Data analyƟcs and IoT. Also, our Machine Learning tools and other

processes are based on the AI plaƞorm with real Ɵme data and analyƟcs.

Systems such as vehicle health monitoring systems, baƩery management

systems, etc. provide data and informaƟon on a real Ɵme basis enabling

predicƟve decision making.

Zero-Emission IniƟaƟves

Over the last 3 years, our ECOLIFE range of electric

buses have been plying in various states of India

such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, Andaman &

Nicobar, Karnataka, Telangana, Goa, etc. I feel

elated to state that our e-buses have clocked over

50 million e-kilometres Ɵll date. As a company we

have pledged that our electric buses will clock 1

billion e-kilometers in the next 3-4 years. Our

zero-emission vehicle (ZEV), ECOLIFE saved about

1,000 tons of carbon dioxide and 350,000 litres of

diesel, in 10 years of operaƟon.

This is driven by the fact that transportaƟon is

currently the second largest contributor to

environmental polluƟon. India is well-posiƟoned

to capitalize on the huge opportuniƟes oﬀered by

the Electric Vehicle segment. In order to be

self-reliant, we created a capƟve supply chain by

developing more than 50 companies in India as

vendors to support our electric bus manufactur-

ing business. Being forerunners in the electric

mobility space, we have spearheaded oﬀering a

comprehensive EV ecosystem soluƟon, which

include electric buses along with charging

infrastructure soluƟons and baƩery energy

storage systems.

To propel our operaƟons in India, we have conƟnu-

ally invested in research associated with mobility

service providers, technology partners, and

industry bodies to meet our holisƟc business

goals. Aided by the developed JBM Auto supply

chain, evolving and energy-eﬃcient power train,

in-house technology capabiliƟes, baƩery technol-

ogy and charging infrastructure development

experƟse, we have been able to sƟtch together

end-to-end soluƟons and are oﬀering this

state-of-the-art EV eco-system to customers for a

wholesome experience. With a solid technical

roadmap, JBM aims at being a one-stop soluƟon

provider for customers oﬀering the most

opƟmum (TCO) total cost of ownership.

Vote of Thanks

To conclude, I would like to thank all our

shareholders, bankers and partners for the

consistent support and encouragement. We are

constantly striving to embark on new journeys

and reach new milestones with renewed spirits

and perseverance. Our belief in sustainability is

the reason for our scalability.

Nimble thinking, inventive planning and a

visionary mission have gone a long way in

making JBM Group a frontliner in enhancing

India’s presence on the global map

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

A.

OVERVIEW OF THE ECONOMY

1. Global Economy

Global growth has been in recovery mode after Covid pandemic. The growth of 6.1% in 2021 after a decline of 3.3% suggest a strong

bounce back. However, there may be short to medium term risk to the global recovery owing to the geo-political crisis that escalated

between Ukraine and Russia in the early months of the year. Beyond CY2023, global growth is forecast to remain constant at pre-

pandemic level of 3.6% over the medium term. Crucially, this forecast assumes three factors – firstly, that the conflict remains confined

to Ukraine; secondly, that further sanctions on Russia exempt the energy sector, although the impact of European countries decisions

to wean themselves off Russian energy and embargoes announced through March 31, 2022, are factored into the baseline and thirdly,

the pandemic’s health and economic impacts abate over the course of 2022 and beyond.

The report also pointed out that war-induced commodity price increases and broadening price pressures have led to CY2022 inflation

projections of 5.7% in advanced economies and 8.7% in emerging market and developing economies. The IMF recommended,

“Multilateral efforts to respond to the humanitarian crisis, prevent further economic fragmentation, maintain global liquidity, manage

debt distress, tackle climate change, and end the pandemic are essential.”

The IMF, in its World Economic Outlook (April 2022), concluded that the war in Ukraine has triggered a crisis that demands a peaceful

resolution. Fuel and food prices have increased rapidly, hitting vulnerable populations in low-income countries hardest. The economic

damage from the conflict will contribute to a significant slowdown in global growth in 2022 and add to inflation. It expects that fiscal

policies of governments around the world will depend on exposure to the war, the state of the pandemic and the strength of the

recovery. After the fiscal expansion in many countries during the pandemic, debt levels across the world are at all-time highs and

governments are more exposed than ever to higher interest rates.

However, the need for consolidation should not prevent governments from prioritizing spending with well-targeted support for the

vulnerable because of commodity price spikes, and those affected by the pandemic.

2. Indian Economy

Despite two waves of Covid19 in FY22 – the second and third wave – the economy demonstrated a V-shaped recovery during the year,

bouncing back to grow at robust rate of 8.7% after contracting by 6.6% during the previous year, due to the first-round economic

impact of the Coronavirus pandemic, the real GDP grew to an estimated Rs 147.36 lakh crore, which is marginally higher than Rs 145.2

lakh crore posted two years ago in FY20, before the pandemic impacted the economy.

Performance of the Indian Economy

The recovery was strongest at the beginning of the year and economic growth has gradually spiraled downwards with each quarter of

FY 2021-22. In the first quarter of 2021-22, the economic growth was 20.1%, largely due to the low base effect. By the second quarter

it declined to 8.4% and further to 5.4% and 4.1% in third and fourth quarters.

2.2

Basis of Preparation and Presentation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial instruments

years presented. Actual results may differ from the estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

TO THE MEMBERS OF JBM AUTO LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of JBM AUTO LIMITED (“the Parent Company”) and its

Subsidiaries (the Parent and its Subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) and its Joint Ventures which comprise the Consolidated

Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2022, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the

Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and

the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements including a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory

information in (hereinafter referred to as “the Consolidated Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration

of the report of the other auditors on separate financial statements and on the other financial information of the Subsidiary and

Joint Ventures referred to below in Other Matters Paragraph, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements give the information

required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian

Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015

as amended (the Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group

and its Joint Ventures as at March 31, 2022, the consolidated profit, consolidated total comprehensive income, consolidated changes

in equity and its consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified

under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities

for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and its Joint Ventures

in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical

requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules

there under, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of

Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on

the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated

Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial

Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have

determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Key Audit Matters

Auditor’s Response

Revenue

Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when

control of the products being sold is transferred to the

customer. The performance obligations in the contracts

are fulfilled at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon

formal customer acceptance depending on customer

terms and conditions. Revenue is measured at fair

value of the consideration received or receivable, after

deduction of any discounts/ rebates and any taxes or

duties collected on behalf of the government such as

goods and services tax, etc. Revenue is only recognised

to the extent that is highly probable a significant reversal

will not occur. The timing of revenue recognition is

relevant to the reported performance of the Company.

The management considers revenue as a key measure

for evaluation of performance.

Refer Note No. 2.2 and 29 of the Consolidated Financial

Statements.

Our procedure included:

-

Assessed the appropriateness of the accounting policy for revenue

recognition as per the Ind AS 115 “Revenue from Contracts with

Customers”

-

Performed reconciliation of revenue with GST returns filed with the

Government.

-

Performed cut off testing for sales made near the reporting date and

tested whether the revenue was recognised in the appropriate period

by testing sales invoices and customer acknowledgement for sample

transactions.

-

Performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual trends and

identify unusual items.

-

Tested internal controls in the revenue over the accuracy and timing

of revenue accounted in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

-

Tested the related disclosures made in notes to the Consolidated

Financial Statements in respect of the revenue from operations.

office at 601, Hemkunt chambers, 89, Nehru place, New Delhi. The Company is engaged in the automotive business that manufactures

and sells sheet metal components, tools, dies & moulds and buses including sale of spare parts, accessories & maintenance contract

of buses. The Company is listed on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 were approved by the Board of Directors and authorize for issue on May

02, 2022.

1.

Basis of preparation and presentation

1.1

Statement of Compliance

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards

(Ind AS) notified under the section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules, 2015 and other relevant provisions of the Act.

1.2

Basis of preparation and presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain

financial instruments which are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies

mentioned below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange of goods or services.

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current according to the Group’s operating cycle and other criteria set

out in the Act. Based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in

cash and cash equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of current or non-current

classification of assets and liabilities.

1.3

Basis of Consolidation and Equity Accounting

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Ind AS 103-“Business Combinations”, Ind AS 110

“Consolidated Financial Statements”, Ind AS 111 “Joint Arrangements”, Ind AS 112 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities”, Ind AS 28

“Investments In Associates and Joint Ventures”.

The financial statements of the entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to the same reporting date as that of the

JBM Auto Limited i.e. year ended March 31, 2022.

The Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events

in similar circumstances and are presented to the extent possible in the same manner as the Company’s Standalone Ind AS Financial

Statements. Accounting policies of consolidated companies have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the

policies adopted by the Group.

The amounts shown in respect of Other Equity comprise the amount of the relevant Reserves as per the Balance Sheet of the Parent

Company and its share in the post-acquisition increase/decrease in the reserves of the consolidated entities.

Subsidiaries

Subsidiary is an entity over which the Company has control. The Company controls an entity when the Company is exposed to, or has

right to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the

relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are

deconsolidated from the date the control cease.

The Company combines the financial statements of its Subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity,

income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gain/loss on transactions between Group companies are

eliminated.

Excess of purchase consideration and the acquisition date non-controlling interest over the acquisition date fair value of identifiable

assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised as Goodwill. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment annually.

Where the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, the Company re-assesses whether it has

correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the
