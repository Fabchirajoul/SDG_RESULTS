CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

The financial year 2021-22 began with the

second wave of the pandemic peaking in

first quarter of the year. It was a difficult

period for our employees, our business

associates and the entire country. During

this trying time it was heartening to see

that everyone rose to the occasion and

extended a helping hand to those most in

need. The company too put in place

processes to ensure that timely support

was available not just to our employees

but to the communities around us. This

included medical help, distributing

oxygen concentrators, setting up oxygen

plants, logistics and mental counselling

wherever required. At the same time the

government rolled out a massive

vaccination drive on a scale never seen

before. This brought the pandemic under

control and helped restore a sense of

normalcy. We would like acknowledge

with gratitude and appreciation the

untiring efforts of all those who made this

possible.

On the economic front we witnessed two

opposing trends emerge. As the

pandemic abated, business activity

picked up rapidly and this got reflected in

high GDP growth, a record USD 400

billion plus of merchandise exports,

buoyant tax collection and improved

business confidence. At the same time,

global inflationary pressures started to

build up which got rapidly accentuated in

the last quarter due to supply chain

disruptions, geopolitical conflicts and the

Russia-Ukraine war. In particular, global

energy prices hit new highs, fueling

domestic inflation.

Our energy intensive businesses

witnessed cost pressures.

Despite the above challenges the

company delivered strong operating and

financial results reflecting the inherent

resilience of our business. The earnings

were higher mainly due to enhanced

margins as product prices rose

substantially. Chloro-vinyl business

reported strong growth, driven by

volumes and improved realizations in line

with international prices. Businesses like

Shriram Farm Solutions and Fenesta also

recorded satisfactory growth led by

increased volumes, benefitting from the

improvement in overall economic

scenario. However earnings of sugar

business declined on account of lower

sugar volumes and lower availability of

’C’ molasses.

The Company's total revenues from

operations increased to Rs. 9,677 crores

in FY22 vs. Rs. 8,212 crores last year.

Chloro-vinyl business registered a

growth in revenue of 79% driven on

account of higher realizations for all

products and higher volumes for chlor-

alkali business. Revenue of sugar

business declined by 27% due to lower

export and domestic sugar volumes while

Shriram Farm Solutions business

registered an 11% growth in revenue and

Fenesta business revenue grew by 47%

led by volumes and prices. Bioseed

business revenue declined by 13% on

account of reduced volumes.

Profit before depreciation, interest and

tax (PBDIT) improved to Rs.1,859 crores,

up approximately 51% over last year. The

improvement was driven by better prices

and volumes in Chloro-vinyl and better

volumes in Farm solutions. Fenesta

earnings were also better. Profits in Sugar

business were lower due to lower

volumes. Bioseed India business was

impacted by lower volumes and

inventory provisioning. Overall PBDIT

margins improved to 19% from 15% last

year.

Net Profit for FY22 was up by 58% to

Rs.1049 crores from Rs.662 crores in

FY21. Net Debt as on March 31, 2022

stood at Rs. 4 crore vis-à-vis Rs. 135 crore

as on March 31, 2021. The strong

balance sheet has encouraged us to

undertake substantial capital investment

to facilitate future growth of the company.

Some of the significant expansion plans

include, increase in caustic soda capacity

by 850 TPD and flakes capacity by 600

TPD, add Hydrogen Peroxide facility with

a capacity of 52500 TPA, install

Epichlorohydrine (ECH) facility with a

capacity of 51000 TPA and Anhydrous

Aluminum Chloride capacity of 32850

TPA.
