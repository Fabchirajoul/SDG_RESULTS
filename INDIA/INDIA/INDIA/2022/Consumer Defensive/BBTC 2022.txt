During the year ended 31 March 2016, based on queries received from Securities Exchange Board

of India (‘SEBI’), Britannia India Limited (‘BIL’) conducted a preliminary internal investigation and

discovered certain irregularities by Sharepro Services (India) Private Limited (‘Sharepro’), BIL’s erstwhile

registrar and share transfer agent. Subsequently, BIL filed a criminal complaint against Sharepro and

its employees. Pursuant to the directions issued by SEBI in its interim order dated 22 March 2016, BIL

appointed an independent external agency to conduct an audit of the records and systems of Sharepro

with respect to past transactions. The report of the external agency was submitted with SEBI by BIL

vide its: letter dated 12 July 2016. During the financial year ended 31 March 2020, following the receipt

of a show cause notice dated 8 November 2019 from SEBI in a related matter, BIL filed a settlement

application and SEBI passed the settlement order on 17 September, 2020. BIL continues to evaluate

additional steps, if any, based on the directions of SEBI or any other regulatory authorities.

Based on the consultations with its legal counsel, BIL has been advised that the liability will not devolve

on BIL and thus no provision is considered necessary.

j)

With respect to Al Sallan Food Industries Co. SAOC, the income tax assessments for the tax years

2012 to 2015 have not been finalised by the Secretariat General for Taxation at the Ministry of Finance,

Oman. The Group believes that additional taxes, if any, that may become payable on finalisation of the

assessments in respect of these these years would not be material to the Group’s financial position.
