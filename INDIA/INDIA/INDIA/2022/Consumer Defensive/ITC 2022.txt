Compiled by: Dion Global Solutions Limited:

Managing Director /

Wholetime Director of a subsidiary.

Under Ind AS, the cost of ITC Stock Options (Stock Options)

is recognised based on the fair value of Stock Options as

on the grant date.

While the fair value of Stock Options granted is recognised

in the Statement of Profit and Loss for employees of the

Company (other than those out on deputation), the value

of Stock Options, net of reimbursements, granted to

employees on deputation and to employees of the wholly

owned and other subsidiary companies is considered as

capital contribution / investment.

The Company generally seeks reimbursement of the value

of Stock Options from such companies, as applicable.

It may, if so recommended by the Corporate Management

Committee and approved by the Audit Committee, decide

not to seek such reimbursements from:

(a) Wholly owned subsidiaries who need to conserve

financial capacity to sustain their business and growth

plans and to address contingencies that may arise,

taking into account the economic and market conditions

then prevailing and opportunities and threats in the

competitive context.

(b) Other companies not covered under (a) above, who

need to conserve financial capacity to sustain their

business and growth plans and where the quantum of

reimbursement is not material - the materiality threshold

being ` 5 Crores for each entity for a financial year.

Cash Settled Stock Appreciation Linked Reward (SAR)

Plan

Cash Settled SAR units are granted to eligible employees

under the ITC Employee Cash Settled Stock Appreciation

Linked Reward Plan (“ITC ESARP”). The eligible employees

for this purpose are such present and future permanent

employees of the Company, including a Director of the

Company, as may be decided by the CMC / Nomination &

Compensation Committee / Board.

For cash settled SAR units granted to eligible employees,

a liability is initially measured at fair value at the grant date

and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting

period, until settled. The fair value of ESAR units granted

is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss for

employees of the Company. In case of employees on

deputation to group companies, the Company generally

seeks reimbursements from the concerned group company.

The value of such payments, net of reimbursements,

is considered as capital contribution / investment.

Leases

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a

contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains,

a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified

asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

Company as a Lessee

Right-of-Use (ROU) assets are recognised at inception of

a contract or arrangement for significant lease components

at cost less lease incentives, if any. ROU assets are

subsequently measured at cost less accumulated

depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of ROU

assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised,

initial direct cost incurred and lease payments made at

or before the lease commencement date. ROU assets

are generally depreciated over the shorter of the lease

term and estimated useful lives of the underlying assets

on a straight line basis. Lease term is determined based

on consideration of facts and circumstances that create

an economic incentive to exercise an extension option,

or not to exercise a termination option. Lease payments

associated with short-term leases and low value leases are

charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight

line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

The Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the

present value of lease payments to be made on the date

of recognition of the lease. Such lease liabilities do not

include variable lease payments (that do not depend on

an index or a rate), which are recognised as expense in

the periods in which they are incurred. Interest on lease

liability is recognised using the effective interest method.

Lease liabilities are subsequently increased to reflect the

accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments

made. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is also

remeasured upon modification of lease arrangement

or upon change in the assessment of the lease term.

The effect of such remeasurements is adjusted to the value

of the ROU assets.
