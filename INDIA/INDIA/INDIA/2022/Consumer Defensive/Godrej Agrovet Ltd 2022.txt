Dear Shareholders,

I hope this: letter finds you and your families well

and safe.

The Financial Year (FY) 2021-22 turned out to be

extremely eventful across business, economy,

science, sports, climate change, travel and most

importantly, healthcare. It started with a

devastating second wave of Covid-19, countered

by rapid and large vaccination drives across the

country. The country is estimated to have closed

the year with 95% of the adult population

inoculated with the first dose and more than 85%

with the second dose. On the economic front, the

country recorded a sharp recovery in GDP growth

rate to an estimated 8.7% in FY2021-22 from

contraction

in

the

previous

year.

India’s

merchandise exports touched a record high of

$418 billion in FY 2021-22, a 40% growth over the

previous year. On the climate front, in the COP26

summit held in Glasgow, India announced five

pledges for the first time: net-zero emissions by

2070, non-fossil fuel energy capacity of 500 GW,

50% energy requirements from renewable sources,

reducing total projected carbon emissions by 1

billion tonnes and reducing the carbon intensity of

the economy to less than 45%; all before 2030. The

year ended with rising geopolitical tension in the

Eastern Europe between Russia and Ukraine

threatening to derail an economic recovery that

the world witnessed in the first 10 months of the

year. The commodity prices soared to record levels

due to the impending logistics and supply chain

disruptions as against growing demand from large

consumption driven economies.

For us, this is the time of the year to look back and

reflect on what we did well, what we could have

done better, and where we go from here. The year

started with a rapid spread of the second wave of

Covid-19 pandemic leading to another spell of

severe operational difficulties for the corporate

sector. However, having navigated through a

similar set of challenges efficiently and with limited

interruptions in the preceding year, your Company

was able to swiftly implement hybrid work culture

wherever necessary and drive plant operations

smoothly across the country. This was possible

only because of unwavering commitment and hard

work of all our GAVL team members and business

partners. For this, I would sincerely like to thank all

our folks for their efforts and contribution in

serving our customers as well as the community.

Resilience and Growth

We have a pan-India presence and we operate in

five business verticals, on our own and through our

subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. This

supremely diversified operational base, spread

across Animal Feed, Crop Protection, Oil Palm,

Dairy, and Poultry and Processed Foods, has made

us fairly resilient as a group to external shocks,

such as the one we witnessed over the past two

years. At the same time, related diversification has

equipped us with an ability to recoup rapidly and

drive growth in our revenues and profitability at a

decent

pace.

We

also

derive

operational

efficiencies and economies of scale by centralizing

and sharing certain key functions across our

businesses such as finance, legal, information

technology, strategy, procurement and human

resources.

letter I have

covered all our successes, areas of improvement,

key achievements and future aspirations to take

the Company on a new growth path. Before I

conclude, on behalf of the Board of Directors and

the management, I would like to thank our

employees, business partners, customers, vendors,

shareholders, investors and other stakeholders for

their continued trust, efforts and contribution to

the Company. Let’s continue our journey together

on a sustainable growth path, the Godrej way.

Note 47.1: Contingent liabilities represents estimates made mainly for probable claims arising out of litigation/ disputes

pending with authorities under various statutes (Excise duty, Customs duty, Income tax).The probability and timing of

outflow with regard to these matters depend on the final outcome of litigations/ disputes. Hence, the Company is not

able to reasonably ascertain the timing of the outflow.

Note 47.2:The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“SC”) by their order dated February 28, 2019, in the case of Surya

Roshani Limited & others v/s EPFO, set out the principles based on which allowances paid to the employees should be

identified for inclusion in basic wages for the purposes of computation of Provident Fund contribution. The company has

started complying with this prospectively from the month of March 2019. In respect of the past period there are

significant implementation and interpretative challenges that the management is facing and is awaiting for clarity to

emerge in this regard, pending which, this matter has been disclosed under the Contingent liability section in the

Standalone financial statements. The impact of the same is not ascertainable.
