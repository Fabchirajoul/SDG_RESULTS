Editor’s note:

Managing Director (FY 2021-22)

Q: How would you describe the

Company’s performance during

the year under review?

A: It would be important to

present the operating landscape

first to get our shareholders to

appreciate the nature of our

performance. The business

environment of the last two years

affected the performance of the

country’s FMCG sector more than

most people would be able to

appreciate. There were direct and

indirect impacts that manifested

in a range of outcomes –

logistics impairment, resource

inflation, export delays and

periodic consumer hesitation in

discretionary spending. Despite

these realities the Company

reported a superior performance

– growth remained profitable

as revenues increased 11% while

adjusted PAT grew by 18%.

Q: What was the fine print of

this performance?

A: The Company’s domestic

business grew 11%. We believe

that this outperformance has

been credible in view of the

challenges we encountered.

Within our domestic business

segment, major brands like Pain

Management grew by 18%, Kesh

King grew by 11%, Healthcare

grew by 9%, Male Grooming grew

by 16% and 7 Oils in One grew by

29%. Besides, our BoroPlus brand

grew by only 5% due to a higher

incidence of hygiene-related

offtake in the previous year while

the Navratna range grew only

5% following sales loss as its

peak season coincided with the

second pandemic wave.

The reason I am mentioning

these brand-wise growth

numbers is to showcase the

reality that your Company’s

growth was not derived out of

the disproportionate success

of a couple of brands but a

broadbased performance during

the year, a validation of the

Company’s responsible focus

on each. The message that we

wish to send out is that each

of these brands outperformed

their respective spaces and

held on or improved their ranks

within. We believe we have

created a number of growing

properties within the Company,

which should keep delivering

sustainable year-on-year growth.

I am pleased to communicate

that these attributes of the

Company delivered successfully

during a challenging year as the

last one.

Q: How else did the Company

build its business in a

distinctive manner during the

last financial year?

A: At Emami, we believe that

growth in our business can be

derived through three initiatives

– organic growth through

existing products, introduction of

new products and the acquisition

of new brands. We focused on

all three initiatives, validating

our commitment to explore all

possibilities to grow our business

in a sustainable way.

Let us start with the organic

growth of our domestic business.

During the year under review, we

are pleased to communicate that

all our domestic sales channels

posted attractive growth. Our

conventional business was

driven by a wider and deeper

distribution coverage.

We believe that the world is

moving towards convenience-

driven platforms. Your Company

was nimble enough to capitalise

on this consumer transition.

In this respect, our Modern

Trade revenues grew 17%; our

e-commerce focus doubled

revenues and contributed 5.5% to

our domestic business ( 2.8% in

the previous year).

Q: What about the Company’s

decision to introduce new

brands?

A: At Emami, we recognise

that disproportionate revenue

increases happen when we

introduce new products. The

objective behind these launches

is to address unmet needs and

build attractive offtake within

months or initial years of launch.

Our objective is not merely to

introduce products that compete

in a crowded marketplace;

our objective is to create new

consumption habits and markets.

The Company did well in this

regard during the last financial

year. We introduced products

like BoroPlus Soft Ayurvedic

Antiseptic Cream, HE Active

range of Deodorants, Kesh

King Anti Dandruff Shampoo

and e-commerce-specific

launches like Creme 21 range,

Navratna Therapy range,

Fair and Handsome Hexapro

Professional Range and more

than 20 products under the

Zanducare web portal. Besides,

the Company launched

campaigns featuring prominent

actors like Ajay Devgn, Shilpa

Shetty, Sonu Sood, Ayushmann

Khurrana, Nushrratt Bharuccha

and Khali, enhancing consumer

recall and brand association. I

am pleased to communicate that

the Company’s new and recent

product launches accounted for

3% of the Company’s domestic

revenues during the year; we are

optimistic that these launches

will be followed by higher year-

on-year growth as consumer

habits deepen and our marketing

spends increase.

Q: This bring us to the third

initiative of FY 2021-22 that

needs to be discussed – the

Company’s decision to acquire a

new brand.

A: At Emami, we have always

invested in brand acquisitions

from various perspectives. Such

acquisitions are intended to drive

revenue growth, suitably utilise

our spare cash and plug gaps

within our products profile. In

March 2022, we responded to

one such opportunity through

the acquisition of ‘Dermicool,

a leading national brand in

the Prickly Heat and Cool

Talc segment. The brand was

acquired from Reckitt Benckiser

Healthcare India Pvt Ltd for H432

crore (excluding taxes & duties).

We believe that this acquisition

will prove value-accretive for

good reasons – it was funded

through our accruals so that we

were not loading the Company’s

Balance Sheet for this acquisition.

Besides, the acquisition will

empower the Company to

emerge as a leader in this niche

category. The acquisition will

help the Company optimise

procurement costs, broadbase

its category presence and

leverage the Company’s branding

competence. The result is that

we are optimistic of generating

a superior return on the

acquisition, enhancing value for

our shareholders.

Q: What is that one decision

that you feel will translate into

a sustained improvement in the

Company’s performance?

A: At Emami, we continue to

prioritise the role of distribution.

In a country as vast and as

populous as India, the challenge

is not as much in branding

and manufacturing as much

as in placing the product just

where the consumer needs it.

Despite being in this business

for more than four decades, we

find that distribution continues

to our last frontier – partly

because consumption points are

beginning to change with new

prosperity pockets emerging;

besides, there are locations in the

interiors where Emami products

are being distributed by resellers

and where we need to establish a

direct presence.

It is with this priority that

the Company continued to

emphasise Project Khoj during

the last financial year, an initiative

marked by the addition of

8000 rural towns to our direct

distribution network, taking

the total tally to 40,000 towns.

The result is that we not only

sold quicker but also sold more

profitably. We intend to double

our rural coverage to 60,000

towns in 13 States in three years,

broadbasing coverage and

seeding locations with Emami

products for the first time.

The Company recognised

that the key to long-term sales

sustainability would be derived

from relationship-driven sales

engagements. The result is that

the Company launched outlets

for healthcare products, focusing

on Ayurvedic bhandars and

chikitsalayas. The Company

also rolled out Project Sirius

as a pilot project in select

cities wherein the Company

launched an upsell and cross-

sell application for the frontline

sales team, which empowers our

sales representatives through

app-driven suggestions. The

Company will introduce

more such technology-based

distribution initiatives to

accelerate offtake.

Q: How did the Company

build on this conventional

distribution footprint?

A: At Emami, we believe that

it is imperative to enhance

convenience in the consumer’s

access to our products. The days

of consumers going from shop

to shop to buy are over; all our

products need to be conveniently

available in one place. We

created a separate structure and

activation programs for around

12000 Standalone Modern Trade

stores and expanded our reach

to 40 cities and more than 3,300

outlets.

As India’s consumer profile is

driven by millennials, we see

our products being purchased

more off the shelves in large

stores of malls where consumers

can inspect them closely and

comprehensively. We also believe

that a growing percentage of

Emami products will be sold

online, circumventing bazaar

visits. The Company launched

D2C websites for Zandu,

BoroPlus and Kesh King; its

products are widely available on

major eB2B platforms like Udaan

and JioMart.

The interesting feature of our

approach was that we didn’t

just launch products that
