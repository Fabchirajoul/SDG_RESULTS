Management Discussion and Analysis:

Dear Shareholders,

With the world starting to return to

normalcy, thanks to the accelerated pace

of vaccinations and well-defined safety

protocols, our operations in India are

gaining momentum.

The consumption demand is increasing

steadily, although the headwind of rising

inflation remains a concern. We are,

however, confident of moving forward

due to the intrinsic strength of our product

portfolio and operational agility.

Under the leadership of our new MD &

CEO, Hina Nagarajan, we are focussed on

reshaping our business strategy. We aspire

to become a top-performing consumer

packaged goods (CPG) company in India

delivering sustained double-digit, profitable

top-line growth. In the backdrop of the

pandemic that has served to underscore

the importance of a healthy and sustainable

world, our new mission statement takes a

broader and more complete view to deliver

long-term value to all our stakeholders

— consumers, employees, trade partners,

suppliers, communities in which we

operate, and of course our shareholders.

Given the geographical diversity of

our business and our stated goal to

continually upgrade our performance, we

aim to tap into market trends and new

consumer cohorts to fuel our mission.

What has helped our business further

is the rising affluence of the population

which has provided us with breakthrough

opportunities in the sector. With the

country expected to have the third-largest

number of high-income households

globally by 2030, India’s growth story will

continue to gain further momentum.

We want to use the immense opportunity

provided by a growing economy to

deliver our mission through three pillars:

reshaping our product portfolio; creating

an organisation of the future, which is being

radically redefined by big societal and

cultural shifts; and defining and executing

an ambitious role for Diageo in Society.

Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) are deeply

embedded in our values, and we continue

to remain committed to building a diverse,

yet inclusive workplace. We have extended

our I&D agenda to include LGBTQ+ and

people with disabilities, and our endeavour

is to introduce relevant policies and

initiatives to instil I&D into every level of

the organisation.

Our CSR initiatives and “Grain-to-Glass”

sustainability journey driven by the ESG

(Environmental, Social and Governance)

framework is a testament to our sense of

responsibility towards our communities and

the planet.

As we move forward, we see a strong

horizon of opportunities, expanding

beyond tier-one cities to smaller towns,

where growing purchasing power

corresponds to increased awareness about

drinking better and not more.

I would like to extend my gratitude

to you, our shareholders, for your

unstinting faith and the trust you have

reposed in us. I would also like to thank all

members of the Board for their support

and active participation.

Warm Regards,

Mahendra Kumar Sharma

Chairman

Managing Director & CEO’s Message

Building an

organisation of the

future with a focus on

digital acceleration and

our brands, to enable

us to achieve strong

growth in ‘Prestige &

Above’.: Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present Diageo India’s

Annual Report for 2021-22 as I complete my

first year in office.

During the year, we reshaped our strategy

with the mission to be a top-performing

Consumer Products Company in India

delivering sustained double-digit, profitable

top-line growth and long-term value to all

our stakeholders.

Our new strategy is anchored on three pillars:

Reshaping our portfolio to focus on

premiumisation and transformational

innovation based on sharp consumer

insights

Building an organisation of the future

with a focus on digital acceleration and

our brands, to enable us to achieve

strong growth in ‘Prestige & Above’

Defining and executing an ambitious

role for Diageo India in Society

reSHapinG our portFolio

The renewed focus on portfolio

premiumisation is yielding positive results.

We witnessed strong growth in Scotch

riding on premiumisation trends and

positive policy developments. We

launched our first artisanal single malt,

Godawan, which caters to modern affluent

Indians looking for bespoke experiences.

With its larger purpose centred on mindful

luxury, we expect Godawan to elevate

Indian craft spirits as a highly aspirational

offering across the world. Our first venture

into Craft was through Epitome Reserve, an

artisanal whisky. We launched two limited

editions, the first edition is made from

100% rice grains (2,000 bottles) and the

second edition is a Peated Indian Single

Malt (3,600 bottles).

Our investment in Nao Spirits, makers of

premium craft gin brands, Greater Than

and Hapusa, marks another step forward in

strengthening our participation in the fast-

growing premium craft gin segment in India.

During the year, we launched Royal

Challenge American Pride, a smooth,

accessible, and inclusive whisky much

enjoyed especially by younger consumers

entering the legal drinking age. Our

renovation interventions for Signature and

Black Dog have also been well received,

reflecting the growing appreciation for

our brands, that has enabled us to achieve

growth in ‘Prestige & Above’.

As we move forward, we will continue

to accelerate the momentum of our

premiumisation strategy, through the

launch of more brands from our global

portfolio as well as powerful new

innovations developed in India.

Another key milestone in reshaping our

Portfolio is the sale and franchising of

select brands in our Popular Portfolio.

On May 27, 2022, the Board approved the

sale and franchising of select brands to

Inbrew Beverages Pvt Limited (Inbrew).

The transaction involved the sale of the

entire business undertaking associated with

32 brands for a total cash consideration

of approximately ₹820 crore, subject to

customary adjustments. The transaction

does not include the McDowell’s or

Managing Director & CEO

Our active portfolio management, price

advocacy engagements, adding more margin

accretive brands and products, dialling

up growth on Prestige & Above, and the

conclusion of the popular brands’ strategic

review will allow us to sustainably meet the

double-digit profitable growth guidance in

this volatile and uncertain environment.

Critical estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of

accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal

the actual result. This note provides an overview of the areas

that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and

of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due

to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than

those originally assessed. Detailed information about each of

these estimates and judgements is included in relevant notes

together with information about the basis of calculation for

each affected line item in the financial statements.

The areas involving critical estimates and judgements are:



Estimation of provisions recognised and contingent

liabilities disclosed in respect of tax matters– Notes 8, 17

and 49



Impairment of trade receivables- Note 31



Impairment of loans to subsidiaries – Notes 5, 31 and 36

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are

based on historical experience and other factors, including

expectations of future events that may have a financial impact

on the Company and that are believed to be reasonable under

the circumstances.:
