Managing Director

'Physically Distant But Together On Purpose':

Managing Director

2020 has redefined the way in which we all think and live. The

magnitude and volatility of the COVID-19 pandemic has shaped

the contours of a New Normal where the 5Ps - PURPOSE,

PLANET, PARTNERSHIPS, PEOPLE and PERFORMANCE will

form the cornerstone of successful organisations.

Our PURPOSE has helped us stay strong despite challenges

in the external environment

Your Company is strongly committed to its global Purpose –

‘We unlock the power of food to enhance quality of life for

every one, today and for generations to come’. We committed

ourselves to the nation’s fight against COVID-19 by giving

every possible support to the communities, authorities and

frontline workers, touching over 1.5 Million people across the

nation. We supported feeding programs and distribution of

essential groceries for vulnerable communities by partnering

with leading NGOs and state authorities. We have also aided

the purchase of medical equipments. Our employees had

voluntarily donated a part of their salary, which has been

topped up with an equivalent contribution from Nestlé India,

and given to the Indian Red Cross Society, for relief efforts. We

contributed ready-to-drink beverages and confectionery to the

frontline warriors across the country, as a recognition of their

efforts for keeping the nation safe. In collaboration with NGO

partners, we also brought about sustained innovations in our

ongoing community initiatives to adapt to the rapidly evolving

external environment.

We are committed to the PLANET through the sustainable

use of resources

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges currently facing

mankind. The next decade will see the introduction of products

with lower carbon footprint, and a move to sustainable

packaging. The power to accelerate this change will require a

multi-stakeholder approach, bringing industry, government,

multilateral agencies and local community to collaborate and

monitor progress, laying the foundation for a better world. Your

Company has been accelerating its actions to reach net zero

greenhouse emissions by 2050 while ensuring high levels of

productivity.

We have strengthened our PARTNERSHIPS during these

unprecedented times

Your Company recognized the difficulties the suppliers are

going through, and we have ensured continuity in timely

payments which is inherent to our values. We ensured that

every drop of milk which was offered to us was bought to

ensure that our farmers do not lose out. We also announced

the launch of “MAGGI DESH KE LIYE 2 MINUTE – Ek Chhoti

Si Koshish”, a set of year-long initiatives, across the country

to contribute towards societal needs. Under the aegis of

Nestlé’s global youth initiative, ‘Nestlé Needs YOUth’, we

launched the Nestlé Entrepreneurship for YOUth platform to

nurture budding entrepreneurs and create job opportunities

through a kiosk business model, helping the youth of the

country cope with these challenging times.

We have witnessed ordinary PEOPLE do extraordinary acts

A defining moment for us in 2020 has been witnessing

ordinary people do extraordinary acts. Mustafa Hossain, our

dedicated distributor’s salesman in Gangtok, walked 14

kilometers each day for 3 days through the mountainous

terrain to get necessary permissions from the local

authorities so that much needed products of Your Company

were available to the consumers during lockdown. Similarly,

our sales executive M Balaji, went beyond his call of duty, by

supporting our distributor, Ramakrishnan in Hosur. Since

Ramakrishnan’s team could not report to work because of the

lockdown, M Balaji, took orders, loaded the stocks in

Ramakrishnan’s car, and together they delivered the products

to the supermarkets and grocery stores, working tirelessly.

Swapan Kumar Roy, is another one of our distributors in

Kolkata, who serviced 300 retailers alone with the help of just

one staff member, and personally delivered stocks.

We delivered a strong PERFORMANCE and are committed

to Make in India and Made in India

Your Company is proud of its 108-year long association with

the nation and as a vindication of this confidence and trust,

we plan to invest ` 26 Billion over the next three to four years.

Further, resonating with consumer needs during evolving

times, we introduced a range of product and marketing

innovations in line with new normal.

Looking ahead in the new normal

The three attributes that will shape successful organisations in

the days to come are resilience, authenticity and compassion.

We also have to recalibrate the way we engage with our

people and further enable decision-making at the appropriate

levels. Increasing penetration and proclivity towards more

credible, transparent, trustworthy, and scientifically better

modulated brands is going to be the call of the consumer. The

future will demand increased commitment from companies

and their brands, making sure that business stays committed

to the community, consumers and the planet.

We hope that each of us will rise to this challenge with all the

will power, hope, energy and prayer that we can muster! If the

pandemic has taught us a lesson, it is, to embrace humanity

and make a difference with our lives for whatever time we

have on the planet.: Dear Shareholders,
