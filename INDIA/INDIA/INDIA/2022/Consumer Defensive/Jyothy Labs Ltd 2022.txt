ABOUT THIS

REPORT:

Dear Shareholders,

I feel a strong sense of satisfaction looking at

the way in which our leadership has steered the

organisation through these tough times since

the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The event

that plunged the world into a period of chaos

and uncertainty coincided with internal changes

within the organisation’s leadership structure,

indicating a period of deep transformation, both

within and without.

During this period, our single point of focus has

been our strong commitment to our people

and our desire to serve the consumers. On

both fronts, I am happy to report that we have

come through. While our business may have

been impacted by prevalent global economic

uncertainty, it is showing strong signs of a

rebound in the form of growing market share

and growing consumer loyalty.

The new leadership has posted an exemplary

performance focussed on protecting the

interests of all our key stakeholders, and

extending support wherever needed. They

have delivered on the Company's strategic

priorities to reach out to a wider segment of

consumers across categories and geographies

and accelerated our embrace of digital

transformation as an FMCG player growing

in the 21st century. Along the way, they have

succeeded in taking care of our people.

I commend our people and our teams for their

belief in the ability of our leadership and for

supporting them all the way through. Thank

you for your unwavering dedication and

commitment, which has served as the basis

of our growth throughout our value creation

journey at Jyothy Labs.

I find extreme gratification in the entire length

and breadth of our long-standing relationships

within our partner ecosystem and the way they

have come together to support our business in

these challenging times. Going forward, we hope

to strengthen our value proposition for each of

our key stakeholders.

I am prouder than ever to belong to this family

that is forever conscious of every need of

our consumers and all our stakeholders. Our

research and innovation teams continue to

closely observe the changes in the lifestyles

of our consumers with the aim to meet their

needs that go unexpressed. It led us to factor

in the burden of rising inflation on household

budgets and adopt appropriate substitutes as

raw materials while ensuring the quality of our

products remains untouched. We continue to try

our level best to limit the impact of the rise in

prices on the wallet of our consumer.

Looking back, I can say this with absolute

certainty that the roots of this organisation are

stronger than they have ever been. The values

have been imbibed in a way that is tangible in

the results we have driven and the outcomes we

have produced.

Warm regards,

M. P. Ramachandran

Managing Director

Jyothy Labs Limited

26:

Dear Shareholders,

FY 2021-22 has been nothing short of an

extraordinary year for the FMCG industry. Seldom

does one come across very conflicting scenarios

that the industry saw transpire through the year.

On one hand, the market sentiments were high and

consumers were upbeat on retail spending, resulting

in a strong resurgence in demand. Yet on the other,

the steep rise in input prices and the subsequent

inflationary pressure posed threat to pull down

this euphoria.

The situation necessitated taking some tough and

smart decisions. At Jyothy Labs, as always, we chose

to shine in the lives of consumers and stakeholders

no matter what the circumstances. Our first and

foremost focus was on execution to ensure that our

products remain available and accessible given most

of them are items of daily need for households. And

so, we augmented the use of technology to ramp up

distribution, supply chain and improve productivity.

At the same time, we implemented several inward

looking cost rationalisation measures and expanded

our distribution to cross the 1 million+ direct

outlet mark. No compromise was made on quality

whatsoever. These measures to a great extent helped

in gaining consumer confidence and reinforcing our

brand as well as balancing market share growth

and margins.

But obviously, after a point we had to take the tough

call of passing on the costs and reducing grammage

to maintain margins. While we understand the

pain of our consumers, this was the need of the

hour, and we adopted a calibrated approach to

ensure our products still remain reasonably priced

and accessible. We will continue to closely track

the market especially the implications of Russia-

Ukraine war, and accordingly taking further pricing

decisions. We appreciate the recent intervention by

the government towards reducing the fuel taxes, and

believe this will give some respite to the citizens

from inflation.

A moment to cheer

Despite the challenges around rising cost, the year

has given us several reasons to be exuberant. I am

glad to report that we have crossed the ` 2,000

Crore topline milestone, closing the FY 2021-22

at ` 2,196 Crore with a strong growth of 15.1%.

We were to some extent insulated by our solid

portfolio comprising essential products finding daily

household application. This contributed to stable

pan-India demand and market share improvement

across categories.

I take this moment to express my gratitude to

our people who maintained steadfast focus and

dedication to help the Company stay afloat. The

sales team went all out and ensured our products

are always on shelf and fill product availability voids.

The Company adequately supported them by taking

care of healthcare needs including regular follow-ups

by a dedicated committee, arranging healthcare and

doctor facilities and forming WhatsApp group to

address all emergency needs. All in all, I think it was

a complete team effort and shows the deep bonding

among them as well as with the Company.

Profitability was hit due to increase in prices of raw

and packing materials. As a result, gross margins

were lower at 41.6% in FY 2021-22 as compared to

47.1% in the previous year. PAT declined by 16.5% to

` 159.1 Crore. On the balance sheet front, we

continue to be a net debt free Company. Our

net cash balance stood strong at ` 85 Crore as

on March 31, 2022 as against ` 77 Crore as on

March 31, 2021.
