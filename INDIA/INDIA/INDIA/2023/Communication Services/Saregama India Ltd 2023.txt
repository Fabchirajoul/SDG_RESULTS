COMMUNIQUE

With continued market presence, your Company recorded

all time high revenue and PAT. Revenue from Operations

rose by over 28% at Rs. 7,366 Mn from the last financial

year, while net profit surged by over 21% to reach

Rs. 1,851 Mn. Our topline has grown by a CAGR of 22% for

the last 7 years and even more significant is the fact that

our profits have grown at a CAGR of 58% for the similar

period. We believe this journey of growth and habit of

breaking our own records will continue as the pillars of

this growth namely digital boom, availability of capital

for future investment and an excellent team at work stay

strong and intact.

The music segment continued to grow strongly on

the back of the Company’s strategy to invest in new

music and monetise the catalogue in different ways.

The Company is continuously exploring possibilities of

inorganic acquisition by way of different transaction

structures, and is committed to investing based on

financial and strategic parameters. However, safeguarding

Hello everyone, I am pleased to share with you highlights

of an extremely eventful year for your Company driven

by the digital revolution and our content play. We have

witnessed the Company scaling new heights and we are

confident of achieving even higher peaks. The Company’s

revenue from operations touched Rs. 7,366 Mn and

the PAT recorded was Rs. 1,851 Mn. It is heartening to

note that the growth story is not a one-off event but a

further addition to the consistent track record of strong

financial performance.

A big shift in the Company’s outlook over the last few

years has been a greater focus on our younger audiences.

We are constantly catering to the content needs of this

class of audience by way of investing aggressively in new

music, creating derivatives and cover versions of gems

from our catalogue, entering into the business of live

events and expanding the horizon of Yoodlee vertical by

releasing Web Series on digital platforms. This approach

not only helps us connect with our younger audience but

also diversifies the revenue streams, paving way for a

broad-based growth in the years to come.

Music has been the driving force behind the Company’s

growth story in the past and it continues to deliver the

results in line with everyone’s expectations. The Company’s

music licensing revenue grew by over 20% for the 5th year in

a row. This is primarily on account of increased investment

in new music and the growing popularity of our retro

of capital continues to be our top priority along with

tapping avenues of growth.

Carvaan sales grew by over 40% and our strategy of

providing value to our customers driven by product

innovation continues to be the driving factor for growth

in retail business. We will continue to innovate on the

product front and plan to come up with some exciting

product offerings with a lot more service features as

well as sources of revenue. The Company believes in

diversifying its business streams to maximise benefits of

synergy. The launch of live events vertical is an example of

the same. In our Films, TV and Events segment, revenue

grew by 54%.

Your Company continues to strengthen its core values

such as governance, stakeholder value creation and

sustainability. The Company has embedded ESG

parameters in its business activities. In order to enhance

visibility, a holistic view of its activities is presented

through an Integrated Report.

The Company continues its practice of rewarding its

shareholders. An Interim dividend of Rs. 578 Mn (Rs. 3 per

Equity Share on the face value of Re. 1 each) was paid

during the quarter ended 31st March, 2023.

I want to thank all stakeholders for their continued

support in achieving our targets for the year gone by. We

believe that we are at the cusp of an exciting journey,

which is expected to create value for all of us.

Yours sincerely,

Avarna Jain

Vice-Chairperson

catalogue. One of the key strengths of the Company and

the one that sets us apart from the rest is the process

of new content acquisition. The Company acquires new

content using predictive AI technology using volumes of

relevant data converted to knowledge which is leveraged

through a completely decentralised decision-taking

structure and listening sessions by our young employees

that clearly understand the modern day content

requirements. Performance of new content has been one

of the major drivers of our growth in the music licensing

vertical. The result is clearly visible as 21st century songs

contributed ~48% of the music licensing revenue for FY23.

Another critical element of our new content strategy is

being language-agnostic. We believe in investing in any

content that meets our parameters of financial returns.

Your Company has clocked revenues of over Rs. 1,574 Mn

in the Films, TV and Events segment registering a 54%

YOY growth. There is an exciting line-up of our films and

series to be released in the coming years. Our entry into

the business of live events has been received very well

and it gives us the confidence to build this further. While

this segment is expected to grow at a higher rate than

other segments, we have implemented a tight capital

allocation policy to mitigate any risks of capital being

locked for a long period.

I would like to highlight that technology remains at the

centre of the Company’s strategy in every decision that

we take. We have so far invested in predictive AI and now

we shift towards investing in Generative AI technology. We

keep ourselves abreast with technological advancement

and believe that leveraging new-age technological

developments will be a path-breaking step with respect

to the growth story waiting to be unfolded.

I thank all our business partners, investors, employees and

most importantly the consumers for their strong support

and patronage to the Company. Looking forward to the

ever-strengthening partnership in future.

Yours sincerely,

PRINCIPLE 1:: Dear Stakeholders,

Saregama is pleased to present to you its first Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report FY23 which supersedes BRR

(Business Responsibility Report) developed previously. We are thankful to all our stakeholders for investing their trust & belief in

us that has helped us to grow exponentially over the past years. Our approach to sustainability is not based on merely meeting

compliances but goes a step beyond towards institutionalization of sustainability practices. We ensure all our business activities are

conducted in accordance with ethical principles, internal policies, procedures, and relevant laws and regulations. Hence prevention

of corruption and promotion of fair competition is another important dimension of the compliance efforts at Saregama. We

strongly believe that success and sustainable growth of any organisation depends on creating long-lasting relationship with its

stakeholders. We have created communication channels for all our stakeholders to ensure that they are granted their very own

right “to be heard” to enable us address their concerns in the best possible manner. We ensure adherence to all environmental and

other applicable compliances. We make sure that all our employees and value chain partners have safe, supportive and respectful

workplaces where the dignity of every associate is recognized. While we can see significant changes in the lives of people we work

with, our efforts to enable the economic empowerment of our communities, and to making a positive difference, will continue.

While we do all this, we believe that we can deliver value and contribute our bit in furthering the sustainable development agenda.

We continue to keep ourselves committed to the growth of our nation and our people at all times.

exchange forward contracts. The objective of the hedging is to eliminate the currency risk due to volatility in exchange rates.

TO THE MEMBERS OF SAREGAMA INDIA LIMITED

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE REVISED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

This Report supersedes our Report dated 19 May 2023

OPINION

We have audited the revised consolidated financial statements of Saregama India Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding

Company”) (in which are included financial information of its employee welfare trust) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its

subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), which comprise the revised consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2023, and the

revised consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), revised consolidated statement of changes

in equity and revised consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the revised consolidated financial

statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the

revised consolidated financial statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of reports

of the other auditors on separate financial statements of such subsidiaries as were audited by the other auditors, the aforesaid revised

consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and in

the context of the overriding effect of the provision in the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the National Company Law Tribunal

(‘NCLT’), regarding accounting of demerger from the specified retrospective appointed date give a true and fair view in conformity with the

accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 31 March 2023, of its consolidated

profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

BASIS FOR OPINION

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities

under those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Revised Consolidated Financial Statements

section of our revised report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit

of the revised consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India

and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of reports of the other auditors referred to in the "Other

Matters" section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the revised consolidated financial statements.

EMPHASIS OF MATTER

We draw attention to Note 1 and Note 34 of the revised consolidated financial statements which describes the basis of revision and

scheme of demerger respectively. As explained in detail therein, these revised consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31

March 2023 have been prepared pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement amongst and the Holding Company and Digidrive Distributors

Limited and their respective shareholders and creditors (the ‘Scheme’) for demerger of E-Commerce Distribution Business along with

identified non-core assets of the Group (the “Demerged Undertaking”) from the specified appointed date i.e. 1 April 2022, as approved

by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Kolkata Bench, vide order dated 22 June 2023 (“Order”). A certified copy of the Order

sanctioning the Scheme has been filed by the Holding Company with the Registrar of the Companies, Kolkata on 12 July 2023. We further

draw attention to the fact that in accordance with the scheme approved by NCLT, the Holding Company has given effect to the Scheme

from the retrospective appointed date i.e. 1 April 2022 which overrides the relevant requirement of applicable generally acceptable

accounting principles in India (according to which the scheme would have been accounted for from 22 June 2023). The financial impact

of the aforesaid treatment has been disclosed in the note 34.

We issued a separate auditor’s report dated 19 May 2023 to the members of the Company on the consolidated financial statements of

the Group for the year ended 31 March 2023 which were first approved by the Board of Directors on 19 May 2023 (“Original consolidated
