Letter from the

Chairman

The global environment is going through

considerable changes. At the same time,

the world is navigating several important

transitions: the Energy transition, the Supply

Chain transition and the AI transition.

Undoubtedly, these transitions will require

significant investments in technology and

innovation, and offer a huge growth

opportunity for the IT industry.: Letter from the

Letter to

Shareholders1

Dear Stakeholder,

Demand for our services showed remarkable resilience

even as other parts of the technology universe deflated,

and macroeconomic uncertainties worsened in our major

markets throughout FY 2023. Our revenue for the year

was ₹225,458 crore, a growth of 17.6% over the prior year

(13.7% in constant currency).

This growth came with an industry leading operating margin of

24.1%. Our Net Margin was at 18.7%. The Earnings Per Share

was at ₹115.19, a growth of 11.2% over the prior year.

From an industry vertical perspective, growth in FY 2023

was led by Retail and Consumer Business, which grew

22.1%, Life Sciences and Healthcare which grew 20.2% and

Communications, Media and Technology which grew 18.1%.

Banking, Financial Services and Insurance grew 14.6% while

Manufacturing grew 14.1%. Others, which make up 8.2% of

revenues, grew 22.5%.

By geographic markets, North America grew 24.2%, UK grew

11.4% and Continental Europe grew 9.2%. Among emerging

markets, Latin America grew 24.8%, India grew 14.9%, Middle

East & Africa grew 12.5% while Asia Pacific grew 7.1%.

The Board has recommended a final dividend of ₹24 per

share, bringing the total dividend for the year to ₹115 per

share. For the full year, the company’s shareholder payout was

₹42,079 crore, 108.2% of the free cash flow during the year.

Innovate, Adapt, Thrive

Our performance this year reflects how much of an enterprise

staple IT services have become. Our full services capability

enables us to help our clients thrive, in good times and bad.

During the up-cycle, we help clients accelerate and expand

their technology-led innovation to differentiate themselves and

drive growth. On the down cycle, we help them adapt, using

technology to drive the efficiency, agility and resilience needed

to cope with a faltering economy, and prepare for better times

ahead.

Cloud transformation remained a high priority area for

enterprises in FY 2023, with greater focus on execution. They

engaged us to take up the modernization and migration of

their bigger, more complex workloads. The breadth and depth

of our cloud expertise, our scale, deep domain knowledge,

strong partnership credentials with the hyperscalers and our

portfolio of intellectual property on the cloud, give us a distinct

competitive edge in this phase of the cloud adoption cycle.

We also helped clients cope with the challenge of managing

cloud expenses. In some cases, it required rearchitecting

their application stack to be more cloud native, capable of

dynamically ramping up resource consumption during periods

of high demand, and automatic ramping down at other times.

Elsewhere, we offered our FinOps advisory and cloud managed

services to rein in cloud costs.

The adoption of cloud technologies continues to drive

innovation within enterprises. The availability of compute, data

Caring for Communities

We continued to work with communities across the world,

pursuing our long-standing commitment to programs in the

areas of skills development, bridging of digital divides and

STEM education. In FY 2023, we estimate that our community

initiatives touched the lives of over 4.5 million beneficiaries –

women, youth and members of marginalized communities.

Our large programs in India around literacy, digital

entrepreneurship and youth skilling continued to gain scale.

Likewise, our STEM initiatives outside India. goIT is shaping

the next generation of digital innovators in 42 countries, while

Ignite my Future in School program has doubled its original

goal, serving over 2 million students and educators in five

geographies worldwide since inception in 2017.

Our employee volunteer program called HOPE (Hours of Purpose

by Employees) resulted in over 2.8 million hours of volunteering

effort towards promoting issues most relevant in their local

communities, such as mental health, climate action, circularity,

education, skilling, mentoring, and conservation.

On the environmental front, we continue to make good progress

in our net zero journey. We have brought down our absolute

carbon footprint across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 71%

over base year 2016, meeting our target two years ahead of

time. This was despite increased electricity consumption in FY

2023 from employees’ return to office. In addition to enterprise-

wide initiatives for energy efficiency, we have also significantly

increased our use of renewable energy. Renewable energy

sources today make up 55% of the total (7.25% in 2016).

In FY 2023, we focused on utilizing the spare capacity built up in

the prior year, and recalibrated our hiring especially as attrition

started falling in the second half of the year. Our LTM attrition in

IT services for the year was 20.1%. Net addition in FY 2023 was

22,600, and the closing headcount was 614,795. Our workforce

continued to be very diverse, with over 150 nationalities

represented and with women making up 35.7% of the employee

base.

Our investments in organic talent development continue to

deliver exceptional outcomes. In FY 2023, TCSers logged

48.3 million learning hours, and acquired nearly 6 million

competencies. Popular technologies witnessed unprecedented

levels of interest from our employees. During the year, 53,000

TCSers acquired certification on hyperscaler cloud skills, bringing

the total number to over 110,000, making TCS one of the Top 2

partners to the largest cloud providers.: Letter to Shareholders | 10

Letter from the

CEO

I am truly humbled by this opportunity to lead this remarkable

organization that I have been part of for 34 years. The culture,

values and ethos of TCS and the Tata group have been an

inspiration always. Your company has a very strong leadership

team and a workforce that is highly motivated. It is my privilege

to lead this talented team.

As part of the transition, I interacted with a number of our

customers, leadership teams and employees. This has further

enriched my understanding of the depth of our customer

relationships, customers ‘priorities and the opportunities

ahead of us. I see a huge potential to create positive impact for

our clients, our employees and for the broader community of

stakeholders that we serve.

Dear Shareholder,

As part of their continuing digital transformation journey, we see

sustained focus on cloud adoption, data architecture, customer

experience and business model transformation. Through

these initiatives, our customers intend to avoid technology

obsolescence, become an intelligent enterprise, introduce new

products and services, orchestrate ecosystems and provide

immersive, hyper-personalized experiences. In addition, all our

customers have also committed to ambitious net-zero carbon

emission targets.

On top of these current focus areas, technologies like 5G, IoT,

generative AI, virtual reality / metaverse, digital twin and others

are also gaining attention and are likely to attract investments in

the short to medium term.

As technology adoption will remain a key driver of business

growth and transformation for our clients, we have been

relentlessly focussed on our clients’ needs and have been

investing in building newer capabilities to help them accelerate

technology adoption. Your company continues to focus on

enhancing the talent base of its associates, building partnerships

with key technology providers, expanding the innovation

ecosystem and building its own products and platforms.

These business and technology trends drove a strong deal flow

throughout FY 2023, peaking in the fourth quarter. We closed

the year with an order book of $34.1 Bn. This along with the

strong pipeline replenishment gives us a good visibility for the

medium term.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your

continued support in this exciting journey ahead.

TCoC5 for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses

covering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any

employee – including the executive directors – from accepting any position of responsibility,

with or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS’ prior written approval.

For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board.

Values, Ethics and compliance6

Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and

has earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global

business. The Company’s core values are: Leading Change, Integrity, Respect for the Individual,

Excellence, and Learning and Sharing.

The TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate

citizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights,

prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association, and

avoidance of conflicts of interest.

Every employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based

annual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further,

frequent communications from the leadership, reiterate the importance of the company values

and the TCoC.

Customers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through

inclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts.

Employees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical

behaviour. They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company,

which are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department. Employees and other

stakeholders can also report any non - compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by

senior executives directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee under the Whistle blower

Policy without fear of retaliation. Information about these channels is communicated to

employees as part of the mandatory training modules.

Succession planning

TCS’ philosophy of empowering employees, its industry-leading talent retention, and an

organization structure that devolves executive decision-making across the three business

groups (viz., Relationship Incubation group, Enterprise Growth group and Business

Transformation group) have resulted in a large and deep bench of leadership talent that

enables robust succession planning and continuity and consistency in strategy. Succession

planning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior

management. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for key

functions within their units.

Succession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board. Business or unit

heads are invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering an

opportunity to the directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities.
