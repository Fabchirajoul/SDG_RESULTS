v)

The Implementation Agreement entered between the parties defines a settlement mechanism between the Company and the

promoters of erstwhile Vodafone India Limited (“VInL”) for any cash inflow/outflow that could possibly arise to/by the Company towards

settlement of certain outstanding disputes pertaining to the period until May 31, 2018. As at March 31, 2023, the Company had

recognized settlement assets amounting to ` 63,939 Mn. The settlement of such assets recognized was to happen periodically based

on cash inflow/ outflow incurred as defined in the Implementation Agreement starting from June 2020 but not beyond June 2025.

The Company has classified ` 17,270 Mn received mainly on account of income tax refund for the period July 2020 till December

2022 as payable to VInL promoters as per the terms of the Implementation Agreement. The balance receivables of ` 81,209 Mn as

at March 31, 2023 is subject to further cash inflows / outflows incurred till June, 2025 and hence, classified as non-current financial

assets. The Company believes that it will be able to recover this amount in terms of the Implementation Agreement even if the

related liabilities are paid beyond June 2025 based on the deferment of AGR dues availed by the Company. The settlement between

the Company and VInL promoters for any cash outflow that could possibly arise shall be subject to requisite approvals, if any, which

would be evaluated/obtained at the time of settlement, to VInL promoters.

vi)

One Time Spectrum Charges (Beyond 4.4 MHz):

During the financial year 2012-13, DoT had issued demand notices towards one time spectrum charges (hereinafter referred to as

“OTSC”). The demands on the Company i.e. formerly Idea Cellular Limited have been challenged by way of writ petition before the

Bombay High Court (BHC). The erstwhile Vodafone India Limited (VInL) and erstwhile Vodafone Mobile Services Limited (VMSL) had

challenged the demands before the TDSAT. The grounds taken before BHC and TDSAT were different though.

On July 4, 2019 TDSAT in its judgement quashed the demands levied on erstwhile VInL and VMSL and inter alia held that:

−

For spectrum up to 6.2 MHz, OTSC is not chargeable and accordingly demand set aside.

−

For spectrum beyond 6.2 MHz,

•

Allotment after July 1, 2008, OTSC shall be levied from the date of allotment of such spectrum.

•

Allotment before July 1, 2008, OTSC shall be levied from January 1, 2013 till the date of expiry of license.

•

Conditions as stated in para 1 (v) of the impugned order dated December 28, 2012 (given hereunder) is arbitrary and illegal

and is accordingly set aside, i.e. Upfront charges in the case of spectrum holding in multiple bands (900 MHz and 1800

MHz), spectrum in 1800 MHz band will be accounted for first, towards the limit of 4.4 MHz was held to be arbitrary and

illegal and accordingly set aside.

Thereafter VIL filed an appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against the TDSAT judgement. On March 16, 2020, Hon’ble Supreme

Court dismissed the petition filed by the Company challenging the levy of OTSC beyond 6.2 MHz. Following the dismissal of the Company’s

appeal by the Hon’ble Supreme Court on March 16, 2020, the Company is yet to receive any demand from DoT in line with the TDSAT

order. VIL proceedings before the BHC in respect of Idea Cellular Limited remains pending. DoT preferred an appeal against the entire

TDSAT judgement and sought stay on the impugned judgement. The matter is pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court.

The Company, on prudence basis, has recognized a charge for spectrum holding beyond 6.2 MHz in line with the TDSAT order. The

amount has been calculated basis the demand computation that was raised by DoT in July 2018 for Bank Guarantees to be given:

vi)

The Implementation Agreement entered between the parties defines a settlement mechanism between the Company and the

promoters of erstwhile Vodafone India Limited (“VInL”) for any cash inflow/outflow that could possibly arise to/by the Company towards

settlement of certain outstanding disputes pertaining to the period until May 31, 2018. As at March 31, 2023, the Company had

recognized settlement assets amounting to ` 63,939 Mn. The settlement of such assets recognized was to happen periodically based

on cash inflow/ outflow incurred as defined in the Implementation Agreement starting from June 2020 but not beyond June 2025.

The Company has classified ` 17,270 Mn received mainly on account of income tax refund for the period July 2020 till December

2022 as payable to VInL promoters as per the terms of the Implementation Agreement. The balance receivables of ` 81,209 Mn as

at March 31, 2023 is subject to further cash inflows / outflows incurred till June, 2025 and hence, classified as non-current financial

assets. The Company believes that it will be able to recover this amount in terms of the Implementation Agreement even if the

related liabilities are paid beyond June 2025 based on the deferment of AGR dues availed by the Company. The settlement between

the Company and VInL promoters for any cash outflow that could possibly arise shall be subject to requisite approvals, if any, which

would be evaluated/obtained at the time of settlement to VInL promoters.

vii) One Time Spectrum Charges (Beyond 4.4 MHz):

During the financial year 2012-13, DoT had issued demand notices towards one time spectrum charges (hereinafter referred to as

“OTSC”). The demands on the Company i.e. formerly Idea Cellular Limited have been challenged by way of writ petition before the

Bombay High Court (BHC). The erstwhile Vodafone India Limited (VInL) and erstwhile Vodafone Mobile Services Limited (VMSL) had

challenged the demands before the TDSAT. The grounds taken before BHC and TDSAT were different though.

On July 4, 2019 TDSAT in its judgement quashed the demands levied on erstwhile VInL and VMSL and inter alia held that:

-

For spectrum up to 6.2 MHz, OTSC is not chargeable and accordingly demand set aside.

-

For spectrum beyond 6.2 MHz,

•

Allotment after July 1, 2008, OTSC shall be levied from the date of allotment of such spectrum.

•

Allotment before July 1, 2008, OTSC shall be levied from January 1, 2013 till the date of expiry of license.

•

Conditions as stated in para 1 (v) of the impugned order dated December 28, 2012 (given hereunder) is arbitrary and

illegal and is accordingly set aside, i.e. Upfront charges in the case of spectrum holding in multiple bands (900 MHz and:
