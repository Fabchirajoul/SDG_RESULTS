Dear Shareholders,

We take great pride in our 18+ years of success

driven by our vision of ‘Built to Last’ and anchored

on our differentiated business model,

entrepreneurial culture, continuous innovations

and robust ﬁnancial fundamentals. We would not

have made it this far without the unwavering

support of our shareholders, the dedication of all

Afﬂers and the trust of our customers.

Afﬂe’s core differentiation of being a consumer-

centric technology business powering

conversions at scale, while ensuring consumers’

data privacy has led us to consistently deliver

strong proﬁtable growth. We continued our

growth momentum in FY2022-23 to conclude the

year with highest revenue, conversions,

proﬁtability and cash ﬂows from operations till

date. It was an exciting year marked with several

important milestones and well supported by our

focus on enhancing the quality of revenue and

bottom-line fundamentals by further scaling our

tech platforms and ecosystem level partnerships.

A PERIOD OF NEW NORMS

Last ﬁnancial year ushered a period of new norms

– new customer needs, new normal macro

environment and new avenues of technological

evolution. Building further on our focused efforts

to augment our value proposition with Afﬂe2.0

Consumer Platform Stack, we were extremely

agile to strategically realign our teams, products,

offerings and go-to market approach to power

the emerging realities and tech use cases at an

enhanced scale. This has further strengthened

our moat, enhanced mutual trust with our

customers & partners and laid a solid foundation

for long-term future growth.

TECHNOVATION: BOLD AND FUTURE-READY

We have made tremendous strides in

strengthening our impactful tech capabilities and

platform solutions that power the mobile

marketing ecosystem. We launched our full-

funnel proposition on iOS Appstore Apple Search

Ads, enabling advertisers to drive premium

conversions of iOS users effectively. We also

rolled out CPCU model on Connected TV with

household ID sync technology, that has

established a unique competitive advantage for

us as one of the ﬁrst few companies to offer

conversion-linked capabilities on the Connected

TV ecosystem. Further, we augmented our

mobile OEMs, operators and publisher

partnerships to power an open internet

connected ecosystem across the global

emerging markets. This has further strengthened

our consumer platform and enabled greater

ROI impact for our customers.

STRENGTHENED OUR CORE

We continued to capitalize on broader

transformational industry shift to further

strengthen our core by focusing on talent building,

empowering our teams with futuristic capabilities

and riding deeper into new markets. We made

efforts towards enhancing our team capabilities in

India as well as augmented on-ground presence in

some of the international geographies like South

East Asia, Middle East Africa, North America and

Latin America. Further, we realigned our on-

ground resources in North America to ensure

greater alignment of our teams to upsell and cross-

sell all our platform use cases on the CPCU business

model, linked to the aggressive growth plans

powering our Vision 2030.

SPIRITED PERFORMANCE

We concluded FY2022-23 as a landmark year

having achieved over 5X growth in topline and

proﬁtability over the last 5 ﬁnancial years. Our

Revenue from Operations increased by 32.6% y-

o-y. Our Proﬁt After Tax increased by 14.4% y-o-y

and Normalized PAT (attributable to equity

holders of the parent) increased by 33.8% y-o-y.

Our cashﬂow from operations increased at a

CAGR of 52.8% over the period FY2019-23.

Powered by ROI-linked CPCU business model,

our consumer platform delivered 256.8 million

converted users crossing the ‘250 million’ mark

for the ﬁrst time and our CPCU revenue increased

by 35.3% y-o-y. Our strong cash ﬂow and balance

sheet ensures that we continue to invest to drive

long-term sustainable growth through

technology innovation, market expansion and

consolidation.

SUCCESSFUL TECH ACQUISITIONS

We have a proven track record of unlocking

greater proﬁtable growth for the acquired

companies through successfully turning them

around over time. This has helped us leverage on

our past acquisitive experience and sound

ﬁnancial position to penetrate deeper into the

high-growth gaming vertical globally through the

acquisition of YouAppi. It complements our CPCU

business model, verticalization strategy and

overall culture to deliver a comprehensive range

of programmatic mobile app marketing solutions

for leading gaming companies globally.

CREATING VALUE SUSTAINABLY

As a responsible corporate citizen, we have

always upheld business integrity and sound

governance as the cornerstone of consistent

stakeholder value creation. We have taken

proactive measures towards ESG reporting and

implemented various policies that promote

sustainable business practices. Our pursuit of

excellence in corporate governance, risk

management and sustainability initiatives has

enabled us to emerge as a resilient organization.

CHARTING THE FUTURE: TOWARDS NEW

WORLD REALITIES

As we look ahead, we are excited about growth

opportunities that await ahead of us. We remain

committed to staying at the forefront of the

industry, driving innovation, thought leadership

and creating a signiﬁcant impact. As an AI

algorithm powered consumer platform business,

we are investing our resources in identifying

future technological trends, leveraging our core

R&D capabilities to build new IP, new patents and

pursue innovative use cases for responsible

integration of Generative AI large language

models. This proactive approach allows us to

strike a balance between short-term product-

based innovation and making long-term

decisions to strengthen our pole position.

With this, I conclude by extending my gratitude to

all our stakeholders. Together, we will continue to

chart new territories and shape a successful and

sustainable future.

Delivering with Resilience,

Progressing with Optimism
