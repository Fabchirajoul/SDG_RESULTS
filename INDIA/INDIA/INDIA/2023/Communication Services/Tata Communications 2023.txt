Dear Shareholders,

Tata Communications

Limited is committed to

achieving double-digit

revenue growth year

after year. Towards this

journey, our performance

during the year reflects our

commitment to delivering

strong results. This

accomplishment is a result

of our product shift and

superior customer focus.

These strategic measures

have allowed us to

successfully shift towards

digital platforms and

solutions, bolstering our

portfolio and enhancing

our relevance within

the evolving customer

ecosystem, both in India

and international markets.

Our solution portfolio,

underpinned by our global

network backbone, is a

digital fabric which is

becoming instrumental in

enabling our customers

transformation journeys

and putting us on a firm

path of establishing Tata

Communications as a

leading global CommTech

player.

SCALING UP

Our revenues from the Core

Connectivity business for

FY 2022-23 grew by 5.7%. We

continue to invest in the core

capabilities, thus transforming our

networks to be intelligent and are

working on their programmability

to cater to the new market needs

particularly to that of on-demand

needs.

a new world of end-to-end video

production and transmission of

high-quality, high-speed, and more

immersive live video experiences for

viewers and fans from event venues

and racetracks to screens across

devices.

STRENGTHENING OUR

PORTFOLIO

SUPERIOR CUSTOMER

INTERACTIONS

During the year we launched

Tata Communications DIGO, our

customer interaction platform.

This platform provides enterprises

with a unified view of all their

customers’ conversations and

interactions across various channels.

Additionally, we offer an extensive

library of applications that serve

as connectors, augmenting the

capabilities of enterprises’ existing

applications.

SIMPLIFYING COLLABORATION

FOR A CONNECTED WORKFORCE

Hybrid working has become the

new norm, and it is evident that

distributed workforces are here

to stay. To facilitate exceptional

employee experiences, efficiently

transitioning to the cloud is

crucial for enterprises. At Tata

Communications, we understand

this need and have taken steps to

enhance our Unified Collaboration

Platform, GlobalRapide, with the

introduction of JAMVEE a voice

calling application on the cloud,

with calling, messaging and PBX

functionality, which can run on

browser, mobile and desktop.

This recent addition aims to simplify

collaboration for enterprises,

ensuring seamless and efficient

communication. JAMVEE offers

quick and seamless integration

with an enterprise’s communication

applications, enabling faster

onboarding and smoother user

experiences. JAMVEE is designed

to be regulatory compliant,

incorporating fraud prevention APIs,

detection mechanisms, and alerting

features. This ensures that sensitive

information remains protected

and confidential throughout all

interactions.

CONNECTED SOLUTIONS FOR A

HYPERCONNECTED FUTURE

We are dedicated to assisting

our customers in implementing

connected solutions for their

businesses, providing them with the

necessary platform, connectivity,

and expertise to unite people,

machines, and materials. As part

of our commitment to meeting

their evolving needs, we have

expanded our Tata Communications

MOVETM platform by introducing

CloudSIM™. This innovative cloud-

based embedded subscriber identity

module (eSIM) enhances security,

simplicity, and scalability for our

customers in the manufacturing,

supply chain, and automotive

sectors. The lack of adequate end-

point security is a key challenge

for the wider proliferation of IoT

enabled solutions. Our recently

launched solution – Ijura, a network

edge-based solution to identify

vulnerabilities through deep

packet inspection, integrated

with our zero-trust networking

solution NetFoundryTM, delivers

an advanced and comprehensive

threat protection for connected

and distributed IoT assets and

ecosystems.

Recognising the immense potential

of 5G, we have made strategic

investments in this area and recently

launched our Private 5G Global

Centre of Excellence in Pune, India.

This centre serves as a hub for

developing and testing various

use cases to accelerate the digital

transformation of enterprises.

CONNECTED SECURITY

A robust cybersecurity strategy

is essential in establishing cyber

resiliency and fostering digital

trust. We are focused on assisting

enterprises in monitoring their

entire digital estate by enhancing

the agility of our already successful

Cloud Cyber Security Operations

Centre (‘Cloud SOC’). We are proud

to deliver these services in an

accelerated timeframe, often within

a matter of weeks. This has been

well received by our customers

and we are seeing increase in the

market engagement. Furthermore,

we have extended this capability

to the Middle East region with the

establishment of a dedicated Cloud

SOC in the UAE. Our managed

security services, combined with

comprehensive cyber-threat

intelligence, provide enterprises with

the assurance that their mission-

critical information is secure.

Tata Communications IZO™

SD-WAN is a managed service that

helps enterprises transform their

network and security architecture

to make it more agile, secure

and optimised. This is an end-

to-end solution that includes

comprehensive network and

application assessment, migration

and management. Our assessment

approach helps us build the right

solution, our automation driven

migration approach reduces risk

during migration and our AI assisted

assurance approach helps ensure

better uptime. Our customers have

seen upto 25% reduction in Total

Cost of Ownership (‘TCO’) and upto

60% improvement in application

performance.

We also introduced SD-WAN as

a service (‘SD-WANaaS’) which

offers a cloud-like consumption

model (pay as you go) with flexible

contract periods. It enables a

simple buying experience and

faster migration to SD-WAN for

customers who need more agility

and scalability.

Another product we launched this

year is SPAED which is a simple

plug-n-play, as-a-service solution,

which enables enterprises to

securely connect smaller branches

or WFH users. SPAED provides

features such as intelligent routing,

security, zero trust connectivity to

multiple clouds, network failover,

etc. We have seen good traction in

use cases such as small retail stores,

temporary sites and WFH power

users.

Our Digital portfolio grew at 21.3% in

FY 2022-23. Our multitude of

offerings in the Digital portfolio are

intended to consistently deliver

more holistic solutions, stitching

multiple products together for our

customers’ ecosystems. Our Digital

portfolio possesses the strength

to help the enterprises to power

their hyperconnected ecosystem.

We have a good pipeline in our

sales funnel and pipeline of product

feature releases and new products

in coming months.

In FY 2022-23, our commitment to

delivering growth has been at the

forefront of our operations. As a

result, we have not only solidified

our market leadership position in

India in data services but have also

made remarkable strides towards

becoming a more meaningful

player in international markets. Our

focus on bolstering our managed

network services has been a key

driver of this success, exemplified

by the introduction of our new IZO™

Internet WAN variants designed

specifically for global enterprises.

These enhancements have allowed

us to offer predictable and reliable

network services, extending our

reach to over 150 geographies

worldwide.

During the year we expanded

our customer base in the Media

and Entertainment Services

business through a multi-year

collaboration to become the Official

Broadcast Distribution Provider

for the ABB FIA Formula E World

Championship and supporting the

sport’s sustainability initiative by

delivering a cloud-based remote

broadcast production. Through

enabling remote production, we

helped Formula E reduce their

costs by 40% to 50% and also

reduce emissions. Additionally, we

extended our strategic collaboration

with MotoGP, securing exclusive

multi-year collaboration to bring the

thrilling race action to nearly half a

billion households globally.

We also acquired 100% stake

in ‘The Switch Enterprises,’

a US-based company. The combined

strength of Tata Communications

and The Switch is set to usher in

Management Discussion and Analysis (‘MDA’)

ECONOMIC OVERVIEW

The year 2022 marked significant progress in the global

economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. While the

world witnessed considerable growth and stabilisation, it

was also challenged by ongoing risks from the pandemic

and geopolitical developments.

Global GDP growth in 2022 was estimated to be at 3.4%1.

This growth was supported by a combination of monetary

and fiscal policies, increasing vaccination rates, and the

easing of restrictions that allowed for the resumption of

economic activities.

However, the global growth is estimated to fall to 2.9%

in 20231, as the rise in central bank rates to fight inflation

and geopolitical issues continue to weigh on economic

activity. Although, the global economy continues

to display resilience and modest improvement, the

estimates are well below the long term global growth

average of 3.1%1. The recent banking sector turmoil in the

United States and Europe has illustrated fragilities in the

financial system, complicating the trade-off for central

banks between fighting inflation and preserving financial

stability. Debt levels remain high, limiting the ability of

fiscal policymakers to respond to new challenges.

Risks to current economic scenario:

•

Covid-19 Related Risks: Despite significant progress

in vaccination campaigns and the lifting of restrictions,

Covid-19 remained a key risk factor in 2022. The

emergence of new variants and unequal vaccine

distribution threatened to disrupt the recovery

process. Governments and health organisations

continued to closely monitor the situation and

adapt strategies accordingly. While direct impact of

covid is huge, it has also caused significant impact

indirectly by the stress induced in medical & pharma

supply chain including access to medicines for non-

communicable diseases2.

•

Russia-Ukraine War: The ongoing conflict between

Russia and Ukraine had significant implications for the

global economy. Disruptions to energy supplies, trade

routes, and financial markets increased uncertainty

and weighed on global economic prospects. The

conflict also strained relations between Russia and

the West, leading to the imposition of economic

sanctions and further disruptions. While the day-

to-day situation continues to evolve, it has been

predicted that this conflict has caused regional

output to contract by 0.2%3.

•

China-Taiwan Conflict: Tensions between China and

Taiwan also escalated in 2022, posing a risk to regional

stability and global supply chains. The situation

demanded increased diplomatic efforts to avoid a

full-scale conflict and to mitigate potential negative

impacts on the global economy. If this conflict worsens,

it is expected to cost above USD 2 Trillion annually in

economic impact even in the best-case scenarios4.

In the current complex situation of geopolitical

and

monetary

pressures,

the

overall

global

outlook is still optimistic especially powered by

strong developments in emerging and developing

economies. Growth in emerging and developing Asia

is expected to rise in 2023 and 2024 to 5.3% and

5.2% respectively5. While inflation and supply chain

challenges will continue to affect many countries

in the short term, underlying trends are expected

to improve. Technological advancements will deliver

major economic production and make consumption

structures more sustainable. Institutions will need to

prepare for their digital future and not remain just

passive observers to the ongoing digital revolution.

They should prepare for the ongoing changes with a

strategic end-to-end digital transformation.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

The imperative for digitalisation across all sectors has

pushed the Information & Communications Technology

(‘ICT’) industry to develop new technologies, products,

and services at an unprecedented pace while attracting

new investment, talent, and players to the market.

Demand for flexibility, affordability, and accessibility of

ICT continues to rise while there is a persistent need for

greater computing power and cybersecurity. These forces

drive innovation and new approaches to value chains and

business models in the industry. Today, every business,

from financial services and healthcare to education

dated September 7, 2000. The GoI also gave the

Company an assurance that it would consider

additional

compensation,

if

found

necessary,

following a detailed review of its decision to open up

the ILD market.

Contrary to its assurances, on January 18, 2002, the

GoI issued a further: letter to the Company, unilaterally

declaring that the compensation package provided

in its original letter was to be treated as full and final

settlement of every sort of claim against the early

termination of the Company’s exclusivity rights in the

ILD business. The Company filed a suit in the Bombay

High Court in 2005. On July 7, 2010, the Bombay High

Court ruled that it did not have the jurisdiction to

hear this suit, in view of the provisions of the Telecom

Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997. Aggrieved by

this Order, the Company instituted an appeal before a

division bench of the Bombay High Court on various

grounds. This appeal is yet to come up for a hearing.

at 31 March 1986 to the Company with effect from 1 April

1986. During the financial year 2007-08, the Company

changed its name from Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited

to Tata Communications Limited and the fresh certificate

of incorporation consequent upon the change of name

was issued by the Registrar of Companies, Mumbai,

Maharashtra on 28 January 2008.

400 001. The Company’s equity and debt are listed on

recognised stock exchanges in India.

The Company offers international and national voice

2. Significant accounting policies

a.

Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in

accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind

AS’) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to time).

b.

Basis of preparation of financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared on a

historical cost basis, except for the following assets and

liabilities which have been measured at fair value:

•

Derivative financial instruments,

•

Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at

fair value (refer note 2 (o)).

The accounting policies adopted for preparation

and presentation of financial statements have been

consistently applied. All assets and liabilities have

been classified as current and non-current as per the

Company’s normal operating cycle.

The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees

(“INR”) and all values are rounded to the nearest crores

(INR 00,00,000), except when otherwise indicated.

c.

Significant accounting judgements, estimates and

assumptions

The preparation of these financial statements in

conformity with recognition and measurement principles

of Ind AS requires the management of the Company

to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that

affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities,

disclosures relating to contingent liability as at the date

of the financial statements and the reported amounts of

income and expenses for the periods presented.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed

on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates

are recognised in the period in which the estimates are

revised and future periods are affected.

i.

Judgements

In the process of applying the Company’s accounting

policies, the management has made the following

judgements, which have the most significant

effect on the amounts recognised in the financial

statements:

a) Revenue from contracts with customers:

As per Company’s assessment, it is generally

the principal in its revenue arrangements, as it

typically controls the goods or services before

transferring them to the customer.

b) Operating lease commitments – Company as

lessor:

The Company has entered into property

leases (‘the leases’) on its investment property

portfolio. The Company has determined the

accounting of the leases as operating lease

on its Investment property portfolio, based

on an evaluation of the terms and conditions

of the arrangements, such as the lease term

not constituting a major part of the economic

life of the commercial property, the fair value

of the asset and the fact that it retains all the

significant risks and rewards of ownership of

these properties.

ii.

Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and

other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the

reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing

a material adjustment to the carrying amounts

of assets and liabilities within the next financial

year, are described below. The Company based its:

47. Related party transactions (Contd..):

letter dated 20 February 2014 extended

the validity of the said license for 3 months with

condition that entire ISP revenue will be subject

to license fees. This conditional extension by DoT,

was challenged by the Company in TDSAT and

on 18 October 2019 the Company’s petition has

been allowed by TDSAT. DoT has filed an appeal

in Hon’ble Supreme Court, against the said order,

but no stay has been granted by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court and appeal is yet to be heard. The

Company has continued to disclose an amount of

H 1,479.35 crores (31 March 2022: H 1,287.15 crores)

including interest under contingent liabilities. In

the previous year, the Company has signed UL-

ISP License on 6 August 2021 and is duly paying

the license fees thereunder.

iv.

Other claims of H 329.97 crores (31 March 2022:

H 290.41 crores) mainly pertain to routine suits

for collection, commercial disputes, claims from

customers and/or suppliers, BSNL port charges

and claim from Employee State Insurance

Corporation.

3.

During the earlier years, the Company and its

two directors and an ex-employee had received

show cause notices (SCNs) from Directorate of

Enforcement, Ministry of Finance on alleged violation

of the rules and regulations under the Foreign

Exchange Management Act, 1999. The contravention

amount involved in all these notices is H 593 crores.

The liability could extend up to three times the

amount quantified as contravention. The Company

had provided H 4.50 crores as compounding penalty,

based on a legal opinion. During the previous year,

Ministry of Information and Broadcasting approval

was received and based on the same the Company

had filed its application with RBI for compounding

of charges. The Company and the named individuals

in the SCNs filed their replies to the SCNs refuting

the allegations made therein and without prejudice

to their contentions and claims filed compounding

applications with the RBI. RBI vide its separate

orders dated 18 October 2019, had disposed off the

compounding applications and had compounded

the contravention subject of payment of H 1.48

crores by the Company and H 0.14 crores each

by the individuals. The Company had made the

payment on its behalf and also on behalf of the

individuals. Thereafter, the Company and named

individuals have also filed their representation with

ED requesting for the closure of the proceedings.

Based on the management assessment and legal advice

(wherever taken), the Company believes that the above:

*Pertains to non controlling shareholders in OASIS Smart SIM Europe SAS, SEPCO Communications (Pty) Limited and Tata Communications Lanka Limited:

letter No. G-25015/6/86OC dated 27

March 1986, transferred all assets and liabilities of the

Overseas Communications Service (“OCS”) (part of

the Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of

Communications) as appearing in the Balance sheet as

at 31 March 1986 to the Company with effect from 1 April

1986. During the financial year 2007-08, the Company

changed its name from Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited

to Tata Communications Limited and the fresh certificate

of incorporation consequent upon the change of name

was issued by the Registrar of Companies, Mumbai

Maharashtra on 28 January 2008.

The Company is domiciled in India and its registered

office is at VSB, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Fort, Mumbai –

400 001. The Company’s equity and debt are listed on

recognised stock exchanges in India.

Tata Communications Limited and its subsidiaries

(collectively “the Group”) offers international and

national voice and data transmission services, selling

and leasing of bandwidth on undersea cable systems,

internet

connectivity

services

and

other

value-

added services comprising unified conferencing and

collaboration services, managed hosting, mobile global

roaming and signalling services, transponder lease,

television uplinking and other managed services, set up,

own and operate white label Automated Teller Machines

(“ATMs”), data center colocation services, network

management and support and other related services.

The Group also undertakes leasing, letting out, licensing

or developing immovable properties to earn income

of any nature including inter-alia rental, lease, license

income, etc from immovable properties of the Group

including land and buildings.

2. Significant accounting policies

a.

Statement of compliance

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have

been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting

Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended

from time to time).

b.

Basis

of

preparation

of

consolidated

financial

statements

The consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the

following assets and liabilities which have been measured

at fair value:

i.

Derivative financial instruments,

ii.

Certain financial assets and liabilities measured

at fair value (Refer accounting policy regarding

financial instruments).

The accounting policies adopted for preparation

and presentation of financial statements have been

consistently applied. All assets and liabilities have been

classified as current and non-current as per the Group’s

normal operating cycle.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in

Indian Rupees (INR) and all values are rounded to the

nearest crores (INR 00,00,000), except when otherwise

indicated.

c.

Going concern

The financial statements of the Group have been

prepared on a going concern basis. The consolidated

financial statements have been prepared as a going

concern basis including considering continuing financial

support to the Group’s subsidaries with continuing losses

on an accrual basis under the historical cost convention.

d.

Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the

financial statements of the Company and the entities

controlled by the Company and its associates. Control is

achieved when the Company:

i.

has power over the investee (i.e. existing rights

that give it the current ability to direct the relevant

activities of the investee);

ii.

is exposed or has rights, to variable returns from its

involvement with the investee and has the ability to

use its power over the investee to affect its returns.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an

investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there

are changes to one or more of the two elements of

control listed above.

Income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed

off during the year are included in the consolidated financial

statements from the date the Group obtains control until

the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

Profit

or

loss

and

each

component

of

other

comprehensive income (“OCI”) are attributed to the

owners of the Company and to the non-controlling

interests, even if this results in the non-controlling

interests having a deficit balance.

When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial

statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting

policies in line with the Group’s accounting policies. The

financial statements of all entities used for the purpose

of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as

that of the parent company.

All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income,

expenses and cash flows relating to transactions

between members of the Group are eliminated in full on

consolidation.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without

a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.

If the Group losses control over a subsidiary, it:

i.

Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and

liabilities of the subsidiary

ii.

Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-

controlling interests

iii. Derecognises the cumulative translation differences

recorded in equity

iv.

Recognises the fair value of the consideration

received

v.

Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss

vi. Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously

recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained earnings,

as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had

directly disposed off the related assets or liabilities.

e.

Business Combination

Acquisitions of business are accounted for using the

acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a

business combination is measured at fair value, which is

calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values

of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred

by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and

the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange

of control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are

generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired,

and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair

value, except that:

i.

Deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or

liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements

are recognized and measured in accordance with

Ind AS 12 Income Taxes and Ind AS 19 – Employee

Benefits respectively.

ii.

Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held

for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105 Non Current

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

are measured in accordance with that Standard.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the

consideration transferred, the amount of any non-

controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value

of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the

acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date

amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the

liabilities assumed.

Non-Controlling interests that are present ownership

interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate

share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation

may be initially measured either at fair value or at the

non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the

recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net

assets. The choice of basis of measurement basis is

made on transaction-by-transaction basis.

When the consideration transferred by the Group in a

business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting

from a contingent consideration, they are measured at

its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of

the consideration transferred in a business combination.

Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration

that qualify as measurement period adjustments are

adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments

against goodwill or capital reserve, as the case may be.

Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that

arise from additional information obtained during the

‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year

from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances

that existed at the acquisition date.

The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value

of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as

measurement period adjustments depends on how

the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent

consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured

at subsequent settlement dates and is accounted for

within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified

as an asset or a liability is remeasured at fair value at

subsequent reporting dates with the corresponding gain

or loss being recognized in profit or loss.

When a business combination is achieved in stages, the

Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree

is remeasured to its acquisition-date fair value and the

resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in profit or

loss statement. Amounts arising from interests in the

acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously

been recognised in other comprehensive income are

reclassified to profit or loss where such treatment would

letter dated 20 February 2014 extended the validity

of the said license for 3 months with condition that

entire ISP revenue will be subject to license fees.

This conditional extension by DoT, was challenged

by the Company in TDSAT and on 18 October 2019

the Company’s petition has been allowed by TDSAT.

DoT has filed an appeal in Hon’ble Supreme Court,

against the said order, but no stay has been granted

by the Hon’ble Supreme Court and appeal is yet to

be heard. The Company has continued to disclose

an amount of H 1,479.35 crores (31 March 2022: H

1,287.15 crores) including interest under contingent

liabilities. In the previous year, the Company had

signed UL-ISP License on 6 August 2021 and is duly

paying the license fees thereunder.

iv.

Other claims of H 337.85 crores (31 March 2022:

H 290.41 crores) mainly pertain to routine suits

for collection, commercial disputes, claims from

customers and/or suppliers, BSNL port charges and

claim from Employee State Insurance Corporation.

v.

During the earlier years, the Company and its

two directors and an ex-employee had received

show cause notices (SCNs) from Directorate of

Enforcement, Ministry of Finance on alleged violation

of the rules and regulations under the Foreign

Exchange Management Act, 1999. The contravention

amount involved in all these notices is H 593 crores.

The liability could extend up to three times the

amount quantified as contravention. The Company

had provided H 4.50 crores as compounding penalty,

based on a legal opinion. During the previous year,

Ministry of Information and Broadcasting approval

was received and based on the same the Company

had filed its application with RBI for compounding

of charges. The Company and the named individuals

in the SCNs filed their replies to the SCNs refuting

the allegations made therein and without prejudice

to their contentions and claims filed compounding

applications with the RBI. RBI vide its separate

orders dated 18 October 2019, had disposed off the

compounding applications and had compounded

the contravention subject of payment of H 1.48

crores by the Company and H 0.14 crores each

by the individuals. The Company had made the

payment on its behalf and also on behalf of the

individuals. Thereafter, the Company and named

individuals have also filed their representation with

ED requesting for the closure of the proceedings.

vi. Based on the management assessment and legal

advice, wherever taken, the Group believes that the

above claims are not probable and would not result in

outflow of resources embodying economic benefits.

b.

Capital commitments:

Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed

on capital account, not provided for amount to H 1,470.46

crores (31 March 2022: H 1,360.77 crores) (net of capital

advances). Further Group’s share in associate’s capital

commitment is H 342.77 crores (31 March 2022: H 114.68

crores) (net of capital advances).

As at 31 March 2023, the Group has remaining

commitment of H 37.80 crores (equivalent of USD 4.60

million) (31 March 2022: H 34.86 crores (equivalent of

USD 4.60 million)) towards investments in Northgate

Telecom Innovations Partners, L.P., one of the investee.

46. The DOT has amended the definition of Gross Revenue

(GR) /AGR in the Unified License and including licenses

held by the Company. The new definition allows

for deduction of revenue from activities other than

telecom activities / operations which is less than 20%

of the total revenue from operations. The association

of Internet Service providers has written to the DOT,

seeking clarification on certain non-licensed services

that it provides and in the interim, the Company has

considered the revenue from such services under the

deduction provided by the new definition. The Company

also obtained independent legal view in this regard.
