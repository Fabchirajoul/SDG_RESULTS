whereby lenders such as banks and other

financial

institutions

make

payments

to

supplier’s banks for purchase of materials.

The banks and financial institutions are

subsequently repaid by the Company at a

later date providing working capital benefits.

These arrangements are in the nature of

credit extended in normal operating cycle

and these arrangements are recognized as

acceptances under trade payables. Interest

borne by the company on such arrangements

is accounted as finance cost. Other financial

liabilities (including borrowings and trade and

other payables) are subsequently measured

at amortised cost using the effective interest

method.

Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts issued by the

Company are those contracts that require a

payment to be made to reimburse the holder

for a loss it incurs because the specified

debtor fails to make a payment when due in

accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised

initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for

transaction costs that are directly attributable

to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently,

the liability is measured at the higher of the

amount of loss allowance determined as

per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109

and the amount recognised less cumulative

amortisation.

De-recognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the

obligation under the liability is discharged or

cancelled or expires. When an existing financial

liability is replaced by another from the same

lender on substantially different terms, or the

terms of an existing liability are substantially

modified, such an exchange or modification

is treated as the derecognition of the original

liability and the recognition of a new liability.

The difference in the respective carrying

amounts is recognised in the statement of

profit or loss.

(c)

Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are

offset and the net amount is reported in the

balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable

legal right to offset the recognised amounts

and there is an intention to settle on a net basis,

to realise the assets and settle the liabilities

simultaneously.

p.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet

comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-

term deposits with an original maturity of

three months or less, which are subject to an

insignificant risk of changes in value.

q.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by

dividing the net profit or loss attributable to

equity holder of the company (after deducting

preference dividends and attributable taxes) by

the weighted average number of equity shares

outstanding during the period. Partly paid

equity shares are treated as a fraction of an

equity share to the extent that they are entitled

to participate in dividends relative to a fully

paid equity share during the reporting period.

The weighted average number of equity shares

outstanding during the period is adjusted for

events such as bonus issue, bonus element in a

rights issue, share split, and reverse share split

(consolidation of shares) that have changed the

number of equity shares outstanding, without a

corresponding change in resources.

For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings

per share, the net profit or loss for the period,

attributable to equity shareholders of the

Company and the weighted average number

of shares outstanding during the period are

adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential

equity shares.

ultimate Promoter Company (Wilmar International

Limited).

Accordingly, the Group management believes it will

be able to meet all its financial obligations, on a

timely basis and hence, the Group has prepared the

financial statements on going concern basis.

Principles of Consolidation

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured

entities) over which the Company has control. The

Company controls an entity when the Company

is exposed to or has right to, variable returns from

its involvement with the entity and has the ability

to affect those returns through its power to direct

the relevant activity of the entity. Subsidiaries are

fully consolidated from the date on which control is

transferred to the Company. They are deconsolidated

from the date that control ceases.

The Group combines the financial statements of the

parent and its subsidiaries through line by line addition

of like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and

expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and

unrealized gains on transactions between group

companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also

eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence

of an impairment of the transferred asset.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of

subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated

statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement

of changes in equity and consolidated balance sheet

respectively.
