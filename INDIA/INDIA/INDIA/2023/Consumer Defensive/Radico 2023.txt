Letter to the Shareholders

The macro environment in

FY2023 was marked by raw

material volatility and inflationary

pressures triggered largely by the

continuing geopolitical tensions.

Amid these challenges, the

Indian alcohol beverages industry

showed remarkable resilience to

post strong growth. The easing

Covid situation led to a significant

demand revival during the year.

Further aided by the growing

premiumisation trend, this

boosted industry performance.: Dear Shareholders,

Radico Khaitan was quick to harness the emerging

demand to post a robust performance. Our strong

premiumisation focus, coupled with our deep

consumer understanding and centricity, helped us

in posting performance excellence. We successfully

delivered a broad-based, premium volume growth

across our product portfolio and geographies, despite

the overall challenging operating environment.

Our sustained investment behind our core brands,

agile supply chain, and robust distribution network

helped us drive growth in the Prestige & Above

category volumes, which registered 17% year-

on-year growth on a very high base. Our strong

premiumisation focus led to a growth of over 150%

compared to the pre-pandemic levels in the Prestige

& Above brands, resulting in sustainable improvement

in the realisation per case. The complexities and

challenges of the external environment failed to

dampen our spirits and we continued to move

actively forward towards the accomplishment of

our targets.

I would like to take a moment here to thank all of

you for your sustained confidence and support in

our onward journey. As a mark of our gratefulness

and in line with our strategy of maintaining a balance

between delivering returns to shareholders and

preserving funds for growth capital, we propose a

consistent dividend of `3.00 per share.
