Gillette India Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

I am delighted to share with you a summary of the Company’s

overall performance in fiscal year 2022-2023.

The Company ended the financial year on a strong note,

recording double-digit growth across top-line and bottom-

line. The Company delivered sales of ₹2477 crore, up 10% versus

year ago while Profit After Tax (PAT) for the fiscal year, was

₹356 crore, up 23% versus year ago behind product price-mix

and high productivity. This strong and balanced growth came

against a dynamic and volatile macro-economic environment

which fueled various unprecedented challenges and headwinds.

The strong results are a testament of the Company’s robust integrated growth strategies of

focusing on daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, irresistible superiority

(across product, packaging, communication, go-to-market execution, and value), productivity,

constructive disruption, and an agile and accountable organization structure and culture. These

strategies build on each other and have worked for the Company despite a challenging external

environment.

In the year, the Company introduced new innovations to delight the consumers including the

relaunch of Gillette Fusion as a styling tool, Venus Swirl and Oral-B SensitiveX – a premium sensitive

toothbrush. It also enhanced the irresistible superiority of its products like Gillette Guard, Oral-B

Criss Cross and Oral-B Kids electric toothbrushes by innovating across multiple vectors including

packaging and communication. The Company recorded the highest-ever market share in the

Blades and Razors category in the fiscal year 2022-2023.

Our Citizenship framework is based on key pillars of Community Impact, Equality & Inclusion

and Environmental Sustainability, with a strong foundation of Ethics & Corporate Responsibility

guiding everything we do.

Our Equality & Inclusion (E&I) efforts are integrated into how we serve diverse consumers and

support our employees. Our ability to do this most effectively is enabled by a workforce and culture

that understands, respects, and reflects the uniqueness of all the consumers we serve.

The Company’s flagship CSR program, P&G Shiksha, is a 360-degree educational intervention

that addresses three critical barriers to achieving universal education – access to education

infrastructure, gender inequality in access to education and gap in learning.

As we enter the new fiscal year, the outlook for the FMCG sector remains positive. The Company

will continue to focus on its growth strategies towards delivering balanced and sustained growth

in a competitive macroeconomic environment.

L.V. Vaidyanathan: Managing

letter and spirit

of all applicable laws. General compliance with legal

requirements is an important component of the

Company's Worldwide Business Conduct Manual and

the same expects the following from its employees:

•

To uphold our Purpose, Values, and Principles in

our work and in the business decisions we make;

•

To know and fully comply with the laws,

regulations, and Company policies that apply to

•

To be alert to any situations or actions that may

violate the law, the WBCM or Company policies,

and to report them appropriately.

The Company has set in place the requisite

mechanism for meeting with the compliance

requirements, periodic monitoring of compliance

to avoid any deviations, and regular updates to keep

pace with the regulatory changes.

periodically for employees with respect to various

compliance related topics such as Global Anti-

Mechanism, Conflict of Interest, Data Privacy, Data

Integrity, Anti-Trust compliance etc.

assets, at all its offices and plants. During the

Financial Year under review, no major security

breaches or incidents occurred. A comprehensive

security risk assessment is carried out regularly and

processes to protect its personnel and assets.

INTERNAL AUDITOR

During the Financial Year, the Board of Directors had

appointed Ms. Pooja Bhutra, Chartered Accountant

as the Internal Auditor of the Company for the

Financial Year 2022-23.

INTERNAL CONTROLS & THEIR ADEQUACY

The Company continues to prioritize sustainable

control processes that are integral part of organization

culture. It has built strong Internal Controls

Environment and Risk Assessment and Management

systems. These systems enable the Company to

comply with Internal Company policies, procedures,

standard guidelines, and local laws to help protect

Company’s assets and confidential information

including personally identifiable information (PII)

against financial losses and unauthorized use. The

robust controls environment at the Company is

efficiently managed and monitored through:

•

Controls Self-Assessments are performed during

October to December period of every Financial

Year across business processes. The purpose of

this thorough exercise is to review and evaluate

process compliances against standard control

objective, activities and attributes. This enables

the Company to proactively identify control

weaknesses and initiate actions to sustainably

mitigate them.

•

Stewardship and Global Internal Audit

Reviews are led by a team of independent

fulltime Internal Controls experts. Their role is to

ensure that all key processes i.e. selling, revenue,

distribution, trade & marketing spends, vendor

payments, and plant operations are reviewed

and assessed at appropriate intervals. The

observations and findings are shared with senior

management for implementing quality action

plans to strengthen overall controls environment

in these processes. The assessments of high

risks and SOX Compliance areas are assessed by

an independent internal audit department led by

the Company’s Global Internal Audit team. This

team comprises of certified internal controls

process experts who have experiences across

different markets that the Company operates in.:

Dear Shareholders,

We are presenting the Company’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for the Financial Year ended

June 30, 2023.

P&G’s objective is to create value for our shareholders by serving consumers, retail partners, employees and

the communities in which we live and work. We create irresistibly superior propositions for consumers in

daily-use categories, where performance drives brand choice. We aim to create the best product, packaging,

communication, in-store and online presentation and value for our consumers and retail partners. To do this

successfully, we integrate our Citizenship efforts into our business strategy, supported by strong governance

policies and practices. Environmental sustainability as an integral part of superior consumer propositions

creates competitive advantage and drives value for consumers, customers and P&G shareholders. Our strategy

is enabled by a diverse and accountable organization that represents the consumers we serve, understands

their needs and has the ability to design and deliver superior solutions for them.

Our Citizenship framework is based on key pillars of Community Impact, Equality & Inclusion and Environmental

Sustainability, with a strong foundation of Ethics & Corporate Responsibility guiding everything we do.

Our efforts in Environmental Sustainability are important to create superior propositions for consumers,

customers, and shareholders, while improving our environmental impact. We seek to reduce the footprint of

our operations and enable consumers to reduce their footprint.

In Community Impact, our flagship Corporate Social Responsibility program – P&G Shiksha, has been focusing

on education interventions for lesser privileged communities for over 18 years.

Our Equality & Inclusion (E&I) efforts are integrated into how we serve diverse consumers and support our

employees. Our ability to do this most effectively is enabled by a workforce and culture that understands,

respects, and reflects the uniqueness of all the consumers we serve.

P&G’s Purpose, Values and Principles set high standards that we hold ourselves and each other accountable for,

and create a strong culture focused on winning the right way.

Our overall approach, with consumers at the centre, and an organization built to serve them, has served us and

our many stakeholders well. It will guide our actions as we move forward. If we do this effectively, consumers

will benefit, customers will grow their businesses, employees will develop and thrive, we will have a positive

impact on society, and shareholders will continue to be rewarded for their investment.
