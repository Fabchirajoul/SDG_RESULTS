NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1

Reporting entity

Britannia Industries Limited (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in India, with its registered office situated at

5/1A, Hungerford Street, Kolkata, West Bengal - 700017. The Company has been incorporated under the provisions of

Indian Companies Act and its equity shares are listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock

Exchange (BSE) in India. The Company is primarily involved in manufacturing and sale of various food products.

2

Basis of preparation

A.

Statement of compliance

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards

(Ind AS) as per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended, notified under Section

133 of Companies Act, 2013, (the ‘Act’) and other relevant provisions of the Act.

The standalone financial statements were authorised for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on 5 May

2023.

Details of the Company’s accounting policies are included in Note 3.

B.

Current and Non-current Classification

The Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current / non-current

classification of assets and liabilities. This is based on the nature of products and the time between acquisition

of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.

C.

Functional and presentation currency

These standalone financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (`), which is also the Company’s functional

currency. All amounts have been rounded-off to two decimal places to the nearest crores, unless otherwise

indicated.

D.

Basis of measurement

The standalone financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following

items:

Items

Measurement basis

Certain financial assets and liabilities

Fair value

Cash-settled (Phantom Option Scheme)

Fair value

Net defined benefit asset/(liability)

Fair value of plan assets less present value of defined benefit

obligations

E.

Use of estimates and judgements

In preparing these standalone financial statements, the Company has made judgements, estimates and

assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,

income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are

recognised prospectively.

Judgements

Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the

amounts recognised in the standalone financial statements is included in the following notes:

- Note 37 - leases: whether an arrangement contains a lease and lease classification:

Managing Director is designated as the CODM.

(u)

Non-current Assets held-for-sale

Non-Current Assets are classified as held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through

a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and sale is considered highly probable. A sale is considered

as highly probable when decision has been made to sell, assets are available for immediate sale in its present

condition, assets are being actively marketed and sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within

12 months of the date of classification. Non-current assets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised.

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value

less cost of disposal and are presented separately in the Balance Sheet.

(v)

Recent accounting pronouncements

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards

under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On 31 March 2023, MCA

amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, which are effective from

annual period beginning on or after 1 April 2023, details of which are given below;

Ind AS 107 - Financial instrument - The amendment substitutes the paragraph 21 - while presenting a Financial

Statement an entity discloses material accounting policy information. Information about the measurement

basis (or bases) for financial instruments used in preparing the financial statements is expected to be material

accounting policy information. The Company has evaluated the amendment and there is no impact on its

standalone financial statements.

Ind AS 1 - Presentation of financial statement - The standard requires the entities to disclose their material

accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies, which forms the basis of making materiality

judgements.

Ind AS 8- Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors - The standard has introduced a

definition of ‘accounting estimates’ and included appropriate amendments to help entities distinguish changes

in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates.

Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes - The standard has narrowed the scope of initial recognition exemption so that it does

not apply to transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.

The Company has evaluated the aforementioned amendments and concluded that there is no material impact on

the standalone financial statements.

(Ind AS) as per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, notified under Section

133 of Companies Act, 2013, (the ‘Act’) and other relevant provisions of the Act.

The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on 5 May

2023.

Details of the Group’s accounting policies are included in Note 3.

B.

Current and Non-current Classification

The Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current / non-current

classification of assets and liabilities. This is based on the nature of products and the time between acquisition

of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.

C.

Functional & presentation currency

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (`), which is also the Company’s

functional currency. All amounts have been rounded-off to two decimal places to the nearest crores, unless

otherwise indicated.

Cash-settled

(Phantom

option

Scheme)

Fair value

Net defined benefit asset/ (liability)

Use of estimates and judgments

In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Group has made judgments, estimates and assumptions

Managing Director is designated as the CODM.

(w) Non-Current Assets Held for Sale

Non-Current Assets are classified as Held for Sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through

a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and sale is considered highly probable. A sale is considered

as highly probable when decision has been made to sell, assets are available for immediate sale in its present

condition, assets are being actively marketed and sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within

12 months of the date of classification. Non-current assets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised.

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value

less cost of disposal and are presented separately in the Balance Sheet.

(x)

Recent accounting pronouncements

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards

under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On 31 March 2023, MCA

amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, which are effective from

annual period beginning on or after 1 April 2023, details of which are given below;

Ind AS – 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: The standard requires the entities to disclose their material

accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies, which forms the basis of making materiality

judgements.

Ind AS – 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors: The standard has introduced a

definition of ‘accounting estimates’ and included appropriate amendments to help entities distinguish changes

in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates.

Ind AS – 12 Income Taxes: The standard has narrowed the scope of initial recognition exemption so that it does

not apply to transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.

The Group has evaluated the aforementioned amendments and concluded that there is no material impact on the

consolidated financial statements.:

letter of credit for ` 61.78 (31 March 2022: ` 64.00).

Notes:

[1]

Contingent liabilities disclosed above represent possible obligations where possibility of cash outflow

to settle the obligations is not remote.

[2]

The above does not include non-quantifiable industrial disputes and other legal disputes pending

before various judicial authorities [Also refer note 41 and 52].

[3]

The Supreme court of India in the month of February 2019 had passed a judgement relating to

definition of wages under the Provident Fund Act, 1952. Considering that there are numerous

interpretative issues relating to this judgement and in the absence of reliable measurement of the

provision for the earlier periods, the Company had made a suitable provision for provident fund

contribution during the Financial Year 2018-19. The Company will evaluate its position and update

its provision, if required, on receiving further clarity on the subject. The Company does not expect

any material impact of the same.

(ii) Commitments:

(a)

Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital account and not provided for

` 288.93 (31 March 2022: ` 471.63).

Regarding items (i), it is not practicable to disclose information in respect of the estimate of the

financial effect, an indication of the uncertainties relating to outflow and the possibility of any

reimbursement as it is determinable only on occurrence of uncertain future events / receipt of

judgements pending at various forums.

Note 38
