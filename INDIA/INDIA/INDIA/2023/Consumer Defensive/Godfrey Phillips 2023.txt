Dear Shareholders,

The major global economies are expected to see a downward trend in their GDP growth in short to medium term due to challenges like

rising interest rates, slowdown in manufacturing, rise in prices of commodities and supplies, geo-political conflicts, and disruptions in

supply chains. The recent report of International Monetary Fund (IMF) has highlighted the geopolitical tensions and China's economic

slowdown are the key contributors to the slowdown in global GDP growth in 2022, with the United States, Europe, and China

experiencing varying levels of deceleration. According to the report, the advanced economies are expected to be the most affected by

the slowdown, while emerging markets and developing economies may experience a less pronounced impact.

Despite the uncertain economic outlook, there are opportunities for an accelerated recovery if significant risks such as inflation and

geopolitical conflicts are adequately addressed. Countries across the world must proactively mitigate inflationary pressures and provide

fiscal support to vulnerable segments of society. Implementation of structural reforms in domestic market and enhancing international

cooperation will play a vital role in addressing concerns such as supply chain constraints, commodity price increases, energy shortages,

while preventing excessive debt in low-income countries.

As far as India is concerned, the economy showed robust recovery in 2022, with a GDP growth rate of 6.8%, thus making it one of

the fastest-growing economies globally. India is expected to maintain strong performance with projected GDP growth rates of 5.9% in

2023 and 6.3% in 2024, fast overcoming the challenges of the pandemic and geopolitical tensions of 2022. The growth is supported

by robust consumer demand and increased focus on infrastructure development by the government.

The Indian tobacco industry plays a significant role in the country's economy, contributing to significant employment opportunities,

revenue generation, and foreign exchange earnings. The industry is influenced by various factors that shape its supply and demand

dynamics. The price of tobacco significantly impacts demand, as higher prices reduce affordability and subsequently decrease consumer

demand. Additionally, the ease of availability and accessibility spurs increase in demand. Further, governmental regulation plays a

crucial role in shaping the industry, primarily through taxation policies that raise tobacco prices and thereby impact consumption.

Despite higher taxes and strict regulations on tobacco products, the industry has witnessed growth due to factors such as rising incomes,

changing lifestyles, and demand for low-tar and filtered cigarettes. However, challenges exist, including health considerations, the rise in

illicit cigarette trade including electronic nicotine delivery devices, and the restrictions on sales and promotion activities. The government,

on its part to support the industry, is taking steps to curb the illicit cigarette trade and stabilize the legal cigarette market.

On the Company financials, we have reported a strong financial performance in FY23, with gross sales value reaching Rs. 9,409 Crore,

a growth of 28.5% Y-o-Y and net profit touching the figure of Rs. 608 Crore. Gross sales from domestic and international sales have

reached Rs. 7,852 Crore and Rs. 955 Crore respectively, registering a Y-o-Y growth of 26.2% and 69.9%. Considering this, the Board

of Directors has recommended a dividend of Rs 44 per share, as compared to Rs 28 per share paid for the last financial year.

We are also proud to announce that Godfrey Phillips India has been recognized as “A Great Place to Work” for the fifth consecutive

year, a remarkable achievement among large corporations.

I want to reiterate our commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen. As part of our social sector commitment, Godfrey Phillips

India, a company whose core product is an agricultural commodity, is dedicated to protecting the marginalized farming community

and ensuring sustainability of their livelihoods. Operating in tobacco farming, the company focuses on pressing community issues

in the drought-prone area it operates in, such as limited access to safe water, sanitation, education, and social protection. Godfrey

Phillips India strives to achieve short-term goals of improving farming efficiencies and long-term plans for environmental conservation to

mitigate the impact of climate change on agriculture. Few of our notable initiatives include eliminating child labour, raising awareness

on the importance of education, enhancing farmers' earning potential, and conserving water and soil through the construction of check

dams, desiltation, pond developments and providing safe water and healthcare to communities through community RO water plants,

health camps, and borewell recharges, etc. We continue to remain focused in contributing to the overall well-being of our supply-side

ecosystem.

In closing, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to our employees and senior management team for their hard work,

commitment, and determination in achieving strong financial results in successive years, and the Board of Directors for its valuable

guidance and unwavering support. I would also like to extend my gratitude to the customers, channel partners, farming community,

bankers, other stakeholders, and government authorities for their continued confidence in the Company. Also, I would like to thank you: dear shareholders as it is your steadfast trust and support that drives us to strive for excellence.

Whole-time Director, Mr. Sunil Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Sanjay Kumar Gupta, Company Secretary of the
