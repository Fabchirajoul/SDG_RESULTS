Board’s Report and MDA

Financial Statements

Corporate Governance

Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Health Care Limited:

Managing Director

I would like to take this opportunity to share with you the overall

performance of the Company in 2022-2023.

Despite a challenging macro-economic environment marked by

significant operating and cost headwinds, the Company delivered

a resilient finish to the fiscal year. During the year, the Company

delivered revenue from operations of ₹3918 crore, flat versus year

ago, with a one-time non-operating income and the pandemic-

linked demand surge in the healthcare portfolio in the base

period. Operationally sales were up 3% for the fiscal. Further, the

Company reported Profit After Tax (PAT) of ₹678 crores, up 18%

versus year ago including one-time tax impacts. Excluding these

one-time impacts, Profit After Tax (PAT) is up 10% operationally.

This encouraging growth was driven by premiumization and productivity interventions, as the Company

continued to make sequential progress in profit growth, despite macro-economic challenges, and a muted

growth in the healthcare category in the first three quarters of the year owing to the pandemic linked

demand surge in the base period.

The Company continued to raise the bar on superiority, innovation, and industry-leading practices. The driving

force has been the focused execution of its integrated growth strategy - a focus on daily use categories where

performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product, package, communication, go-to-market execution,

and value), productivity, constructive disruption, and an agile and accountable organization structure and

culture – which enabled a sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.

The feminine care and healthcare brands, Whisper, and Vicks respectively, continue to grow behind a strong

product portfolio, superior consumer communication and a continuous stream of product innovations like

Whisper Hygiene Comfort, Whisper Choice Nights, Vicks ZzzQuil, Vicks Roll-On Inhaler and Vicks Xtra Strong.

Whisper continued its journey of raising awareness regarding menstruation, with the fourth edition of its

long running #KeepGirlsInSchool (KGIS) movement, with the aim of educating mothers on the biology of

periods to help them educate their daughters.

Whisper also continues to scale up the ‘Whisper Menstrual Health & Hygiene Program’, educating over 2

crore girls on puberty and hygiene over last two years. To date, Whisper has educated over 10 crore girls and

mothers. This year, Whisper India also partnered with UNESCO India to introduce teaching-learning modules,

addressing the challenges related to menstrual health and hygiene management, including in relation to

disability, gender, teachers and educators, young adults, and nutrition.

The Company’s flagship CSR program, P&G Shiksha, is a 360-degree educational intervention that addresses

three critical barriers to achieving universal education – access to education infrastructure, gender inequality

in access to education and gap in learning.

As we enter the new fiscal year, the Company is well positioned to sustain and improve its performance with a

resilient and empowered workforce, leverage opportunities with agility, address challenges and overcome the

risks. While short to medium term challenges exist owing to a weak global economic outlook, the long-term

outlook for the FMCG sector remains positive. We will continue to focus on our integrated growth strategy

which has consistently enabled us to deliver sustained and balanced growth.: Dear Shareholders,

irresistibly superior propositions for consumers

in

daily-use

categories,

where

performance

is enabled by a workforce and culture that

understands, respects, and reflects the uniqueness

of all the consumers we serve.

accountable for, and create a strong culture focused

on winning the right way.

Our overall approach, with consumers at the centre,

and an organization built to serve them, has served

us and our many stakeholders well. It will guide our

actions as we move forward. If we do this effectively,

consumers will benefit, customers will grow their

businesses, employees will develop and thrive, we will

have a positive impact on society, and shareholders

will continue to be rewarded for their investment.
