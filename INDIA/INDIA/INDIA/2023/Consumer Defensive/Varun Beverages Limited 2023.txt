Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to place

before you the 29th Annual Report of

the Company.

Ravi Jaipuria

Promoter & Non-Executive Chairman

Overview of the Year

CY 2023 has been a year marked by healthy operational

and financial progress for Varun Beverages Limited (VBL).

Despite the abnormally high unseasonal rains in the peak

season, we are pleased to conclude CY 2023 on a strong

note. The performance is a testament to the resilience

and adaptability of the Company in navigating dynamic

market conditions.

One of the key objectives this year was to build upon

the strong demand we experienced in CY 2022. To this

end, we embarked on a strategic expansion program,

commissioning multiple greenfield and brownfield

facilities across India. Along with this, we also expanded

our distribution network and chilling infrastructure.

These strategic investments have not only fortified our

manufacturing footprint but also opened avenues into

previously untapped markets, allowing us to extend our

reach and enhance our market presence.

The year saw us achieving an impressive YoY volume

growth of 13.9%, reflecting the strong and consistent

demand for our products. Our proactive approach in

expanding our product portfolio, particularly with the

addition of the energy drink ‘Sting’, and our endeavors in

Dairy, Hydration, and Juice segments, have played a role

in assisting this growth. Financially, the year was equally

successful, with a healthy increase in our top line by

21.8%. Our EBITDA and PAT also saw strong growth of

29.5% and 35.6% respectively, underscoring our financial

strength and operational efficiency.

Strategic Expansion and Future Initiatives

As we move into CY 2024, VBL continues to build on the

strong operational foundation laid during the year. We

successfully commissioned new production facilities at

Bundi; Rajasthan and at Jabalpur; Madhya Pradesh, as

well as expanded our capacity at six existing locations

namely Pathankot, Kosi, Bharuch, Tirunelveli, Begusarai

and Guwahati. The commissioning of multiple greenfield

and brownfield beverage manufacturing lines in CY 2023

was a significant step in enhancing our operational

capabilities. These expansions are vital for meeting

increasing consumer demand and tapping into new

market opportunities and have set the stage for our

continued growth in the beverage industry.

Central to our expansion strategy for CY 2024 is the

further development of manufacturing facilities, with

a focus on adapting to evolving consumer preferences

and market trends. We are particularly concentrating

on increasing our production capacities in the juices

and value-added dairy products segments. Moreover,

an integral part of our growth strategy involves

continuously strengthening our distribution network and

chilling infrastructure. This is essential for enhancing our

presence in existing and under-penetrated markets.

be of utmost importance; not just as a crucial

element to meet its regulatory requirements and

guiding force behind the way we do business.

We are proud to have consistently met our ESG

goals in the past few years and remain committed

to forge sustainable pathways for the future, in

collaboration with our valued stakeholders.

business, we take

significant initiatives

to optimize resource
