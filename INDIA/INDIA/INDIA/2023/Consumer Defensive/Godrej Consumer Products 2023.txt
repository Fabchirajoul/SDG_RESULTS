the functioning of the risk management

the ERMC meetings are held half-yearly or

more frequently, if required.

We take a proactive approach to risk

management, wherein an annual risk

`iÌwV>Ì>`>ÃÃiÃÃiÌ«ÀViÃÃ

is incorporated in line with our strategic

business planning and annual business

planning initiatives.

The annual business plan is a foundation

for identifying and prioritising risks.

Following prioritisation, a risk competency

scan is conducted to determine existing

management strategies that effectively

address material and emerging risks to our

business. This scanning process helps in

pinpointing opportunities for enhancing risk

mitigation.

For each material and emerging risk,

the combined outcomes of the existing

>>}iiÌÃÌÀ>Ìi}iÃ>``iÌwi`

improvement opportunities are

documented in a formal risk management

plan. Subsequently, the assessment of

prioritised risks and their mitigation

strategies is presented to the Board Risk

Management Committee for evaluation

and review.

The risk assessment function is structurally

independent of business and is overseen

and coordinated by the Secretary to the

ERMC. The risk assessment outcomes fall

under the ownership of the respective

business function heads. This collaborative

approach ensures a comprehensive and

the organisation.

51:

Managing Director and CEO.

The risk owners may change over time,

depending on their changing roles and

responsibilities within the organisation.

On a half-yearly basis, the risk owner

formally reports about risk management

within their area of operation at the ERMC

meetings. This reporting is aimed at

assessing how well material risks are being

managed and if any additional risk has

emerged that can adversely affect business

operations. The risk report includes:

•

Performance of the function

in managing its material risks,

considering the mitigation strategies

•

`iÌwV>Ìv>Þ>``Ì>

emerging risks

•

iwÌÃvÌ iÌ}>ÌÃÌÀ>Ìi}Þ

for the new material risks

The results of this report are coordinated

by the Secretary to the ERMC and are

made available for review by the ERMC.

The Secretary submits a half-yearly report

on risk management for review and

appraisal of the ERMC. In addition, every 6

Ì Ã]L>Ãi`>«ÀiÃ«iVwi`V>i`>À]

a risk owner would formally present the

risk management initiatives and status of

their area of operation to the ERMC

Employees across all levels and

geographies have risks as part of their

individual goals and performance review.

These risks range from measures to

reduce occupational health and safety

incidents, adherence to regulations and

V«>Vi]w>V>vÀiV>ÃÌ}Ì

reduction of volatile forex exposure. The

risk goal weightage for employees ranges

from 30% to 60% and is a part of their

half-yearly HR employee performance

review. Compliance and quality risk

assessments are a part of our new product

development (NPD) process, and the

goal is aligned with the key performance

indicators of R&D team members involved

in NPDs.

New managers are inducted on Enterprise

Risk Management training, which is

organised quarterly. They are trained on

mitigation, control, and review. Across all

manufacturing facilities, we also conduct

workshops on occupational health and

safety risks and management throughout

the year, encompassing over 100% of our

manufacturing plant workforce.

Our employees are encouraged to share

feedback for continuous improvement

in risk management practices. A formal

annual NPS survey is conducted across the

company for all functions. Risk management

is a part of that survey, and the feedback

helps us improve our processes and

systems.

An annual InTune survey is also conducted

across the company seeking suggestions

and feedback from all employees.

Moreover, emerging risks and development

of mitigation measures are discussed in

regularly conducted departmental monthly

review meetings. The line manager records

Û>`ÀÃÃ`iÌwi`LÞÌi>iLiÀÃ

and communicates them to the Risk

Management Committee for further action.

At the plant level, we have a mobile app

to identify occupational health and safety

risks. These risks are tracked, reviewed, and

mitigated through the app.

The ERMC is responsible for:

•

Half-yearly reports to the Audit

Committee and Risk Management

Committee

•

Half-yearly review of the risk mitigation

status for material and emerging risks

•

Annual assessment of risks in line with

business/strategic planning

52:

Managing Director and CEO approves

Over and above 2% mandatory spend for the FY, INR 2.45 Crore is spent in lieu of CSR spends of FY14-15. A

capital asset (briquette based boiler) was acquired by the company in FY 2014-15 wherein an investment of

`9.32 Crore was treated as CSR expense as per the then prevailing rules, it was informed that such part of that

asset cannot be alienated. The total spend that was required to be spent in FY15 was ` 12.41 Crore, however,

the Company actually spent ` 16.08 Crore, largely due to the excess amount spent towards the investment in

the Briquette boiler. The GCPL Board recommended that the asset would not be classified as CSR asset and the

perceived underspend of `5.81 Crore (excluding overheads) in FY 2014-15 would be spent in FY23 and FY24, in

addition to the statutory CSR obligation for the respective years.
