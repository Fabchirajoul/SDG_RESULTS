Ms. Tanya A. Dubash

Non-Executive Director:

Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to present to you Godrej Agrovet

Limited’s Annual Report for FY 2022-23. I hope this: letter finds you and your families well & safe.

Over the past year, the global landscape was

marked by the Ukraine war, rising commodity

prices, tightening global monetary policy and slower

global economic growth. The macro-economic

volatility and geo-political factors have dominated

the global business environment.

In the midst of this, India’s growth continued to be

resilient and Indian economy became the fifth

largest economy in the world. India’s GDP is

estimated to have registered a growth of 7.2% in

FY 2022-23 and is expected to continue to be the

fastest growing large economy for the third

consecutive year.

For Godrej Agrovet, volume-led topline growth was

one of the critical constants from the previous year

as we reported 13% year-on-year growth in

consolidated revenues to reach total revenues of

₹ 9,374 Crore in FY 2022-23 from ₹ 8,306 Crore in

FY 2021-22. Our branded businesses – Dairy and

Processed Foods – achieved important revenue

milestones on the back of robust volume growth in

value-added product (VAP) portfolios. Nonetheless,

some of our businesses also encountered several

compelling headwinds during the FY 2022-23. This

impacted the profitability of these businesses.

Before we further analyse performance for the year,

I would first like to thank all our Shareholders for

their immense and continued faith in Godrej Agrovet

in these volatile times. At Godrej Agrovet, we really

appreciate your contribution and we remain

committed to a sustainable & long-term value

creation for our valued Shareholders.

Sustained volume growth to enable rapid

recovery in the coming year

While the year was full of surprises, we ensured that

most of the businesses of your Company main-

tained focus on market share gains and healthy

volume growth. In the Animal Feed business, overall

volume growth was ahead of the industry, support-

ed by

robust sales in key categories. Your Company’s joint

venture, ACI Godrej Agrovet Private Limited

Bangladesh, further consolidated market share in

Bangladesh across categories. While the adverse

external environment constrained the dairy

industry’s profitability, your Company responded

with new product launches and aggressive market

share gains in Creamline Dairy’s (CDPL) VAP

portfolio. Resultant volume growth was higher than

the peers in Southern India.

In the Poultry and Processed Food business,

several new launches across branded categories

coupled with renewed focus on brand-building and

channel expansion yielded positive results.

Consequently, the branded business of Godrej

Tyson (GTFL) had another outstanding year of

volume performance.

The Crop Protection segment, with its widespread

distribution network, delivered record volumes for

the in-house portfolio of “Hitweed” herbicides and

the in-licensed insecticide “Gracia”. A product of

Godrej Agrovet’s decade-long collaboration with

Nissan, Gracia has been a stellar performer in its

category.

Managing Director, Godrej Agrovet Limited

Implementing Bee Hotel significantly increased red gram productivity by enhancing pollination rates. This

approach offered numerous benefits to farmers including improved crop yields, sustainable farming

practices, and biodiversity conservation. By promoting the presence of solitary bees through bee hotel,

farmers can increase the long-term sustainability and profitability of red gram cultivation, ultimately

improving their livelihood.

- Creating awareness among the cultivators of Red

Gram about the importance of pollinators in improving

the quantity and the quality of produce

- The farmers are encouraged to plant sun hemp on

peripheries to provide foraging sites for solitary bees

and install ‘Bee Hotels’ - a bee nesting site

- Aim to reach 50,000 farmers cultivating Red

Grams from across India in the next three years

- Piloted in 50 villages covering 250 farmers and

500 Bee Hotels

- 20% productivity improvement in pilot phase led by

combined impact of Bee Hotels (Pollination stage) and

right usage of products such as DOUBLE (Fertilization

stage) and GRACIA (Protection stage):

Note 47.1 : Contingent liabilities represents estimates made mainly for probable claims arising out of litigation/ disputes pending with authorities

under various statutes (Excise duty, Customs duty, Income tax).The probability and timing of outflow with regard to these matters depend on the

final outcome of litigations/ disputes. Hence, the Company is not able to reasonably ascertain the timing of the outflow.

Note 47.2 : The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“SC”) by their order dated February 28, 2019, in the case of Surya Roshani Limited & others v/s

EPFO, set out the principles based on which allowances paid to the employees should be identified for inclusion in basic wages for the purposes of

computation of Provident Fund contribution. The company has started complying with this prospectively from the month of March 2019. In respect

of the past period there are significant implementation and interpretative challenges that the management is facing and is awaiting for clarity to

emerge in this regard, pending which, this matter has been disclosed under the Contingent liability section in the Standalone financial statements.

The impact of the same is not ascertainable.:
