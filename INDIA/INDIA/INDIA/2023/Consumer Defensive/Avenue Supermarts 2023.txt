Managing Director, is responsible for

proactively managing risks with appropriate mitigation measures

and ensuring their implementation thereof.

Below are some of the key risks and concerns in our business:

If we are unable to continue to offer daily low prices pursuant

to our EDLC/EDLP pricing strategy, we risk losing our distinct

advantage and a substantial portion of our customers, which

will adversely affect our business, financial condition, and

results of operations

Availability of commercially viable real estate properties at

suitable locations for our new stores, timely execution of sale

deeds/leave and license registrations and getting regulatory

approvals for these properties

Our ability to attract, hire, train and retain skilled employees

Our inability to maintain an optimal level of inventory in our

stores may impact our operations adversely

Our continued understanding and prediction of consumers’

changing needs and preferences and timely customising of

our offerings

Effective management of our store expansion and operations

in newer locations/cities/states

Any breach of our cyber security measures could potentially

result in disruption of our business operations

The outbreak of new variants of COVID-19 or any other

pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business,

financial condition, and results of operations

Climate Change may result in lower sales, lesser profits and

/ or increased investments in the short to medium-term.

Further, any potential change in Climate related regulations

may lead to higher cost of compliance.
