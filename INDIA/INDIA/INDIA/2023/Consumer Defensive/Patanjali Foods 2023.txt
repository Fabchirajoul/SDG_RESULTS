Dear Stakeholders,

We proudly present the first

integrated annual report for

Patanjali Foods Limited.

We're excited to share our

Company's incredible

journey in creating value for

our stakeholders over the

past year. The year 2023

has witnessed a dynamic

economic landscape, both

globally and domestically.

Despite the recent pandemic's

challenges, Indian economy

has demonstrated resilience

and adaptability, paving the

way for renewed growth

opportunities.

Patanjali Foods Limited (Formerly Ruchi Soya

Industries Limited) started as a manufacturer and

marketer of healthy edible oils. We pioneered soya

foods and significantly expanded our product

portfolio over the years."

India has been at the forefront of this

economic resurgence, with robust GDP

growth and encouraging investment

inflows. The FMCG sector is one of

the most crucial contributors to India's

economy. It experienced several challenges

during the year under review owing to high

inflation, slowing rural demand and rising

interest rates.

However, the changing lifestyles and

increasing awareness of health and

wellness among consumers will likely

increase the demand for high-quality

and healthy products. As an FMCG

player, we closely monitored these

trends and performed exceptionally well

despite various challenges. One of our

key accomplishments during the year is

generating a revenue of over ₹31,000 crores

with an annual growth of 31% and a profit

after tax (PAT) of ₹886 crores.

Expanding Beyond Edible Oils

PFL (Formerly known as Ruchi Soya)

started as a manufacturer and marketer

of healthy edible oils. We pioneered soya

foods and have significantly expanded

our product portfolio. Edible oils and

soya foods remain an integral part of

our business segments today as we have

diversified our offerings to a diverse range

of consumer-packaged goods, biscuits,

cookies, noodles, cow ghee, honey,

and other items, along with range of

nutraceutical products catering to a wide

spectrum of consumer needs. This approach

has helped us broaden our offerings to

reach several high-growth segments.

Strong Manufacturing and

Distribution Network

Strong distribution and manufacturing

capabilities are essential to establishing

a successful FMCG company. At PFL,

we take immense pride in our extensive

network that spans the country's length

and breadth. With 25+ strategically located

manufacturing units, we have optimised

our production and supply chain,

resulting in seamless product delivery to

our customers.

To complement our manufacturing

strength, we have built an impressive

distribution infrastructure. With 7,500+

distributors, 100+ sales depots, 130+ super

distributors and a staggering 1.5 million+

retail locations spread across India, our

products are within the easy reach of

consumers from every corner of the nation.

Strategic Capex and Global

Expansion

We recently announced a significant capital

expenditure of ₹421 crores to fortify our

growth. Over the next five years, we will

deploy this strategic investment to enhance

our Oil Palm Plantation business. By

augmenting this segment's capacity, we aim

to strengthen our product offerings and

capture a larger market share, propelling us

towards greater heights.

While consolidating our presence

domestically, we are also committed

to expanding geographically in the

international markets. With a presence

in 33 countries, exports substantially

grew during the year under review. This

achievement demonstrates the global

acceptance of Patanjali Foods' products and

the trust placed in our brand.

Embracing Innovation for Profitable

Growth

Innovation has always been central to our

business ethos. We are always coming

up with new products to launch, which

can provide us with higher margins. This

strategic move diversifies our product

range and opens avenues for increasing

profitability, propelling us towards

sustainable growth. We have launched

multiple products in FY23 and intend to

venture into new segments in the coming

years through our well-established brands.

Digital Transformation and

E-Commerce Initiatives

Recognising the significance of digital

channels and e-commerce segments, we are

preparing to embrace this transformation.

By leveraging these platforms, we aim

to reach a wider audience, expanding

our consumer base and reinforcing our

position as a market leader. We have built

an incredible digital ecosystem, which

has helped us establish and enhance our

connection with internal and external

stakeholders.

Sustainability and ESG

Commitment

We remain committed to sustainability

and responsible business practices as we

grow and prosper. At Patanjali Foods,

we recognise our responsibility towards

the environment and society and strive

to impact every aspect of our operations

positively. Environmental stewardship is

one of our top priorities. As a consumer

goods manufacturer, we acknowledge

the importance of minimising our

carbon footprint and conserving natural

resources. Over the years, we have

implemented energy-efficient practices in

our manufacturing units, reducing energy

consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

We are engaged in a proactive exploration

of integrating renewable energy sources into

our operational framework. Furthermore,

we dedicatedly promote sustainable

agricultural practices. Our sourcing of

raw materials, especially for edible oils and

soya-based products, focuses on responsible

farming and sustainable supply chains.

We actively engage with farmers to adopt

sustainable agricultural methods that are

environmentally friendly and contribute to

their economic well-being.

Our social responsibility goes beyond our

immediate stakeholders. We believe in

empowering communities and supporting

initiatives that promote education,

healthcare and skill development. Through

various programmes, we have positively

impacted the lives of countless individuals,

furthering the cause of inclusive growth.

On the governance front, we maintain

the highest levels of transparency,

accountability and ethical conduct. Our

Board of Directors comprises individuals

with diverse expertise, and they play a

pivotal role in guiding the company with

integrity and prudence. We are committed

to upholding your trust in us as custodians

of your investment.

Looking Ahead

As we stand at the cusp of a new era, we

are excited about the growth prospects that

lie before us. With your continued support

and trust, we are confident in achieving

new milestones and creating sustainable

value for all our stakeholders.

We sincerely appreciate the entire team at

Patanjali Foods, whose dedication, hard

work, and passion have driven our success.

We also thank our valued customers whose

loyalty inspires us to push the boundaries

of excellence.

Thank you again for your support, and we

look forward to another fruitful year ahead.
