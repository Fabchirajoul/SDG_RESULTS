C. Ramachandra Rao

Joint: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

With immense delight and energy, I present to you our Annual Report 2022-23, showcasing our

accomplishments, advancements, and future potential.

Despite the numerous challenges faced by our company, including Global recession, high inflation

affecting EU nations, and COVID-related difficulties in China, I am proud to report that we navigated

through these dynamic situations and achieved a commendable financial performance, remaining

nearly on par with FY22 in most aspects.

During FY23, our turnover remained steady at ` 4,04,135 lakhs, while our net profit increased to

` 23,284.42 lakhs compared to ` 19,925.50 lakhs in the previous financial year. These results reflect

our ability to leverage our 30-year standing, sector expertise, and leadership position to overcome

challenges such as the crash in farmgate prices, farmer apprehensions, and industry slowdown.

Despite experiencing an 8% decline in Shrimp feed sales volume during FY23 compared to the previous

year, we remain steadfast in our commitment to growth. We have taken this opportunity to accelerate

the establishment of a new shrimp feed manufacturing plant with an installed capacity of 1,75,000 MT

per annum, along with expanding our shrimp processing capacity.

The remarkable growth we have sustained is entirely attributed to the dedicated and unwavering

efforts of our employees, supported by our value chain partners, and the efficient operations of our

supply chain from farm to export markets.

Looking ahead, we anticipate better times in the US and European countries, as they recover from

high inflation and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. One of the big advantages of Indian

aquaculture is the size of the country’s coastline, with that of the mainland measuring up to a hefty

7,500 kilometers. Avanti is trying to encourage farmers to expand their aquaculture to many different

parts of India, which have not yet gone into shrimp culture.

Aquaculture has an important role to play in serving the nutritional needs of India’s growing population.

But it can also help elevate the lives of farmers across the country. With India on a mission to improve

the health of its population through initiatives such as FIT India and the National Nutrition Mission,

nourishment has been pushed up the agenda. As the population has exploded, so too has demand

for protein, with seafood proving to be an affordable source of the macronutrient, while is also rich in

minerals and vitamins.

In order to keep pace, the aquaculture industry will have to expand. Similar in concept to agriculture,

it involves the cultivation of aquatic organisms for human consumption to increase. As the farmers

increase the scale of their operations, feed surge is estimated in fueling Avanti’s growth.

Avanti Frozen Foods, is concentrating on selling value-added products, by making India one of the best

suppliers of value-added products.

The outlook for India’s aquaculture industry is highly positive, with opportunities to accelerate growth,

meet demand from markets affected by COVID-19 and lockdowns, and tap into new markets. As a

leader equipped with cutting-edge technologies, robust R&D, skilled manpower, and strong linkages

with aqua farmers, our company is poised to overcome the recent challenges and enter a fast-track

growth mode.

In addition to our core business, we operate four windmills located in Karnataka State, generating a

total capacity of 3.2 MWs. During FY23, these windmills generated 47.95 lakh units, slightly lower than

the previous year’s 48.09 lakh units. The power generated was successfully sold to Karnataka Power

Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our employees, aqua farmers, customers, dealers,

partners, financial institutions, and all stakeholders for their unwavering support in maintaining

Avanti’s position at the pinnacle of success, even amidst multifaceted challenges. I am also thankful

to my fellow Directors for their invaluable guidance and unwavering support throughout our journey.

With my best wishes to everyone
