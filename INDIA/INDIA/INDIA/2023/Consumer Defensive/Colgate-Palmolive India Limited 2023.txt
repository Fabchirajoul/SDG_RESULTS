manufacturing operations and boost marketing initiatives. The

digitized supply chain provides improved control and visibility

over inventories and logistics. It has also employed artificial

intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies

to estimate demand and optimize production, resulting in

increased efficiency and cost optimisation.

To increase consumer reach and brand awareness, the

Company has been effectively using digital marketing

strategies and social media channels. It continues to build

customized promotional campaigns using data analytics

to gain a better understanding of consumer behavior and

preferences.

Colgate-Palmolive has introduced an AI-based image

recognition tool that allows for in-store aided merchandising,

resulting in zero in-store display gaps. This substantial

advancement has eliminated manual input monitoring in

favor of a one-click solution, providing real-time surveillance

of crucial in-store merchandising features such as availability,

planogram adherence, and element purity. The app provides

live insights and suggests corrective action within 30 seconds,

minimizing manual intervention. With just one image, the

Company can track various in-store efficiency parameters

such as on-shelf availability, planogram compliance, assets

utilization, competition presence, and share of shelf. Real-time

dashboards facilitate on-the-go monitoring and corrections,

adding to the app's versatility. This game-changing solution

enhances the Company's efficiency and ensures seamless

in-store operations.

Risk Management

This is integral to the Company’s strategy and attainment of

its long-term goals. The Company’s success lies in its ability to

identify the opportunities generated by the business and the

markets it operates in. The primary objective of the Company's

risk management framework is to guarantee timely and

effective identification and mitigation of potential risks, while

also enabling flexibility in adapting a risk-conscious business

strategy that can tap into new opportunities.

The Company implemented a comprehensive risk

management system that protects its stakeholders' interests

by detecting, scrutinizing and managing significant business

risks. This entails various strategies such as risk identification

surveys, environmental business analysis, and gathering

feedback from internal and external stakeholders.

The Company has formulated an Enterprise Risk Management

Committee and the members meet periodically to efficiently

identify upcoming risks and work on the mitigation plans. The

risks are rated to various parameters, such as probability of

occurrence, severity of impact and Company's preparedness

to mitigate such risks. The risks identified are placed on a

matrix to depict the potential staging and monitoring of the

same. The assessment considers both short and long-term

risks, including how these risks are changing, together with

emerging risk areas. These are assessed on an ongoing basis

and officially at least once a year by the Risk Management

Committee and the Board.

Corporate Overview

Statutory Reports

Financial Statements:

Managing Director and

Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The Company

has identified ‘Personal Care (including Oral Care)’ as

its only primary reportable segment, which primarily

includes products such as Soaps, Cosmetics and Toilet

Preparations.

(q) Cash Flow Statement

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,

whereby profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of

transactions of non-cash nature and any deferrals or

accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments.

(r) Offsetting Financial Instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net

amount reported in the balance sheet when there is

a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized

amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis,

or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

(s) Contributed Equity

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental

costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or

options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax.

(t) Earnings Per share

i.

Basic Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing:

•

the profit attributable to owners of the Company

•

By the weighted average number of equity

shares outstanding during the financial year.

ii.

Diluted Earnings per share

Diluted earnings per share adjust the figures used

in the determination of basic earnings per share to

take into account:

•

the after income tax effect of interest and

other financing costs associated with dilutive

potential equity shares, and

•

the weighted average number of additional

equity

shares

that

would

have

been

outstanding assuming the conversion of all

dilutive potential equity shares.

2. Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The preparation of financial statements requires the

use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will

seldom equal the actual results. This note provides an

overview of the areas that involved a higher degree

of judgment or complexity, and of items which are

more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates

and assumptions turning out to be different than

those originally assessed. Detailed information about

each of these estimates and judgments is included in

relevant notes together with information about the

basis of calculation for each affected line item in the

financial statements.

The areas involving critical estimates or judgments are:

-

Estimation of defined benefit obligation (Note 28)

-

Estimation of Useful life of Property, plant and

equipment and intangibles (Note 3)

-

Estimation of taxes (Note 19 and 31)

-

Estimation of impairment of trade receivables

(Note 8)

-

Estimation of provision and contingent liabilities

(Note 24 and 32)

-

Estimation of Share based payments to employees

(Note 38)

-

Estimation of variable consideration in respect of

revenue recognition (Refer Note 1B(m) and Note 25)

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated.

They are based on historical experience and other

factors, including expectations of future events that

may have a financial impact on the Company and that

are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Annual & ESG Report 2022-2023:

Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer of the

Company. The Company operates only in one Business Segment i.e. ‘Personal Care (including Oral Care)' which primarily

includes products such as Soaps, Cosmetics and Toilet Preparations and the activities incidental thereto within India, hence

does not have any reportable Segments as per Ind AS 108 "Operating Segments". The performance of the Company is

mainly driven by sales made locally and hence, no separate geographical segment is identified.
