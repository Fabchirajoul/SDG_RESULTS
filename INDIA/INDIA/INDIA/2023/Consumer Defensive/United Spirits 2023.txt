CORPORATE OVERVIEW

AnnuAl RepoRt 2022-23:

dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to share that

our sharp focus on the execution of the

growth strategy and enhanced productivity

initiatives have made us a bigger and

stronger entity over the years.

While the operating environment remained

challenging for the industry amidst

double-digit inflationary pressures and

geo-political headwinds leading to the

surge in prices of critical raw materials, we

navigated the headwinds successfully and

delivered sustained double-digit growth,

demonstrating the resilience of our business

and strategy.

Creating value

I am pleased with the performance

delivered by the team during the year. We

have built a strong foundation to drive

business efficiencies, deliver consistent

value, build credibility and trust, and

engage our talent. Our focus is to create

an organisation of the future that is agile

and resilient and also enables our systems

and processes to deliver profitable growth

for our shareholders in a consistent and

sustainable manner. In view of this, the

Company has embarked on certain

transformational projects which include

a multi-year supply agility programme.

In addition, we are taking steps to simplify

our legal entity footprint and completed the

merger of Pioneer Distilleries Limited this

year. These, along with other initiatives such

as the removal of mono-cartons will help

us to progress towards creating an efficient

and sustainable business entity. We continue

to make good progress in achieving our

Society 2030 goals and our efforts have

been recognised. The Alliance for Water

Stewardship (AWS) Certification (Core) for

our distillery in Alwar is a testament to our

commitment on driving water stewardship.

Our environment

While we expect inflationary headwinds

to continue in the near term, we remain

optimistic about the medium to long-term

business prospects and our ability to harness

growth opportunities. The convergence

of India’s robust economic growth and a

vibrant, burgeoning young Legal Drinking

Age demographic creates a massive

opportunity for our industry to grow. The

larger consumption story remains anchored

in premiumisation with rising consumer

aspirations, higher disposable incomes and

drinking better, not more. Moreover, consumer

behaviour is undergoing a structural shift

with consumers preferring to experiment and

repertoire drinking has picked up as a trend.

Looking ahead

As we move forward, with a continued focus

on premiumisation, and renewed thrust on

craft and innovation, we are confident of

capitalising on evolving market trends and

propelling growth. We will continue to invest

in our brands and explore future growth

opportunities, unlock better value for all

stakeholders and shape positive outcomes

for our society.

In closing, I want to express my gratitude

to our shareholders, for your continued

confidence in our Company. I would also like

to thank my fellow Board Members for their

guidance and support.

Warm Regards,

Mahendra Kumar Sharma

Chairman

I am pleased with the performance

delivered by the team during the year.

We have built a strong foundation

to drive business efficiencies, deliver

consistent value, build credibility and

trust, and engage our talent.

ManaGinG direCtor & Ceo’S Message: dear Shareholders,

It is a pleasure to share Diageo India’s

performance for the financial year 2022-

23. Your Company demonstrated strong

growth momentum even as the external

environment remained challenging. Before

delving into the progress made across the

key pillars of the strategy, let me share the

financial highlights.

Performance

For the full year, reported net sales

increased 10.1% consistent with our

ambition of delivering double-digit growth.

It reflects the recovery in the on-trade,

continued consumer demand in the off-

trade and sustained home consumption

trends. Strong premiumisation delivery and

the accelerated reach of our innovations

like Royal Challenge American Pride and

the renovated offerings including Royal

Challenge and Signature are adding to the

mix benefit. Our Prestige & Above segment

contributed 80.6% of reported net sales, an

increase of 22.8% demonstrating a strong

growth rate of the portfolio in line with our

premiumisation strategy. Our Profit After Tax

grew at 23.6% to ` 1,052 crore.

Our capital allocation strategy is balanced,

value accretive and indexed towards

supporting core growth through renovation,

innovation and new growth engines.This

aligns well with our long-term vision of

providing consumers with greater choices

and newer offerings. We remain focussed

on our strategy of reshaping the portfolio,

driving commercial excellence: in-store and

on-premise, revenue growth management

and everyday efficiency and productivity

extraction.

A strong foundation for future growth

The country is at an inflexion point and our

transformational growth strategy is designed

to help us capitalise on the opportunities

with our “future-back” approach. During the

year, we have made good progress across

the three pillars of our strategy; this has

instilled confidence in us, that we are on the

right track.

Accelerating portfolio reshape

We have intensified brand innovations and

renovations over the last year aligned with

changing consumer choices, entry of new

cohorts and premiumisation trends.

With the thrust on innovation, and to

strengthen our craft and premium portfolio,

we invested ` 45 crore to set up our

Innovation Hub, "The Good Craft Co.", in

Ponda, Goa last year.

I am happy to share that our Technical

Centre and Innovation Accelerator in

Bengaluru is the first in the industry to

be recognised by the Department of

Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) ,

a demonstration of our leading in-house

Research & Development capabilities.

During the year, we introduced Johnnie

Walker Blonde, a light scotch variant for

the next-generation non-scotch consumer.

We have also launched Godawan 100, an

exclusive limited edition artisanal single

malt that honours and advocates the

conservation of the Great Indian Bustard,

an endangered bird. I am proud to share

that Godawan, an example of exceptional

Indian craftsmanship won the superior

taste award at the International Taste

Institute Brussels, the Grand Gold & Gold

Awards at The Monde Selection World

Quality Awards, Brussels and Silver at the

World Spirits Awards, Austria. Godawan is

now available across six states in India and

globally in UAE and USA. We sharpened

our portfolio execution on salient segments

and brands such as Black & White, Black

Dog and Royal Challenge. We also

accelerated the reach of our innovations

such as Royal Challenge American Pride

and the renovations of Royal Challenge

and Signature in the country.

As part of our prudent active portfolio

management, we completed the sale and

franchising of select popular brands to

Inbrew Beverages Private Limited. We also

completed the merger of Pioneer Distilleries

Limited and signed definitive agreements

to divest the non-operative Sovereign

Distilleries Limited. These strategic

developments enable a simplified legal

entity footprint.

Building future-ready capabilities

We continue to focus on embedding digital

capabilities, enhancing business efficiency

and driving inclusion & diversity at all

levels.

Performance against above

policies and follow up action

Diageo India’s (USL) Code of Business Conduct

covers all the principles laid down under NGRBC

guidelines.

The code of business conduct is refreshed

biennially and approved by our Board prior to

publication to all our employees. The latest Code

of Business Conduct document was approved by

the Board in January 2023.

The performance is measured in the below ways–

Annually, Diageo India (USL) conducts an Annual

Compliance Certification for all its employees

wherein employees need to certify that they have

read and abide by the COBC. Yearly declarations

are also taken from our Board members on the

same.

Any Code violation or deviation reported to the

company are investigated and actioned on our

the code or its aligned policies.

Annually:

Letter

dated 25th April 2023 in respect of the agreed indicators/parameters listed below (the “Identified Sustainability Indicators”). These indicators/

parameters are as included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2023;

the reporting boundary being as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A of the BRSR, with exceptions if any been disclosed as a note under the

respective questions under BRSR.

Identified Sustainability Indicators

The Identified Sustainability Indicators for the year ended March 31, 2023 are summarized in Appendix 1 to this report.

Our limited assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31, 2023 information only and we have not performed any

procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the BRSR and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon.

Criteria

The criteria used by the company is the ‘Guidance note for BRSR format’ (referred to as the ‘Criteria’).

Management’s Responsibility

The Company’s Management is responsible for identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content and presentation of the

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report in accordance with the Criteria mentioned above. This responsibility includes the design,

implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report and

measurement of Identified Sustainability Indicators, which are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Inherent limitations

The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for

different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities. In addition, greenhouse gas

“GHG” quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emission factors and the

values needed to combine emissions of different gases.

Our Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants

issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity,

objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control

including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal

and regulatory requirements.

Our Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Indicators, based on the procedures we have

performed and evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard

on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information

and ISAE 3410 Assurance Engagements On Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards

Board (IAASB). These standards require that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Identified

Sustainability Indicators are free from material misstatement.

A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for

the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Indicators, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Indicators

whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of

the Identified Sustainability Indicators.

Business Responsibility Sustainability Report (Continued):

letter/ Scope of Assurance

●

The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim or future intentions provided by the Company and

testing or assessing any forward-looking assertions and/or data.

Limited Assurance Conclusion

Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe

that the Company’s Identified Sustainability Indicators included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for the year ended

March 31, 2023 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria.

Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer and other senior

management team members. Since segment disclosures have

been provided in the consolidated financial statements, no

such disclosures have been made in these standalone financial

statements.

1.20 Equity

Own shares represent shares of the Company and those held

in treasury by USL Benefit Trust. Pursuant to orders of the High

Court of Karnataka and the High Court of Bombay, shares held

in aforesaid trust have been treated as an investment.

Dividends - Provision is made for the amount of any dividend

declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the

discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting

period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.

1.21 Rounding of amounts

All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes

have been rounded off to the nearest million as per the

requirement of Schedule III (Division II) to the Act, unless

otherwise stated. The sign ‘0’ in these financial statements

indicates that the amounts involved are below ` five lakhs and

the sign ‘-’ indicates that amounts are nil.

2. Critical estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of

accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal

the actual result. This note provides an overview of the areas

that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and

of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due

to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than

those originally assessed. Detailed information about each of

these estimates and judgements is included in relevant notes

together with information about the basis of calculation for

each affected line item in the financial statements.

The areas involving critical estimates and judgements are:

•

Estim

ation of provisions recognised and contingent

liabilities disclosed in respect of tax m

atters– Notes 8, 17,

and 42;

•

Im

pairm

ent of loans, trade receivables and other

financial assets - Notes 5, 6, 11 and 31.

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are

based on historical experience and other factors, including

expectations of future events that may have a financial impact

on the Company and that are believed to be reasonable under

the circumstances.:
