Date: 2023.07.04 16:14:19 +05'30':

Dear Shareholders,

I am honoured to write to you for the first time as the

Chairman of Dabur Inda Limited. As I take on the

role of the Chairman, I feel immense pride in what

our organization has already accomplished, how we

have upheld our promise of delivering Health and

Well-being to every Household, and I am equally

enthusiastic about what the future holds for us.

The past few years have been a period of great

contrasts… demanding and satisfying in equal

measure. The COVID-19 pandemic fuelled an

unprecedented innovation drive that saw Dabur display

unparalleled agility to roll out a plethora of purposeful,

consumer-centric introductions, rapidly adopt digital

advancements and technologies to strengthen its

go-to-market strategies while deepening its focus

on People and Planet with enhanced investments in

creating a greener enterprise. These measures not

only helped us survive the pandemic but also emerge

stronger and better.

As the pressures of the pandemic receded, we saw

a new challenge emerge in the form of high Inflation,

which pushed up commodity prices to multi-decade

highs in many countries, causing central banks to

raise interest rates and slow down economic activity.

The inflationary environment also took a toll on

consumption patterns as consumers tightened their

purse-strings and consumer goods industry witnessed

a slow-down.

Even in a turbulent operating environment, Dabur

ended the 2022-23 financial year with a Consolidated

Revenue of `11,529.9 Crore, up 6% from `10,888.7

Crore in 2021-22. Net Profit for the full year stood at

`1,707.1 Crore.

Chairman’s Message

Our performance in a tough inflationary environment

aptly demonstrates the power and consistency of

Dabur’s strategic playbook, which helped us capitalize

on our brand strength while continuing to innovate

and deepen our engagement with our consumers. We

are happy to have progressed well with expanding our

presence in key categories and report market share

gains across our product portfolio. I am pleased to

share with all of you that today, Dabur is amongst the

top most penetrated brands in the country with 8 out

of 10 households being a Dabur household and using

one or more Dabur products.

Surpassing New Milestones

Our products always meet the highest quality

standards. As we work towards bringing new and

innovative products and solutions to market, we

are determined to remain committed to providing

innovative health and wellness solutions on herbal and

natural platform to our consumers in contemporary

formats to meet their evolving needs.

Today, we have a portfolio of 23

Billion Rupee Brands, brands with

sales greater than `100 Crore. The

year 2022-23 saw 5 brands joining

this list. In all, we now have 17

brands that are above `100 Crore

but lesser than `500 Crore in size;

2 brands that are over `500 Crore

but less than `1,000 Crore in size,

and another 4 brands that have

a turnover of more than `1,000

Crore.

letter and

spirit. About 15% of our value chain partners (by value

of business done with such partners) and 40 in count

were assessed by SEDEX (Third Party Audit). This

marks an achievement of 2.7 times the target set for FY

2022-23. Going ahead, top suppliers by business value

of more than `10 Crore will be screened and assessed

by a second/third party auditor in FY 2023-24.

For FY 2022-23, Dabur has performed higher by 500

basis points against a target of 10% for the supplier’s

assessment

and

development.

Similarly,

our

significant suppliers assessed were 40 bps higher.

Dabur

implements

a

comprehensive

supplier

screening process using a set of frameworks that

assign weightage to various criteria. These criteria

include volume, supplier base, endangered species,

seasonality,

region

specificity

(domestic

and

import), critical components, specialized products,

technicality, and substitution. These aspects primarily

focus on business relevance and environmental

considerations, addressing commodity-specific and

country-specific risks. Based on these evaluations,

Tier 1 critical/ significant suppliers are identified. For

the fiscal year 2022-23, a total of 91 Tier 1 critical /

significant suppliers have been identified across

22 materials, contributing to approximately 5.1% of

the total procurement spend. Our objective for the

FY 2023-24 is to reduce the list of critical materials

by approximately 10% by expanding the number

of vendors, as seen with Garic Powder and Litchi,

reducing usage as demonstrated with Pink Guava

and transitioning to other variants, and implementing

biodiversity afforestation to minimize the risks

associated with endangered herb species, among

other measures.

Dabur values the association with MSME vendors and

ensures procurement from the vicinity of its production

units. For FY 2022-23, 39% of material were directly

sourced from MSME vendors; 25% of the material

were sourced from within the district and neighbouring

districts; 6.74% of the material was procured from

Vulnerable/Marginalised Groups/Individuals as part of

the policy of preferential procurement.
