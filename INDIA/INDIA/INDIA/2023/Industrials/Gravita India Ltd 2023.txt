Dear Shareholders

Growth in investments will be critical to

meet India’s rising demand and ensure non-

inflationary growth in the long run. Capital

investments, at a higher scale by the government

and expected fresh ones by the private sector,

are expected to drive medium-term growth.

INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT

The definition of waste has changed over

time. Waste is no longer considered as trash or

abandoned material, but as an asset or resource

that can generate revenues in crores. It is not

only related to reducing landfill volumes but

also reliance on fossil fuels. Globally, many

countries have been actively working towards

finding the best technologies to utilise waste.

The adequate treatment of waste, or sustainable

waste management, is essential not only from

a sanitation point of view but also due to its

economic and environmental values. This

includes its potential contribution to energy

generation in developing countries such as

India. Many developed nations have adopted the

strategies of the integrated waste management

system to maximise waste-based revenues

Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East

& Africa. North America took an initiative on

battery dumping which results in 96% recycling

rate which is highest for any economic product.

Notable tech giant’s headquarters (HQs) situated

in this region which requires large data centres

with high consumption of electronic equipment

will push a recycling market in a positive way.

In Asia Pacific, China, India and Southeast Asian

countries are the top consumers of automobiles

and consumer electronics, and battery-powered

vehicles which have outstripped their domestic

lead production. Thus, there is extensive growth

potential for lead acid battery recycling in the

region. European countries are highly sensitive

in

terms

of

implementing

environment

protection norms and have proven their ability to

deal effectively with lead-acid battery recycling.

The rolling project of e-public transport, shifting

trend to energy storage system, space and

defence development which require high battery

backup will increase overall recycling growth in

Europe.

PERFORMANCE IN 2022-23

During the fiscal year 2022-23, our Company

made significant progress in fortifying our

foundation and advancing our growth initiatives.

The commendable financial results achieved

were a testament to the collective abilities of our

teamwork. Furthermore, we placed heightened

emphasis on infusing sustainability into all

facets of our business operations. During the

year under review on Consolidated basis our

Topline grew by 26% to achieve a total of Rs.2,801

crores, EBIDTA increased by 33% to achieve a

total of Rs.286 crores and PAT jumped by 44% to

achieve a total of Rs.201 crores. Such impressive

results have helped us to maintain a consistent

22% Revenue CAGR in the last 5 years. Our PAT

margin grew consistently over the last 5 years

and achieved a 35% CAGR growth. Our EBIDTA

margin stood in the range of 9-10% annually. We

generated 37% of our revenue and 51% PAT from

overseas businesses.

In our line of business, sourcing the raw materials

can be more challenging than marketing the

end product. Therefore, we made a conscious

decision to establish a presence in regions that

have ready access to raw materials and a large

nearby market resulting in five manufacturing

India’s growth story has been

conquering new highs. Its

impressive GDP growth continues

to show the world its advancing

manufacturing prowess led by

innovation. Interestingly, today

the nation’s growth is becoming

more inclusive or participatory,

allowing hundreds of thousands

of people to raise their quality

of life. As part of our dedication

to promoting sustainability, we

are endeavoring to optimize our

investments while simultaneously

making a positive impact towards

a healthier and more ecologically

conscious future.
