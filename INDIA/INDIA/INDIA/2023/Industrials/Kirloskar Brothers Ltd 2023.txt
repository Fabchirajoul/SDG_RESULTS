MANAGING DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE

At the heart of our Company’s ethos lies an unwavering

commitment to provide maximum value to our customers

through futuristic, ingenious, cost-effective, and

energy-efficient innovations. We have consistently remained

at the forefront of our industry, pushing boundaries and

challenging the status quo. By embracing cutting-edge

technologies and approaches, we have harnessed the

power of innovation to revolutionise the way our customers

experience our products and services. It’s more than a

century since Kirloskar pumps have gained customers’

trust and naturally, we are the most preferred choice for

our users today.

Our products have become catalysts for change, enriching

lives and transcending boundaries. They have improved

productivity, enhanced comfort and contributed to

the overall well-being of individuals and communities

worldwide. We take immense pride in witnessing the

positive impact that our offerings have had on people’s

lives, regardless of their location or background.

Through our dedicated customer-centric approach, we have

created a global footprint, connecting with diverse cultures

and creating a positive ripple effect.

During the year under review, our top line grew at a healthy

pace, driven by an improved product mix, recovery in key

geographies and robust momentum in B2C pumps in the

domestic market. On a consolidated basis, our Net Revenue

from Operations stood at ` 37,302 Million in FY 2022-23,

indicating a growth of 22% over ` 30,576 Million in the earlier

fiscal year of FY 2021-22. Reported Profit After Tax was

` 2,358 Million, demonstrating a 150% rise over ` 943 Million

PAT in the previous year. At 6.3%, PAT margin compared

favourably with 3.1% previously. EBITDA at ` 4,264 Million

was 79% higher than ` 2,385 Million, while EBITDA margin

grew to 11.4% vis-à-vis 7.8%. Our minimal exposure to the

engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business

helped us improve our working capital cycle and cash flows.

However, our operating expenses grew mainly on account

of a sharp rise in raw material prices and other key input

costs. Going ahead, we see future growth being driven by a

healthy order book and enhanced profitability.: Dear Shareholders,

I am thrilled to present to you the 103rd Annual Report of our esteemed company

for the fiscal year 2022-23. Your unwavering support and steadfast belief in our

Company’s mission has been instrumental in our continued success. Together,

we have embarked on a remarkable journey of transformation and growth through

innovation and technology, to create a lasting impact and to make India self-reliant in

fluid management.
