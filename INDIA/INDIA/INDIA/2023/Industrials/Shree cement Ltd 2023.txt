Dear Stakeholders,

It has been four decades of our contribution towards

infrastructure development of the country. The journey

involved many crests and troughs, testing our endurance

and perseverance. Over the years, the business

ecosystem has evolved considerably, and we have

witnessed various externalities recasting the business

environment. As rightly stated by our philosophy, ‘आ नो

भद्रा: क्रतवो यन्तु व वश्वतः , we are imbibing noble thoughts from

all over the world into our business, bringing in

prosperity and excellence as we grow.

Pushing our limits to reimagine our future, we are

growing with a renewed vigour while taking our

sustainability and business commitments to greater

heights. The purpose of Shree’s existence is about

shared values. Our spirit of sharing and mutual growth

is reflected through relationships we have nurtured with

our stakeholders throughout our journey.

Looking forward to a year of well-being, collective

growth, and success.

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

We are living in a world

characterised by heightened

volatility. The economic,

environmental, geo-political and

socio-economic challenges have

paved a ‘polycrisis’ situation in

the making. The time demands

efforts, resources, talent, and an

unwavering commitment to drive

growth and create guardrails for

businesses. We, at Shree Cement,

perceive the challenges as tailwinds

for creating new avenues and our

actions converge as pathways

to create a resilient, rising and

rewarding Shree.

With profound and accelerating

changes prevailing in the external

business ecosystem, we are also on

a transformation journey focusing

on growth and reinvention across

multiple fronts. We regard this

as an opportunity to reground

ourselves with business goals

better aligned with stakeholders’

interests and aspirations. With

transformation cascading down

the governance and seeping into

people and process management,

we are envisioning a 360o

transformation journey supported

by our imbibed values of agility,

adaptability, and flexibility.

I find that when the challenge

is stiff and daunting, potential

for advancement will also be

big and inspiring. This calls for

efforts with a mindset that “there

is no limit to what one can do”

and guide people to embrace

disruptive thinking, challenge

traditional assumptions, and seek

unconventional solutions. While

we are known for making continual

incremental improvements; we

need to aspire to paradigm-

shifting changes as well. So, while

we need to continue our practice

of making continual betterment;

we also need to think whether a

particular process or activity can

be bypassed altogether or could

there be another way to achieve

our objective or purpose. For

example, we may be using a motor

in a process for completing an

activity. To think about its energy

consumption and optimising it, is

incremental betterment. To explore

whether we can bypass the motor

by change in process or whether

a much smaller capacity motor

can do the work is transformation.

Thus, transformation is forward

looking and requires bold, open-

ended and courageous mindset.

There will be many failures on the

way of transformation. People

may feel discouraged. Leadership

needs to encourage its people

to challenge long-held beliefs,

systems, and structures for novel

and innovative solutions to march

on transformation path.

With renewed focus, we are

thinking big on our future and

setting ambitious and futuristic

goals. We have embarked upon

an ambitious journey to almost

doubling our production capacity

to 80 million tons & beyond

over the coming years. We have

adopted a proactive marketing

strategy with the introduction

of a dynamic distribution model,

unique customer centricity and

niche product focus. Likewise,

we have also initiated systematic

transformation in our other

business processes by digital

technologies and automation.

Gearing up for the future, we are

re-positioning ourselves through

augmenting our product offerings,

integrating technology in our

processes, and making our people

ready for paradigm shifts. This

way, we are working harder than

ever, pushing more than ever to

reimagine the future, which is

stronger, efficient, and sustainable.

We proactively put our business

to work to play our part for a

sustainable future. Through

delivering low-carbon products,

and increasing the use of

alternative raw materials, fuels,

and green power, we are on an

incremental nature-positive

journey. Our actions are driven

by a heartfelt commitment to our

people, suppliers, customers, and

communities, aiming for responsive

and inclusive value creation.

Our business success is a testimony

to our passion and drive to create

value. Embracing transformation,

integrating sustainability, and

reinventing ambitions we are

setting greater goals, making

bolder bets, and building successes.

H. M. BANGUR

Chairman

With profound and

accelerating changes

prevailing in the

external business

ecosystem, we are also

on a transformation

journey focusing on

goals better aligned with

stakeholders’ interests

and aspirations.

violations of collective bargaining

rights in the reporting year.

Our Chief Human Resource Officer

looks after the human rights

impacts and issues contributed by

our business.

To raise awareness among

employees about their

responsibilities and our

commitment to respect human

rights, we regularly conduct human

rights trainings for our employees

and workforce. The training

modules are designed to provide

employees with the knowledge

and skills they need to identify and

prevent human rights abuses and

create a culture of respect and

inclusion in the workplace. All our

plants and offices were assessed

during the reporting period for

human rights aspects such as

child labour, forced labour, sexual

harassment, discrimination at

workplace and wages. We did not

identify any instances of breach

of significant human rights in our

operations. Therefore, there was

no requirement to modify the

business process as a result of

addressing human rights issues.

We are planning to conduct human

rights due diligence for our plant

and office locations . The results of

the due diligence will be exercised

to develop action and mitigation

plans as applicable.

As an equal opportunity employer,

we ensure that our rewards and

compensation policies reflect our

values of fairness, transparency,

and meritocracy. We offer

competitive salaries that are in

line with market trends and based

on the skills, experience, and

performance of each employee. We

believe that compensation should

be determined solely on the basis

of merit and performance, and we

do not consider any differentiating

factors that could lead to

discrimination or bias. Owing

to our concerted efforts, 100%

of our employees and workers

receive more than minimum wages

standard set by the government.

Moreover, there were no

complaints raised by employees

or workers on Sexual Harassment,

Discrimination, Child and Forced

labour in the current and previous

reporting year.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

We value the efforts taken by our

employees for the growth and

progress of our organisation. To

engage and motivate them to

achieve their targets we provide

them with regular performance

reviews. For ease of tracking their

progress throughout the year, we

encourage our employees to set

Specific, Measurable, Achievable,

Relevant and Time bound (SMART)

goals. Focusing on comprehensive

development of workmen, we

conduct annual performance and

career development reviews with

100% of our employees and 100%

Managing Director. The executive management are officials that are second in

command below the core leadership team. The Board also plays a crucial role in setting the tone for governance

and overseeing the implementation of policies and procedure along with promoting accountability and

transparency in our business operations.

Our Board has an appropriate balance of independent and non-independent directors from diverse background,

to ensure appropriate independence in functioning. This also ensures that the Board is able to make objective,

informed decisions focused on value creation. The target share for the Independent Directors on the Board

is more than 60%. The Board's diverse experience, and expertise helps in providing a holistic perspective for

decision making. Moreover, we expect our Board of Directors to attend minimum 50% of the Board meetings.

Managing Director is based on

performance of the company including performance of ESG factors. The median of the Board, KMP and other

employees is as follows.

ESG GOVERNANCE

The principles of sustainability

are imbibed in our vision, policies,

and business, and this ensures a

culture of inclusive value creation.

We have established an ESG

Governance Framework to steer

our sustainability initiatives in line

with our business aspirations.

The Board shoulders the overall

responsibility of guiding and

steering our sustainability vision

through our CSR and Sustainability

Committee. The Committee

reviews our performance

across environmental, social,

and governance pillars. ESG

performance is also one of the

factors considered under the

Remuneration Policy to determine

the remuneration of Directors,

Key Management Personnel and

Senior Executives.

ESG Committee

The Environmental, Social and

Governance (ESG) Committee

has been primarily constituted to

monitor and review our corporate

ESG performance at a functional

level. The Committee is headed

by the: Managing

letter. Any violations to CoC can

be brought to immediate notice

through our grievance mechanism.

The Code of Conduct governs our

business activities in the areas of:

•

Conflict of Interest

•

Personal Conduct

•

Workplace conduct

and conduct with

external stakeholders

We are committed to principles of

transparency and accountability

in all our business operations. We

do not tolerate unethical practices

and uphold all laws concerning

bribery, fraud, and corruption in all

forms. Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-

Corruption Policy communicates

our stance on anti-corruption

to all the directors, employees,

workers, and third parties. The

policy is available on the internal

portal as well as corporate website

to facilitate accessibility to all

stakeholders. During the reporting

period, we recorded zero cases of

non-compliance against corruption,

bribery, and anti-competitive

behaviour. Further, there were no

charges of bribery, corruption and

conflict of interest against any of

our directors, KMPs or employees

in the current year.

WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY

Our Whistleblower Policy provides

a vigil mechanism for employees,

directors, customers, shareholders,

and vendors to report their

concerns about unethical business

practices. This shall include

but not be limited to actual or

suspected fraud, violations of

the Code of Conduct or instances

of leakage of unpublished price-

sensitive information. The Policy

also protects against reprisals

and retaliations. The Policy offers

necessary safeguards against the

victimisation of whistleblowers

using the mechanism and provides

for direct access to the Chairman of

the Audit Committee in exceptional

cases. The Policy is available on our

website and can be accessed by

all stakeholders at any given point

of time.

PUBLIC POLICY ADVOCACY

The Shree Philosophy lies in the

idea of imbibing and sharing

noble thoughts. We have been

engaging with Government and

other organisations think tanks

to promote learnings, thoughts,

developments and actions relevant

to the business. Our policy

advocacy strives to bring solutions

to drive critical decision-making

through exchange of knowledge

and expertise. We responsibly

engage with agencies and use

collective platforms like trade and

industry chambers to undertake

policy advocacy. Some of our key

associations are as follows:

•

Cement Manufacturing

Association (CMA)

•

National Council for Cement

and Building Materials (NCCBM)

•

Global Cement Concrete

Association (GCCA), India

•

Federation of Indian

Chambers of Commerce and

Industry (FICCI)

•

Technology and Action for

Rural Advancement (TARA)

•

Indian Institute of

Technology (IIT) Delhi

•

Confederation of

Indian Industry (CII)

Through above associations,

we are actively advocating low

carbon products contributing

to the development of sectoral

low carbon roadmap and

communicating our stance related

to concerned national policies on

environmental improvement as and

when required.

USHERING IN TRANSPARENCY

We endeavour to create value for

all our stakeholders through our

philosophy of ‘walk the talk.’ The

faith entrusted by our stakeholders

has pushed us to accomplish

projects within time and budget

and deliver a high return on

investment. CRISIL, India’s top

rating agency has reaffirmed its

highest rating of ‘CRISIL AAA/Stable’

for our long-term bank facilities and

‘CRISIL A1+’ for our short-term bank

facilities as well as Commercial

Paper Issuance. Similarly, CARE,

another rating agency has also

reaffirmed its highest issuer rating

of ‘CARE AAA; Stable’ for our long-

term bank facilities and ‘CARE A1+’

for our short-term bank facilities as

well as Commercial Paper Issuance.

We also participate in various

benchmarking and rating exercises

such as Carbon Disclosure Project

(CDP) and S&P Global Dow Jones

Sustainability Indices (DJSI).

We are proud to share that we

received an ‘A-’ in Climate Change

Assessment and ‘B’ in Water

Security in CDP, ranking among the

top performers in the industry. We

are consistently working to further

improve our ESG performance.

The ratings are testimony to our

sound business principles and our

financial capability.

GRIEVANCE MECHANISM

We have established a grievance mechanism that is accessible to all our stakeholder groups. All concerns and

grievances can be raised through the ‘Contact Us’ section on our website or through our dedicated email ID:

grievance@shreecement.com. Further, local communities or the local stakeholders can directly connect with

human resources / CSR representatives at respective locations for reporting any concerns.

We have initiated systems to ensure fast redressal of queries within a specified duration from the receipt of the

complaint. If the complaint remains unresolved, it will be escalated to the respective local point of contact. The

contact details of the officers are available with the concerned departments at each unit. If stakeholders are not

satisfied with the response received from the local point of contact, then the grievance can be escalated to the

Concerned Unit Heads or Department Heads. In cases where the complaint is still unresolved, the stakeholder

can write directly to our Senior Management explaining the details of the issue concerned. In the reporting year,

no concerns were raised by any stakeholder that could be regarded as critical in nature.

Neeraj Akhoury: Managing

Dear Stakeholders,

At Shree Cement, we believe in ourselves, and our ability to make a difference,

even in the face of uncertainty and adversity. We are pushing the envelope of

perceived notions and exploring our hidden capabilities to improve, expand,

grow, and progress. We are identifying the best path forward, pursuing the right

technological advancements, and rethinking our business model, products,

portfolios, and partnerships.

Innovation is critical to achieving the cement industry’s decarbonisation goal,

with promising avenues already emerging. To meet the rising demand for low-

carbon materials, we are embracing circular business models, clean energy, and

reallocating capital flows to finance the transition to green production. We are

enhancing our operational efficiency by using clinker substitutes, increasing plant

utilisation (which can lower energy intensity), and improving the effectiveness of

equipment.

We are increasingly investing in green energy capacity creation, including Waste

Heat Recovery (WHR), solar and wind energy. Our existing green energy capacity

is 385.6 MW, whereas our upcoming capacity stands at 83 MW. We have added

around 122 MW of solar and wind power plants in different states during the

current financial year.

With over three decades of experience in project management, we have a

sustained track record of implementing projects ahead of schedule. We are

constantly working to increase our installed capacity beyond 80 MTPA in coming

years across geographies, through both organic and inorganic growth.

We are continually striving to create an inclusive, diverse, safe and healthy

workspace for our people. Our philanthropy arm, Shree Foundation Trust, is

consistently working to bring a change in the lives of our communities, especially

the disadvantaged, marginalised and vulnerable groups. During the reporting

period, our total community spent stood at ` 69.99 Crore, impacting more than 7

lac lives.

To ensure that we are well-prepared for unexpected changes, we have

established contingency plans and risk management strategies and regularly

review and update them to maintain their effectiveness. We have formulated

new policies and revised existing ones in accordance with international standards

and frameworks. We have redesigned our business model and governance

structure considering the ESG risks.

Our business success is a testimony to our passion and drive to create value.

Embracing transformation, integrating sustainability and reinventing ambitions

we are setting greater goals, making bolder bets and building successes.
