Dear Shareholders,

As we conclude the fiscal year 2022-23, we reflect upon a

period that tested our resilience and adaptability in the face

of global challenges. At AIA Engineering, our unwavering

commitment to excellence and reliability ensured a robust

performance.

In the face of external headwinds, we remained optimistic

about the resurgence of the mining and cement industries,

which fuelled the demand for our products. I am delighted to

share that AIA Engineering Limited experienced a favourable

product mix, resulting in a notable increase in margins.

Furthermore, we successfully managed raw material costs.

Our contracts include a price pass-through mechanism,

which reflects previous raw material/freight costs in pricing,

thus maintaining stability. Financially, we achieved impressive

growth compared to the previous year:

• Our annual sales volume soared to 2,91,342 MT, a

substantial leap from the previous year’s 2,60,469 MT

•

Our total revenue witnessed a healthy growth, reaching

` 5,143.31 Crores, compared to ` 3,722.84 Crores in

the previous year

•

Our EBITDA stood at a robust ` 1,475.18 Crores,

marking a significant increase from ` 877.24 Crores last

year

•

PAT experienced remarkable growth, reaching

` 1,056.50 Crores, compared to ` 619.62 Crores in the

previous fiscal year

Our growth is a

testament to our

favourable conversion

cycle, which presents

ample room for

the penetration of

ferrochrome in the

current market

Notes:

(i)

Most of the issues of litigation pertaining to Central Excise / Service tax / Income tax (including transfer pricing matters)

are based on interpretation of the respective law & rules thereunder. Management has been opined by its counsel that

many of the issues raised by revenue will not be sustainable in law as they are covered by judgements of respective judicial

authorities which supports its contention. Further, in several matters, the management has successfully defended their case

at lower forums of adjudication. Accordingly, the management do not envisage any material impact on the consolidated

financial statements of the Group.

(ii)

Sales tax/VAT related litigation/demand primarily pertains to non submission of required declaration forms in time due to

non-receipt of the same from customers and / or some interpretation related issues. However in most of the cases, required

documents are being filed and minor impact if any, shall be given in the year of final outcome of respective matter in appeal.

(iii) The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-employment benefits

received Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. However, the date on

which the Code will come into effect has not been notified. The Group will assess the impact of the Code when it comes into

effect and will record any related impact in the period the Code becomes effective.
