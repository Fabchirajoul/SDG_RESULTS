Policy for Appointment of

Directors and Board Diversity

This policy has been recommended by the Nomination and

Remuneration Committee of the Company at its meeting held

on February 05, 2015 and adopted by the Board of Directors of

the Company at its meeting held on February 05, 2015 pursuant

to Section 178 of the Companies Act, 2013 and is applicable with

effect from the said date.

The policy is divided into separate sections for executive directors,

non-executive directors and employees.

The remuneration of the executive directors is recommended by

the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (the Committee) and

approved by the Board of Directors (the Board) and shareholders of

the Company within the overall limits as may be prescribed under

applicable laws.

The remuneration of the non-executive directors is approved by

the Board of Directors and shareholders of the Company within the

overall limits as may be prescribed under applicable laws.

This Policy is a forward-looking document. It is hereby clarified

that existing obligations of the Company under existing contracts,

pension scheme, etc. which are outstanding at the time this Policy

is approved shall continue to be honoured by the Company. It is

the Company’s policy to honour in full any pre-existing obligations

that have been entered into prior to the effective date of this Policy.

Whereas, while formulating this Policy, the Company is committed

to full and transparent disclosures, certain parameters such as

business targets etc. have not been disclosed as the same is not in

the interest of the Company.

I. EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

Key principles

Attracting and retaining top talent is a key objective of the Company’s

approach to remuneration. The Company’s policy remains largely

unchanged from that which it has applied for a number of years

and its continuity has been a stabilizing force during the periods

of turbulence. The core elements of salary, variable pay, benefits

and pension continue to provide an effective, relatively simple,

performance-based system that fits well with the nature of

Company’s business and strategy.

The remuneration policy for the executive directors has been

consistently guided by following key principles, which represent the

underlying approach of the Board and the Committee:

a)

The remuneration structure of executive directors is designed

to reflect the nature of shipping business in which the Company

operates. The shipping industry has long term business cycles,

is capital intensive, highly regulated and has significant safety

and environmental risks requiring specific entrepreneurial

skills and experience, which the Company must attract and

retain.

b)

A substantial portion of executive directors’ remuneration is

linked to success in implementing the Company’s strategy and

varies with performance of the Company.

c)

There is quantitative and qualitative assessment of each

executive director’s performance.

d)

Total overall remuneration takes account of both the external

market and Company’s conditions to achieve a balanced and

fair outcome.

e)

Ensuring that executive directors are remunerated in a way that

reflects the Company’s long-term strategy. Consistent with this,

a high proportion of executive directors’ total remuneration

has been and will always be, strongly linked to the Company’s

performance.

Flexibility, judgement and discretion

This Policy recognises that the Board and Committee shall

undertake quantitative and qualitative assessments of performance

in reaching its decisions. This involves the use of judgement and

discretion within a framework that is approved by shareholders.

The Board and Committee also need to be sufficiently flexible to

take account of future changes in the industry environment and in

directors’ remuneration practices generally.

The ability to exercise discretion, upwards or downwards, is

important to ensure that a particular outcome is fair in light

of the director’s own performance and the Company’s overall

performance.

Annexure 'D' to the Board’s Report

Remuneration Policy for the

Directors, Key Managerial

Personnel and Other Employees:

Managing Director(s)

during business trips for travelling, boarding and lodging, including

for their respective spouses.

Reimbursement of expenses incurred by other Whole-time

Directors during business trips for travelling, boarding and lodging.

5.

inserted w.e.f. November 2, 2018.

7.

inserted w.e.f. February 11, 2019.

6Variable Pay

It provides a variable level of remuneration dependent on short-

term performance of the individual as well as the Company vis a

vis industry performance globally. The test of performance by

the Company is whether it is able to increase its profits when

the industry environment is favourable and whether it is able to

minimise its losses when the environment is harsh. The Company

believes that performance of each and every employee of the

Company contributes to its overall performance and hence should

be rewarded suitably. Hence, the Company follows the policy of

making payment of variable pay to its executive directors annually.

Variable pay is decided based on performance of executive

directors as well as the Company. Where possible, the Company

uses quantifiable, hard targets that can be factually measured and

objectively assessed. The Company also reviews the underlying

performance of the group in light of the annual plan, competitors

results, etc.

Variable pay may vary from time to time but shall be maximum four

times of the Consolidated Salary. Executive directors with bigger

operating responsibilities may be entitled to more variable pay as

compared to others.

Pension

Pension recognises and appreciates the experience, expertise,

advice, efforts and contribution provided and made by executive

directors to the Company during their long years of service with

the Company and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries, whether in their

capacity as executive directors or otherwise.

The Company may provide pension (which includes providing

perquisites) to its eligible executive directors upon their ceasing to

hold office in the Company in recognition of their past services in

accordance with a scheme formulated by the Board of Directors.

Review

Salary reviews consider both external competitiveness and internal

consistency when determining if any increases should be applied.

Salary increases will be generally in line with all employee increases

within the Company and other companies based in India and

abroad.

Salaries are compared against other shipping and offshore majors,

but the Company also monitors market practice among companies

of a similar size, geographic spread and business dynamic to the

Company.

Salary increases are not directly linked to performance. However

a base-line level of personal contribution is needed in order to

be considered for a salary increase and exceptional sustained

contribution may be grounds for accelerated salary increases.

Specific measures and targets may be determined each year by the

Committee. The principal measures of increments / bonus will be

based on value creation and may include financial measures such

as operational efficiency, operating cash flow, operating profit, cost

management, project delivery, etc.

II. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

The principle which underpins the Board’s policy for the

remuneration of NEDs is that the remuneration should be sufficient

to attract, motivate and retain world-class non-executive talent. The

remuneration practice should also be consistent with recognized

best practice standards for NED remuneration.

Elements

of Directors. It is presently 1.` 1 lakh per meeting.

The NEDs are also paid sitting fees for attending meetings of the

Committee. 4.It is presently ` 1 lakh per meeting. 10.Sitting fees of

It provides a variable level of remuneration dependent on short-

term performance of the Company, i.e. net profits every year.

year to year basis.

` 9 lakhs p.a.11. over and above the Commission payable to him as

for which the underlying asset is of low value on a lease by lease basis. The Company has also used the practical expedient provided

by the standard when applying Ind AS 116 to leases. The Company has used a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar

characteristics.

KEY AUDIT MATTER

AUDITOR’S RESPONSE

Assessment of recoverable amounts of Vessels and Drilling Rigs – (Refer note 2(o), 6 and 31 of the consolidated fi nancial statements)

1.

The Group carries signifi cant amount of property, plant and

equipment on the balance sheet, mainly in the form of vessels

and drilling rigs aggregating to ` 8283.62 crores representing

54% of the total assets as at March 31, 2023.

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period

whether there is any indication that a vessel and drilling rig may

be impaired by considering internal and external sources of

information.

Principal audit procedure performed but not limited to:

Our Principal Audit Procedures included but were not limited

to:

Õ

Obtaining a detailed understanding of key controls and

processes with regard to identifi cation of impairment

indications, and assessment of recoverable amounts of

the vessels and drilling rigs, where such indications exist,

and testing operating eff ectiveness of such controls.

The management assesses recoverable amount of each of the

vessels and drilling rigs where such indications exist, based

on higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The

fair value of a vessel and drilling rig is estimated based on

the valuation provided by external professional valuers, which

is based on brokers’ price ideas and market knowledge. The

‘value in use’ is determined by discounting estimated future

cash fl ows as per management forecast over balance useful

life of a vessel and drilling rig to its present value. The future

cash fl ows are estimated based on various assumptions

relating to charter hire rates based on published external

industry forecasts and historical performance, deployment

pattern, operating costs and other expenses, scrap value, and

discount rate.

Õ

Assessing reasonableness of fair value of vessel and drilling

rig considered by the Management by comparing the same

with the valuations provided by external professional valuers.

Õ

Evaluating and challenging the key inputs and assumptions

considered for cash fl ow forecasts for estimating ‘value in

use’ especially related to charter hire rates with reference

to historical performance and published external industry

forecast, expected deployment with reference to historical

pattern, operating costs with reference to Management

budget and historical actuals, scrap value with reference

to prevailing and forecast rates, and those considered for

discount rate for which we also involved our internal experts,

and assessing mathematical accuracy of the ‘value-in-use’

model.

Õ

Assessing adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures

in the fi nancial statements.:
