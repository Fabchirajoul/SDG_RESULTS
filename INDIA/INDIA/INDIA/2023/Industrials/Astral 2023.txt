CORPORATE OVERVIEW

STATUTORY REPORT

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE: Dear Shareholders,

I am thrilled to share with you that

Astral marks its 25th anniversary

this October 2023, a milestone that

commemorates legacy of innovation,

connectivity, brand building, wide

distribution reach, and strong

production capabilities across the

country. Moreover, it represents

our unwavering commitment to

creating sustainable value for all our

stakeholders. As one of the pioneers

in the Indian CPVC market, our pride

rests not only in our contributions to

this rapidly growing polymer sector,

but also in our sustained ability

to lead, innovate, and expand in

various products in building material

category.

In our journey towards further expansion and

progress, I am confident that our agility and

resilience will consistently propel us towards

maintaining our industry leadership, achieving

greater growth, and enlarging our scale of

operations.

Looking back on FY23, I would like to provide an

overview of our accomplishments and growth

over the last year.

This was a year when our businesses

exhibited tremendous resilience and

steady growth.

We successfully navigated through significant

fluctuations in polymer and chemical prices,

allowing us to achieve substantial profitability

and value growth in both the Pipe segment

(12% growth) and the Adhesive segment (35%

growth), resulting in an increased market share.

Strategic resource management and talent

acquisition have enabled us to successfully

diversify into sectors such as faucets, sanitaryware, paints, and valves,

without compromising the growth of our core businesses.

Over the years, we have witnessed a strong response in our Silencio

product, and more recently, our DrainPro product has also garnered

significant attention and positive feedback. The success of these

products has inspired us to introduce another exciting addition to our

portfolio, Rainway. We are confident that this will further enhance our

offerings in the pipes segment.

In addition to our pipes segment, we are also expanding our product

range in the valve category. Valves serve as a crucial component in

various applications, and we recognize the immense potential they

hold. We are actively focusing on developing and offering high-

quality valves as import substitutes. We are currently on the trajectory

of expanding these product lines and have initiated the process of

doubling the capacity for both. As part of our growth strategy for

the faucets and sanitaryware segment, we are focused on network

expansion and have completed 383

Showrooms/display centres across

various states, with more under

construction.

Our adhesives business displayed

robust growth. Amid industry-wide

consolidation, our strategic expansion

into new geographies, reinforced

dealer networks, and innovative

product launches underpinned our

strong growth. With the continuous

shift from unorganised to organised

players, we expect further market

capture from regional players.

Sustained demand from UK and US

markets further promises a positive

outlook for this vertical.

Additionally, during the year, we

expanded the Bondtite brand

umbrella to incorporate two additional

adhesive offerings: Cyanoacrylate

instant adhesive, and Polyvinyl

Acetate (PVA) under Bondtite.

These concerted efforts culminated

in a robust consolidated performance

for the year, yielding a PBT of ₹6,170

million and an EBITDA of ₹8,351

million.

During the year, we

undertook several steps to

ensure a solid foundation for

our business.

Believing in the pivotal role of strong

leadership, we onboarded a CHRO

and a CTO to streamline our human

resources and technology strategies.

This move will significantly contribute

towards the realization of Astral’s

strategic vision and mission, solidifying

our place as an industry leader. Further,

we are leveraging technology to boost

our cross-selling opportunities once

our new business verticals gain solid

ground and are confident that the new

leadership will guide and direct the

business towards progress.

We reinforced our brand recall by

engaging Allu Arjun as our brand

ambassador to bolster our pipe

business in South India. Further, we

launched various TVCs and magazine

advertisements to forge stronger

connections with our customers. In the

2023 edition of the IPL, we extended

our brand visibility by co-sponsoring a

total of four teams. Astral Pipes proudly

served as co-sponsors for three teams:

Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians,

and Gujarat Titans. Furthermore, our

adhesives brand, Bondtite, stepped

in as a sponsor for the Lucknow Super

Giants.

We have always had a

community-first attitude.

While profitability is our goal, it

is not without the recognition of

the importance of community

empowerment. We understand

that our business thrives when our

community thrives. Therefore, we aim

to strike a balance between achieving

our financial objectives and making

meaningful contributions to the

communities in which we operate. This

dual focus is integral to our business

model and long-term sustainability.

Our social initiatives encompass a

wide range of areas, from education

to healthcare, providing growth

opportunities and fostering self-

sufficiency and resilience. We strive to

light the way towards knowledge and

skill development, enabling individuals

to realise their full potential. We are

also committed to environmental

sustainability, as we advocate for eco-

friendly practices and lead innovative

projects that safeguard our planet's

delicate ecosystems.

The Astral Foundation, our guiding

light, facilitates collaboration by

connecting us with implementation

partners who share our passion for

making a difference. Together, we

forge partnerships that break barriers

and transform aspirations into tangible

realities, ultimately creating a brighter

future for all.

I am pleased to inform you that

we've received multiple accolades

for our distinguished project films.

Our Ranthambore project film, titled

"Ranthambore - The Jungle Story," and

the innovative "Ice Stupas in Ladakh"

project film, have been decorated with

gold awards. Additionally, our "Hiwali

Pipeline Project" film has also been

recognized with an award. Renowned

Organisations, Digies, ABBY, and

Afaqs, have graciously recognized our

contributions.

As we end FY23, we are

motivated to do more in the

years to come.

We have made considerable

investments in our main business line

over the past five years, enhancing

our production capacities and

priming us for future rewards. We

are confident that our investment of

~₹1,000 Crore in capex in the last 5

years will yield results in the upcoming

years. Our upcoming launch of two

advanced pipe plants in Guwahati and

Hyderabad, and an adhesives plant in

Dahej will fortify our market presence

and provide opportunities in new

markets, supporting our ambitious

expansion plans.

In closing, I would like to extend my

heartfelt gratitude to each one of

you. To our valued shareholders and

investors, thank you for placing your

trust in us and supporting our vision.

Your faith in our Company's potential

has been instrumental in propelling us

forward. To our dedicated employees,

your unwavering commitment, hard

work, and innovation are the driving

forces behind our success.

I assure you all that we will continue

to strive for growth and profitability

while maintaining our commitment to

corporate responsibility. As we look

towards the future, I am confident

that we will remain a resilient and

successful business that consistently

offers good returns.

Dear Shareholders,

I am delighted to share with

you the results of Astral’s

performance during the financial

year 2023. Our diligent efforts

and strategic planning have

translated into substantial

profitability, which is reflected in

our impressive FY23 results.

The dynamic macro-economic environment and our

performance

Before I talk about your Company’s performance, it is important to

take a look at the macroeconomic environment in which the business

operated during FY23. The pipes industry was dominated by volatility

in polymer prices, resulting in challenges for small and unorganised

players. The adhesives and sealants industry witnessed higher chemical

prices. The booming construction industry contributed to the growth of

the paints segment; however, the fluctuating raw material prices posed

challenges.

Against these trends, Astral exhibited significant resilience and recorded

a revenue of ₹51,585 million, up by 17.4% over FY22. Our PBT and

EBITDA stood at ₹6,170 million and ₹8,351 million, respectively. We

made a net cash profit of ₹6,376 million, up by 3.29% over FY22.

Over the past two years,

we recorded a CAGR growth

In Adhesives & Sealants

business

In Pipes

business

35.50%

24.81%

The expansion of our geographical

reach, particularly in the eastern

region, has yielded substantial

growth in FY23. Looking ahead,

we expect this momentum

to continue as we prepare to

introduce our complete product

range from the newly established

plant in that region.

"

Individually, our plumbing and paints

and adhesives business performed

well. Our plumbing business recorded

a revenue growth of 11.93% over last

year at ₹37,675 million. EBITDA stood

at ₹6,419 million, up by 1.41%, while

PBT stood at ₹4,850 million, witnessing

a marginal fall of 6.6%. We recorded a

strong production growth of 22.15%

as our production volume stood at

1,73,940 MT for the year. Our paints

and adhesives business boomed

during the year, with revenue growing

by 35.28% over last year to ₹13,910

million and EBITDA growing by 24.40%

to ₹1,932 million. This business, thus,

accounted for 27% of our revenue

compared to 23% in FY22.

The factors that contributed

to our growth

Despite facing several challenges, our

business has exhibited remarkable

resilience, leading to strong growth.

Both our pipes and adhesives &

sealants segments have witnessed

robust volumetric growth and

gained market share. The successful

introduction of value-added products

and the decentralized plant operations

have contributed to favorable margins,

even in the face of raw material

volatility. Moreover, the recent

launches of innovative products in both

segments have further accelerated

growth and profitability.

We have also made significant strides

in capturing market share from both

unorganized and organized players,

solidifying our position in the market.

The expansion of our geographical

reach, particularly in the eastern region,

has yielded substantial growth in

FY23. Looking ahead, we expect this

momentum to continue as we prepare

to introduce our complete product

range from the newly established plant

in that region.

A future full of opportunities

Over the past few years, our

management team has meticulously

strategized and executed a number of

investments and initiatives, all with a

focus on long-term sustainability and

profitability. Our financial health has

been meticulously maintained, and

we are in a robust position to leverage

emerging opportunities in our industry.

We are confident that our ₹1,000 crore

capex investment done over the last 5

years will empower us to not only grow

our existing portfolio but also expand

our revenues in the coming years.

Over the past two years, we recorded

a CAGR growth of 24.81% for our

pipes business, despite operating in

a challenging environment. Similarly,

for the adhesives business, we have

delivered a CAGR growth of 35.50%

over the past two years. Having set the

benchmark ourselves, we are confident

that our pipes and adhesives business

will continue growing at a CAGR of

15% in the next 5 years. We plan to

grow both our businesses by entering

into new geographies, launching new

products and adding new dealers,

distributors and plumbers to our family.

Moreover, the upcoming plants in

Guwahati, Dahej and Hyderabad will

also serve as major growth drivers in

future.

Astral is a robust brand that has

garnered the trust of millions of Indian

consumers. Our strategy moving

forward will be to capitalize on our

accumulated knowledge and to

harness our exceptional distribution

capabilities as we expand into various

categories. Our commitment to brand

enhancement remains unwavering,

and we will continue to invest in a

wide range of channels to ensure

this. Presently, we stand as a fortified

Company with a diversified and

expanding portfolio, adeptly applying

our learnings across all our endeavours.

Despite the challenges that lie ahead,

I am steadfast in my belief that our

strategic plans and initiatives will lead

us towards industry-leading growth.

As we launch ourselves into a renewed

journey of growth, I would like to assure

our shareholders and investors that

we remain committed to delivering

strong financial returns. Our strategic

decisions and investments are aimed

at ensuring sustainable growth and

profitability, and we are optimistic

about the financial trajectory of our

business. Your trust and support fuel

our pursuit of financial excellence, and

we are dedicated to rewarding your

faith in us with healthy returns on your

investments.

I would like to express my deep

gratitude to our devoted employees.

Your unwavering commitment, hard

work, and dedication have played a

pivotal role in achieving this impressive

growth for our organization.

Let’s take Astral to new

heights together.

Best regards,

Hiranand Savlani

Statement of Consolidated Changes In Equity (Contd.)

For the year ended March 31, 2023:

Managing Director.

Segment revenue, segment expenses, segment assets

and segment liabilities have been identified to segments

on the basis of their relationship to the operating activities

of the segment. Inter segment revenue is accounted on

the basis of transactions which are primarily determined

based on market/fair value factors. Revenue, expenses,

assets and liabilities which relate to the Group as a

whole and are not allocable to segments on a reasonable

basis have been included under “unallocated revenue/

expenses/assets/liabilities”.

x) Non-current assets held for sale and

discontinued operations

Discontinued operations are reported when a component

of the Group comprising operations and cash flows that

can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial

reporting purposes, from the rest of the Group operations

is classified as held for sale or has been disposed of, if the

component either (1) represents a separate major line of

business or geographical area of operations and (2) is part

of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major

line of business or geographical area of operations or (3) is a

subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale

Non-current assets are classified as held for sale, if its

carrying amount will be recovered principally through a

sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and

the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present

condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary

for sales of such assets and its sale must be highly probable

and sale is expected to be completed within one year from

date of classification.

Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets

and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale

are presented separately from the other assets and liabilities

in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Non-current assets

classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their

carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current

assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are

classified as held for sale.
