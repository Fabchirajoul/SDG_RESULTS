Managing Director as CODM who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing

performance of the operating segments and makes strategic decisions.

1.23 exCePtIONAL IteMS

When an item of income or expense within profit or loss from ordinary activity is of such size, nature or incidence that their

disclosure is relevant to explain the performance of the Company for the year, the nature and amount of such items is disclosed

as exceptional items.

1.24 CASH DIvIDeND

The Company recognizes a liability to pay dividend when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the

discretion of the Company i.e. when the dividend distribution is being approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount

is recognized directly in equity.

1.25 ReCeNt INDIAN ACCOuNtING StANDARDS (IND AS)

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian

Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from

April 1, 2023, as below:

(a) Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements - The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting

policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is

material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements.

(b) Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes – The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases

and decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the Initial recognition exemption of Ind AS 12

so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary

differences. Accordingly, companies will need to recognise a deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability for temporary

differences arising on transactions such as initial recognition of a lease and a decommissioning provision.

(c) Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors – The definition of a “change in accounting

estimates” has been replaced with a definition of “accounting estimates”. Accounting estimates are defined as “monetary

amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting estimates if

accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty.

The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial statements and does not expect to have these amendments

to have any significant impacts in its financial statements.

Notes to the Standalone financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023:

Managing Director and governed by

overall direction of Board of Directors of the Company.

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a

financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency

exchange rates, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable

to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits , foreign currency receivables, payables and

loans and borrowings.

A. CReDIt RISK

Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter party may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage

this, the Company periodically assess financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current

economic trends, and analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set

accordingly.

The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant

increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis through each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase

in credit risk the Company compares the risk of default occurring on asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default

as at the date of initial recognition. It considers reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information such as:

i)

Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business

ii) Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty

iii) Financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty’s ability to meet

its obligations

iv) Significant increase in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same counterparty

The company catogarises financial assets based on the assumptions, inputs and factors specific to the class of financial

assets into High-quality assets, negligible credit risk; Quality assets, low credit risk; Standard assets, moderate credit risk;

Substandard assets, relatively high credit risk; Low quality assets, very high credit risk; Doubtful assets, credit-impaired.

Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectations of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a

repayment plan with the Company. The Company categorises a loan or receivable for write off when a debtor fails to make

contractual payments greater than one year past due. Where loans or receivables have been written off, the Company

continues engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are

recognized in profit or loss.:
