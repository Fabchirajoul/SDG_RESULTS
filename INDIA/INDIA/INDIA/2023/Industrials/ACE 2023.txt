in the consolidated financial statements.

ind as 8 - accounting Policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors - This amendment has introduced a definition of

‘accounting estimates’ and included amendments to Ind AS 8 to help entities distinguish changes in accounting policies from

changes in accounting estimates. The effective date for adoption of this amendment is annual periods beginning on or after

April 1, 2023. The Group has evaluated the amendment and there is no impact on its consolidated financial statements.

ind as 12 - income taxes - This amendment has narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exemption so that it does

not apply to transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences. The effective date for adoption of this

amendment is annual periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023. The Group has evaluated the amendment and there is no

impact on its consolidated financial statements.
