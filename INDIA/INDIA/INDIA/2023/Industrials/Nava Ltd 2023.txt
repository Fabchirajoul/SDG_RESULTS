3 | Annual Report 2022-23:

Dear Shareholders

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to

each and every one of you for your unwavering

support and confidence in our organization, which

has helped it grow by leaps and bounds.

It is heartening to report an impressive

performance for the fiscal year 2022-23, despite

the disruptive economic challenges that our core

businesses have faced. This truly reflects the

resilience that has been diligently built into our

operational philosophy over the last five decades,

and I believe it will continue to hold us steadfast

in the future.

During the past year, our company has achieved

record consolidated revenues of ₹ 392,800 lakhs

and a net profit of ₹ 122,169 lakhs. These

exceptional results can be attributed to significant

improvements in our Zambian operations, while

our domestic businesses performed well in

the first half and faced the challenges of the

commodity cycle in the second half of FY 2023.

The Manganese Alloy business is expected to

benefit from economies of scale, as both our

Telangana and Odisha works are engaged in

similar products, providing the company with

better input cost management and access to

wider markets. In this context, the current and

future demand for the dependent primary steel

business is critical for sustaining margins in the

manganese alloys. Our existing procurement

contracts for manganese ore provide visibility

of direct costs and help us adapt efficiently to

commodity cycles. We anticipate that backward

integration into mining will not only result in

further cost savings but also create expansion

opportunities. We expect to see progress in this

aspect starting from the next financial year.

While captive power consumption has been

advantageous for our domestic power business,

the company has also been engaging in merchant

sales of power through exchanges on an

opportunistic basis. The quality of coal and its

associated delivered costs are factors beyond our

control, but we strive to remain cost-competitive

to maximize contributions and net margins to the

best of our ability.

It is extremely gratifying to report a significant

financial turnaround in Zambian operations during

FY 2023. Operational metrics reached their

highest level, and the improved cash flow position

enabled the Zambian subsidiary to fully address

its long-overdue debt and reduce leverage.

Although power revenues from the Zambian

subsidiary declined due to a mutually agreed

tariff reduction, it established a sustainable

arrangement for both parties. Furthermore, the

amicable resolution of the "Consented Arbitral

Award" and subsequent payments from ZESCO

should assist the Zambian subsidiary in achieving

compliance with financial covenants, paving the

way for equity returns in the next financial year.

I am delighted to share this positive development

with all of you.

Our initiatives in healthcare services in Southeast

Asia and the maiden Avocado venture in Zambia

are aimed at achieving asset-light diversification.

We are pleased to mention that the Avocado

Venture, despite being in its early plantation

stage, has already garnered significant attention

from leading global players, underscoring its long-

term potential.

Looking ahead, Nava Limited is optimistic

about capitalizing on emerging opportunities

and overcoming industry challenges. We are

dedicated to delivering long-term value to our

shareholders while providing innovative solutions

and exceptional service to our customers.

Our Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives

centred around the cherished objective of

HELP (Health, Education, Livelihood and other

Programs), continue to make a lasting impact in

our operational areas. We will similarly strive for

excellence in our ESG (Environment, Social and

Corporate Governance) efforts and benchmark

ourselves with the best practices.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our

management team, employees, and stakeholders

for their collective efforts in delivering improved

results. I also express my gratitude to each

individual shareholder for their unwavering

confidence in us.

the Company and against NBPL. The Case has been

going on before the Special Court at New Delhi. Based

on the non-involvement of the Company’s MD in the

alleged offences, it is felt that a favourable outcome

should ensue in due course. While the CBI case is

proceeding, ED had attached the NBPL’s shareholding

in NBEIL and further sought transfer thereof which was

contested by NBPL and a stay was obtained from the

designated Tribunal.

BRAHMANI INFRATECH PRIVATE LIMITED (BIPL)

During the year there were no operations in BIPL. The

case involving Mantri Group, concerning the erstwhile

SEZ development project, went through protracted

litigation through Arbitration at first and then was before

the Hon’ble High Court of Telangana which directed that

the matter be discharged by the Commercial Court at

Hyderabad in accordance with past judgement of the

Hon’ble Supreme Court. The matter is now awaiting

disposal by the Commercial Court.

KINNERA POWER COMPANY PRIVATE LIMITED

(KPCPL) (Associate Company)

The Company is holding 26% of equity shares in

KPCPL, which is continued as specified by the National

Highway Authority of India (NHAI). As per the professed

intention and there being no economic interest, the

Company plans to fully off-load its stake in KPCPL in

favor of Meenakshi Infra Group as per the regulations.

Accordingly, no economic interest from KPCPL is being

factored in the consolidated financials nor the accounts

of KPCPL is appended to the Annual report of the

Internal Control Systems and their Adequacy

Adopting stringent Internal Control Mechanisms is vitally

important in a dynamic and competitive environment

that witnesses frequently shifting paradigms. Our

Internal Control Mechanisms seek to safeguard the

organization’s assets as well as authorize, record and

report all transactions correctly and in a timely manner.

They ensure that we not only conform to local statutory

requirements but meet the highest global standards and

practices as well.

Our carefully structured Internal Control Framework

constantly monitors and assesses all aspects of risks

associated with current activities and corporate profile,

including scientific and development risks, partner

interest risks, and commercial and financial risks. Our

Control Processes 1) safeguard the organization’s

assets, 2) prevent/detect frauds and errors, 3) ensure

accurate and complete accounting, and 4) facilitate

timely preparation of reliable financial information.

They see to it that manual and automated processes for

transaction approval and recording are adequately and

effectively reviewed. They also ensure compliance with

various policies, practices and statutes in keeping with

the organization’s growth and business complexity.

Our Internal Control Systems are reinforced by regular

Management Reviews and verification by Internal

Auditors. Further, all internal control functions and its

entire gamut of activities are covered by independent

audit whose findings are reviewed regularly by the

Audit Committee and Management of the Company.

A Board-appointed Audit Committee is entrusted with

the task of 1) reviewing the Internal Audit Plan, 2)

verifying the adequacy of the Internal Control System,

3) marking its Audit Observations and 4) monitoring the

sustainability of the remedial measures.

The Board of

letter, duly reserving their rights

in accordance with the terms of the Common Terms Agreement entered with them. These loans are

primarily secured by the assets of MCL, a sovereign guarantee issued by the Government of Zambia

(To the extent of monies owed to MCL by ZESCO) and an insurance cover for a majority portion of the

outstanding balance. Pursuant to an approval from the lenders and in accordance with the terms of the

power purchase agreement, the management of MCL has invoked necessary arbitration proceedings

against ZESCO, in pursuit of strengthening its efforts to realise the amounts due and also to ensure the

repayment of the instalment defaulted.

While the management has secured a formal approval from the lenders in relation to invoking the

government guarantee, the invocation of the insurance claim does mandate completion of an arbitration

proceedings in accordance with the terms of the power purchase agreement and the arbitration award

being in favor of MCL. In accordance with the terms of the underlying insurance policy, the insurer would

make good to the lenders only the amount of instalments which have been defaulted and the rest of

the instalment would be paid in accordance with the terms of the original repayment schedule agreed

between MCL and the lenders.
