Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to share my thoughts after

another eventful year of good progress. We continued

our growth momentum through a year that was

relentless with unprecedented inflation primarily due to

geopolitical strife and supply chain constraints resulting

in a rising interest rate regime. Yet, continuous upheavals

notwithstanding, we recorded good growth across all our

business segments.

Our robust performance resulted from the teams’

relentless focus on execution. We reinforced our core

strengths and further widened and deepened our

capabilities. These intangible investments have also

facilitated in ending the year with a healthy order book

position that enhances the energy levels within the

organisation to sustain our progress.

Sustainability, a compelling mandate

While nature continues to provide everything we need,

if we continue to do things the way we do it today,

someday, very shortly, these resources will be completely

depleted. Because what nature provides is finite. In this

context, sustainability signifies providing for the present

needs without compromising the needs of future

generations.

Climate change and sustainability have become

fundamental to every company’s long-term relevance

due to rapidly altering perspectives worldwide. Therefore,

embracing and integrating sustainability principles into

the business edifice has become a compelling business

case. When that happens, the natural fallout will be that

a new business model will emerge, new societal and

environmental performance benchmarks will emerge,

and valuation criteria will stand redefined.

For instance, in the textile industry, for as long as I can

remember, the textile fraternity talked about the fibre-

to-fabric model. Today, conversations veer around the

fabric-to-fabric strategy. The growing awareness about

problems emerging from dumping of used garments

has transformed the dialogue. And recycling fabric has
