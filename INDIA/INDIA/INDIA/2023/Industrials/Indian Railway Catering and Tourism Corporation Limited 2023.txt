Dear Shareholders,

A conducive domestic policy environment and the Government’s sustained focus

on structural reforms have kept India’s economic activity robust despite global

headwinds. By optimising our operations and delivering exceptional experiences

to our valued customers through our business segments, we registered strong

growth in the fiscal year.

During the fiscal year under review, the travel and tourism industry saw a

rebound, with growing traveller aspirations. IRCTC has been positioned as a

significant participant in meeting the travel requirements of millions of people.

With our rising prominence in the online ticketing industry, we operate as one of

the most transacted websites in the Asia Pacific area.

We have witnessed a significant increase in domestic and international

travellers, which has resulted in changing preferences and diversified client

needs. IRCTC actively supports and promotes tourism initiatives, connecting

various destinations and communities across India. At IRCTC, we monitor market

dynamics and embrace technology-driven solutions to meet the evolving needs

of our clients.

Hospitality being one of the main business objectives of the company, in FY 2022-23

IRCTC focused its catering operations towards enhancement of the meal experience

of the passenger fraternity whether on trains or at stations. After witnessing

stagnation in catering activities for nearly 2 years on account of the pandemic,

IRCTC came back strongly in its catering vertical by commencing of operation of a

number of hospitality outlets at railway stations and non-railway premises. Besides,

the company has been entrusted with the responsibility of provision of catering

services in the fleet of Vande Bharat Trains launched by the Ministry of Railways

letter for Debtors as well as creditors is sent

to all the parties (Railway as well as Non Railways).

It may be noted that Railway follows cash system of

accounting while IRCTC follows accrual system of accounting.

Also, a huge number of ongoing transactions take place

between IRCTC and Railways on daily basis. To resolve the

issue, regular meetings are held with Zonal Railways for

reconciliation of Payable/Receivable and the minutes of the

meetings are also issued accordingly.

Further, most of the said entries are on account of change

in Catering Policy from time to time. The reconciliation and

identification of legacy items along with inoperative debit

and credit balances is in progress.

Also, while there is 100% balance confirmation from banks, .

the balance confirmation from other parties has also improved

as compared to last year. The Company is continuously

following up for the same to ensure better response.

Note No.56 (b) regarding non-sharing of input

tax credit data of GST for certain periods by

Developer cum Operators (“DCO”) of four Rail

Neer plants resulting in non-recognition of these

claims receivables in the books of account of

the Company. Amount of such claims are not

ascertainable at this stage. Further, these DCOs

are also disputing these claims including claims

of H 751.74 Lakhs debited to their accounts.

As per the terms and conditions of the tender, in respect

of 4 PPP Railneer plants i.e. Parassalla, Sankrail, Nagpur

and Hapur, the Developer cum Operator (DCOs) are to be

reimbursed the GST on sales, net of Input Tax Credit (ITC)

(earlier Excise-duty/VAT on sales, net of CENVAT/ITC) availed

by them.

The DCOs have represented against the claim of IRCTC for

Input Tax Credit. The Company has approached for legal

opinion on this matter from Ex-Additional Solicitor General

(ASG) of India and same has been received. The appropriate

decision on the said matter will be taken during the FY 2023-

24. However, prima-facie, there seems to be no financial

letter no TC-II/2910/20/Trains dated 11.5.2021 has only agreed to waive

off the component of ""loss of paths to Good trains"" in calculation and charging of fixed cost for IRCTC passenger trains for

non –operational period up to 31.12.2020 and has decided that other charges applicable will remain the same. IRCTC has again

requested Railway Board to reconsider waiving off the fixed charges (fixed haulage and Custody charges) amounting to H 2793

Lakhs for non-operational period of the three trains considering it as a force majeure situation, as the lockdown and restriction

imposed by Government of India due to COVID-19 pandemic was beyond control of IRCTC. However, IRCTC has made full

provision for the fixed charges for both the Tejas trains and Kashi Mahakal express trains train in the Financial Year 2020-21.

Further, during the current year, Railway Board vide: letter no TC-II/2910/2019/Trains by IRCTC (E-3344610), New Delhi dated

06.01.2023 has further allowed waiver off amounting H 174.91 lakhs relating to Tejas trains on account of Custody and Fixed

Haulage charges out of H 2793 Lakhs. The said amount is included in Excess Provision Written Back under Exceptional Items

(refer note no.33) during the year. "

Note :- 77 The Company has applied for advance ruling for following issues for which decision of AAR is still awaited:

1.

Reimbursement of Service Charges: The Government of India through Ministry of Railways, in the public interest had waived

off the service charges from the passengers for booking of online train tickets through IRCTC's website. The Government of

India has reimbursed consolidated amount of H 8000 Lakhs, H 8800 Lakhs and H 3227 Lakhs for the 2017-18 , 2018-19 and

2019-20(up to July-19) respectively. Section 15 (2) of CGST Act 2017, excludes the amount of reimbursement of expenses

received from the Central Government and State Governments from the value of taxable supply, hence the amount received

from the Indian Railways being the Central Government towards the reimbursement of expenses incurred for the providing

of same should not be charged to GST. Therefore no GST was paid by IRCTC for above reimbursement.

2.

Reimbursement of Travel Insurance: The Government of India has decided to provide travel insurance on free of Cost to

the passengers who have booked the train ticket through online to promote digitalization. Accordingly, IRCTC provided the

Insurance free of Cost for which Ministry of Railway had reimbursed the travel insurance of H 4700 Lakhs on which no GST

was paid by the Company being reimbursement of expenses received from the Central Government.

3.

MDR Received from Acquirer Banks. The IRCTC has received H 300 Lakhs in FY 2019-20 from Acquirer Banks towards

its share of MDR charges being rate or fee charged on the merchant service providers The Company has treated this

payment as subsidy and no GST was paid on the aforesaid amount, as subsidy received from Central Government and State

Governments shall be excluded from the value of supply and same shall not form part of consideration for the purpose of

levying GST.

4.

The IRCTC has received pro-rata Licensee fees from Indian Railways for taken over of catering of SBD trains in the terms of

Catering Policy, 2017 of H 1385 Lakhs, H 7058 Lakhs, H 125 Lakhs for the years 2017-18, 2018-19 & 2019-20 respectively and no GST

passengers.

(f) Accordingly, in compliance to the above Railway Board’s orders, IRCTC has issued letter for withdrawal of terminations vide

letters dated 21.11.2021.

Note :- 79

Ministry of Railway vide commercial Circular no. CC-60 of 2019 has increased the catering tariff for post and pre-paid trains.

As per the tender clause the existing License fees will be increased on the basis of sales assessment on account of increase

in catering tariff. The sales assessment was not done in the previous years due to Pandemic. After the resumption of regular

trains services, company has started the process of sales assessment during the year 2022-23 and sales assessment has been

completed for all pre-paid trains and of peak season for post paid trains. The sales assessments for lean season in case of post

paid trains are still under finalization. Further, company has started to raise demand notices for increased License fee for pre-

paid trains but some of the licensees have challenged company’s decision of increased License fees in Hon’ble High Court of

Mumbai. As the matter is sub- judice and there is an uncertainty and occurrence is dependent on outcome of certain event in

future, hence the impact of increase in License fees for pre-paid trains has not been recognized in the financial statement for the

financial year 2022-23.

Note :- 80

letter no. 2009/TG-III/631/2 Pt. dated 23.2.2023 has mentioned that non-availability of catering services

in the trains even after 03 days from the date of intimation by the Zonal Railways, shall attract a fine of Rs. 01 lakh per day till the

services commence. The Company has represented to Ministry of Railways that it is difficult to implement the above instructions

due to non participation in tenders for TSV trains majorly because of rampant unauthorized vending beyond the control of IRCTC.

Further, there are many overnight trains which originate and terminate at such hours (After Dinner & before Breakfast stipulated

meal time) that for such trains catering services are not feasible. The Company has requested Ministry of Railways to review

the above instruction keeping in view the facts stated in this regard. Response from Ministry of Railways is awaited. Appropriate

decision will be taken as and when response is received from Ministry of Railways. Amount of fine till 31 March, 2023 is neither

ascertained nor any demand from Zonal Railways received till date.

C&AG to the company on payments of ex-gratia/Performance related pay to the deputationists and requested to send comments

on the provisional Para. this Para C&AG has commented that the payments of ex-gratia either in lieu of PRP or as pay parity

to employees on deputation on CDA scale was in violation of the DPE and DoPT instructions, and thus inadmissible. Further

inadmissible payments of H 230.13 Lakhs made to deputationists. The Company has sent detailed reply to Ministry of Railways

on dated 24.01.2023 in which company has requested that the performance award paid to the deputationists is not in violation

of the DPE and DoPT instructions. The amount of performance award paid to deputationists is a form of incentive to boost the

morale of the employees and to retain them with the company. As on date no further communication has been received from

Ministry of Railways by the Company. Appropriate decision will be taken on this matter as and when response is received from

Ministry of Railways. In the meantime , no such provision has been made for the financial year 2022-23 and existing provision
