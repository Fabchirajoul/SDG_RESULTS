Notice:

Managing Director

Seiji Fukuoka

Deputy: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

We at Escorts Kubota are paving a

new path forward, respecting our rich

history of Escorts’ 76 and Kubota’s

132 years. The infusion of culture from

Japan and India is ready to give shape

to an organisation which embeds the

strengths of two legacies.

Our vision is to become a Company

that is truly loved and sought after

by society and employees, provide

solutions to society for a sustainable

world and to become a manufacturing

hub for the world from India by

utilising the capability and potential of

our country.

We are delighted to present our 2nd

Integrated and 77th Annual Report,

showcasing our commitment to

creating value for you over the past

seven-and-half-decades.

In FY2023, we witnessed a gradual

return to normalcy in supply chains,

energy and food markets. The Indian

Tractor market had double-digit growth

with a peak volume of 9.45 lakhs.

The government’s support through

various policy measures, thrust on

domestic manufacturing driven by

its self-reliance mission, coupled

with reduced private sector debt and

increased investment in infrastructure

projects, positions India as a major

player in the global economy. India is

poised for even greater success and

prosperity in the coming years.

As reported by Morgan Stanley about

India’s journey in the next decade,

first, the Indian population will touch

1.5 billion by 2030, which means

growing demand for food and second

that India is estimated to have a surplus

of 245 million skilled labour, which

indicates that the world will invest in

India and become a hub for the world

markets. The infrastructure requirement

to bring the Indian economy into the

top three economies of the world will

require large investments and thus, also

increase the scope for construction and

railway businesses at EKL.

At Escorts Kubota Limited, we take

pride in actively contributing to India's

journey of growth and progress. Our

unwavering focus on enhancing farm

productivity through mechanisation

underscores our commitment to

improving food security. We are

dedicated to forging a safer and

technologically advanced future for

the construction industry in India by

introducing innovative products and

solutions. As a trusted partner of

Indian Railways, we remain steadfast

in catering to the evolving needs of

the sector. We are actively involved

in developing products that meet the

requirements of ongoing rail transport

and metro projects, ensuring our

commitment to serving the nation's

emerging needs.

We are resolute in our mission to be a

catalyst for positive change, supporting

the socio-economic development

of India and delivering solutions that

make a lasting impact. The strength

of Escorts' speed, agility and frugality

and Kubota’s technology, processes,

and quality will jointly be embedded

at Escorts Kubota to discover ways of

newer opportunities and give a new

experience in the farming and industrial

space. This is an opportunity for us

to offer an exceptional experience

to our society, customers, and an

exciting path for both our stakeholders

and shareholders.

letter of credit from customers

where credit risk is high and taking insurance cover for receivables. The Company closely monitors the credit-

worthiness of the debtors through internal systems that are configured to define credit limits of customers,

thereby, limiting the credit risk to pre-calculated amounts. In case of trade receivables, default is considered to

have occurred when amounts receivable become one year past due.

Trade receivables are generally extended a credit period of 0 to 90 days, except in case of sale to government,

where the credit period is governed by terms of the order or the tender document and do not involve any significant

financing component.

Other financial assets measured at amortised cost

Other financial assets measured at amortised cost includes loans and advances to employees, security

deposits and others. Credit risk related to these other financial assets is managed by monitoring the

recoverability of such amounts continuously, while at the same time internal control system are in place ensure

the amounts are within defined limits.

b)

Expected credit losses for financial assets

i)

Financial assets (other than trade receivables)

Company provides for expected credit losses on loans and advances other than trade receivables by

assessing individual financial instruments for expectation of any credit losses.

-

For cash & cash equivalents and other bank balances - Since the Company deals with only high-rated

banks and financial institutions, credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances

and bank deposits is evaluated as very low.

-

For loans comprising security deposits paid - Credit risk is considered low because the Company is in

possession of the underlying asset.

-

For other financial assets - Credit risk is evaluated based on Company's knowledge of the credit

worthiness of those parties and loss allowance is measured. Since this category includes loans and

receivables of varied natures and purpose, there is no trend that the Company can draw to apply

C.2 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial

liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity

is to ensure as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company’s liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis

of expected cash flows. The Company takes into account the liquidity of the market in which the entity operates.
