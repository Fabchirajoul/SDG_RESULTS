MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO

My Dear Shareholder,

It is my pleasure to share with you this

year’s Annual Report. FY 2022-23

was a watershed year for Thermax

with the business reaching all-time

highs on multiple financial metrics

including those of revenues, order

backlog, profits, and cash flow from

operations. These numbers were a

result of strength across business

sub-segments. I would like to thank

each one of Thermax’s stakeholders

as it is their partnership that is at the

core of our achievements.

Robust Domestic Economic

Environment

The post Covid-19 revival of the

Indian economy continued through

the entirety of last year. The strong

growth of the GDP at a rate of 7% was

supported by a consistently robust

manufacturing Purchasing Managers’

Index (PMI) that maintained a healthy

average of 55.6. Private credit

offtake increased by 15% despite an

increasing rate environment and signs

of a global recession. The domestic

economic policy aligned well with

industry needs and supported

this growth.

Additionally, the Union Budget

2023-24 provided a push for green

growth, encouraging the use of

alternate sources of energy such

as bioenergy and green hydrogen.

The Budget projected an increase in

capital investment in infrastructure

by Rs. 10 lakh crore (3.3% of

India’s GDP). The allocation of

Rs. 19,744 crore towards the National

Green Hydrogen Mission, and the

production-linked incentive (PLI)

As India and the world move to decarbonise and clean up

their energy systems, companies such as Thermax will have

a valuable role to play in this journey. This means a sense of

urgency in everything we do, fostering numerous partnerships

within our ecosystem, and shifting capabilities from large

specification-driven projects to projects that are bespoke,

technology-driven, often smaller in scale but distributed

in breadth.

-Ashish Bhandari

with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI),

Australia, we believe, over time, that

the production of green hydrogen will

be a key step forward in decarbonising

hard-to-abate industries in India, such

as refineries, fertilisers, and steel.

Although not a large emitter of CO2

within the company, we have charted

our decarbonisation path. By 2025,

we will achieve 25% reduction in CO2,

from our 2019 baseline, to support

India in transitioning into a low-carbon

economy. Progress has been made

by enhancing operational efficiency,

renewable energy generation,

procurement, and fuel switch. In this

financial year, we have achieved

an absolute reduction of 17% in

emissions from the base year of

2019. Moreover, our carbon emission

intensity with respect to revenue has

improved by 38.6%.

We remain committed to transforming

Thermax as a future-ready, agile,

productive, and effective organisation.

We are leveraging tech-enabled

processes and digitisation to

ensure customer delight externally

and reduce bureaucracy as well

as repetitive processes internally.

Leveraging the company’s experience

in the domains of energy and

environment over 55 years, Thermax

introduced a unique digital solution

called ‘Edge Live’ over a year ago.

Our customers have experienced

increased efficiency, improved plant

performance, enhanced uptime and

knowledge management of their

industrial assets.

We understand that a sustainable

business, in the long run, is one

that maintains a consistent focus on

the ‘S’ (Social) imperative of ESG.

Being a responsible organisation, we

constantly find opportunities to take

actions not only towards the planet,

but also our people, and positively

impact society.

The initiative Social Compact (SoCo),

which Thermax and other companies

have signed up for along with the NGO

Dasra and others, ensures greater

dignity and equity for unorganised

industrial workers in India. Apart from

our own manufacturing facilities

and sites, Thermax started a worker

facilitation centre (WFC) in Pune

and another in Savli to help informal

workers across industries access

benefits linked to government

schemes they are entitled to, such as

the e-Shram card, BOCW benefits,

Aadhaar card, PAN card, and health

insurance. I am delighted that our own

workers in Pune have come forward to

volunteer their time for this initiative.

To further social equity, we are

partnering with local communities

near our manufacturing locations.

During FY 2022-23, Thermax

Foundation collaborated with NGOs

such as Lokbharati and Manavlok,

along with like-minded corporates, to

provide skill development programmes

for youth and capacity-building

initiatives for farmers respectively.

We also continue our support

towards school education and the

alumni programme at The Akanksha

Foundation and iTeach. I’d like to

express my heartfelt appreciation

and commend our NGO partners, the

CSR team and the local support from

our employees, for their unwavering

efforts in making a positive impact on

people’s lives.

Last year we put together a Diversity,

Equity, and Inclusion strategy,

focussing on four pillars: enhancing

diversity representation, nurturing and

sponsoring talent, fostering mindset

change, and promoting openness

and inclusiveness in the workplace.

We’ve taken some baby steps in

hiring more women in leadership

roles as well as on the shop floor and

a few differently-abled individuals in

our workforce. We aim to double the

women working with Thermax within

the next three years.

Through our ethical and inclusive

corporate governance practices,

which form an integral part of

our Environmental, Social, and

Governance (ESG) framework, we aim

to add value to all our stakeholders

and successfully fulfil our long-term

business objectives. Once again, my

heartfelt gratitude and appreciation

to every stakeholder who has and

continues to partner with us on

this journey. We thank you for your

ongoing trust and support.

Warmly,

Meher Pudumjee

Chairperson

I am delighted that our own

workers in Pune have come

forward to volunteer their time

for this initiative.

In an ever-evolving technology environment,

no company can work in isolation.

Partnerships across the ecosystem are crucial to

success, and Thermax is well-positioned to be a

trusted partner in its customers’

energy transition journey.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended March 31, 2023

(All amounts are in Rupees Crore, except per share data and unless stated otherwise)

1. Corporate Information

Thermax Limited (‘the Holding Company’ or ‘the

Company”), its subsidiaries and its associates

(together referred to as ‘the Group’) is a leading

energy and environment solutions provider.

The Group’s portfolio includes boilers and heaters,

absorption chillers/ heat pumps, power plants, solar

equipment, air pollution control equipment/system,

water and waste recycle plant, ion exchange resins

and performance chemicals and related services.

The Holding Company is a public limited company

incorporated and domiciled in India. It is listed on

the BSE Limited (BSE) and National Stock Exchange

Limited (NSE) in India. The address of its registered

office is D-13, MIDC Industrial Area, R.D. Aga Road,

Chinchwad, Pune- 411019, India. The Board of

Directors have authorised to issue these financial

statements on May 17, 2023. The CIN of the Company

is L29299PN1980PLC022787.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

2.1. Basis of preparation, measurement and

consolidation

(a) Basis of preparation

These consolidated financial statements have

been prepared in accordance with the Indian

Accounting Standards (Ind AS), notified under

the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to time)

and presentation requirements of Division II of

Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act)

(as amended) as applicable.

The preparation of the consolidated financial

statements requires the use of certain critical

accounting judgements, estimates and

assumptions. It also requires the management to

exercise judgment in the process of applying the

Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a

higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas

where assumptions and estimates are significant

to the consolidated financial statements are

disclosed in note 3.

The accounting policies adopted for preparation

and presentation of these consolidated financial

statements have been consistently applied except

for changes resulting from amendments to Ind

AS issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs,

effective for financial years beginning on or after

April 1, 2022 as disclosed in note 2.2.

(b) Basis of measurement

The consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on the accrual and going concern

basis under historical cost convention except the

following:

• Derivative financial instruments;

• Certain financial assets and liabilities measured

at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding

financial instruments); and

• Defined benefit plans whereby the plan assets

are measured at fair value.

(c) Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise

the financial statements of the Holding Company,

its subsidiaries and its associates as at March 31,

2023. Control is achieved when the Group is

exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its

involvement with the investee and has the ability

to affect those returns through its power over

the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an

investee if and only if the Group has:

• Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that

give it the current ability to direct the relevant

activities of the investee);

• Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its

involvement with the investee, and

• The ability to use its power over the investee to

affect its returns.

There is a presumption that a majority of

voting rights result in control. To support this

presumption and when the Group has less than

a majority of the voting or similar rights of an

investee, the Group considers all relevant facts

and circumstances in assessing whether it has

power over an investee, including:

• The contractual arrangement with the other

vote holders of the investee;

Executive Officer as the chief operating decision

maker of the Group.

x. Contingent liabilities

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made

where there is a possible obligation that arises

from past events and the existence of which

will be confirmed only by the occurrence or

non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future

events not wholly within the control of the Group

or a present obligation that arises from the past

events where it is either not probable that an

outflow of resources will be required to settle the

obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount

cannot be made.

y. Earnings Per Share (EPS)

The Group presents the basic and diluted EPS

data for its equity shares. Basic EPS is computed

by dividing the net profit for the year attributable

to the equity shareholders of the Parent by the

weighted average number of equity shares

outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is

computed by adjusting the net profit for the

year attributable to the equity shareholders and

the weighted average number of equity shares

considered for deriving basic EPS for the effects

of all the equity shares that could have been

issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential

equity shares (which includes the various stock

options granted to employees).

z. Dividends

Dividend to equity shareholders is recognised

as a liability in the period in which the dividends

are approved by the equity shareholders.

Interim dividends that are declared by the

Board of Directors without the need for equity

shareholders’ approvals are recognised as a

Claims against the Group not acknowledged as debt*

209.63

209.68

The timing and amount of the cash flow which will arise from these matters, will be determined by the relevant

authorities on settlement of the cases or on receipt of claims from customers.

*Claims against the Group not acknowledged as debt on account of ongoing arbitration/ legal dispute with the various customers /

vendors of the Group. Based on the legal opinion on few matters and management assessments of the facts of the case, no provision

against above claim is considered. Pending resolution of the matters, it is not practicable to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any.

e)

There are certain law suits, disputes, warranty claims, etc., including commercial matters that arise from time to time in

the ordinary course of business, the amounts involved in such matters are currently not quantifiable. However, based

on managements assessment under Ind AS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”, that claims

are not tenable / probability of final outcome against the Group is low and therefore not disclosed as contingent

liabilities.

Capital and other commitments

a)

b)

c)

Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed for assets which are to be leased to customers and are

currently under commissioning (net of advances) and not provided for is Rs. 72.43 (March 31, 2022: Rs. 24.01).

d) For lease commitments, refer note 32.

32 Leasing Arrangements

i)

Where the Group is lessor

a) Amounts receivable under Finance lease -

The Group has entered into certain arrangements with its customers where the Group will supply heat/steam/treated

water by installing boiler/heater/water treatment plants at their customers’ premises. The Group has determined, that

fulfilment of these arrangements is dependent on the use of a specific asset and the arrangement conveys a right to

use these specific asset to the customers. Accordingly, these arrangements qualify as arrangements in the form of

lease as specified in Ind-AS 116. Based on the evaluation of terms and conditions of these arrangements, such as the

contract term constituting a major part of the economic life of the specific assets, the fair value of the asset and that it

has transferred the significant risks and rewards in these assets to the customers, these lease arrangements have been

classified as finance leases.

Thermax Limited | Integrated Report 2022-23:

Managing Director and Chief

Executive Officer as the chief operating decision

maker of the Company.

w. Contingent liabilities

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made

where there is a possible obligation that arises

from past events and the existence of which

will be confirmed only by the occurrence or

non-occurrence of one or more uncertain

future events not wholly within the control of the

Company or a present obligation that arises from

the past events where it is either not probable that

an outflow of resources will be required to settle

the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount

cannot be made.

x. Earnings Per Share (EPS)

The Company presents the basic and diluted EPS

data for its equity shares. Basic EPS is computed

by dividing the net profit for the year attributable

to the equity shareholders of the Company by

the weighted average number of equity shares

outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is

computed by adjusting the net profit for the

year attributable to the equity shareholders and

the weighted average number of equity shares

considered for deriving basic EPS for the effects

of all the equity shares that could have been

issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential

equity shares (which includes the various stock

options granted to employees).

y. Dividends

Dividend to equity shareholders is recognised

as a liability in the period in which the dividends

are approved by the equity shareholders.

Interim dividends that are declared by the

Board of Directors without the need for equity

shareholders’ approvals are recognised as a

liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity

in the year in which the dividends are declared by

the Board of Directors.

z. Employee stock option and share based

payments

In respect of stock options granted pursuant

to the Company’s Employee Stock Option

Scheme, the Company recognises employee

compensation expense, using the grant date

fair value in accordance with Ind-AS 102 - Share

Based Payment, on straight line basis over the

period over which the employees would become

unconditionally entitled to apply for the shares.

Employees (senior executives) of the Company

receive remuneration in the form of share-based

payments, whereby employees render services

as consideration for equity instruments

(equity-settled transactions).

Equity-settled transactions

The cost of equity-settled transactions is

determined by the fair value at the date when

the grant is made using an appropriate valuation

model. Further details are given in Note 40.

That cost is recognised, together with a

corresponding increase in share-based

payment (SBP) reserves in equity, over the

period in which the performance and/or service

conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits

expense. The cumulative expense recognised for

equity-settled transactions at each reporting date

until the vesting date reflects the extent to which

the vesting period has expired and the Company’s

best estimate of the number of equity instruments

that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit

in the statement of profit and loss for a period

represents the movement in cumulative expense

recognised as at the beginning and end of that

period and is recognised in employee benefits

expense.

Service and non-market performance conditions

are not taken into account when determining

the grant date fair value of awards, but the

likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed

as part of the Company’s best estimate of

the number of equity instruments that will

ultimately vest. Market performance conditions

are reflected within the grant date fair value.

Any other conditions attached to an award, but

without an associated service requirement,

are considered to be non-vesting conditions.

Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair

value of an award and lead to an immediate

expensing of an award unless there are also

service and/or performance conditions.

Thermax Limited | Integrated Report 2022-23:

Managing Director and CEO,i.e., Chief

Operating Decision Maker. The management

has determined that some of the segments

exhibit similar economic characteristics and

meet other aggregation criteria and accordingly

aggregated into three reportable segments i.e.

industrial products, industrial infra and chemical.

3.2 Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and

other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the

reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing

a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of

assets and liabilities withinthe next financial year, are

described below. The Company based its assumptions

and estimates on parameters available when the

standalone financial statements were prepared.

Existing circumstances and assumptions about future

developments, however, may change due to market

changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the

control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in

the assumptions when they occur.

Estimation of uncertainties relating to the

global health pandemic from the Coronavirus

disease (COVID-19):

The Company has considered the possible effects that

may result from the pandemic relating to COVID-19 on

the carrying amounts of its assets such as investments,

loans, receivables, unbilled revenues and inventories.

In developing the assumptions relating to the possible

future uncertainties in the global economic conditions

because of this pandemic, the Company, as at the

date of approval of these financial statements has used

internal and external sources of information including

credit reports and related information, economic

forecasts and consensus estimates from market

sources on the expected future performance of the

Company. The Company has performed sensitivity

analysis on the assumptions used and based on

current estimates expects the carrying amount of these

assets will be recovered. The impact of COVID-19 on

the Company’s financial statements may differ from

that estimated as at the date of approval of these

standalone financial statements.

i.

EPC contracts:

• Provisions for liquidated damages claims (LDs):

The Company provides for LD claims to the

extent that it is highly probable that a significant

reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue

recognised will not occur when the uncertainty

associated with the variable consideration

is subsequently resolved. This requires an

estimate of the amount of LDs payable under a

claim which involves a number of management

judgments and assumptions regarding the

amounts to be recognised.

• Project cost to complete estimates: At each

reporting date, the Company is required to

estimate costs to complete on fixed-price

contracts. Estimating costs to complete on

such contracts requires the Company to make

estimates of future costs to be incurred, based

on work to be performed beyond the reporting

date. This estimate will impact revenues, cost

of sales, work-in-progress, billings in excess

of costs, estimated earnings and accrued

contract expenses.

• Recognition of contract variations:

The Company recognises revenues and

margins from contract variations where it

is considered probable that they will be

awarded by the customer and this requires

management to assess the likelihood of

such an award being made by reference to
