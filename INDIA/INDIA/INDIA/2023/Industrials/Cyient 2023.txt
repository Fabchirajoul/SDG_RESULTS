Dear Shareholders,

Cyient had a very good Financial Year2022/23. The

company has grown its business despite declining

economic trends across the world, has built new

capabilities, enhanced product and service offerings,

and widened its geographical footprint. With the

pandemic having receded in most parts of the world,

Cyient has also found new ways of hybrid working,

explored new avenues, and met fresh challenges. It has

been a year of both consolidation and discovering new

horizons.

Cyient’s financial performance during the year under

review has been consistent and positive in terms of

growth and profitability. This has been possible due

to good leadership and a focused team effort across

all company parts, subsidiaries, and associates. The

Board has recommended the highest dividend thus far

in Cyient’s history. Good governance and openness to

embracing good industry practices and taking the lead

in many areas continue to build the company’s strength

and have been the hallmark of the year’s activity. The

relentless focus on large orders and offering design-led

manufacturing solutions have resulted in a good order

book as we start the year ahead.

MESSAGE FROM

THE NON–EXECUTIVE

CHAIRMAN

MM Murugappan

Non-Executive Chairman:

Managing Director. Krishna will

continue to lead the company’s strategic initiatives.

Mr.Karthikeyan Natarajan moves to the position of

Chief Executive Officer while continuing as an Executive

Director of the company. I wish Krishna and Karthik the

very best in their new roles. After serving Cyient for

over a decade as the Chief Financial Officer and as a

member of the Board, Mr.Ajay Aggarwal retired in April

2023. Ajay’s contributions to the company have been

immense. I thank him for his dedication and diligence

and wish him a restful and rewarding retirement.

Mr.Prabhakar Atla, who headed the Aerospace, Rail, and

Communications business, succeeded Ajay as the CFO.

He brings a wide and varied business perspective to the

role. I wish Prabhakar all success.

My colleagues on the Board have been a great strength

and support to the company and me. I thank them for

emphasizing business performance and shareholder

returns, providing a strategic direction while ensuring

diversity and inclusion, and thus enhancing principles

of good governance. Members of the Board have been

generous with their time and encouragement to the

leadership and management of the company. Our

Founder Chairman, Dr. BVR Mohan Reddy’s, continued

presence on the Board provides the company

continuity, stability, and inspiration. My thanks to my

colleagues on the Board for their support and counsel.

Cyient has always put its people first, along with its

core values. This has resulted in the company being

selected and certified as “A Great Place To Work” in

India. This reflects the continued emphasis on creating

a responsible and equitable workplace through

diversity and inclusion. My congratulations to the

teams at Cyient for having gained this prestigious

recognition. This pursuit of excellence enables Cyient

to accelerate toward technology convergence in a

rapidly changing world while being rooted in its core

values and being a globally responsible organization.

We value your unstinted support and are grateful for

your involvement and encouragement.

Sincerely Yours,

M M Murugappan

Non-Executive Chairman:

Dear Shareholders,

As I look back on this year, I am proud of the milestones

Cyient has achieved. We have made significant

progress in growing our capabilities, accelerating the

adoption of technology solutions, and enabling our

associates to deliver on our ambitious long-term goals.

This year, we expanded Cyient’s capabilities in new

markets with the acquisitions of Citec and Celfinet.

These key acquisitions strengthened our sustainability

and connectivity offerings to our customers.

Citec was the largest outbound acquisition by an Indian

engineering services company and Cyient’s largest

acquisition to date, demonstrating our ambition to

proactively address the sustainability market. Citec is

a leader in Plant and Product engineering services with

customers across the energy, process, oil, gas, and

manufacturing industries. The combined portfolio will

position Cyient as one of the largest independent plant

engineering firms globally.

The acquisition of Celfinet strengthens our position

to be a technology partner with the world’s leading

Communication Services Providers (CSP) with end-to-

end network planning in the rollout of 5G.

on the DRHP on 29 March 2023..

In June 2022, the company acquired Celfient – Consultoria Em Telecomunicacoes, SA, a Portugal based company through

Cyient Europe Limited, its wholly owned subsidiary.:

Managing Director – Board relations;

By focusing on the board as a team and on its overall performance, the Company ensures that communication and

overall level of participation and engagement also improves.

In order to facilitate the same, the board undertook a formal board assessment and evaluation process during 2022-23.

The board evaluation was performed after seeking inputs from all the directors and included criteria such as the board

composition and structure, effectiveness of board processes, information and functioning as provided by the Guidance

Note on Board Evaluation issued by the SEBI on 5 January 2017.

The Leadership, Nomination & Remuneration Committee has overall stewardship for the process. The evaluation

process covers the following aspects:

Peer and self-evaluation of Directors;

•

Evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the board;

•

Evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of Board Committees;

•

Evaluation of the performance of the Non-Executive Chairman;

•

Evaluation of the performance of the MD & CEO

•

The evaluation process elicits responses from the directors in a judicious manner - ranging from composition and

induction of the board to effectiveness and governance. It also sought feedback on board and committee charters,

strategy, risk management and quality of discussion and deliberations at the board. The evaluation process also ensures

the fulfilment of independence criteria as specified in the applicable regulations and that the latter are independent of

letter of appointment issued to the non-executive directors states the time the non-executive director will be required

to spend on the company’s business, and indicates the possibility of additional time commitment when the company is

undergoing a period of particularly increased activity, such as in the case of an acquisition or takeover.

As part of the process of learning more about the business and of becoming effective boardroom contributors in the

company, non-executive directors - supported by the chair and CEO - build recognition among executive directors of

their contribution in order to promote mutual respect. This, in turn, allows them to support executive directors in their

management of the business while monitoring their conduct.

Non-executive directors maintain confidence in the governance of the company by upholding high standards of integrity

and probity, and supporting the chair and executive directors in the embedding of the appropriate culture, values and

behaviours in the boardroom and beyond.

Because of the importance of the process of decision making to the work of the board, non-executive directors insist on

accurate, clear and comprehensive information being provided sufficiently in advance to enable thorough consideration of

the issues prior to, and informed debate and challenge at, board meetings.:

who evaluates Company’s performance and allocates

resources based on analysis of various performance

indicators by business verticals and geographical

segmentation of customers. The Company has only

one reportable business segment, which is rendering

of Services. Segment information has been presented

in the consolidated financial statements in accordance

with Ind AS 108 ‘Operating Segments’ notified under

the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015.

2.20 Financial instruments

(A) Initial recognition

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised

when a Company becomes a party to the contractual

provisions of the instruments. Financial assets and

financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value

and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair

value through other comprehensive income (‘FVTOCI’)

and fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’). The

classification of financial assets at initial recognition

depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow

characteristics and the Company’s business model for

managing them. With the exception of trade receivables

that do not contain a significant financing component

or for which the Company has applied the practical

expedient, the Company initially measures a financial

asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset

not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.

Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition

of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are

recognised immediately in the statement of profit and

loss. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant

financing component or for which the Company has

applied the practical expedient are measured at the

transaction price determined under Ind AS 115. Refer to

the accounting policies for revenue in note 2.13.

(B) Subsequent measurement

a. Non-derivative financial instruments

i) Financial assets carried at amortised cost: A financial

asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is

held within a business model whose objective is to hold

the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and

the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on

specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments

of principal and interest on the principal amount

outstanding.

ii) Financial assets at FVTOCI: A financial asset is

subsequently measured at FVTOCI if it is held within

a business model whose objective is achieved by both

collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial

assets and the contractual terms of the financial

asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that

are solely payments of principal and interest on the

principal amount outstanding. The Company has

made an irrevocable election for its investments which

are classified as equity instruments to present the

subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive

income based on its business model.

iii) Financial assets at FVTPL: Financial assets which

are not classified in any of the above categories are

subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.

iv) Financial liabilities: Financial liabilities are subsequently

carried at amortised cost using the effective interest:

Managing Director who

evaluates Group’s performance and allocates resources

based on analysis of various performance indicators

by business verticals and geographical segmentation

of customers. Refer note 30 for operating segment

information.

2.23 Financial instruments

(A) Initial recognition

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised

when a Group becomes a party to the contractual

provisions of the instruments. Financial assets and

financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value

and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair

value through other comprehensive income (‘FVTOCI’)

and fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’). The

classification of financial assets at initial recognition

depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow

characteristics and the Group’s business model for

managing them. With the exception of trade receivables

that do not contain a significant financing component or

for which the Group has applied the practical expedient,

the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair

value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value

through profit or loss, transaction costs. Transaction

costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial

assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognised

immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and

loss. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant

financing component or for which the Group has applied

the practical expedient are measured at the transaction

price determined under Ind AS 115. Refer to the

accounting policies for revenue in note 2.16.

(B) Subsequent measurement

a. Non-derivative financial instruments

i) Financial assets carried at amortised cost: A financial

asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is:

Managing Director who evaluates

Group’s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business verticals

and geographical segmentation of customers.

The Group has identified business segments as its primary segment and geographic segments as its secondary segment.

Geographic segments of the Group are North America, Europe and Asia Pacific (‘APAC’).

The CODM reviews the business as two operating segments - Services and Design Led Manufacturing (‘DLM’), and in

accordance with the core principles of Ind AS 108 ‘Operating Segments’, these have been considered as the reportable

segments of the Group.

Effective April 1, 2022, the Group has re-organised its business units within the services segment into ARC (Aero, Rail &

Communication), MEU (Mining Energy & Utilities) and NGA (New Growth Areas such as HiTech, Automotive, Semicon and

Medical Technologies) while the Digital, Embedded Solutions are across all the Business Units. The DLM segment is engaged

in providing electronic manufacturing solutions predominantly in the fields of ARC, Energy and Medical Technologies as well

as Digital Services & Solutions.

The DLM segment includes Cyient DLM Limited (formerly Cyient DLM Private Limited), Cyient Solutions and Systems Private

Limited and Aerospace Tooling and Parts division of Cyient Defense Services Inc., USA.

The accounting policies adopted for segment reporting are in line with the accounting policies of the Group. Segment

revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities have been identified to segments on the basis of their relationship to the operating

activities of the segment.

Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities which relate to the Group as a whole and are not allocable to segments on reasonable

basis have been included under “unallocable revenue /expenses /assets /liabilities”.:

Voluntarily obtained a rating of CGR 2+ from ICRA for corporate governance practices:

letter, duly signed by the first holder, stating the new address and folio numbers of the shares

you own to our R & T agents. An acknowledgement will be sent to your new address confirming the up-dation of the change in

our records.

In the case of dematerialized holdings, please write to your Depository Participant (DP) intimating them of the change and ask for

a confirmation that their records reflect the new address.

If dividend cheque is lost/was never received/has expired, how to get a fresh cheque re-issued?

Please write to our R&T Agent, with details of folio numbers (in the case of physical holdings) or the DP ID and Client ID in the case

of dematerialized holdings. After verification, they will issue a fresh instrument.

To avoid this problem in the future, you can use the ECS facility in which the dividend amount is automatically credited to the bank

account of your choice. To avail of this facility, give your request to our R&T agent in writing.

Also, you might consider dematerializing your holdings through a Depository Participant. This would not only eliminate the issues

of storage and risk of loss of paper certificates but also ensure automatic crediting of dividends to your bank account.

How does a shareholder re-claim the shares and/or unclaimed dividend transferred to IEPF?

Such shareholders may make an application to the IEPF Authority in Form No. IEPF-5 available on www.iepf.gov.in online and send

a physical copy of the same duly signed to the R&T Agent along with requisite documents enumerated in the Form No. IEPF-5.

No claims shall lie against the company in respect of the dividend/shares so transferred to the IEPF.:
