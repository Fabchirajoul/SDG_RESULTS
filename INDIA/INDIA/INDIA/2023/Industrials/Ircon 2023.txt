For The Year Ended 31st March 2023

Directors in their meeting held on 24th May 2023.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

2.1 2.1 Basis of preparation

The financial statements of the Group have been

prepared in accordance with accounting principles

generally accepted in India, including the Indian

Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under section

133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together

with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to

time) and presentation requirements of Division II

of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS

compliant Schedule III), as applicable to the financial

statements.

The financial statements have been prepared on a

going concern basis following accrual system of

accounting. The Group has adopted the historical

cost basis for assets and liabilities, except for the

following assets and liabilities which have been

measured at fair value:

●

Provisions, where the effect of time value of money is

material are measured at present value

●

Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair

value

●

Defined benefit plans and other long-term employee

benefits

Basis of Consolidation

a)

The consolidated financial statements comprise

the financial statements of the Group as at 31

March 2023. Control is achieved when the Group is

exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its

involvement with the investee and has the ability

to affect those returns through its power over the

investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee

if and only if the Group has:

●

Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give

it the current ability to direct the relevant activities

of the investee)

●

Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its

involvement with the investee, and

The ability to use its power over the investee to

affect its returns

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority

of voting rights result in control. To support this

presumption and when the Group has less than

a majority of the voting or similar rights of an

investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and

circumstances in assessing whether it has power

over an investee, including:

●

The contractual arrangement with the other vote

holders of the investee.

●

Rights arising from other contractual arrangements.

●

The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.

●

The size of the group’s holding of voting rights

relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings of

the other voting rights holders.

b) The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an

investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there

are changes to one or more of the three elements

of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins

when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary

and ceases when the Group loses control of the

subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of

a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year

are included in the consolidated financial statements

from the date the Group gains control until the date

the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

c)

Consolidated financial statements are prepared using

uniform accounting policies for like transactions and:

letter No. 2011/LMB/22/1/39 dated 18.10.2021 had communicated ‘in-principle’ decision for closure

I, on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, have conducted a supplementary audit of the consolidated

Section 129(4) of the Act. We conducted a supplementary audit of the financial statements of subsidiaries (as per
