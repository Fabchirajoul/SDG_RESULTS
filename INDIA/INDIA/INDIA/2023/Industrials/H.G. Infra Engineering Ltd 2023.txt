Managing Director of the Company has been identified as CODM and he assesses the financial performance

and position of the Company, and makes strategic decisions. Refer note 41 for segment information.

E. Foreign currency translation

(i)

Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the Standalone financial statements of the entity are measured using the currency of the primary economic

environment in which the entity operates (`the functional currency’). The Standalone financial statements are presented in

Indian rupee, which is Companies functional and presentation currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the

transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation

of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognized in

Standalone Statement of profit and loss.

F.

Revenue recognition

The Company derives revenue principally from following streams:

•

Construction contracts

•

Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)

(i)

Construction contracts

The Company recognises revenue from engineering, procurement and construction contracts (‘EPC’) over the period of time,

as performance obligations are satisfied over time due to continuous transfer of control to the customer. EPC contracts are

generally accounted for as a single performance obligation as it involves complex integration of goods and services.

The performance obligations are satisfied over time as the work progresses. The Company recognises revenue using input

method (i.e percentage-of-completion method), based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated

contract costs. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recognised in the period in which they are determined as

assessed at the contract level. If the consideration in the contract includes price variation clause or there are amendments in

contracts, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for work performed.

Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the performance obligations, the estimation of total

revenue and cost of completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Variability in the

transaction price arises primarily due to liquidated damages, price variation clauses, changes in scope, incentives, if any. The

Company considers its experience with similar transactions and expectations regarding the contract in estimating the amount

of variable consideration to which it will be entitled and determining whether the estimated variable consideration should be

constrained. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant

reversal of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration

is resolved. The estimates of variable consideration are based largely on an assessment of anticipated performance and all

information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available.:

Managing Director of the Holding Company has been identified as CODM and he assesses the financial performance

and position of the Holding Company, and makes strategic decisions. Refer Note 41 for segment information presented.

E. Foreign currency translation

(i)

Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic

environment in which the entity operates (`the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in

Indian rupee, which is Holding Company’s functional and presentation currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the

transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation

of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognized in

Consolidated Statement profit or loss.

F.

Revenue recognition

The Group derives revenue principally from following streams:

•

Construction contracts

•

Service concession arrangement

•

Sale of Services (Operation and Maintenance contracts)

(i)

Construction contracts

The Group recognises revenue from engineering, procurement and construction contracts (‘EPC’) over the period of time,

as performance obligations are satisfied over time due to continuous transfer of control to the customer. EPC contracts are

generally accounted for as a single performance obligation as it involves complex integration of goods and services.

The performance obligations are satisfied over time as the work progresses. The Group recognises revenue using input method

(i.e percentage-of-completion method), based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated

contract costs. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recognised in the period in which they are determined as

assessed at the contract level. If the consideration in the contract includes price variation clause or there are amendments in

contracts, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for work performed.

Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the performance obligations, the estimation of total

revenue and cost of completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Variability in the

transaction price arises primarily due to liquidated damages, price variation clauses, changes in scope, incentives, if any. The

Group considers its experience with similar transactions and expectations regarding the contract in estimating the amount

of variable consideration to which it will be entitled and determining whether the estimated variable consideration should

be constrained. The Group includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant

reversal of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration

is resolved. The estimates of variable consideration are based largely on an assessment of anticipated performance and all

information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available.

Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of the work as stipulated in the contract. Billing

terms of the over-time contracts vary but are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The difference between the

timing of revenue recognised and customer billings result in changes to contract assets and contract liabilities. Payment is

generally due upon receipt of the invoice, payable within 90 days or less. Contractual retention amounts billed to customers

are generally due upon expiration of the contract period.:

letter of credit, guarantee including contractor

guarantees and liquidated damages and under all insurance contracts.

Note 57

As at March 31, 2023, the 10 subsidiary companies in the Group (the ""SPVs"") have assessed their collection plan (which is contractually

recoverable from the respective customers In next 12 months for the work already done upto the reporting date and recognised as

revenues in the books) and accordingly, classified the financial asset, related to ""Receivables under service concession agreement with

National Highway Authorities of India"", between current and non-current assets. Whereas as at March 31, 2022, the SPVs classified

their financial asset based on anticipated collections in next 12 months (pertaining to work already done upto March 31, 2022 as well

as expected work to be delivered in next 12 months) resulting into misclassification between current financial assets and non-current

financial assets as at March 31, 2022. Due to this, the SPVs have restated the current financial assets and non-current financial assets

considering the expected collections in next 12 months from March 31, 2022 pertaining to the work done and corresponding revenues

recognised by then only.

Furthermore, while there is no impact of the said reclassification on the Consolidated Statement of Profit and loss for the year ended

March 31, 2022 and Total Equity of the Group as at March 31, 2022 and April 1, 2021 respectively, the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at

April 1, 2021 has also been restated to correct the Impact of aforementioned reclassification.
