Managing Director’s Message: Dear Stakeholders,

It gives me great pleasure to share

the Annual Report for the financial

year 2022-23, which has been a

milestone year in the history of Jupiter

Wagons Limited.

As all of you are aware, we successfully

concluded the merger of Jupiter

Wagons and erstwhile CEBBCO, and

the combined entity has been listed on

the stock exchange as Jupiter Wagons

Limited. This merger has resulted in a

synergistic consolidation of operations,

bringing together the strengths of both

companies. With enhanced financial

and infrastructure capabilities, your

Company can now leverage the joint

resources more effectively.

In its relentless pursuit of becoming

a prominent player for mobility

solutions, Jupiter Wagons continues to

fortify its offerings. In addition to its

product range for the railway sector

comprising railway wagons, high-

together bogies, couplers, draft gears,

and cast manganese steel crossings;

it also offers ISO and specialised

containers for marine transport. By

reviving the operations under CEBBCO,

your Company has reclaimed the

position as a supplier of load bodies

to leading commercial vehicle OEMs

in India. It is set to launch further

offerings in the area of brake systems,

brake discs and electric LCVs.

By integrating these diverse

competencies, we have positioned

ourselves to effectively address

the evolving needs of the mobility

sector while maintaining a resilient

market presence. This holistic

approach reflects our commitment to

adaptability and sustained growth,

enabling us to navigate the dynamic

landscape of the industry and seize

opportunities for success.

With the rapid scaling of opportunities

in India, driven by increased

infrastructure investments, the

prospects for growth are flourishing.

The Union Budget of 2023 included

an allocation of ₹ 2.5 lakh crores for

the Indian Railways, surpassing the

previous year's budgetary provisions.

This substantial investment aims

to facilitate the development of

top-tier railway infrastructure,

materially scale railway operations

while bringing about significant

advancements and improvements in

passenger services.

The increased budgetary allocation

reflects the government's commitment

to transforming the Indian Railways

into a world-class system. By

effectively utilising these funds,

the railways will be able to make

remarkable strides in achieving

their target of transporting 3 billion

tonnes of freight by the year 2040.

This unprecedented financial support

The current orderbook

for Jupiter Wagons

Limited (JWL) as of

FY23 stands at

₹ 58,20,000 lakhs of

which the orderbook for

wagons is ~₹ 50,00,000

lakhs. Compared to

the annual revenues of

₹ 2,06,825 lakhs in FY23,

this provides significant

visibility for the next

3 years.

CORPORATE SNAPSHOT

29:

letter and spirit are the pillars

of the business practices.

The driving forces of corporate governance are its

core values – excellence and customer satisfaction,

maximising long- term value for stakeholders, good

corporate conduct and environment-friendly behavior.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The management and members of the Board review the

business periodically to identify ongoing factors that

affect the business and also changes in the external

environment, which are likely to impact the Company.

The management has foreseen certain risks and took

steps to mitigate the risks. The following are the key

risks and the mitigation approach.

Dependence on Railways: IR being the major customer

for Wagons, any adverse impact on budget allocation

of Railways will impact the order flow. The Company

has mitigated this risk partly by developing wagons for

private operators.

Cyclicality of the commercial vehicle industry - The

demand for heavy vehicles is closely linked to overall

industrial growth and is vulnerable to cyclicality in the

commercial vehicle industry. In addition to rationalising

the production capacities (as already mentioned), the

Company is focusing on increasing the revenue from

other businesses such as wagons, heavy fabrication for

power plant, water tankers, load bodies for automotive

vehicle used by defense and Containers.

Delay in execution of orders: Delays in execution of orders

(particularly orders obtained through competitive tenders)

can have a negative impact on profitability. The Company

continues to monitor closely the execution of orders.

Raw material costs – Steel accounts for a major portion

of the raw material costs. The Company has centralised

the steel procurement function with the objective

of leveraging the volumes to get better prices and is

focusing on other cost control measures. Fluctuation

in the foreign currency will adversely effect on import

price of raw material components

Competition – The Company depends on load body

business from certain OEM customers. These OEMs

have developed more than one supplier to minimise

their risk. There is a risk of change in OEM policy of with

reference to suppliers. The Company follows a policy of

working closely with select OEMs to enhance its share

of business. Further, the Company continues to focus on

orders from certain dealers.

Increase in interest rate/cost: Any increase in interest

rate will adversely affect the Company. The Company is

exploring ways and means to tighten its working capital

in order lower working capital finance.

INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

The Company has an established and comprehensive

internal control mechanism and management structure

in place across all locations and business functions that

ensure the Company’s assets are safeguarded against all

and any loss from unauthorised use or disposal.

The documentation of Internal Control over Financial

Reporting is in place and the management has

undertaken an effectiveness test of the system.

Internal Control systems are implemented:

a)

To safeguard the Company’s assets from loss

or damage.

b)

To keep constant check on cost structure and

process loss.

c)

To provide adequate financial and accounting

controls for preparation and reporting of financial

performance and state of affairs, in accordance with

Accounting Standards.

d)

To maintain proper accounting record and

statutory compliances.

The systematic implementation of Internal Control

Systems and policies has resulted in the use of funds in

the most efficient and appropriate manner.

The Company has assigned the internal audit to a leading

auditing firm. The internal audits are reviewed by the

Audit Committee including implementation status of
