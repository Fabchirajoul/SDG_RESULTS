Dear Shareholders,

FROM THE

CHAIRMAN’S DESK

We are growing. With strong

fundamentals, solid financial

discipline & greater customer focus

we have become a much stronger

force in the market place

Last year, we took significant steps into the

urban market (Plumbing & Sanitation), while

simultaneously strengthening our reputation

in the agricultural sector. With a strong belief

in our capabilities, a strengthened talent force,

and focused initiatives to build our brand, I am

confident that we will turn these steps into

great strides going forward.

All the plans we have put in place, each and

every person on our team, every decision

taken so far, the backward and forward

integration, the customer centric moves -

everything now puts us on the cusp of the

next big shift in our collective fortunes. Yes,

collective. As our beloved founder, Late Shri

Pralhad Chhabria kept reminding us - we

can move forward, only if we carry each and

every member of our large, extended Parivaar

forward along with us, to progress & prosper.

This is exactly the theme for this year’s Annual

Report - 'Universal language of prosperity'.

Wherever they may live in India, whatever

their language, Indians have the same word

for reliability - Finolex. Which translates into

prosperity for each of them.

This is not just true for the present, but also our

vision for the future. We have put plans and

systems in place to ensure that we are a household

name & we earn the confidence of people across

the length and breadth of our great country.

This year's annual report speaks of this, but in

the language of growing numbers.

For us, prosperity goes beyond these numbers. It

includes our contribution towards supporting the

underprivileged & creating social well-being. It is

a combination of dignity, respect, joy, abundance,

good health, and everything else that contributes

to the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual

well-being of an individual, family, community

and their environment.

This is only possible when we take personal

accountability for the success and prosperity

of our customers by relentlessly pushing for

quality in order to ably support their dreams

and ambitions. This happens when we push

for prosperity amongst our family of channel

partners & are fair with vendors, suppliers,

agencies, employees & associates. When one

of our stakeholders moves ahead in life, we

can then honestly claim progress for ourselves.
