Employees, and covers fixed and variable components.

Long-term incentives are envisaged for the Management

and key talent to bind their performance to the company’s

long-term sustainability. These are in the form of Employee

Stock Option Scheme (ESOS) with staggered vesting or

performance-linked deferred cash with payouts in multiple

tranches linked to the Company’s performance. The annual

variable pay approach links to business, financial and non-

model by linking individual performance to the Company’s

achievements, particularly with respect to environmental

measures, inclusion and diversity matters, and overall human

capital governance.
