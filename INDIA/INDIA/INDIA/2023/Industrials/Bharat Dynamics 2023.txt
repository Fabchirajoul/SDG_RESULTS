Despite the operational and supply chain disruptions caused by the current global scenario, BDL’s performance throughout the

company.

The Government of India’s initiatives to make India self-reliant in providing state-of-the-art weapon systems to the Indian Armed

Forces and clearance for export to Friendly Foreign Countries (FFCs) have opened plenty of opportunities for BDL to grow and expand

I am extremely pleased to inform you that BDL continues to maintain a consistent dividend payment. Your Board has recommended

a final dividend of ₹1.20 per equity share of ₹10 each, amounting to ₹21.99 crore. It also gives me great pleasure to inform you that

BDL has already paid an interim dividend of ₹8.15 per share in February 2023. The total dividend for FY 2022–23 declared by the
