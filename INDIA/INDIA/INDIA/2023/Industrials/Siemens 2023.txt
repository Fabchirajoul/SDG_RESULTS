Chairman's Statement: Dear Shareholders,

The financial year 2021-22 was a volatile period for the global economy. While it started with

optimism, with the economy opening up, consumption rising and production back to normal

levels, developments on the geo-political and macro-economic fronts led to uncertainty.

Speculation of a looming recession and slowing growth emerged as a result of inflation,

material shortages, supply chain issues and most central banks around the world raising

interest rates.

In such a scenario, the Indian economy remained resilient and continued growing. Business

sentiment too was strong, as seen in increased domestic demand and consumption, aided

by both public and private capital expenditure. The Central Government has been consistent

in its policies and measures to maintain higher capital expenditure while also supporting

the State Governments to follow suit. It is imperative that the core sectors and the small

and medium enterprises (SMEs) continue to get capital investments to drive steady, all-round

economic growth.

The resilience of all the businesses, which did remarkably well, is evidence of the Company’s strong performance in Revenues,

New Orders as well as Net Profits. With its wide-ranging portfolio, market-oriented organization structure, technology leadership

and strong local competence, the Company is in a good position to partner with the country in its sustainable growth.

Financial Performance – Highlights

For the financial year 2022, the Company received New Orders valued at ` 194,221 million, a 43.1 percent increase over

` 135,709 million in the financial year 2021. The Order Backlog as of 30th September 2022 stood at ` 171,830 million. Sales

(excluding other operating revenues) were up by 18.3 percent to ` 145,881 million, compared to ` 123,280 million in the

previous financial year.

Profits from Operations stood at ` 13,974 million compared to ` 12,061 million in the previous financial year. The Company’s

Profit before Tax stood at ` 16,802 million compared to ` 14,055 million in the previous financial year, an increase of

19.5 percent. The Profit after Tax for the financial year was ` 12,497 million, an increase by 19.7 percent compared to

` 10,440 million in the previous financial year. The Board of

Chairman's Statement:

Dear Member(s),

Sub.: Green Initiative - Electronic mode of service of documents

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) has allowed paperless compliances by companies through electronic mode by

providing the same under the Companies Act, 2013 and rules framed thereunder. The Members can receive various notices

and correspondences including Annual Reports i.e. Audited Financial Statements, Directors’ Report, Auditors’ Report, etc.,

through electronic mode (e-mail). The initiative taken by the MCA is a welcome move for the society at large, as this will reduce

paper consumption to a great extent, ensure prompt receipt of communication and avoid loss of document in postal transit.

We are sure that you will whole-heartedly support this initiative for a greener environment and co-operate with the Company

to make it a success. We therefore request you to fill up the E-communication Registration Form below, for registering your

e-mail ID as under:
