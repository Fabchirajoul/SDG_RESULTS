To consider & approve Grant of options to

employees of subsidiary company(ies), under

the Employee Stock Option Scheme, 2013 and to

create further number of options for grant under

the existing Employee Stock Option Scheme of

the Company

The Company had implemented Employee Stock Option

Scheme in the year 2013 (‘Scheme’) in accordance with

the provisions of erstwhile SEBI (Employee Stock Option

Scheme and Employee Stock Purchase Scheme) Guidelines,

1999, to grant stock options to the employees. The

scheme is administered by Nomination and Remuneration

Committee and options were granted to eligible employees

as part of their compensation structure, from time to time.

Subsequently the Scheme was amended from time to

time to increase the number of options for new grants to

existing and new employees. The Shareholders approved

the amendments at the 20th Annual General Meeting held

on July 26, 2016 and on April 30, 2017, December 09,

2017 through Postal Ballot process and at the 24th Annual

General Meeting held on August 12, 2020 to increase the

pool of options available for grant.

Equity based compensation is considered to be an integral

part of employee compensation across sectors which

enables alignment of personal goals of the employees with

organizational objectives by participating in the ownership

of the Company through stock-based compensation

scheme.

Considering the nature of the industry, the long-term

incentives being offered to the employees of the Company

mainly consist of Options. The Company is on a growth path

and has aggressive business plans for the next few years.

To support these plans, the current number of available

Options for new grants is estimated to be insufficient

over the next three to five years. Given this background,

it is proposed to increase the total Options reserve by:

Message from the Chairman

Message from the: Managing

Message from the Chairman: Dear Shareholders

I am happy to share with

you the key highlights of

the journey that V-Guard

traversed in FY23. In

keeping with our growth

and expansion goals,

we achieved significant

milestones. It was a

year of sluggish demand

because general inflation

kept consumer confidence

down and interest rate

increases led to a general

tightening of the market.

Despite these headwinds, I

am pleased to report that

V-Guard delivered a healthy

performance with double-

digit revenue growth across

all of its business divisions.

Post Covid-19, the global economic

recovery has been slow. High inflation,

rising debt, geo-political tensions

and wide scale layoffs are some of

the headwinds that have impacted

growth. The year has also witnessed

the rise of India as one of the world’s

fastest-growing major economies.

India has emerged as a beacon

of progress and opportunity. The

country’s vibrant and diverse

market, coupled with a thriving

entrepreneurial spirit, has catapulted

it into the forefront of international

trade and investment. India’s robust

technological advancements,

particularly in the fields of information

technology and digital innovation,

have positioned it as a global leader

in the digital age. As India continues

to implement pro-business reforms,

attract foreign investments, and

foster innovation, its dynamic

presence in the global economy is set

to illuminate new pathways for growth

and development. Moreover, its vast

pool of skilled labour, coupled with

a burgeoning middle class, presents

an enormous consumer base and a

gateway to economic prosperity. The

rise of the middle class has brought

about notable shifts in consumption

patterns, lifestyle choices, and

aspirations. With rising incomes, this

segment is becoming a powerful force

in shaping consumer demand seeking

higher-quality products and services,

and driving the need for innovation

and improved customer experiences.

Technology continues to reshape

consumer behaviour and business

operating models. V-Guard is focussed

on building capabilities to address the

levers around digital consumer, digital

channel, digital product, and digital

enterprise.

India is witnessing a significant shift in

shopper behaviour, with a notable rise

in the popularity of e-commerce. The

convenience and accessibility offered

by online platforms have transformed

India has emerged as a beacon of progress and

opportunity. The country’s vibrant and diverse

market, coupled with a thriving entrepreneurial spirit,

has catapulted it into the forefront of international

trade and investment. India’s robust technological

advancements, particularly in the fields of

information technology and digital innovation, have

positioned it as a global leader in the digital age.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN:

Managing Director: Dear Shareholders

I am pleased to write

to you at the end of an

exciting year for V-Guard,

which continues to scale

new frontiers of business

growth and expansion.

We remained undeterred

by the market challenges

and stayed on course with

our promise to deliver on

our ambitious goals. Our

growth trajectory during

the year was guided

by the addition of new

capacities, new product

innovations, technological

advancements, emerging

channel play, expansion of

the distribution network,

driven by the strong

commitment and passion of

our employees.

V-Guard’s consolidated net

revenues increased by about 18%

year-over-year in FY23, reaching

4,126 crore. Even with the revenues

from the recently acquired Sunflame

business excluded, the year-over-year

growth was an impressive 16.3%,

significantly higher than the 11.9%

CAGR over the FY19 to FY23 period.

Our business in the Southern markets

expanded by 9% over the prior fiscal

year, compared to 26.4% growth in

the Non-South markets. The fact that

the business has a diversified revenue

base and that the contribution from

Non-South markets has exceeded 45%

is what makes this growth noteworthy.

Our Non-South business is now a

significant revenue contributor which

is a healthy sign, as it de-risks the

company from being over indexed in a

single geography.

The growth was driven by Electronics

and Consumer Durables segments

which grew by 21.9% and 20%

respectively. We are convinced that

V-Guard will soon begin to reap the

rewards of operating leverage in this

business as the Consumer Durables

segment achieves considerable scale

in the top line. Another significant

contributor in the overall growth, the

Electricals segment also delivered a

double-digit year-over-year growth,

at 11%.

FY23 also witnessed margin

pressures due to inflation and surge

in commodity prices across segments.

With commodity prices stabilising

lower than their all-time highs, we

anticipate gross margin moving back

towards pre-covid levels progressively

from Q1 FY24.

Consumption behaviour in India has

been undergoing significant changes

in recent years. Several factors have

contributed to this shift, including

economic growth, urbanisation,

technological advancements, and

evolving social and cultural dynamics.

There are some key trends that are

emerging to the forefront.

The growth was driven by Electronics and Consumer

Durables segments which grew by 21.9% and 20%

respectively. We are convinced that V-Guard will soon

begin to reap the rewards of operating leverage in

this business as the Consumer Durables segment

achieves considerable scale in the top line. Another

significant contributor in the overall growth, the

Electricals segment also delivered a double-digit

year-over-year growth, at 11%.

Annual Report 2022-23

MANAGING DIRECTOR:

Managing Director

As we stride ahead into

the future, we believe

that the high consumer

involvement categories

(consumer durables,

including kitchen) and

our other recent entries -

Switches and Switchgears -

will drive the growth story.

We have made a strategic

acquisition of Sunflame,

one of India’s leading

kitchen brands which will

help us create a strong

kitchen franchise with a

national footprint.

Practices, helped employees explore

their innovative side by working in

groups to win prizes. Other contests

like Crossword and VG Factor

were also conducted to engage

employees across all locations.

Long Service Awardees:

Employees who were associated

with V-Guard for more than

25 years were felicitated on

Foundation Day.

Festivals & Special Days - Various

other celebrations and contests

were conducted during the year to

mark the festive occasions of Diwali,

International Women’s Day.
