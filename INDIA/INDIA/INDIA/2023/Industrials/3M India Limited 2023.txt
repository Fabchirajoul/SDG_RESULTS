Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege as Chairman of

3M India Limited to place before

you the Annual Report of your

Company for FY 22-23. It was a

year of robust recovery for the

Indian economy, even as other

external developments continued

to affect macro-economic

conditions. India’s economy

has fared better than most

other economies despite global

uncertainties. GDP has grown due

to public investment endorsed

by the Government and domestic

consumption. Agriculture and

services sector saw growth while

manufacturing improved even as

production costs increased during

the year due to supply chain

inconsistencies.

The outlook for India

continues to remain positive as

Government investment gains

momentum, giving impetus to

the infrastructure sector. The

PLI programme is expected to

increase investments and output

in the manufacturing sector in the

near to medium term. Services

sector performance continues to

be robust. Advanced economies

are expected to see slower

growth during the next fiscal

while the outlook for India’s GDP

is projected at 6.5% for FY 23-24

by leading financial agencies.

We have built a strong base

in the country with depth in

technologies and solutions

relevant to different market

sectors. Growth opportunities

in priority areas like

automotive, infrastructure,

industrial markets, healthcare

and retail helped leverage some

of the leading solutions crucial

for your Company’s growth.:

Dear Shareholders,

I am honoured to present the

Annual Report of 3M India Limited

for FY 22-23 and share with you

some highlights of your Company’s

performance last fiscal. Despite

the headwinds faced by the global

economy, the Indian economy staged

a resilient recovery and delivered

robust growth in FY 22-23. It is

estimated that India’s GDP grew at

about 7.2% for FY 22-23.

Strong rebound

Your Company’s performance

rebounded strongly in FY 22-23 with

a sales growth of 21.3% and revenue

of ` 3,733 crores on a stand-alone

basis. Profit before tax grew by

55.91% versus previous year, with

PBT margins at 15.02% for FY 22-23,

compared to 11.68% in prior year.

FY 22-23 also marked an important

milestone in the journey of your

Company. During the year, the

Company declared its maiden

dividend in the form of a special

dividend of ` 850 per share. The

Board has also recommended a final

dividend of ` 100 per share, for your

approval.

While we are pleased with the above

financial results, we also recognise

that this is an important step in a long

journey of creating sustainable value

for our shareholders, customers,

partners, communities and other

stakeholders. We intend to create

sustainable long-term value by

leveraging the unique capabilities of

3M and applying them to existing and

several emerging opportunities in

India.

At its core, 3M is a material science

company, and we create value

through science and innovation. This

fundamental strength continues to

keep us relevant in an ever-evolving

business environment. I am excited

at the multiple growth opportunities

we have before us and our ability to

contribute to several priority areas of

India’s economy.
