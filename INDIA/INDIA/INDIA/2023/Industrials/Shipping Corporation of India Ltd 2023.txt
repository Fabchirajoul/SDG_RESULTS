Dear Shareholders, Ladies and Gentlemen,

On behalf of the Board of Directors of The Shipping Corporation of India Ltd, it gives me immense pleasure to address you after another year

of growth of our Company. We present to you the 73rd Annual Report of the Company. The global maritime sector during the financial year

2022-23 was riddled with various challenges like inflationary pressures impacting the consumption patterns, continued geo-political risk due

to war, compliance of IMO regulations for de-carbonization etc. However, the challenges on the other hand, have also given opportunities in

the global maritime sector and few segments like tankers, which had faced tremendous impact during the COVID pandemic, bounced back,

providing excellent returns to the tanker owners.

A well-diversified fleet has always been the strength of your Company and during the last three financial years, it has given agility to your

company to navigate through one of the most challenging global economic crisis and continue to emerge as a well-established and matured

player in the global maritime industry. On analysing the short term view of the last three financial years, it can be realised that while containers

and bulk carriers segment played crucial role in performance of your company during FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22, the impressive financial

performance of your company for FY 2022-23 was ruled by the tankers. The 78% of your company’s tonnage comprise of diversified range

of tankers of different sizes serving in multiple segments of crude oil, product and gas transportation on the coastal routes as well as in the

international trade. The consistent performance of SCI vessels has ensured that during the financial year 2022-23 your company has been

successful in earning the highest level of Revenue from Operations in the last 17 years as well as the highest level of Profit After Tax in the last

14 years. I take this opportunity to congratulate each shareholder for the excellent performance of your company and also convey gratitude

for strongly supporting it during challenging times.

Shipping Scenario & Operations

Shipping works on derived demand basis that means the demand for ships is dependent on the demand for cargoes that are carried on the

ships and thus the global economic activities play a significant role in the demand for ships. The world GDP during 2022 grew by 3.4% and

during 2023, it is expected to grow by about 2.8%. The GDP growth in the advanced economies was slower, whereas the emerging markets

and developing economies have exhibited relatively strong growth. The global trade volume (goods and services) growth has been decent at

5.1% in 2022 and is expected to be about 2.4% in 2023.

Globally, the average seaborne trade (inclusive of both crude oil and refined products) exhibited a handsome rise of 3.78% in year 2022.

The Crude Oil trade increased by 4.21% and the Product trade grew by 2.57% in the year 2022. The tanker markets enjoyed a remarkable

run in 2022 and the robust demand is expected to keep the tonnage utilization high during year 2023. China’s economy has fully opened

The Shipping Corporation of India's Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the fiscal year 2022-23 emphasizes its unwavering

commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles and the strides we have made in addressing sustainability challenges. We

see our responsibility to take the lead in sustainable development not only as a duty to the society but also as an opportunity to do well by doing

good.

ESG Related Challenges:

Over the past year, we have encountered a range of ESG challenges that have guided our focus on responsible business practices. We acknowledge

our responsibility in mitigating the impact of shipping operations on the en vironment and communities. Additionally, ensuring the safety, well-

being, and growth of our workforce while fostering transparency, diversity and inclusion both within and outside our organisation continues to be

a priority for us.

diversity and inclusion within our organization.

bank if all terms and conditions are met by the drawee. It is as good as the

issuing bank.

ISO (International Organization for Standardization)

An independent, non-governmental standard-setting body composed of

representatives from 165 national standards organisations. International

standards give world-class specifications for products, services and

systems to ensure quality, safety and efficiency. They are instrumental in

facilitating international trade.

ISO 9001

The international management systems standard concerned with quality

management – what an organisation does to ensure customer need and

expectations and applicable regulatory requirements, and continually to

improve its quality performance.

Kamsarmax

A Kamsarmax type bulk carrier is basically a 82,000 dwt Panamax with an

increased LOA = 229 m (for Port Kamsar in Equatorial Guinea).

LCL

Less than Container Load, consolidated container load.

LDT (Light Displacement Tonnage)

Light Displacement Ton (Tonnage). It is also called Displacement Light Weight

of the vessel without stores, bunker, fresh water, cargo and passengers.

Usually used for vessels for scrapping.

*LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas)

Natural gas changes to a liquid at – 162C, creating LNG. When liquefied,

the gas is reduced to 1/600th of its original volume making it economic to

transport in specially designed

LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas)

Natural gas will liquefy at a temperature of approximately -259 F or -160

C at atmospheric pressure. One cubic foot of liquefied gas will expand to

approximately 600 cubic feet of gas at atmospheric pressure.

LNGC

(LNG Carrier) An ocean-going ship specially constructed to carry LNG in

tanks at -160 C. Current average carrying capacity of LNGs is 125,000 cubic

metres. Many LNGCs presently under construction or on order are in the

210,000 – 215,000 cubic metre range.

Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)

Not to be confused with LNG, LPG is often called ‘propane’ as it is made of

various mixtures of propane and other similar types of hydrocarbon gases.

These hydrocarbons are gases at rooms temperature, but turn to liquid

when they are compressed. LPG is stored in special tanks that keep it under

pressure, so it stays a liquid. While the room distribution of LNG requires

heavy infrastructure investments, LPG is more easily transported.

Load Line

The waterline corresponding to the maximum draft to which a vessel

is permitted to load, either by freeboard regulations, the conditions of

classification, or the conditions of service.

Marine Cargo Insurance

Broadly, insurance covering loss of, or damage to, goods at sea. Marine

insurance typically compensates the owner of merchandise for losses in

excess of those which can be legally recovered from the carrier that are

sustained from fire, shipwreck, piracy, and various other causes. Three of

the most common types of marine insurance coverage are “free of particular

average” (f.p.a.), “with average” (w.a.), and “All Risks Coverage.”

Maritime Labour Convention

The international Labour Organization’s Convention, known as ‘MLC, 2006’

came into force in August 2013, effectively becoming binding in international

law. It is currently ratified by 56 ILO member states responsible for regulating

conditions for seafarers on more than 80% of the world’s gross tonnage of

ships. It establishes minimum working and living standards on those ships.

MR: Medium Range Tanker, mostly refers to the product tanker with DWT in

the range between 25000-54999 tons.

Net Tonnage (NT)

The replacement, since 1994, for “Net Register Tonnage.” Theoretically the

cargo capacity of the ship. Sometimes used to charge fees or taxes on a

vessel. The formula is (0.2+0.02 log10(Vc)) Vc (4d/3D)2, where Vc is the

volume of cargo holds, D is the distance between ship’s bottom and the

uppermost deck, d is the draught) “Ton” is figured as a 100 cubic foot ton.

An approximate conversion ratio is 1NT = 1.7GT and 1GT = 1.5DWT.

Non–Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC)

A cargo consolidator in ocean trades who will buy space from a carrier and

sub–sell it to smaller shippers. The NVOCC issues bills of lading, publishes

tariffs and otherwise conducts itself as an ocean common carrier, except that

it will not provide the actual ocean or intermodal service.
