LETTER FROM CHAIRMAN AND: MANAGING DIRECTOR

Dear Shareholders,

My heartiest greetings to all of you. I am pleased to present before you the Annual Report of the Company for FY

2022-23. This report presents Company’s performance and achievements during the year under review.

Last year was indeed challenging for all global economies with slowing growth due to mounting inflation, volatile

markets, continuing geo-political crisis, supply chain disruptions and policy tightening by the Central Banks. Despite

these global headwinds, the Indian economy has managed to show resilience and has come out as one of the fastest

growing economies of the World. As per National Statistical Office (NSO), the provisional estimates of the growth

in real GDP of India during FY 2022-23 is 7.2%. Going forward, the healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates,

supply chain normalization, business optimism and robust capital expenditure by Government are favorable

indicators for the Indian economy. However, continuing uncertain global economic environment pose a risk to the

international trade. RBI has estimated GDP growth of 6.5% for the year 2023-24.

The Company has been able to sustain its growth momentum and has marked yet another strong year of performance.

During the year 2022-23, it has handled 4.4 million TEUs as against, 4.1 million TEUs in 2021-22, reflecting an

increase of 7.08%. The operating revenue of Company has increased by 6.70% to Rs.8,103.40 crores in FY 2022-23

from Rs.7,594.45 crores in FY 2021-22 and net profit stood at Rs.1,169.08 crores in FY 2022-23, representing growth

of 10.05%. The physical volumes and operating revenue achieved in the year are the highest ever in any financial

year.

Three interim dividends totaling to 180% (Rs.9/- per share) on equity share of Rs.5/- each were paid during the year

and a final dividend of 40% (Rs.2/- per share) has been recommended. Therefore, the total dividend payment in FY

2022-23 would be Rs.670.22 Crores which is 57.33% of the net profit for the year. The market capitalization of your

Company at the end of the year was Rs.35,354 crores.

The logistics sector is one of the key element in every economy as it supports trade and commerce. This sector is set

to grow significantly in the coming years with rising production, consumption and new opportunities emerging for

India on account of global disruptions. The Government's focus on infrastructure development, productivity linked

incentives, digital connectivity and improving the ease of doing business will go a long way in contributing to achieve

long term growth. As per Logistics Performance Index (LPI) of World Bank, India’s rank jumped 6 places to 38 out

of 139 countries, which is a strong indicator of country’s global positioning.

Government’s vision is to develop a world-class logistics ecosystem that can support the country's growing trade and

investment needs. Following this vision, in October, 2021 the Government launched PM Gati Shakti National Master

Plan, which will be an enabler for having a coordinated approach, leveraging technology, for infrastructure planning

and development. In this direction, the National Logistics Policy (NLP) will act as a guiding document for States/

UTs in formulating their logistics policies. With its focus on bringing efficiency in services (process, digital system,

regulatory framework) and human resources, the Policy will help to streamline processes for seamless coordination

and reduction in logistic costs. In the Union Budget 2023-24, the Government has increased the capital investment

by 33% to Rs.10 lakhs crores, which would be 3.3% of GDP. In this, the capital outlay on Railways itself is Rs.2.4

lakh crores. Government has also identified one hundred critical transport infrastructure projects for last mile and

first mile connectivity, for ports, coal, steel, fertilizer and foodgrains, which will be taken up on priority. All these

initiatives inter-alia will contribute to economic development of the country and will also boost business prospectus

of the Company.

In above scenario, the Company is fully committed for expansion of its business for achieving sustainable growth. It

is steadily marching ahead on the path of growth with its focus on setting up Multi Modal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)

along Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC), increase in double stack haul of containers, value added services,

innovative use of technology, expanding warehousing business, venture internationally, etc. During the year,

Company’s capital expenditure was Rs.568.16 crores approx., incurred mainly on development/expansion of

informed CONCOR that license fee for Railway land licensed from

01.04.2020 onwards shall be charged as per extant policy of Indian

Railways (IR). Accordingly, annual Land License Fee (LLF) at 6%

of Industrial Land Value shall be applicable. However, prior to

considered and not accepting relevant jurisdictional Industrial

land rates obtained by the Company from land revenue authority.

(ii) Divisional Railways are charging commercial rates for LLF,

whereas it should be at Industrial rates.

(iii) Divisions are considering old rate and increasing it by 7% per

annum, instead of land rates obtained by CONCOR as applicable

on 01.04.2020.

ICDs, which is a guiding factor to determine the industrial land

rate.

authorities. The Company is regularly following-up with concerned

structures that are capable of identifying and mitigating risks in a continuous and vibrant manner. Risk evaluation

anything we do, as it is an inherent part of our existence, however by acting proactively and managing these risks

well in advance, your company has been able to perform well. CONCOR has a robust risk management system in

place to identify, monitor and minimize risks.
