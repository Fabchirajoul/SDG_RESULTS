Managing Director of KSB Ltd.

Managing Director of KSB Limited: Dear shareholders,

I am pleased to share the 64th Annual report for the ﬁnancial year

2023. This past year is yet another year of achieving strategic

milestones and is more than just a collecƟon of ﬁnancial ﬁgures and

market successes; it's a testament to the collecƟve power of vision,

innovaƟon, and a commitment to making a posiƟve impact with keen

execuƟon. This report will provide you with comprehensive overview

of our various iniƟaƟves which were enabled in our journey towards

this successful year, along with opportuniƟes and challenges that lie

ahead.

The business climate in India is posiƟve and the government's focus

with capex infusion in infrastructure development and green energy

iniƟaƟves is one of the key drivers. This has created healthy business

environment and opened new opportuniƟes for us as well. Export's

business for us has also shown a posiƟve trend. We have reached

internaƟonal markets and built stronger relaƟonships with our global

partners. The increasing demand for our products worldwide is a

testament to our quality and commitment to excellence.

Our group strategy for 2030 has commenced, which is centered on

“Technology & Quality Leadership” along with being champions in

sustainability and aŌermarket. As part of Strategy 2024, we now have

our footprint in new market segments like Solar, Green Hydrogen etc.

and have enhanced our product porƞolio with new product launches.

We have achieved several milestones, including securing a substanƟal

order for auxiliary pumps, receiving orders from government

schemes, and securing export orders from internaƟonal clients. This

year has been really exciƟng for us with several ﬁrsts. We received our

ﬁrst order for reciprocaƟng pumps, which is a big step for our product

range. We also got our ﬁrst order as an FM packager in the ﬁre-ﬁghƟng

sector, we qualiﬁed in the SECI (Solar Energy CorporaƟon of India)

tender for our solar business and have started supplying for PM-

KUSUM scheme; and this demonstrates our diversiﬁed growth. This

also shows our ability and readiness to perform for key projects.

In Pune, we have established a new mechanical seal assembly

line, enhancing our manufacturing capabiliƟes to ensure that

we meet the growing demands of our customers. Our valves

business from the Coimbatore division has seen remarkable

growth, fueled by an expanding customer base and signiﬁcant

factory investments to support them. Strengthening our service

network has been a priority, which enables us to provide beƩer

support and service to our clients.

Along with business growth, KSB also prioriƟzes its ESG -
