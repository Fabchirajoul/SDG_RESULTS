JPVL had executed Bulk Power Transmission Agreement for long term

open access (LTOA) with Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (PGCIL)

for transmission of power from Nigrie STPP (JNSTPP) and Bina TPP

mines which allowed usage of 85% of coal for Long term PPAs only

in respect of JNSTPP. As per change in coal policy, FSAs were entered

for the quantity of coal to the extent required for generation of power

for supplying to DISCOMs under long term PPA in respect of Bina TPP.

There was no assured supply of coal for the capacities of Plants and

these events have resulted in material change in sale of power of the

Nigrie STPP and Bina TPP.JPVL had requested PGCIL for relinquishing

of LTOA in respect of Bina TPP and Nigrie STPP for the part of sale

of power without any payments because of force majeure events i.e

cancelation of coal mines and change in coal policy.

Note 47

IIn the earlier years, Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd. (UPPCL) had sent notice/

recovery plan in respect of unit VHEP for recovery of Rs. 42,442 lakhs (including

carrying cost of Rs. 2,472 lakhs for the year ended 31st March, 2023 and Rs.11,109

lakhs for the financial years 2018-19 to 2021-22) (as at 31.03.2022 Rs. 39,970

lakhs) being amount excess paid to the Company as assessed and estimated by

the UPPCL including carrying cost (excess payment made to the Company towards

income tax and secondary energy charges for financial years 2007-08 to 2019-20

and 2014-15 to 2019-20 respectively) and hold back Rs. 22,500 Lakhs till 31st

March, 2023 (up to March’22 Rs. 16,044 Lakhs) including recovery for carrying

cost of Rs 13,581 lakhs (up to March’22 Rs. 11,109 Lakhs) as stated above. Based

on the legal opinion obtained by the Company, the action of UPPCL for denying

income tax and secondary charges and holing / deducting amount, is not as per the

terms of the power purchase agreement (PPA). The Company had filed a petition

with Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) against UPPCL for

the aforesaid recovery. UPERC vide its order dated 12th June,2020 had disallowed

the claims of the Company and upheld the recovery/proposed recovery of excess

payment made, and against the Order of UPERC the Company has preferred an

appeal before APTEL. Meanwhile in 2020-21 UPPCL and Company both have

agreed that recovery of amount paid in excess (subject to ongoing reconciliations

and final outcome of appeal filed with APTEL for revision in design energy) to be

made from monthly power sale invoices raised/to be raised for next 7 years starting

from FY 2021-22 till FY 2027-28, with carrying cost charges on outstanding amount

@SBI MCLR plus 350 basis points, starting from financial year 2021-22. In view

of the above and considering prudence, from 2020-21 onwards, revenue from

UPPCL has been accounted for net of the component of income tax and excess

secondary energy charges. Pending the final decision on Company’s appeal filed:

letter dated 20.03.2020 of Entry Tax

Exemption from Madhya Pradesh Industrial Development Corporation Limited (Govt

of Madhya Pradesh Undertaking) for the period commencing from 12.03.2013 and

in some of the residential buildings due to land subsidence. The management of

the Company have carried out independent assessment with the help of an expert.

Process of further evaluation at residential colony is in process and management

believes that impact will not be material of above. There is no impact of the land

In respect of Bina TPP, billings amounting to Rs 17,706 lakhs (till 31st March

2022 Rs17,706 lakhs including claims on account of non-scheduling of power of

Rs.10,459 lakhs) on MPPMCL for capacity charges for five (5) months of year

2020 which has been disputed by MPPMCL as notices of invoking force majeure

clause as stated in note 58 below had been served and/or non-scheduling of

power by MPPMCL. In the Opinion of the Management considering the prevailing

Madhya Pradesh Electricity Grid Code (revision -ii), 2019 (MPEGC, 2019) and

based on opinion of an expert (legal opinion taken by the Association of Private

Electricity Generating Stations of MP), the MPPMCL is liable to make payment of

capacity charges for declared availability of Contracted Capacity under PPA and

for which invoices had been raised in terms of PPA signed between company

and MPPMCL (also delayed payment surcharge of Rs. 3795 lakhs till Oct’21 in

addition to above stated amount). The Company had filed petitions with Madhya

Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC) in earlier year for the recovery

of capacity charges. MPERC has allowed the petition filed for recovery of unpaid

capacity charges on account of force majeure and did not allow the Company’s

petition for recovery of unpaid capacity charges on account of non-scheduling of

power by MPPMCL(RSD). Company has filed an appeal with APTEL against the

Order of MPERC for not allowing the petition filed for recovery of unpaid capacity

charges of Rs.10,459 lakhs on account of non-scheduling of power by MPPMCL

and also MPPMCL has filed an appeal with APTEL against the Order of MPERC

for recovery of unpaid capacity charges on account of force majeure, which are

pending. Management believes that, considering stated facts, the above amount,

which is overdue for payment, is good and fully recoverable by the management and

no provision there against is needed at this stage

of coal to the extent required for generation of power for supplying to

DISCOMs under long term PPA in respect of Bina TPP. There was no

assured supply of coal for the capacities of Plants and these events have

resulted in material change in sale of power of the Nigrie STPP and Bina

TPP.JPVL had requested PGCIL for relinquishing of LTOA in respect of Bina

TPP and Nigrie STPP for the part of sale of power without any payments

because of force majeure events i.e cancelation of coal mines and change

lakhs) being amount excess paid to the Company as assessed and estimated by

the UPPCL including carrying cost (excess payment made to the Company towards

income tax and secondary energy charges for financial years 2007-08 to 2019-20

and 2014-15 to 2019-20 respectively) and hold back Rs. 22,500 Lakhs till 31st

March, 2023 (up to March’22 Rs. 16,044 Lakhs) including recovery for carrying

cost of Rs 13,581 lakhs (up to March’22 Rs. 11,109 Lakhs) as stated above. Based

on the legal opinion obtained by the Company, the action of UPPCL for denying

income tax and secondary charges and holing / deducting amount, is not as per the

terms of the power purchase agreement (PPA). The Company had filed a petition

with Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) against UPPCL for

the aforesaid recovery. UPERC vide its order dated 12th June,2020 had disallowed

the claims of the Company and upheld the recovery/proposed recovery of excess

payment made, and against the Order of UPERC the Company has preferred an

appeal before APTEL. Meanwhile in 2020-21 UPPCL and Company both have

agreed that recovery of amount paid in excess (subject to ongoing reconciliations

and final outcome of appeal filed with APTEL for revision in design energy) to be

made from monthly power sale invoices raised/to be raised for next 7 years starting

from FY 2021-22 till FY 2027-28, with carrying cost charges on outstanding amount

@SBI MCLR plus 350 basis points, starting from financial year 2021-22. In view

of the above and considering prudence, from 2020-21 onwards, revenue from

UPPCL has been accounted for net of the component of income tax and excess

secondary energy charges. Pending the final decision on Company’s appeal filed

with APTEL, as stated above, no provision in these financial statements has been

considered necessary by the management against the disallowances of income

tax and secondary energy charges of Rs. 42,442 lakhs and carrying cost (amount

unascertainable). Further the management believes that it has credible case in its

favour and accordingly amount which has been deducted by UPPCL of Rs. 22,500

lakhs (shown as part of trade receivables) is considered good and recoverable with

interest from UPPCL.
