items in the financials:

ʙ Cost of materials consumed

ʙ Purchases of stock-in-trade

ʙ Changes in inventories of finished goods, stock-in-trade,

and work-in-progress

ʙ Project bought outs and subcontracting costs

Costs of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased by

3.1% to H105,109 million in FY23 mainly due to favourable

business mix and judicious price revisions.

Employee Benefit Expenses

The employment expenses increased by H502 million to

H4,568 million from H4,066 million, an increase of 12%

was on account of yearly increments and new hiring. As a

percentage to revenue, employee cost was 3.24 % in FY23

as compared to 3.33% in FY22.

We instituted the ESOP Plan 2018, ESOP Performance

Scheme, and ESOP Privilege Scheme for issuance of stock

options to eligible employees. The compensation cost

recognised for these ESOP schemes was H108 million for

FY23 and H161 million for FY22 which was included in the

employee benefit expenses.

Finance Cost

Finance cost largely includes interest cost, bank charges,

and foreign exchange gains/(losses) on borrowings. Our

finance costs increased by H246 million to H598 million in

FY23 primarily due increase in acceptances and hike in

interest rate.

Depreciation and Amortisation Expense

Depreciation and amortisation expense increased to

H2,092 million in FY23 compared to H2,015 million in FY22,

increase of H76 million largely due to addition in PPE.

Other Expenses

Other expenses increased by H2,217 million to H12,880

million in FY 23 from H10,663 million in FY 22. As a % of

revenue, other expenses were 9.13% in FY 23 as compared

to 8.74% in FY 22.

Increase/Decrease was largely on account of:

ʙ Increase in advertising and sales promotion spends

by H421 million mainly due to spends on major

campaigns like T20 Cricket World Cup, ICC World Cup

Tournaments, Green Wire TV commercial, etc.

ʙ Following expenses are in line with an increase

in revenue:

− Increase in power and fuel by H398 million

− Increase in freight and forwarding expense by

H406 million

Polycab India Limited

Management Discussion and Analysis:

Managing Director, Chief Human

Resource Officer, Company Secretary & Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and a functional head exists to

take necessary action in cases of serious misconduct and inappropriate corporate behavior. The committee determines

the severity of the incident and its impact, based on which appropriate action is taken by the committee head which

is final and binding. The complainant may raise protected disclosure by writing at the email: speakup@polycab.com.

Further details regarding the procedure adopted to handle complaints is mentioned in ‘Whistleblower Policy’ https://

polycab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Whistle-Blower-Policy-1.pdf.

6.

There have been no complaints related to sexual harassment, discrimination at workplace, child labour, forced labour/

involuntary labour, wages or any other human rights related issues during FY 2022-23 and FY 2021-22 by employees /

workers.

Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/ assurance has been carried out by an external agency? (Yes/

No). If “Yes”, name the external agency – Yes, the independent assessment has been carried out by KPMG Assurance

and Consulting Services LLP.

7.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.

Our Whistleblower policy has clearly laid down the guidelines to prevent retaliation against a complainant. A complainant

has the right to complete anonymity unless required by law enforcement agencies. The organization prohibits retaliation

against a complainant that may include discrimination, reprisal, harassment, or vengeance in any manner. The

whistleblower will not be at the risk of losing her/ his job or business or adverse impact or suffer loss in any other

manner like transfer, rejection, termination, demotion, refusal of promotion, or the like including any direct or indirect

use of authority to obstruct the Whistle-Blower’s right to continue to perform his/her duties/functions including making

further Protected Disclosure, as a result of reporting under this Policy. A complainant may file a written complaint under

Protected Disclosure to the Chairman of the Audit committee.

To handle cases related to sexual harassment, Polycab has an Internal Committee for time-bound redressal of

complaints. The Internal Committee is constituted by the management and consists of a presiding officer, minimum

of two employee members committed to the cause of women or who have experience in social work or have legal

knowledge, and a member from an NGO/lawyer/any external body. The committee is responsible to inquire into every

formal written complaint of sexual harassment, make appropriate recommendations and remedial measures to respond

to any substantiated allegations of sexual harassment, discourage and prevent employment-related sexual harassment.

The Internal Committee will thereafter provide advice or extend support as requested and will conduct inquiry to resolve

the matter. It ensures confidentiality is maintained for all complaints and the complainant is protected against any

form of victimization and discrimination.

8.

Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)

Yes. The business agreements, purchase orders and contracts with our suppliers include our Supplier Code of Conduct

(SCoC). The SCoC is applicable to all our suppliers. ‘Supplier’ here includes suppliers, service providers, vendors, traders,

agents, consultants, contractors, dealer, distributors, business associates and joint venture partners, third parties

including their employees, agents and other representatives, who have a business relationship with and provide, sell,

seek to sell, any kinds of goods or services to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or divisions. The Company

expects the suppliers to fully comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and adhere to internationally recognised

environmental, social and governance standards including working conditions and well-being of their employees, anti-

harassment, anti-discrimination, abolition of child and forced labour.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

A) Basis of preparation

i.

Statement of Compliance:

The Group prepares its Consolidated Financial

Statements to comply with the Indian

Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) specified

under section 133 of the Companies Act,

2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended from time

to time and the presentation requirements of

Division II of Schedule III of Companies Act,

2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III). These

Consolidated financial statements includes

Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2023, the

Statement of Profit and Loss including Other

Comprehensive Income, Statement of Cash

flows and Statement of changes in equity for

the year ended 31 March 2023, and a summary

of significant accounting policies and other

explanatory information (together hereinafter

referred to as “Financial Statements”).

ii.

Basis of Measurement:

The financial statements for the year ended

31 March 2023 have been prepared on an

accrual basis and a historical cost convention,

except for the following financial assets and

liabilities which have been measured at fair

value or amortised cost at the end of each

reporting period:

(a)

Derivative financial instruments (Refer

note 40 for accounting policy regarding

financial instruments)

(b)

Certain financial assets and liabilities

(Refer note 40 for accounting policy

regarding financial instruments)

(c)

Net defined benefit plan (Refer note 30 for

accounting policy)

(d)

Share Based Payments (Refer note 30 for

accounting policy)

In addition, the carrying values of recognised

assets and liabilities designated as hedged

items in fair value hedges that would otherwise

be carried at amortised cost are adjusted to

record changes in the fair values attributable

to the risks that are being hedged in effective

hedge relationships.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair

value of the consideration given in exchange

for goods and services. Fair value is the price

that would be received from sell an asset

or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly

transaction between market participants at

the measurement date.

Accounting policies and methods of

computation followed in the financial

statements are same as compared with the

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Contd.

for the year ended 31 March 2023:

letter of credit. Trade payables are presented as current financial liabilities.

The Group enters into arrangements for purchase under usance: letter of credit issued by banks under non-fund based

working capital limits of the Group. Considering these arrangements are majorly for raw materials with a maturity of

up to twelve months, the economic substance of the transaction is determined to be operating in nature and these are

recognised as acceptances under trade payables.

Standalone Statement of Cash Flows

for the year ended 31 March 2023

Accounting policy

Cashflows are reported using the indirect method as set out in Ind AS 7, ‘Statement of Cash Flows’, whereby profit for the

year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating

cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cashflows. The cash flows

from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.

Cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of cash flow statement comprise cash at bank and in hand, cheques in hand

and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes

in value and having original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. Cash and

cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage (Refer Note-8).

For the purposes of cash flow, statement cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined

above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Company’s cash management.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

A) Basis of preparation

i

Statement of Compliance:

The Company prepares its Standalone Financial

Statements to comply with the Indian Accounting

Standards (“Ind AS”) specified under section 133

of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as

amended from time to time and the presentation

requirements of Division II of Schedule III of

Companies Act, 2013 (Ind AS compliant Schedule

III). These Standalone financial statements includes

Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2023, the Statement

of Profit and Loss including Other Comprehensive

Income, Statement of Cash flows and Statement

of changes in equity for the year ended 31 March

2023, and a summary of significant accounting

policies and other explanatory information

(together hereinafter referred to as “Financial

Statements”).

ii

Basis of Measurement:

The financial statements for the year ended 31

March 2023 have been prepared on an accrual

basis and a historical cost convention, except for

the following financial assets and liabilities which

have been measured at fair value or amortised cost

at the end of each reporting period:

(a)

Derivative financial instruments (Refer note

37 for accounting policy regarding financial

instruments)

(b)

Certain financial assets and liabilities (Refer

note 37 for accounting policy regarding

financial instruments)

(c) Net defined benefit plan (Refer note 29 for

accounting policy)

(d) Share Based Payments (Refer note 29 for

accounting policy)

In addition, the carrying values of recognised

assets and liabilities designated as hedged items

in fair value hedges that would otherwise be carried

at amortised cost are adjusted to record changes

in the fair values attributable to the risks that are

being hedged in effective hedge relationships.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value

of the consideration given in exchange for goods

and services. Fair value is the price that would be

received from sell an asset or paid to transfer a

liability in an orderly transaction between market

participants at the measurement date.

Accounting policies and methods of computation

followed in the financial statements are same as

compared with the annual financial statements for

the year ended 31 March 2022, except for adoption

of new standard or any pronouncements effective

from 1 April 2022.

The Company presents an additional balance

sheet at the beginning of the earliest comparative

period when: it applies an accounting policy
