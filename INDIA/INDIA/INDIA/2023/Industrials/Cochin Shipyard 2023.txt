Dear Shareholders,

It is with profound delight

that I extend a warm

welcome to each one of

you on behalf of the Board

of Directors to the 51st

Annual General Meeting

of your Company, Cochin

Shipyard Limited (CSL).

Allow me to share with

you the highlights of the

Company’s performance and

accomplishments during the

fiscal year 2022-23, as well as

our future endeavours.

Financial performance

The fiscal year 2022-23 presented certain

financial and operational challenges for

Cochin Shipyard Limited. Our results

fell short of our initial expectations.

Specifically, the revenue from operations

for the year amounted to ₹2330.46

Crores, compared to ₹3190.00 Crores

in the prior fiscal year. The profit before

tax stood at ₹448.51 Crores, down from

₹794.39 Crores in the preceding year.

The net profit for the year was ₹334.49

Crores, a decrease from ₹586.57 Crores

in the previous year. Despite this, we

achieved PAT Margins of 14%, while the

Earnings Per Share (EPS) stood at ₹25.43.

Moreover, we achieved an EBIDTA of

₹533.40 Crores with a fairly decent

EBITDA margin of 23%.

Our interactions during the conference

calls on May 31, 2023, provided insight

into the specific factors affecting

our financial performance, and a

comprehensive presentation on this

matter can be found on the Company’s

website in the investor section. I have

full confidence in CSL’s resilience and

anticipate a robust recovery in FY24,

considering the strong order visibility and

the execution of various orders in hand.

Operational performance

The Company delivered the first

indigenously built Aircraft Carrier to the

Indian Navy on July 28, 2022 and the

vessel was commissioned by the Hon’ble

Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra

Modi on September 02, 2022, which is

a significant milestone not only for the

Company but also for the entire nation.

The construction of IAC is considered

as the most ambitious warship project

of the country as it is unprecedented

in terms of size and complexity in

comparison to any ship built in India

till date, setting a new benchmark in

Indian shipbuilding. Other noteworthy

vessel deliveries during the year include

two Autonomous Electric Barges, viz.,

“Marit” & “Theres”, for Norway based

ASKO Maritime AS, one 500 Pax Vessel

viz., “Nalanda” for Andaman and Nicobar

Administration, three Floating Border

Out-Post (FBOPs) Vessels built for

Ministry of Home Affairs and seven

Hybrid Electric Catamaran Hull Vessels

for Kochi Metro Rail Limited.

Orders received during the year

CSL’s prowess in securing substantial

shipbuilding orders remained evident

during the year. Despite intense

competition, we secured orders for two

Commissioning Service Operation Vessels

(CSOV) from Pelagic Group, Cyprus;

six Next Generation Missile Vessels

(NGMV) from Ministry of Defence and

two Zero Emission Feeder Container

Vessels, from companies based in Norway

which are part of the SAMSKIP Group,

headquartered in Netherlands. These

achievements underscore our strengths

in the Indian defence shipbuilding sector

as also our credibility in the Global

shipbuilding sector.

Major expansion projects

CSL is executing two large expansion

projects costing ₹2,769 Crores viz.,

International Ship Repair Facility (ISRF)

costing ₹970 Crores and new dry dock

costing ₹1,799 Crores.

The new dry dock project is at an

advanced stage of execution. Majority

of the works viz., Ground improvement

works, cofferdam works, dock wall sheet

pile installation works, caisson gate unit

fabrication, 3 out of 4 underground

Substations, 280 Meter of dock floor

(at a depth of 13m), 65% Civil Works

of underground pump house (from

depth of 21m), 98% RCC piling works,

40% crane track works, 50% caisson

gate erection works, grand assembly

area works etc. have been completed.

Further, the fabrication of components

of 600T gantry crane, a critical machinery

for the dry dock, have been completed

in South Korea. Delivery of crane

components to the site is targeted by

October 2023. Overall, the project is

progressing well and it is expected to

complete the construction by December

2023 and thereafter full commissioning

of the project by mid of 2024.

Chairman’s

message

The ISRF project had run into difficulties

due to the financial problems faced

by the turnkey contracting company,

forcing us to terminate the contract. The

physical progress of construction works

reported till contract termination was

78%. As a result, the remaining of the

job was divided into three independent

tender packages. The works have

been resumed with new contractors,

the dredging works have since been

completed and civil, mechanical and

electrical works are progressing well. All

the shiplift components have already

been received at site and the 130m X

25m shiplift platform is under sea transit

from Vietnam. We expect to complete

commissioning of the ship lift and the

first two workstations by December

2023, put the facility into initial stages

of operation, and thereafter complete

and commission the balance facilities by

mid-next year.

Wholly owned subsidiaries

Hooghly Cochin Shipyard Limited:

During the financial year 2022-23 the

setting up of new state-of-the-art ship

nation by Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, the

Hon’ble Minister of Ports, Shipping &

Waterways. The Facility has been set up

of river Hooghly at a cost of ₹175.20
