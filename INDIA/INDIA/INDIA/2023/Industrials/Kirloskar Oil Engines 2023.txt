positioned us for long-term success.

Business Transformation Journey:

Over the past year, we have undertaken a

comprehensive business transformation

journey to adapt to the evolving market

dynamics and capitalise on emerging

opportunities. This transformation was

driven by the vision to create sustainable

value for all stakeholders and secure

Kirloskar Oil Engines' position as a leading

One of the key aspects of our transformation

journey has been a relentless focus on

innovation and technological advancements.

We firmly believe that nurturing homegrown

talent and expertise is crucial for

fostering innovation, driving technological

advancements, and maintaining our

competitive edge. By investing in our in-

house R&D capabilities, we have been able

to develop cutting-edge solutions tailored

to the unique needs of our customers and

the markets we serve. This emphasis on

indigenous R&D not only strengthens our

position as a technology leader but also

contributes to the growth and self-reliance

of our nation's engineering ecosystem. We

remain committed to fostering a culture of

innovation and continuous learning as we

navigate the exciting opportunities that

environmental sustainability and

regulatory compliance, I am pleased to

inform you that Kirloskar Oil Engines has

made significant progress in achieving

readiness for the Central Pollution

testament to our dedication to creating a

greener future.

We are incredibly proud of our steadfast

dedication to in-house and indigenous

research and development initiatives,

which have played a crucial role in

ensuring our products are prepared for this

phase of transition.

Through rigorous testing and validation

processes, we have successfully

developed a range of environment-friendly

engines that deliver high performance

with a reduced carbon footprint, in line

with the regulatory requirements.

Sustainable business Practices:

At Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited, we

fully appreciate the importance of

environmental, social, and governance

(ESG) factors in fostering sustainable

growth. Over the course of the year, we

have achieved notable milestones in

establishing a strong governance structure

and implementing a comprehensive policy

framework to guide our ESG initiatives.

Our unwavering commitment lies in

reducing our carbon footprint, preserving

resources, and championing responsible

manufacturing practices as the focal

points of our endeavours.

As we continue our journey, we remain

steadfast in our commitment to delivering

sustainable value to all our stakeholders

while contributing to a cleaner and

healthier planet.

Management Discussion and Analysis

Global economic overview

In the wake of mounting inflationary pressures and the geopolitical

conflict in Europe, global economies grappled with several

challenges in 2022. The sustained rise in interest rates by Central

Banks around the world to rein in inflation and the prolonged

geopolitical crisis in Europe are impeding economic activity.

The resurgence of COVID in China dampened growth prospects

in 2022. However, the recent reopening has set the stage for a

faster-than-anticipated rebound. Another silver lining is the fact

that global inflation is projected to decelerate from *8.8% in 2022

to 6.6% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024. In the course of 2023, pent-

up demand across emerging economies and a sharper decline

in inflation are expected. The emerging and developing economies

of the world are expected to drive and remain instrumental in

accelerating global economic growth, in the years ahead.

*Source: IMF World Economic Outlook January 2023

Outlook

There are early signs that indicate a gradual recovery from the

pandemic-induced shocks and supply-chain constraints. Growth

rates (fourth quarter over fourth quarter) have increased from an

expected 2.8% in 2022 to 4.5% in 20231, signifying that growth

in many emerging markets and developing economies is now

witnessing an upswing.

The pace and effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy measures

to support economic expansion would also help shape a promising

outlook. Central banks around the world have been tightening

monetary policy, but it remains to be seen if these measures will

prove to be effective in curbing sticky inflation and promoting long-

term growth. Fiscal policies would also play a key role, particularly

in assisting businesses and individuals affected by the pandemic.

Structural reforms such as fostering flexible and inclusive

labour markets, scaling up productivity, alleviating supply chain

bottlenecks, enhancing business dynamism, lowering barriers

to cross-border trade and encouraging economic migration are

expected to be essential for mitigating supply shortages and

building on the gains from digitalisation .1

letter of credit, bank guarantee, business deposits and such other forms of credit assurance schemes.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. In addition, a large

number of minor receivables are combined into homogenous category and assessed for impairment collectively. The

calculation is based on actual incurred historical data. The Company does not hold collateral as security. The Company

evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are spread over vast spectrum.

The Company consistently recognizes provision for any significantly delayed receivables, for accounting of expected credit

losses. Provision for doubtful debts and advances for the year ended 31 March 2023 includes a provision of H 28.09 Crores in

respect of receivables against sales of Gensets to a customer made during the FY 2021-22. While the company is in active

discussions with the customer for the payment, the aforesaid provision has been recognised as per the consistent policy of

the company for accounting of expected credit losses.

Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company’s treasury department in

accordance with the Company’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made as per the approved investment policy.

Investment limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss if any.

c

Liquidity risk

The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a liquidity planning tool.

The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank

overdrafts, bank loans. The Company has access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding and debt maturing within 12

months can be rolled over with existing lenders.

letter of credit, bank guarantee,

business deposits and such other forms of credit assurance schemes.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. In addition, a large

number of minor receivables are combined into homogenous category and assessed for impairment collectively. The

calculation is based on actual incurred historical data. The Group does not hold collateral as security. The Group evaluates

the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are spread over vast spectrum.

The Parent company consistently recognizes provision for any significantly delayed receivables, for accounting of expected

credit losses. Provision for doubtful debts and advances for the year ended 31 March 2023 includes a provision of H 28.09

Crores in respect of receivables against sales of Gensets to a customer made during the FY 2021-22. While the company is

in active discussions with the customer for the payment, the aforesaid provision has been recognised as per the consistent

policy of the Parent company for accounting of expected credit losses.

Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury department in accordance

with the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made as per the approved investment policy. Investment limits are

set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss if any.

d Liquidity risk

The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a liquidity planning tool.

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts,

bank loans. The Group has access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding and debt maturing within 12 months can be

rolled over with existing lenders.

The risk arises due to asset liability mismatch. The inadequacy of the NBFC subsidiary in increasing its asset base, managing

any unplanned changes in funding sources and meeting the financial commitments when required may result in non-

liquidity.

Mitigation:

•

NBFC has Asset Liability Management Policy in line with the RBI guidelines.

•

The Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is responsible for managing the risk arising out of exposures to

interest rate changes and mismatches between assets and liabilities.

Excessive risk concentration

Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same

geographical region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly

affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group's

performance to developments affecting a particular industry.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the Group's policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on

the maintenance of a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled and managed accordingly.

Selective hedging is used within the Group to manage risk concentrations at both the relationship and industry levels.

The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted

payments:

6.14 Capital management

For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital and all other equity reserves attributable

to the equity holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong

credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the

requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment

to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 March 2023 and

31 March 2022.
