March 31, 2023, India will invite Renewable Energy

Project bids for 50 GW per annuam which includes

10 GW of Wind Energy Projects during the period

from FY24 to FY28.

The MNRE, in collaboration with the Danish Energy

Agency, has published a conceptual plan for 15

offshore wind projects, paving the way for offshore

wind development. The increase in commodity

prices and the impact of a shrinking supply chain

in Europe present a significant opportunity for India

in the wind energy supply chain, further boosting

the wind energy sector in India. All these factors are

expected to favour the wind energy sector in India.

Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present Suzlon’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, which is a testimony to our

commitment to sustainability and outlines our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)

principles.

Environmental Responsibility: At Suzlon we recognize the importance of minimizing our ecological footprint

and contributing to a sustainable future. The primary challenge for wind turbine manufacturers the world over

is mitigating the impact of wind turbine manufacturing and installation on local ecosystems. To address this, we

have invested significantly in research and development to eliminate or minimize such impact e.g designing turbine

models that reduce bird and bat collisions in 100% of our new turbines.

Social Responsibility: Our relationship with local communities has been a cornerstone of our success. The key

challenge for social programs that we have been cognizant of has been ensuring long term positive impact on

the communities in which we operate. We are actively engaged in capacity-building initiatives, such as providing

livelihood opportunities to local residents. Our investments in community welfare programs, including education

and healthcare, have directly benefited 609 villages reaching over 30 Lakh villagers and 10 Lakh households in

underserved regions.

Governance: Transparent and ethical governance is the bedrock of our business operations. Maintaining a high

standard of corporate governance across a diverse portfolio spread over hundreds of decentralized and often

remote operating locations is always a critical challenge. We take pride that our Company has consistently and

successfully maintained a robust governance framework, with all our projects adhering to stringent regulatory and

compliance standards.

Looking ahead, we are committed to continual improvement to raise the bar even higher. Our focus includes a

robust baseline assessment and work on reduction in overall carbon emissions through increased renewable energy

generation and adoption, continued efforts to enhance local community engagement, and an increase in human

rights trainings.

In conclusion, our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report underscores our unwavering dedication to ESG

principles and our mission to create lasting positive impact. We remain steadfast in our pursuit of sustainability and

are confident that, together with your continued support, we can pave the way for a greener, more inclusive, and

responsible future for generations to come.
