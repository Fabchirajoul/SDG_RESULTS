Financial highlights and state of Affairs of the

Company

We reported a healthy performance in difficult times. Having

crossed C3,000 crore mark comprehensively in FY22, we scaled

past the C4,000 crore milestone in FY23. We achieved volume and

revenue growth of 11% and 18% y-o-y, respectively showcasing

the organisation’s resilience and brand’s strength.

Spiraling gas prices, impacted business profitability of all tile majors

and Kajaria. Our focus on value-addition helped cushion the drop

in profitability. Your Company reported a Net Profit of C345 crore

in FY23. We sustained our deleveraged position which strengthens

our ability to undertake capital projects over the coming years to

capitalise on growth opportunities.

The State of Affair of the Company is detailed in the ‘Management

Discussion and Analysis’ section which forms part of this report.

Outlook

The positivity in the external environment coupled with reduced

inflation suggest a promising current year.

The healthy uptick in the real estate sector across India coupled

with the Government’s impetus to creating world-class

infrastructure is expected to fuel demand over the medium term.

Further, Government agencies have decided to offer large land

parcels for real estate development which adds to the optimism

of the tile sector.

After a lag of a few years, residential housing is growing rapidly as

cities widen their municipal limits and Tier 2 and 3 towns emerge

as new residential hubs. Additionally, demand for Grade-A office

space is growing at a healthy pace as global conglomerates are

looking to set shop in India. Further, realty creation has gained

steam in other segments such as warehouses, data, centers retail

segment and hospitality.

From an organisational standpoint, our recently commissioned

capacities coupled with our reduced reliance on natural gas

(owing to the use of bio mass) should help in sustaining profitable

business growth.

Dividend

Your Directors have recommended to the shareholders a final

dividend of C3/- (i.e. 300%) per equity share of C1/- each fully

paid-up for the financial year ended March 31, 2023, if approved

at the ensuing Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’).

During the year 2022-23, the Company has also paid Interim

Dividend of C6/- (i.e. 600%) per equity share of C1 each fully paid-up
