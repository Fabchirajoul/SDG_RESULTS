opportunities in contract manufacturing for

foreign OEMs, technology transfer partnerships

with global players. The Government is encouraging

defence exports through many policy initiatives

and has set a target of ` 35,000 Crore by 2025,

further strengthening our efforts to expand our

global footprint.

In the area of offsets, we are unlocking revenue

generation opportunities by enabling foreign

Letter of Credit established by the customer thereby reducing the credit risk.

In a few cases credit is extended to customers based on market conditions after assessing the solvency of the customer

and the necessary due diligence to determine credit worthiness. Advance payments are made against bank guarantee

which safeguards the credit risk associated with such payments. Impairment losses on financial assets (representing mainly

liquidated damages leviable for delayed deliveries and other disallowances) have been made after factoring contractual

terms, etc and other indicators.

The cash and cash equivalent with banks are in the form of short term deposits with maturity period of upto 1 year. The

Company has a well structured Risk Mitigation Policy whereby there are preset limits for each bank based on its net worth

and earning capacity which is reviewed on a periodic basis. The Company has not incurred any losses on account of

default from banks on deposits.

The credit risk in respect of other financial assets is negligible as they are mostly due from Government department

/ parties.

Letter of Credit established by the customer thereby reducing the credit risk.

In a few cases credit is extended to customers based on market conditions after assessing the solvency of the customer

and the necessary due diligence to determine credit worthiness. Advance payments are made against bank guarantee

which safeguards the credit risk associated with such payments. Impairment losses on financial assets (representing mainly

liquidated damages leviable for delayed deliveries and other disallowances) have been made after factoring contractual

terms, etc and other indicators.

The cash and cash equivalent with banks are in the form of short term deposits with maturity period of upto 1 year in case

of parent company. The Parent Company has a well structured Risk Mitigation Policy whereby there are preset limits for

each bank based on its net worth and earning capacity which is reviewed on a periodic basis. The Parent Company has

not incurred any losses on account of default from banks on deposits.

The credit risk in respect of other financial assets is negligible as they are mostly due from government department

/ parties.

and maintain optimal capital structure.

As part of this overall objective, the Parent Company has expanded capital base by issuing bonus shares in FY 2022-23.

The Parent company has a well defined Dividend Distribution Policy which lays the framework for payments of dividend

and retention of surplus for future growth and enhancing shareholders wealth. The parent Company has been sanctioned

borrowing limits with banks to the tune of ` 5,00,000 (` 4,00,000).
