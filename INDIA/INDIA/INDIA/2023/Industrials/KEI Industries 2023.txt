(j) There are no discrepancies in Quarterly returns or statements of current assets filed by the

19. Lease Liabilities:

Accounting Policy

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid

at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate

cannot be readily determined, company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the company uses its

incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

l Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

l Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate

as at the commencement date;

l Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and

l The exercise price under a purchase option that the company is reasonably certain to exercise,

lease payments in an optional renewal period if the company is reasonably certain to exercise an

extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the company is reasonably

certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured

when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there

is a change in the company’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value

guarantee, or if company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or

termination option.

When the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying

amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-

use asset has been reduced to zero.

Short-Term Leases and Leases of Low-Value Assets

The company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short- term

leases of real estate properties that have a lease term upto12 months. The company recognises the

lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.:

letter of credit. Trade payables are presented as current financial

liabilities.

The Company enters into arrangements for purchase under usance: letter of credit issued by banks

under non-fund based working capital limits of the Company. Considering these arrangements are

majorly for raw materials with a maturity of up to twelve months, the economic substance of the

transaction is determined to be operating in nature and these are recognised as acceptances under

trade payables.

Letter of

Credit (LCs) issued to raw material vendors under non-fund based working capital facility approved

by Banks for the Company. For security of Non-fund based limits refer note 18B.

(b) Others includes amount payable to vendors, employees liability and accrual of expenses that are

expected to be settled in the Company’s normal operating cycle or due to be settled within twelve

months from the reporting date.

(c) Company’s liquidity risk management processes, refer note no. 40.
