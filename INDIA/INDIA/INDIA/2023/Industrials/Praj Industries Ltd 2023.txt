Dear Shareholders,

I am privileged to present the 37th Annual Report of your Company

for FY 2022-23. Amid turmoil in the world economy, India has

received recognition as a bright spot, thanks to robust economic

growth on the back of domestic consumption cycles. Your company

has been able to leverage tailwinds in the home market to record

strong financial performance.

There are rising concerns over the evils of climate change and its

impact on the environment. In fact, according to the latest State of

the Global Climate reports published by the World Meteorological

Organization, the world witnessed hottest summer in 2022. Also,

the past eight years were the warmest on record globally, fueled

by ever-rising greenhouse gas concentrations and accumulated

heat. May 2023 report of World Meteorological Organization has

estimated weather and climate related disasters as USD 4.3 trillion

and human casualties over 2 million in last five decades. While most

of the economic damage was in developed nations, nine out of ten

human casualties were reported in developing economies. This has

further precipitated the need for sustainable climate action to curb

greenhouse gas emissions.

The Race to Zero campaign towards carbon neutrality has gained

strong momentum following COP 27 summit held in Egypt last

year. Several nations and global conglomerates have announced

definitive plans by way of roadmap to achieve net zero target.

Adopting circular economy and embracing energy transition are

among two most promising solutions to achieve Net Zero and

bioeconomy encompasses both.

Your company has two pronged strategies in the realm of

Bioeconomy viz. Bio-MobilityTM platform of technologies for

production of low carbon biofuels and Bio-PrismTM portfolio of

technologies for production of renewable chemicals and materials.

While the former facilitates sustainable decarbonization, latter

enables carbon recycling. Both innovative technology solutions help

in transitioning from hydrocarbon-based economy to carbohydrate-

based economy. In addition to being a renewable resource bioenergy

also positively impacts socio and economic development of nation

besides ensuring inclusive growth.

Your company is playing an important role in reconfiguring the

nation’s transportation fuel mix by helping build capacity for

production of biofuels. India’s strides in ethanol blending program,

enabled by technology advancements, now at foothills of 20% blend,

is acclaimed as a success story globally. Your company is proud to

be a prime mover in this development, with over 70% share in the

country’s ethanol production capacity.

We have now successfully commissioned our First 2G Ethanol Bio-

Refinery at IOCL Panipat and the first ethanol is out. This one plant

will benefit more than 1 lac farmers, create around 1500 jobs for

rural youth while eliminating around 320,000 MT of CO2 every year

which is equivalent to replacing nearly 63,000 cars on road annually.

Your company has reaffirmed its technology leadership in biofuels

industry globally by deploying indigenously produced sustainable

aviation fuel (SAF) blended with Aviation jet fuel (ATJ) in India’s

first ever commercial passenger flight. By collaborating with

major national and international energy companies your company

is building SAF capacities to ready India meet CORSIA mandates.

Energy Transition & Climate Actions has become a strong

development agenda globally to facilitate transition to low carbon

economy. With an array of technology embedded sustainability

solutions, your company is gearing up to service significant

opportunities from global customers.

As a firm believer of the premise that technology has prowess

to change the world for better, your company continues to invest

in developing innovative sustainable solutions. To curb evils

of plastic menace and to support government of India’s single

use ban on plastic Praj has developed technology to produce

bioplastics. As a part of commercialization our first-of-its kind

demo cum pilot plant in Jejuri in outskirts of Pune, will be used for

scaled production of Food Grade Lactic Acid and Polylactic Acid.

To expedite our research technologies for production on SAF, bio

butadiene, and biohydrogen, we are also making investments to

set up “Multipurpose catalysis lab”.

Your company, as a responsible organization, is committed to

enhancing and contributing towards achieving a resilient and

environmentally friendly future for all. As a part of our internal

sustainability system, we monitor several key sustainability

indices aligned with the principles of ESG i.e., Environmental,

Social, and Governance. By embracing Bioeconomy, we can

commence our voyage towards assured sustainability.

Your company is committed to causes that are for the greater

good of society. As yet another demonstration, this year your

company has taken up a project to make village Mandede in

Mulshi district of Pune, Net Zero in two years’ time with active

support from villagers and other stakeholders. With over 650 lac

villages, majority of India’s population lives in villages and this

model project is expected to inspire other villages to undertake

similar initiatives and help India achieve its nationally determined

contributions.

India is on course to become a five trillion-dollar economy by

2026-27 and has ambition to become developed economy by

2047. Your company is committed to help India achieve this

ambitious goal and is accordingly investing in technology, people

and infrastructure.

I remain confident of your continued support in realizing the

company’s vision of making the world a better place.

Dr. Pramod Chaudhari

Executive Chairman

July 2023, Pune:

Dear Shareholders,

I am delighted to present the progress of your Company for FY 2022-

23. Our Revenues on consolidated basis stood at Rs. 35,280.37

million (Rs. 23,432.74 million in FY 2021-22). PAT stood at Rs.

2,398.18 million (Rs. 1,502.420 million in FY2021-22). The Board of

Directors have proposed a final dividend of Rs 4.50 per equity share

for the financial year ended 31 March 2023.

FY 2022-23 was very exciting year for Your company. The year

witnessed challenges around volatile commodity prices, global

inflation, supply chain imbalance. Notwithstanding volatile external

environment, we delivered a very formidable performance on the

back of our single-minded focus on execution excellence and

customer relationships. We also recorded important milestones

such as Inauguration of prestigious 2G ethanol plant at IOCL

Panipat, commissioning of rice straw based high yield CBG project,

successful demonstration of first commercial passenger flight

powered by indigenous sustainable aviation fuels.

Although the global economy is on a weak wicket, Indian economy

showed resilience by recording highest growth among G20 nations,

thanks to domestic demand cycle. Prolonged war in the Europe

continued to overshadow global demand cycle. Although energy

and food crisis has tapered apprehensions over latent inflation risk

remain.

Year was also marred by several climate calamities that served as

a stark reminder about uphill tasks on sustainable climate action.

Energy transition to cleaner and greener energy sources is one of

the most promising sustainable climate actions. Mainstreaming

bioeconomy that utilizes agri based feedstock has emerged as

promising pathway for curbing GHG emissions.

Hard to abate transportation sector is one of the major contributors

to GHG emissions and biofuels as apart of bioeconomy are playing

important role in its decarbonisation. Having crossed 10% blending

target last year, India is taking strides towards achieving 20%

blending by 2025-26. On the other hand, auto OEMs are actively

gearing up for adopting biofuels. This was evidenced during the

flagship India Auto Expo held in Delhi earlier this year when several

leading OEMs showcased flex fuel vehicles. Flex fuel vehicles can

work with ethanol blend of up to 85%.

With rising awareness about minimizing carbon footprint, low carbon

ethanol has emerged as a very promising international opportunity.

Your company is in dialogue with several ethanol producers in USA

to discuss solutions for reducing overall carbon intensity of their

plants.

Your company has successfully commissioned its first 2G ethanol

plant in IOCL Panipat and we have produced the first ethanol. Our

team is now focusing its effort in establishing continuous operations

and reliability enhancement of the plant along with the IOCL team.

Successful commissioning of rice straw based commercial scale

CBG plant at HPCL, Badaun is seen as an important step towards

solving brown clouding issue due to stubble burning in the northern

part of India. This is the first reference plant in the world that

produces CBG using agricultural feedstock.

Indian aviation sector took a leap of faith towards cleaner skies by

powering first ever commercial flight with a blend of indigenously

produced sustainable aviation fuel. The SAF blended in the ATF

was produced by Praj using sugary feedstock. This development

holds great significance in SAF capacity building in India. As

signatory to CORSIA guidelines, India has accepted blending

mandate of SAF from 2027.

To address growing opportunities from Energy Transition &

Climate Action (ETCA) segment, your company has launched

a new subsidiary- Praj GenX Limited to offer cutting edge

modularized solutions as well as critical equipment for various

low carbon fuel projects such as Blue and Green Hydrogen/

ammonia etc. We have earmarked a CAPEX plan of Rs. 100 crores

for setting up a modern manufacturing facility near a major port.

After facing strong headwinds of depressed demand cycles in

past two years, our brewery business is gradually getting back to

pre-covid demand cycles. We are nearing mechanical completion

of ZLD project at IOCL Dhumad which is one of the largest in

country. We have also introduced innovative modularization

approach to our ZLD offerings that is receiving positive response

from our key customer segments.

Praj HiPurity systems is witnessing sustainable growth

opportunities with improved business traction in l fermenters that

are finding very positive response.

With array of innovative industrial biotech solutions in its fold

coupled with execution capabilities and customer centric

approach, your company is well positioned to capitalize on

different growth opportunities.

We are strengthening out talent pool, our most prized asset, to

meet growing business demands. We are investing in imparting

new age skills while exploring newer ways to attract and retain

talent.

I am delighted to share that our Chairman Dr. Pramod Chaudhari

joined a select league of nation’s highly accomplished engineers

by winning prestigious Eminent Engineer Award instituted by

Engineering Council of India (ECI).

I remain grateful for guidance and directions I received from the

members of the Board from time to time. I wish to record my

sincere appreciation of our partners, customers and other and

other stakeholders for the strong support. I thank you my dear

shareholders for your continued belief in Praj’s capabilities and

bright future.

My team and I remain confident to continue to collaborate with

all stakeholders and to lead Praj to its next phase of growth.
