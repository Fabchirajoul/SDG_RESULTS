During FY 2022-23, the profit of the Company was not adequate. The persistent shortage of semiconductors and other electronic components

has hindered revenue growth and reduced capacity utilization in FY 2022-23. Increased costs for raw materials and lower capacity utilisation

have had an effect on the Company’s operating profits.

The Company is mainly involved in the business of manufacturing and providing smart metering solutions.

Government of India is implementing the National Smart Metering Project, under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), with a

plan to install 250 million meters by 2025 with an estimated investment of US$30 bn. This will result in strong order inflows, healthy topline

growth, and a significantly improved working capital cycle for the Company in the coming years.

Genus has been improving the architecture and layout of the AMI software range. It allows us to participate as a strong and capable AMISP (AMI

Service Provider) in the new TOTEX (CAPEX + OPEX) model under the DBFOOT arrangement. With the addition of new product modules and apps

to the software portfolio, there are now more opportunities for System Integrators coming forward.

The Company has also been adopting a robust inventory management system based on adoption of multiple sourcing strategies. In order to

impede the risk of late deliveries of some critical components, the Company has been signing long-term strategic supply agreements with

some key manufacturers & distribution partners. The Company has developed complete forward and backward integration facilities to carry

out manufacturing of sub-parts / assemblies in-house. Adoption of Kraljic Matrix has further been improving supply-chain management of the

Company.

(3) Expected increase in productivity and profits in measurable terms:
