financial

quarter & half

30th

September,

2021

A fine of Rs. 1,45,000/

- plus GST@18%

each was levied on

the Company by the

respective Stock

Exchanges

The Company received email/: letter dated 14th December, 2021 from

BSE and NSE regarding non-submission of the financial results for

the quarter and half year ended 30th September, 2021 (‘Results’) till

the date of such email/letter, which was a non-compliance of

Regulation 33 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, advising the

Company to pay the respective applicable fine of Rs. 1,45,000/- plus

GST@18% to each Stock Exchange. The Company paid the said

fine under protest to BSE and NSE and requested them to waive the

fine levied and refund the amount paid on the grounds that, as was

already communicated to the respective Stock Exchanges, the delay

in submission of the Results was due to reasons beyond the control

of the Company. The Company had earlier sought additional time for

preparation/finalization of the results, since its subsidiary, Titagarh

Firema S.p.A., Italy, on an entirely unavoidable ground, was awaiting

the sanction of one-time debt restructuring by its Banker in accordance

with the applicable regulations of their local government for a situation

having arisen out of the pandemic and had requested for additional

time to provide its quarterly and half yearly results which have to be

consolidated with the Results of the Company.

Further, the Company received another letter dated 30th December,

2021 from NSE levying the fine of Rs. 190,000/- + GST@18% for

delay in submission of the said Results by 38 days from its due date

(i.e. Rs. 5000 per day/fine amount). Since the Company had earlier

paid the fine levied for 29 days, the differential amount of Rs. 45,000/

- + GST@18% was paid by the Company to NSE on 5th January,

2022.

The Company by its letter(s) to BSE and NSE had informed that it

had already submitted letters to SEBI and the Stock Exchanges for

extension of time for submission of the financial results for the Quarter

ended March 2020 and June 2020 respectively on the grounds

interalia that the order sanctioning the Scheme of Amalgamation of

Cimmco Limited and Titagarh Capital Private Limited with the

Company was expected within a short time and will enable giving

effect to the merger of subsidiaries in the accounts of the Company

from the Appointed Date i.e. April 01, 2019 thereby facilitating

reflection of correct financial position of the Company on standalone

and consolidated basis; and the extension of time for submission of

the Results after giving effect to the amalgamation therein will facilitate

publication of financials such that there will be no confusion in the

minds of the shareholders and other stakeholders regarding financial

position of the Company. Further, while considering the Company’s

application for the extension of time for submission of the aforesaid

financial results, the concerned officer of SEBI had advised that

considering the facts of the case, should the stock exchange(s) were

to demand fine/penalty for delay in submission of the financial results,

then the Company should submit response to the said stock exchange

requesting for waiver of fine/penalty and that SEBI would advise the

stock exchange to waive the fine/penalty and not take any

consequential action.. In view of the same, the Company requested

BSE and NSE not to take any consequential action in that regard.

The aforesaid Scheme of Amalgamation was sanctioned on 30th

September, 2020 and the Company submitted the Results for the

Quarter/Year ended 31st March 2020 to the Stock Exchanges on 8th

October, 2020. BSE by an email dated 27th July, 2021 informed that

the Company was liable to a basic fine of Rs. 3,35,000/- plus

GST@18% for the delayed submission of Results for the Quarter/

Year ended 31st March 2020, however the Company’s representation

for waiver of fine was placed before its relevant Committee and after

considering the facts of the case, the written submissions made by

the company, the Committee decided to partially accede to the request

for waiver of fines and advised the Company to pay a basic fine of

Rs. 40,000/- plus GST@18%, which was paid by the Company. NSE

is yet to respond for the Company’s request for waiver of fine on the

subject.
