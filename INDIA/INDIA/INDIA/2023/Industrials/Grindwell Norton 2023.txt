Managing Director, assesses the financial performance and position of the Group and makes

strategic decisions.

Q. Government grants

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be

received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Government grants relating to purchase of property, plant and equipment are included in non-current liabilities as deferred

income and are credited to profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets and

presented within other income.

r. leases

as a lessee

The Group mainly has lease arrangements for land and building (office premises and warehouses).

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. This assessment involves the

exercise of judgement about whether there is an identified asset, whether the Group has the right to direct the use of the

asset and whether the Group obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement date. The

lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement

date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses

an incremental borrowing rate specific to the Country, term and currency of the contract. Generally, the Group uses its

incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for

any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of

costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset on the site on which it is located,

less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method

from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease

term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and

equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain

re-measurements of the lease liability.

Lease liability is accounted at amortised cost. The lease liabilities are adjusted for the lease payments made by the Group.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. Finance cost is charged to profit and loss over the lease

period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. In case

of changes in the future lease payments due to renegotiation, changes of an index or rate, the lease liability is remeasured

(with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset).

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets: The Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease

liabilities for short term leases as well as low value assets.

as a lessor

Lease income from operating leases where the Group is a lessor is recognised in income on a straight line basis over the

lease term. The respective leased assets are included in the balance sheet based on their nature.:

Managing Director assesses the financial performance and position of the Company and makes strategic

decisions.
