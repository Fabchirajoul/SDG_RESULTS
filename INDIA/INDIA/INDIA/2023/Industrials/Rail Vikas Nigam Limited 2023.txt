The Company has been making concerted efforts

to implement the directives of the Government

letter dated

23.07.2019 with regard to borrowing of materials

from the PIUs/Railways. The: letter, however,

contains detailed provision with respect to

taking of material on loan from other PIUs

and doesn’t give any details/procedure to be

followed for taking material on loan from the

Railways. The policy regarding disposal of

surplus material dated 20.07.2016 (procedure

order for management of projects material

including disposal of surplus material), however,

gives procedure for transfer of excess material to

railways in details.Detailed provisions including

the procedure to be followed by the PIUs should

be made with respect to taking of material on

loan from the Railways in case of exigency.

Reconciliation of all such material may be done

periodically (time period to be satisfied) within

in the PIU and also with the concerned Zonal

Railway.

is drawn to CVC’s OM dated 25.11.2021, where

in “RVNL is advised to explore the possibility of

implementing/extending the policy of rotation

of officials in the headquarters as well in the

filed units in a transparent manner”.In above

suggested:-

During

investigation of a Complaint related to alleged

irregularities

in

“RE

Works

between

Rani

to Palanpur”, Ahmedabad PIU of RVNL has

furnished that imposition of penalty of Rs. 1.61

Cr. approx. on M/s NMTPL for non-deployment of

key personnel’s as per contract as proposed by

PMC is yet to be recovered due to final decision

pending at RVNL HQ.Further, from the reply of

PIU, it has emerged that due to communication

gap between PMC and M/s KEC relating to

MRC of incoming material and pressure of

commissioning, erection of steel was done prior

to issue of MRC and there is no penal clause

envisaged in the contract for this lapse since the

steel used for erection was RITES inspected and

only left out for MRC.

To avoid recurrence of such lapses in other cases

in future, following system improvement is

recommended for implementation:

(i)

Decision on penalty from contractor’s bill

as proposed by PMC should be given in a

time-bound manner without keeping the

issue in limbo for an indefinite period (at

Corporate Office as well as at PIU) to avoid

manipulation at later stage.

(ii) Proper

procedure

order

to

be

issued

regarding “Inspection, MRC and Erection

of steel/other materials” to avoid erection

of

material

without

inspection/MRC.

Moreover, appropriate penal clause must

be incorporated in the tender for fixing

accountability on both executing agency as

well as on PMC for lapses such as erection of

steel without MRC.

Necessary guidelines in this regard may kindly

be issued under intimation to this office.

2.20 Fair Value Measurement

Company measures financial instruments at fair

value at each reporting date. Fair value is the price

that would be received to sell an asset or paid to

transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between

market participants at the measurement date. The

fair value measurement is based on the presumption

that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the

liability takes place either:

•

in the principal market for the asset or liability or

•

in the absence of a principal market in the most

advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must

be accessible to the company. The fair value of an

asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions

that market participants would use when pricing the

asset or liability assuming that market participants

act in their economic best interest. The company

uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in

the circumstances and for which sufficient data are

available to measure fair value maximizing the use of

relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of

unobservable inputs.
