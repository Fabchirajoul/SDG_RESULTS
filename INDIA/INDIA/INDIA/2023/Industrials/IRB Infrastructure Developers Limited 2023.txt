Dear Stakeholders,

Following a humble beginning in the year 1998, IRB

went on to list in the year 2008. 25 years later, with

immense support from all stakeholders, IRB Group

today has 3 listed entities, an Asset base of around

I 70,000 Crores, 13,739 lane kms under management,

20% share of India’s Golden Quadrilateral, 37% market

share of TOT projects across the country and enjoys the

backing of marquee Investors (Cintra and GIC) to help it

realise its growth potential.

Presently, we operate 64 toll plazas, service 736 FASTag

lanes and cater to more than 1.3 million vehicles on

a daily basis.

We are pleased to share an interesting data point that

we recently came across. Gross toll collection across

India for the Financial Year 2023 was approximately

H 48,000 Crores. The toll revenue that IRB group has

collected across the listed company and the two InvITs

was close to H 5,000 Crores, which is around eleven

percent market share of the total toll revenue collected

across India. This number is growing at robust pace with

increasing traffic, tariffs and the addition of new assets.

The toll revenue that IRB group

has collected across the listed

company and the two InvITs

was close to J 5,000 Crores,

which is around eleven percent

market share of the total toll

revenue collected across India.

Global developments including geopolitical escalation

and recalibration of supply chains have led to a

significant increase in inflation across the globe

including India. This has been a threat to all businesses

across the world. Fortunately, for IRB, Inflation-linked

tariff revision acts as a natural hedge against interest

rate hikes. For example, the Ahmedabad-Vadodara BOT

project and nine assets of the Private InvIT received a

tariff revision of ~10% in line with inflation from April

1, 2022. During the current financial year, we have also

witnessed good traffic growth across the portfolio. The

combination of tariff revisions and traffic growth has

enabled us to deliver an improved performance in the

financial year under review.

We are pleased to inform you that we have successfully

achieved completion for all the nine projects that were

transferred to the Private InvIT in the initial phase.

Following the completion of the Kishangarh-Gulabpura

and Hapur-Moradabad projects the toll rates for

these SPVs have seen an increase of 78% and 65%

respectively. As most of the assets of Private InvIT have

achieved completion, we expect to receive regular pay-

out from Private InvIT to IRB from the financial year.

Successful award of two projects enhancing

visibility of growth

Taking forward the growth momentum, we bagged two

projects during the financial year, i.e. the upgradation

project for 6 laning of NH27 from Samakhiyali to

Santalpur having a project cost of H 2,132 Crores and

concession life of 20 years on BOT basis from NHAI in the

state of Gujarat. The project will be funded by debt of

approximately H 1,450 Crores and balance through equity

and internal accruals (IRB's share of equity is less than

H 300 Crores).

The second award is for a prestigious project in the

state of Telangana. The scope encompasses TOT for the

Hyderabad Outer Ring Road (ORR) project comprising

an 8-lane highway, starting at kilometre 0 at Narsingi

junction and ending at kilometre 158 at Gachibowli in

Hyderabad, in the state of Telangana on upfront payment

of H 7,380 Crores for a concession period of 30 years. The

total Capex will be H 8,362 crores which will be funded

by debt of H 5,500 Crores and balance through equity

of H 2,862 Crores. Since the project is to be executed

through the Private InvIT, IRB's share will be close to

H 1,500 Crores and the remainder will be contributed by

our financial partner (GIC).

The total order book of the Company as on June 30,

2023 is H 33,708 Crores including the Hyderabad ORR

project. EPC order book is close to H 8,423 Crores

providing good revenue visibility for the next 2-3 years

for the construction segment and further bolstered by a

3 years' executable O&M order which is close to H 2,500

Crores to H 3,000 Crores. This marquee Hyderabad TOT

project not only provides visibility for toll revenue but

also adds a significant long-duration O&M order book

which provides visibility for the construction segment

as well.

Return optimisation strategy with optimal

debt equity mix

Following the raising of growth capital in the prior

financial year, we have repaid debt and significantly

reduced leverage. On a consolidated basis, the

debt-equity ratio is less than 0.8:1 which is one of the

best for asset developers in the sector. Further, CRISIL

has upgraded the rating of the Company by a couple of

notches. This has led to a change in the Long term rating

from A to AA-.

Leveraging the strengthened financial position and

improved rating, in line with our return optimisation

strategy, we have refinanced 3 BOT project SPVs

i.e. Solapur-Yedeshi, Yedeshi-Aurangabad and

Udaipur-Shamlaji of the Private InvIT, reducing/fixing the

rates for 5 years. We will be saving an additional cash

surplus of I 550 Crores over the period of 5 years.

We are pleased to inform you that we

have successfully achieved completion

for all the nine projects which were

transferred to the Private InvIT in the

initial phase.

Chairman and: Managing

Managing Director

Outlook

With the continued thrust on infrastructure and asset

creation by the Government, we see a steady pipeline

of opportunities arising across the landscape. IRB will

selectively bid for BOT, TOT and HAM projects in that order

of preference. From an execution standpoint, BOT and TOT

projects will be housed in the Private InvIT which is the

development platform of the Group. Any HAM assets will

be housed in IRB during the construction phase and will be

monetised post-completion. The Public InvIT will enjoy the

right of first refusal for the HAM Assets. The EPC and O&M of

all the projects will be undertaken by IRB.

This uniquely designed operating model reduces the capital

requirements for IRB Infra to 51% of the Equity Component

as 49% of the equity component is contributed by GIC

Affiliates, our partner in the Private InvIT. Further, with the

monetisation strategy we can continue to unlock capital

and churn it into future projects. In addition to our strong

financial position, the favourable outlook for both toll

revenues and our construction business will provide further

resources for growth. Needless to say, your Company is

Summary of significant accounting policies

3.01 Basis of consolidation

Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose

entities) that are controlled by the Company. Control exists

when the Group is exposed to, or has the ability to affect

those returns through power over the entity. In assessing

control, potential voting rights are considered only if

the rights are substantive. The consolidated financial

statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have

been combined on a line-by-line basis while eliminating

the carrying amount of the parent’s investment in each

subsidiary and the parent’s portion of equity of each

subsidiary. The financial statements of subsidiaries are

included in these consolidated financial statements

from the date that control commences until the date

that control ceases. For the purpose of preparing these

consolidated financial statements, the accounting policies

of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary

to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.

Upon loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets

and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling

interests and the other components of equity related to

the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss

of control is recognised in the consolidated statement of

profit and loss. If the Group retains any interest in the

previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair

value at the date that control is lost and the differential

is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit

and loss. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity

accounted investee depending on the level of influence

retained.

The financial statements of each of the subsidiaries used

for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same

reporting date as that of the Company, i.e., year ended

on March 31.

Consolidation procedure:

i.

Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity,

income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with

those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income

and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the

amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised

in the consolidated financial in the consolidated

financial statements at the acquisition date.

ii.

Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent’s

investment in each subsidiary and the parent’s portion

of equity of each subsidiary. Business combinations

policy explains how to account for any related

goodwill.

iii.

Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities,

equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to

transactions between entities of the group (profits

or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that

are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed

assets, are eliminated in full, except as stated in point

iv. Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that

requires recognition in the consolidated financial

statements. Ind AS12 Income Taxes applies to

temporary differences that arise from the elimination

Summary of significant accounting policies

3.01 Current versus non-current classification

The Company has identified twelve months as its operating

cycle. The operating cycle is the time between the

acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation

in cash and cash equivalents.

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance

sheet based on current/ non-current classification.

An asset is treated as current when it is:

• Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or

consumed in normal operating cycle

• Held primarily for the purpose of trading

• Expected to be realised within twelve months after the

reporting period, or

• Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being

exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve

months after the reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

All liability is current when:

• It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle

• It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

• It is due to be settled within twelve months after the

reporting period, or

• There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement

of the liability for at least twelve months after the

reporting period

The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as

non-current assets and liabilities.

3.02 Foreign currency translations

The Company’s financial statements are presented in INR,

which is also the Company’s functional currency.

Transactions and balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by

the Company at their functional currency spot rates at the

date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign

currencies are translated at the functional currency spot

rates of exchange at the reporting date.

Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation

of monetary items are recognised in the statement of

profit and loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of

historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using

the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.

Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign

currency are translated using the exchange rates at the

date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss

arising on translation of non-monetary items measured

at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the

gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e.,

translation differences on items whose fair value gain
