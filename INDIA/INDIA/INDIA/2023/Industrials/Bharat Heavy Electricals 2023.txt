Credit (LC). The project duration ranges from 3 to 5 years and payments are generally realised in stages as per the terms of the

contract including advance, progress payments, milestone (including intermediate) payments and also retentions which are

released on completion of such projects. Since majority customers' profile pertains to Government sector, constituting 80%

of total receivables coupled with the fact that the company itself is a CPSE, credit risk is relatively low. In respect of private

sector customers , the payment terms are mainly through LC. The company has well established review mechanism for

receivables at various levels within organisation to ensure proper attention and focus for realisation in line with the company

policies, procedures and guidelines.The company uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or gain and

the disclosure of the same is made elsewhere. Further, adequate provisions are maintained to address any eventuality.:

Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors

The amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of

a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition,

accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities

develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that

involves measurement uncertainty.The Company does not expect the amendment to have any significant impact in its

financial statements.

Credit (LC). The project duration ranges from 3 to 5 years and payments are generally realised in stages as per the terms of the

contract including advance, progress payments, milestone (including intermediate) payments and also retentions which are

released on completion of such projects. Since majority customers' profile pertains to Government sector, constituting 80% of

total receivables coupled with the fact that the company itself is a CPSE, credit risk is relatively low. In respect of private sector

customers , the payment terms are mainly through LC. The company has well established review mechanism for receivables

at various levels within organisation to ensure proper attention and focus for realisation in line with the company policies,

procedures and guidelines.The company uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or gain and the disclosure

of the same is made elsewhere. Further, adequate provisions are maintained to address any eventuality.
