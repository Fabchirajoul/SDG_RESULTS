Dear Shareholders,

I am delighted to present the performance of Engineers India Ltd

(EIL) during its 58th year of dedicated service to our nation. In a

year marked by resilience, recovery, and rejuvenation of the Indian

economy, EIL has stood as a potential contributor to India's economic

development and social progress. This achievement would not have

been possible without the collective efforts of our government,

citizens, and stakeholders.

As India's premier Engineering Consultancy company, role of EIL has

been instrumental in shaping the national energy infrastructure for

almost six decades. Mega project implementation in the oil & gas

sector has been EIL’s core business. Vizag Refinery Modernisation

Project (VRMP) of HPCL, HPCL Rajasthan Refinery project (HRRL)

having the highest petrochemical intensity of around 25%, Capacity

expansion project of IOCL-Panipat, Cauvery Basin Refinery (CBR)

project for CPCL with the combined capital outlay of around $20

billion are some of the recent testimonies of EIL’s mega project

implementation in the domestic market. It is worth mentioning that

one of the biggest petrochemical integration projects of HPCL Mittal

Energy Limited (HMEL) with the capital cost of around $3 billion being

implemented by EIL has been completed. In the petrochemical sector,

EIL is also implementing first of its kind Propane Dehydrogenation-

Polypropylene (PDH-PP) unit in India for GAIL. These multibillion-

dollar projects clearly demonstrate EIL’s strong domestic presence in

the oil & gas sector.

Likewise, EIL has significantly expanded its business in new

geographies which include Dangote Oil Refinery Project (DORC)

in Nigeria having total capital outlay of almost $20 billion with

highest single train refining capacity in the world. The company is

also providing Project Management Consultancy (PMC) services for

1.5 MMTPA Mongol Refinery project in Mongolia on Line of Credit

(LoC) from the Govt of India. This project showcases EIL’s project

implementation capabilities in adverse climate and challenging global

business environment.

EIL has played a pivotal role in executing the nationwide natural gas

pipeline network under the Urja Ganga Pipeline Project of the Govt

of India. It is aimed to increase the share of natural gas in the nation’s

energy mix from currently around 6% to 15% by the year 2030.

In previous years, EIL has contributed significantly in executing major

energy efficient infrastructure projects in the country with focus on

LEED and GRIHA compliant Green Buildings for academic institutions,

state of the art Data centres, Airports, High speed railways in various

engagement models. Data centre for State Bank of India, IIM Nagpur
