Dear Shareholders,

I have great pleasure in informing you that your Company has achieved

excellent results last year. Considering the uncertain industry outlook

which loomed at the beginning of the year, the performance truly

exemplifies the immense resilience Ashok Leyland possesses in braving

the odds and emerging successfully. I would like to, on your behalf,

congratulate and thank the entire team in Ashok Leyland and its wider

ecosystem for their conscientious efforts to make it possible.

Reflecting on our endeavour last year, it can be noted that our journey

has not been an easy one. There was volatility in commodity prices

which pushed up costs, that could not be fully recovered in pricing

due to unprecedented competitive pressures. Due to a combination of

economic factors, the commercial vehicle industry had yet to gather

momentum in the latter part of FY22 and the residual effect remained

well into the initial period of FY23. Amid this turmoil, which had an

impact on our market share and profitability, Ashok Leyland team

quickly rejigged its product-market efforts, revamped the customer

orientation and was able to realise the high aspirations that were set.

While stability in the market from the second half of the year buoyed

up the sentiment to an extent, our key success factors were superior

product performance, clinical efforts in cost reduction and above all

the “can do – will do” attitude of the Ashok Leyland team.

To enumerate some of the high points across business units,



We sold 114,247 Medium and Heavy commercial vehicles in the

domestic market comprising 10,767 buses and 103,480 trucks

including Defence vehicles, registering a growth of 75.5% and

posting a market share increase of approximately 5% over the

previous year, closing at 31.8%. It is gratifying that we have

gained share in every region and in almost all the product sub-

segments, attributable to the superior performance of AVTR

models, focused network development and additional thrust

given on customer centricity.



Our used vehicle business – ReAL- made good progress during

the year as was expected.



In the Light vehicle segment, with sales of 66,669 vehicles, the

growth was 27.7% over the previous year. The Bada Dost range

posted its highest ever sales volume since introduction and was

awarded ‘Pick up of the Year’ and a special edition model was

awarded the ‘Marketing campaign of the year’ by ET Now and

World Leadership Congress.



Despite difficult market situation in target countries which faced

issues of currency depreciation and forex availability, International

Operations could achieve a growth of 2% year over year. We

expanded the reach by adding distributors in 12 countries and

launched 5 new products and their variants.



Power Solutions and Aftermarket businesses had clocked a

growth of 9% and 31% respectively in FY23.



Backing this spectacular market performance, the Operations

team kept pace with the highest ever LCV production and the

highest monthly overall vehicles production along with the

highest ever material cost savings.

All these helped us achieve an all-time high revenue of ` 36,144

Crores with a 67% growth over previous year along with nearly 3

times growth in EBITDA – from ` 995 Crores in FY22 to ` 2,931 Crores,

operating profit grew by 120 times and a cash surplus of ₹ 243 Crores

at the end of FY23.

On the product and technology front, which is our passion, we are

making good progress in alternate propulsion development. At the

Auto Expo held in Delhi in January this year, a wide range of alternate

fuel driven products were displayed across our LCV, ICV and MDV

platforms. This covered CNG, LNG, Hydrogen, Fuel Cell and Battery

Electric options. Switch Mobility, through which we are positioning the

electric vehicles, has gained considerable momentum in FY23 and has

already made a mark in the industry. The electric LCV is slated for

introduction later this year.

Recognising the importance of building a talent pipeline in an

environment of homogenous culture, our HR team was on an overdrive

launching several initiatives and cascading them across the board. These

initiatives include defining the organisation purpose as “Transforming

Lives & Businesses through Leadership in Mobility” and driving a new

culture throughout the organisation. Preparing future leaders saw the

introduction of a new AL-Young Talent Program and the AL-Emerging

Leaders Program. Another significant milestone in our gender diversity

pathway is the establishing of an all women-run engine assembly line

in our Hosur plant.

I would like to take this opportunity to present some of the key

initiatives in other areas that are relevant to our business. Our plants

have won 13 CII-Environment, Health, and Safety Excellence Awards.

Use of renewable solar power is at the top of the agenda. Renewable

energy now constitutes 57% of our total requirement. Furthermore,

your Company believes sustainability is key to its overall strategy and is

consciously moving from compliance to competitiveness in the overall

ESG approach. And as part of a holistic approach to sustainability, your

Company has developed an ESG vision: “To create and lead sustainable

practices, across Environment, Social and Governance initiatives,

delivering outstanding stakeholder value.” This vision has been further

operationalized into 10 Focus areas deep diving individually in E, S, and

G areas. Moving forward, your Company is also preparing for some

major commitments around becoming carbon-neutral in its operations

in the medium term and becoming Net Zero in the long term.

STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY FOR THE YEAR

ENDED MARCH 31, 2023:

Letter

of credit and other forms. The Company’s trade and other receivables consists of a large number of customers, across geographies,

hence the Company is not exposed to concentration risk except in case of a STU.

The Company makes a loss allowance using simplified approach for expected credit loss (ECL) and on a case to case basis.

ECL are the weighted average of credit losses with the expected risk of default occurring as the weights (historically not significant).

ECL is difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance with the contract and all the cash

flows that the Company expects to receive.

Expected credit loss for other than trade receivables has been assessed and based on life-time expected credit loss, loss allowance

provision has been made. The ageing on trade receivable is given in Note 1.10.

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings.

(C)

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is

to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Company has obtained fund and

non-fund based working capital limits from various banks. Furthermore, the Company has access to funds from debt markets through

commercial paper programs, non-convertible debentures, and other debt instruments. The Company invests its surplus funds in bank

fixed deposit and mutual funds, which carry minimal mark to market risks.
