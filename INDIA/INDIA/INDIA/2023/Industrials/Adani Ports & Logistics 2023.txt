Dear shareholders,

A few months ago, I heard a new term called Permacrisis. I learnt that the

Collins dictionary had defined it as ‘An extended period of instability and

insecurity’. It also chose it as the Word for the Year 2022. Interestingly, I also

learnt that two other words that were in the running for the top spot were ‘quiet

quitting’, which meant doing the bare minimum duties at work (in rejection of

competitive careerism) and ‘vibe shift’, which meant a significant change in the

prevailing culture. What I find fascinating is that in the post-Covid world, these

words accurately summarise changes that we see happening around us.

The government is working towards achieving

complete integration between PCS 1x, a cloud-based

new generation technology, and Indian Customs EDI

Gateway (ICEGATE) for seamless data exchange.

Additionally, RFID solutions have been implemented

at all key ports to facilitate uninterrupted movement

of traffic across port gates and reduce the need

for extensive documentation checks. The Ministry

of Ports, Shipping and Waterways has set up an

Enterprise Business System (EBS) at five major ports

in India (Mumbai, Chennai, Deendayal, Paradip, and

Kolkata, including Haldia Port), with an estimated

cost of H320 crore. The EBS aims to provide a digital

port ecosystem that adopts leading international

practices while remaining aligned with local needs.

As part of the EBS implementation, a total of 2,474

processes were standardized, resulting in a final

count of 162 redesigned processes.

Dedicated freight corridor: The Dedicated Freight

Corridor (DFC) project, being executed by the Ministry

of Railways, aims to plan, develop, mobilize financial

resources, construct, maintain, and operate rail

corridors dedicated to freight transportation across

India. The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation

of India Ltd. is responsible for this project, and its

primary mission includes:



The Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) project aims

to construct corridors equipped with relevant

technology that would enable Indian Railways to

recapture their market share of freight transport

by developing additional capacity and ensuring

effective, dependable, secured, and economical

options for mobility to their customers.



Multimodal logistic parks are being constructed

along the Dedicated Freight Corridor to provide

customers with a complete transport solution.



Promoting the use of railways as the most eco-

friendly mode of transportation and supporting

the government’s initiatives towards ecological

sustainability.

The DFC project comprises of two corridors: the

Eastern Corridor and the Western Corridor. These

corridors span a total of 3,360 kilometers with the

Eastern DFC stretching from Ludhiana in Punjab to

Dankuni in West Bengal and the Western DFC from

Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai to Dadri in Uttar

Pradesh. The impact of the DFCs is already visible in

the sections where operations have started as can

be seen in reduced transit times of freight times and

increased running speeds. APSEZ has considerable

focus on the freight corridors and running double

stack trains on the DFC on a daily basis. We have 2

terminals (ICD Patli and ICD Tumb) notified for direct

connectivity to the WDFC and more terminals are

planned at strategic locations on the DFC.

More corridors are being proposed namely – East

Coast Corridor, East-West corridor and the North

South Corridor seeing the success of the WDFC and

EDFC. These corridors are expected to enhance

the connectivity between various clusters and thus

improve logistics efficiency for the industry
