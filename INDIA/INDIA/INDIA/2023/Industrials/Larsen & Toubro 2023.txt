Dear Shareholders

There is an air of sustained optimism in India even as

the world grapples with economic uncertainties. The

vision of the Government and the indomitable spirit

of Indians seem to be propelling the country forward.

This has been made possible through a nuanced

combination of structural reforms, prudent regulatory

actions and smart policy manoeuvring. During the

year under review, your Company has performed well

and continues to excel in the areas of infrastructure,

hi-tech manufacturing and tech-driven services. It also

Managing Director. My

association with your Company, however, will continue as

Chairman Emeritus and as Chairman of LTIM and LTTS.

In a symbolic gesture, I will be handing over the L&T

flag to Mr. Subrahmanyan, and bestowing on him the

attendant honour, responsibilities and challenges which

come with the position. This is succession planning in the

full sense of the term, and the change of guard at L&T

could well rank among the smoothest in Indian industry.

Looking back, I consider myself privileged to have had the

opportunity to serve, lead and transform the Company

that is building the India of the next century. As I have said

on multiple occasions before, my life and legacy are L&T,

and I am happy and content that I will be leaving it in very

capable hands to continue its exemplary record of service

to the nation and society.

Jai Hind!
