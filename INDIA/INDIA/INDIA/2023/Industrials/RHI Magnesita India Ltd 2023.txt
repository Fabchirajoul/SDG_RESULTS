RHI Magnesita India Limited

Annual Report 2022-23

2:

Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present to you the

annual report of RHI Magnesita

India Ltd. for the financial year

ended 31 March, 2023.

Despite the challenges posed

by macro-economic volatility

and geo-political tensions,

RHI Magnesita India Ltd. has

sustained its growth and

performed well during the year.

We have continued to strengthen

our position as a leading

refractory company, driven by

our commitment to innovation,

customer focus, and operational

excellence.

Birth of a Responsible

Market Leader

In the latter part of the financial

year, the company successfully

completed two strategic

acquisitions in the refractory

business, to strengthen its

long-term growth strategy.

The first acquisition was the

Indian refractory business of

Dalmia Bharat Refractories

Limited (“DBRL”), completed

on 6 January, 2023 through a

share swap consideration. The

second acquisition was Hi-Tech

Chemicals’ refractory business,

completed on 31 January, 2023

through a slump sale as a going

concern. These acquisitions

would expand the company’s

product portfolio and strengthen

its position in the Indian market,

as well as for exports. We believe

that these acquisitions will create

a strong platform for growth and

help the company to achieve its

long-term objectives. Subsequent

to the integration of the two

leading refractory makers with

RHI Magnesita India (“RHIM”),

the company has emerged as the

market leader that aims to act as

a responsible leader that would

continue to invest in innovative

technologies to build a sustainable

business.

Continued Growth

During the year, RHIM successfully

implemented several initiatives to

enhance its production capability

and efficiency, while maintaining

high standards of quality and

safety. Our investments in making

import substitute products through

technology exchange with the

parent company have also yielded

promising results, enabling us to

offer innovative and sustainable

solutions to meet the evolving

needs of our customers.

In the year ended 31 March, 2023,

your company’s revenue grew 37%

year-on-year to ` 27,263 million,

while Adjusted EBITDA grew

11.5% to ` 4,388 million. Though,

impairment of investment in a

subsidiary and cost of integration

of the two new acquisitions

adversely impacted the PAT, which

is expected to be of one-time in

nature.

Dr. Vijay Sharma

Chairman

Chairman’s

Message:

Dear Shareholders,

In FY2022-23 your company

remained committed to further

strengthening its market

leadership in India. We ramped up

our capacity with the acquisition

of the two leading refractory

businesses in India. These

acquisitions will help us serve our

customers in India with a local

-for- local approach and give

fillip to our strategic ambitions

of evolving the country as the

refractory products, R&D and

service hub to serve the markets

globally in the long run. With

an unrivaled product range,

production footprint, talent

pool and reach to service our

customers, we are now well on

track towards realizing that. Thank

you for your continued support

and trust on us through this

journey.

We aspire to be a responsible

market leader that would continue

to drive innovation in the industry.

Be the sustainability frontrunner

and empower our people and

partners to deliver world-class

products and services. We are on

a mission to rise together with all

our stakeholders to create shared

value and continue to bring in

positive changes to our industry,

customers and everyone who

depends on us.

The Integration

The acquisitions brought to us

the challenge of integrating

the newly acquired businesses

– people, culture, processes,

products, policies. The biggest

integration in the history of the

Indian refractory industry. We saw

this as an opportunity – to bring in

the best from the three businesses

and create a greater organization

that is stronger and more efficient

to serve its customers. To tap

this opportunity, we had set up

Project Milan that was aimed

at amalgamating the best of

three companies to build a new

integrated RHI Magnesita India.

The focus of the project were our

Customers, People, Processes and

Network. The project team did all

the hard and smart work to deliver

on the synergy expectations in

each of these areas successfully.

The integration remains ongoing

and as we proceed further, you

would start seeing the synergy

realizations in our business

performance.

Improving Operational

Efficiencies

While we continue realizing the

synergies out of the integration,

your company has prioritized

some key areas to focus on to drive

future growth. The integration

has given us a well distributed

network of plants across the

country. Operational efficiency

building, particularly of the

newly acquired plants, through

Company Secretary

(ACS-17021):

Managing Director has

been identified as being the Chief Operating Decision Maker

(“CODM”). CODM evaluates the performance of the Group

based on the single operative segment for the purpose of

allocation resources and evaluating financial performance.

2.19 Revenue recognition

At the inception of the contract, the Group identifies the goods

or services promised in the contract and assesses which of

the promised goods or services shall be identified as separate

performance obligations. Promised goods or services give

rise to separate performance obligations if they are capable of

being distinct. Where the customer expects supply of refractory

material and its related services together to produce the steel,

the management has determined that both supply of goods and

services are not distinct and the arrangement is considered to

have only one single performance obligation.

Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is

measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable

consideration) allocated to that performance obligation, which

is the expected consideration to be received, to the extent that

it is highly probable that there will not be a significant reversal

of revenue in future periods. If the consideration in a contract

includes a variable amount, at the inception of the contract, the

Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be

entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services to the

customer.

(i) Sale of products

The Group manufactures and sells a range of refractories,

monolithics, bricks and ceramic paper. Revenue from sale

of products is recognised when the control of the products

has transferred, being when the products are delivered

to the customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation that

could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products.

Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to

the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have

been transferred to the customer, and either the customer

has accepted the products in accordance with the sales

contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the

Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance

have been satisfied. No significant element of financing is

deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term

of 30 days to 90 days, which is consistent with market

practice. A receivable is recognised when the goods are

delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is

unconditional because only the passage of time is required

before the payment is due.

(ii) Total Refractories Management Services

Revenue from contracts for total refractory management

services is recognized over time on basis using the output-

oriented method (e.g. quantity of steel produced by the

customer). The management has determined that both

supply of goods and services are not distinct as the customer

expects total refractory management services from the

Group, which includes supply of refractory material and its

related services to produce steel, thus, the arrangement is

only one single performance obligation.

(iii) Sale of Services

Revenue from services is recognised over time, using an

input method to measure progress towards completion of

service, because the customer simultaneously receives and

consumes the benefits provided by the Group.

The Group recognises contract liabilities for consideration

received in respect of unsatisfied performance obligations

and reports these amounts as other liabilities. Similarly, if the

Group satisfies a performance obligation before it receives the

consideration, the Group recognises either a contract asset or

a receivable, depending on whether something other than the

passage of time is required before the consideration is due.

2.20 Government grants

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value

where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be

received and the Group will comply with required conditions.
