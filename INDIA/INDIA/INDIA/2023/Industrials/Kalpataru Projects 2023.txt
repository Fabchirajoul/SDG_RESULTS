Dear Shareholders,

As we embark on our 29th year of

value creation for our stakeholders, I

am pleased to showcase the progress

and growth that your organisation

has achieved.

The financial year 2022-23 was marred

by worldwide economic uncertainty. The

war in Ukraine triggered a geopolitical

crisis that exacted a heavy toll on global

economic activity. It exacerbated the

global supply chain disruptions, further

increasing an already elevated inflation

rate. Soaring commodity and logistic

costs as well as currency fluctuations

during the year somewhat impacted our

execution and financial performance.

Nevertheless, we delivered strong

consolidated revenue growth of 11%,

amalgamation of JMC

with KPIL has resulted

in the creation of one

of India’s largest listed

diversified Engineering

and Construction

companies. Today, KPIL

is amongst India’s top

listed EPC companies

with footprint across 70

countries.

letter dated October 7, 2021 to the National

Highways Authority of India (“NHAI”) on account of

continuous disruption and blockade of traffic at National

Highway-71 due to farmer agitation with stoppage of toll

collection that resulted into cash losses. The provisions

of Concession Agreement provide for termination where

events which are not in control of KEPL, and obliges

NHAI paying KEPL for repayment of Debt Due along with

Adjusted Equity after necessary adjustments. However,

pending receipt of final termination payment from NHAI,

KEPL could not pay the loan and interest to its lenders

in October 2021 and consequently the outstanding

amount of loan and interest was classified as NPA (Non-

performing asset) by the lenders.

Upon receipt of termination payment and other claims

filed against NHAI, KEPL believes that it will be able to

meet its liabilities. KEPL has received a copy of the: letter

dated February 3, 2022 from an Independent Engineer

(“IE”) appointed by NHAI in which the IE has sought to

limit the amount payable (net of other deductions) as

“Termination Payment”. KEPL do not agree to it.

Although, the Company and other promoter of KEPL

have, jointly and severally given ‘shortfall undertakings’ to

the Senior Lenders in case there is any shortfall between

amounts received from NHAI and that payable by KEPL

to its lenders, however, upon receipt of termination

payment and other claims filed against NHAI and based

on management’s assessment and legal advice, KEPL

believes that it will be able to meet its liabilities.

The Company has made provision for impairment of

its entire Equity investment in KEPL, expected credit

loss against the entire amount of loan given (including

amount paid on behalf of other promoter) to KEPL and

potential shortfall, if any.

The Company has made above provisions without

prejudice to its and KEPL legal rights and claims against

NHAI and will continue to pursue these amounts against

KEPL. Further, it will seek KEPL to pursue their claims

and termination payment against NHAI notwithstanding

the above recognition.

of H 160.72 Lacs & H 3,857.11 Lacs

respectively in the current as well as the

that the subsidy applied under Scheme of Development / Strengthening of Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure, Grading

and Standardization (AMIGS) for its Agri Logistics Parks has not been approved on technical grounds as stated in the Joint

Monitoring Committee report and has recalled the advance subsidy of INR 2.25 Crores. The said advance capital subsidy

received by the subsidiary Company is credited to the relevant fixed assets in the year of receipt. The subsidiary Company has

represented the matter to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and Directorate of Marketing &

Inspection (DMI), Delhi. DMI has initiated the process for reviewing the same in the light of submissions made by the subsidiary

Company. The subsidiary Company believes that the projects are well qualified under the said subsidy scheme and the same

would be approved by the relevant sanctioning authorities. The Empowered Committee of India has observed that cold storage

of Ramganj mandi (Rajasthan) and Deesa (Gujarat) are eligible for release of final subsidy of H 0.25 Crores each (Total H 0.50

Crores). Both Rajasthan and Gujarat locations related subsidy matters are pending before the Hon’ble High Court Rajasthan,

Bench Jaipur and Hon’ble Gujarat High Court, Ahmedabad, respectively. The Hon’ble High Courts of Rajasthan and Gujarat

have already granted stay order in favour of the subsidiary company. Stay is continuing till the final disposal of the writ petitions.

As per judgement dated 29th March, 2022 Hon’ble Gujarat High Court has decided the Subsidiary company’s Special Civil

Application and directed NABARD to release the balance subsidy amount along with 6% interest per annum. However,

NABARD has filed an appeal against the order of Hon’ble Gujarat High Court. In case of Rajasthan, an application for hearing

has been filed by the subsidiary company.

concession period. The Group has to pay a guaranteed minimum annual payment to the grantor for each year that the toll

road in operation, as per agreement, for 2 toll roads. At the end of concession period, the ownership of the toll roads will vest
