NOTICE (Contd.):

Dear Shareholders,

I am delighted to reconnect with all of you and present

our Company’s Annual Report for FY 2022-23. It gives

me immense pleasure and pride to reflect on another

successful year of consolidation of our position in the core

sector where our Company consistently thrived, while

foraying into new areas, to expand our horizons.

FY 2022-23 proved to be a favorable period for the

infrastructure industry with remarkable progress across the

sectors that helped the nation maintain its coveted position

as one of the fastest-growing economies globally, while

moving towards becoming a US$ 5.0 trillion economy. The

Government’s continued commitment towards expeditious

infrastructure development in core sectors, including

social segments, created huge opportunities for all the

stakeholders.

Roads and highways sector being the key infrastructure

sector, where we have got our core competency and proven

expertise, will continue to be one of the focus areas for the

Government in overall development landscape, as the sector

will remain in the forefront to play a significant role in catalyzing

the accelerated economic development. Substantial

increase in budgetary allocation for infrastructure reaffirms

the Government’s commitment towards strong economic

growth and nation-building. In the Union Budget for FY 2023-

24, the Government maintained its focus on infrastructure

development with a 33% increase in capital expenditure for

overall infrastructure spending amounting to ` 10 lakh Cr.

Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has

recently set construction and awarding target of 14,000

km and 12,000 km respectively for 2023-24. National

Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is implementing

the Bharatmala Pariyojana, India’s largest highway

infrastructure program and envisions developing 34,800

km of national highways. In FY 2022-23, the NHAI

awarded national highway projects of length 6,003 km

for construction. NHAI received a budgetary allocation of

` 1.62 lakh Crore for FY 2023-24, a 14% year-on-year

increase hike. Ministry of Jal Shakti also witnessed a

significant increase in budgetary grant with ` 97,278 Cr

allocated in the current fiscal year, showing a substantial

41% rise from the previous year. With these favourable

allocations in highways and water sectors, sizeable new

business opportunities are anticipated for our Company

going forward.

On the funding front, I wish to share with you that in the recent

years, we have witnessed an increased interest from foreign

investors, including pension funds, in acquiring operational

road assets. This interest is clearly visible through their active

participation in NHAI’s TOT bundles and acquisition of several

operational projects from road developers. External funding

helps developers like us to address liquidity needs, unlock

equity for reinvestment and reduce strain on the balance

sheets. Consequently, this enables developers to participate

more actively in projects on various funding models such

as HAM (Hybrid Annuity Mode) and build-operate-transfer

(toll), among others. Another remarkable development took

place in the recent past government approval for formation

of Infrastructure Investment (InvITs) for facilitating investment

in the infrastructure sector. The roads and highways sector

has been the distinguished beneficiary of this investment

framework, as the majority of the established InvITs are from

this segment.

Roads and Highways sector

will remain in the forefront

to play a significant role in

catalyzing the accelerated

economic development.

Substantial increase in

budgetary allocation for

infrastructure reaffirms the

Government’s commitment

towards economic growth.

In the Union Budget for FY

2023-24, the Government

maintained its focus on

infrastructure development

with a 33% increase in

capital expenditure for

overall infrastructure

spending amounting to ` 10

lakh Cr.

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for

the other information. The other information comprises

the information included in the Annual Report but does

not include the standalone financial statements and our

auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not

cover the other information and we do not express any form

of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial

statements, our responsibility is to read the other information

and, in doing so, consider whether the other information

is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial

statements, or our knowledge obtained during the course of

our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that

there is a material misstatement of this other information,

we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report

CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE STANDALONE

Financial StatementS

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the

matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to

the preparation of these standalone financial statements

that give a true and fair view of the financial position,

financial performance including other comprehensive

income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted

in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind

AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act, read with the

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as

amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance

of adequate accounting records in accordance with the

provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the

Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and

other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate

accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that

are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation

and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,

that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy

and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to

the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial

statements that give a true and fair view and are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In

preparing

the

standalone

financial

statements,

management is responsible for assessing the Company’s

ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as

applicable, matters related to going concern and using the

going concern basis of accounting unless management

either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease

operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the

Company’s financial reporting process.

auDitor’S reSponSiBilitieS For tHe auDit oF tHe

StanDalone Financial StatementS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about

whether the standalone financial statements as a whole

are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud

or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our

opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance

but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance

with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it

exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are

considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they

could reasonably be expected to influence the economic

decisions of users taken based on these standalone financial

statements.
