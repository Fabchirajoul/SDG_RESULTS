The past stands reconciled. The present

optimised. Time now to seed the future.

Yes, at CG, we are now seeding the future. A

future of immense potential. To engineer better,

to manufacture leaner, to sell across more, to

invent faster, to retain and allocate more. In a

world striving to add efficiency, comfort and

predictability; capital goods as well as CG ought

to rise to the occasion.

Responding to the opportune landscape, we

are expanding our manufacturing capacities for

motors and transformers both. Learning from

our recent exploration of operational excellence,

we are blending debottlenecking and greenfield

expansion both to achieve higher capital

efficiency.

Furthering our gains in market share and

customer confidence, and on the back of added

capacities, we are heading to sell more in the

global markets. Adding impetus to our in-house

research and development, we are exploring

technological collaborations to fast forward our

approach to newer and bigger opportunities.

Seeding

the future

Leveraging the strength of our

balance sheet and financial

position, we are approaching the

future with renewed confidence

and conviction. At CG, we are

seeding the future.:

Dear shareholders,

Over the last few years, I believe that we

have successfully overcome the phase of

addressing legacy issues. From grappling

with severe financial constraints and

mounting debts, we have transformed

into a debt-free entity. Our progress is

exemplified by our ability to not only

meet the needs of our employees and

vendors but also fund our future capital

expenditure through internal accruals.

We have overcome existential challenges

and achieved remarkable growth in both

revenue and profitability for the second

consecutive year.:

NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

CORPORATE INFORMATION:

CG Power and Industrial Solutions Limited (the ‘Company’ or ‘Parent’) with CIN No: L99999MH1937PLC002641 is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in

India whose shares are publicly traded. The registered office is located at 6th Floor, CG house, Dr. Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai – 400 030, India.

The Company and its subsidiaries (collectively the ‘Group’) is a global enterprise providing end-to-end solutions to utilities, industries and consumers for the

management and application of efficient and sustainable electrical energy. It offers products, services and solutions in two main business segments, viz. Power

Systems and Industrial Systems for the year ended 31 March, 2023.

The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March, 2023 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on

08 May, 2023.

2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

2.1

Basis of preparation:

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the

Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended from time to time and presentation requirements of Division

II of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets

and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:

•

Derivative financial instruments,

•

Certain financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (‘`’) and all values are rounded to the nearest crores, except when otherwise indicated.

2.2

Basis of consolidation:

The Group consolidates all entities which are controlled by it. The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its

subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the

ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those

which significantly affect the entity’s returns. The entities are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.

The consolidated financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions including unrealised

gain/loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in

use at the Group. Profit or loss on each component of other comprehensive income (‘OCI’) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the

non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.

The Financial Statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the Parent Company, i.e., year ended on

31st March. When the end of the reporting period of the Parent is different from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional

financial information as of the same date as the Financial Statements of the Parent to enable the Parent to consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary,

unless it is impracticable to do so.

If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity

while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.

Changes in the Group’s holding that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s holding and the

non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative holding. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are

adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to equity holders of the parent.

Joint Ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Investments

in Joint Ventures and Associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is

increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the acquisition date. The Group’s investment in Joint Ventures and

Associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.

2.3

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost comprises the purchase price,

net of trade discounts and rebates, directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use and capitalised borrowing costs. When

significant parts of the plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives.:
