Annual Report 2022-23

Corporate Overview

Kirloskar Ferrous Industries Limited

A Kirloskar Group Company

Ferrous:

Dear Shareholders,

I am delighted to present to you KFIL's

performance for the fiscal year 2023.

It has been an eventful year marked

by significant achievements and

transformative initiatives that have

positioned our company for sustained

growth and success.

I am pleased to inform you that our

strategic acquisition of ISMT Limited

has yielded a positive net profit within

a year of acquisition. ISMT, a renowned

seamless tube manufacturer, faced

numerous challenges when we acquired

it last year. However, through our

dedicated efforts and strategic planning,

we have successfully orchestrated a

remarkable turnaround for ISMT. The

company’s financial performance

has improved significantly, and we

are witnessing a steady improvement

in operations. This achievement is a

testament to the commitment and

expertise of our teams who have worked

tirelessly to optimise operations,

enhance productivity, and revitalize

ISMT’s brand value.

Moreover, Our Solapur foundry

expansion project has been completed

within the scheduled timeline. The

expansion enhances our casting

capacity, enabling us to meet the

growing demand for high-quality ferrous

products. With this expansion, we are

well-equipped to cater to the evolving

needs of our customers and capitalise

on the emerging opportunities in the

market.

Strong Financial performance

We maintained robust financials in

this fiscal year, near-term pressures

notwithstanding. We continue to

maintain a 15% CAGR on the top line

and above 15% on the bottom line. For

the year the standalone revenue was

H 4,150 crore and the net profit was at

H 351 crore. During the year, Mini Blast

Furnace (MBF)2 at Koppal and MBF at

Hiriyur underwent planned shutdown

of around 94 and 41 days respectively

towards up-gradation and carrying out

relining works.

Focus on sustainability

At KFIL, we have always recognized

the importance of innovation and

sustainability. In line with this ethos,

we have invested in research and

development initiatives focused on

developing advanced technologies

and eco-friendly processes. These

investments are aimed at reducing our

carbon footprint, conserving resources,

and delivering sustainable solutions to

our customers. We remain committed

to responsible manufacturing practices

that prioritise environmental stewardship

and contribute to the well-being of the

communities in which we operate.

Operational Excellence

Our relentless pursuit of operational

excellence and cost optimisation

has yielded positive outcomes. By

implementing efficiency enhancement

programmes, streamlining processes,

and optimising our supply chain, we

have managed to keep costs under

control despite the volatility of input

commodity prices.

Proposed Merger of KFIL and

ISMT

During the year we have proposed

a scheme of the merger of KFIL

and ISMT. We believe the combined

business would benefit from increased

scale, expanded reach, higher cross-

selling opportunities to a larger base

of customers, and improvement in

productivity. The appointed date of the

proposed scheme is April 1, 2023. All the

regulatory and compliance requirements

are under process.

Positive Outlook

In conclusion, I would like to express my

deepest gratitude to our people, whose

dedication and hard work have been

instrumental in our success. I would also

like to extend my sincere appreciation

to our valued customers, suppliers and

partners for their unwavering support

and trust in our products and services.

As we look ahead, we remain committed

to our vision of being a globally

competitive and customer-centric

organisation. We will continue to explore

new avenues for growth, embrace

innovation, and uphold the highest

standards of corporate governance

and ethics. Together, we will seize the

opportunities that lie ahead and steer

Kirloskar Ferrous Industries Limited

towards a future of sustained success

and prosperity.

Thank you for your continued trust and

confidence in KFIL.

Yours sincerely,

Atul Kirloskar

Chairman

We continue to

maintain a 15% CAGR

on the top line and

above 15% on the

bottom line. For the

year the standalone

revenue was H 4,150

crore and the net

profit was at H 351

crore.

Kirloskar Ferrous Industries Limited

A Kirloskar Group Company

Ferrous:

Managing Director who makes strategic decisions.

w) Events occurring after the Consolidated Balance Sheet Date

Events occurring after the Consolidated Balance Sheet

date and till the date on which the consolidated financial

statements are approved, which are material in the

nature and indicate the need for adjustments in the

consolidated financial statements have been considered.

x)

Government Grant

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair

value where there is a reasonable assurance that the

grant will be received and the Group will comply with all

attached conditions.

Government grants relating to income are deferred and

recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss over

the period necessary to match them with the costs

that they are intended to compensate and presented

within other income.

When loans or similar assistance are provided by

governments or related institutions, with an interest

rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect

of this favourable interest is regarded as a government

grant. The loan or assistance is initially recognized and

measured at fair value and the government grant is

measured as the difference between the initial carrying

value of the loan and the proceeds received. The loan

is subsequently measured as per accounting policy

applicable to financial liabilities.

233

Annual Report 2022-23

Financial Statements:

Managing Director being the Chief

Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to assess performance and

allocate resources. The standard also requires Management

to make judgments with respect to recognition of segments.

Accordingly, the Group recognizes Iron Castings, Tube

Segment and Steel Segment as its three segments.

Contingent liability

The Group has received various orders and notices from

different Government authorities and tax authorities in

respect of direct taxes and indirect taxes. The outcome of

these matters may have a material effect on the financial

position, results of operations or cash flows. Management

regularly analyses current information about these matters

and discloses the information relating to contingent liability.

In making the decision regarding the need for creating loss

provision, management considers the degree of probability of

an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a sufficiently

reliable estimate of the amount of loss. The filing of a suit or

formal assertion of a claim against the Group or the disclosure

of any such suit or assertions, does not automatically indicate

that a provision of a loss may be appropriate.

Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key

sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that

have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to

the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the

next financial year, are described below. The Group based its

estimates and assumptions on parameters available when the

financial statements are prepared. Existing circumstances

and assumptions about future developments, however, may

change due to market conditions or circumstances arising

that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are

reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

Defined benefit obligation

The cost of the defined benefit plans and other post-

employment benefits and the present value of the obligations

are determined using actuarial valuation. An actuarial

valuation involves making various assumptions that may

differ from actual developments in the future. These include

the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases,

mortality rates and future post-retirement medical benefit

increase. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation

and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly

sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions

are reviewed at each reporting date.

The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate.

In determining the appropriate discount rate, management

considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies

consistent with the currencies of the post-employment

benefit obligations and extrapolated as needed along the yield

curve to correspond with the expected term of the defined

benefit obligation.

The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality

tables. Those mortality tables tend to change only at intervals

in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases

are based on the expected future inflation rates for the country.

Further details about defined benefit obligations are provided

in the respective note.

Deferred Tax

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible

temporary differences including the carry forward of unused

tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets

are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable

profit will be available against which the deductible temporary

differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits are

unused tax losses can be utilized.

Useful lives of Property, plant and equipment

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment are dependent

upon an assessment of both the technical lives of the assets

and also their likely economic lives based on various internal

and external factors including relative efficiency and operating

costs. The depreciable lives are reviewed annually using the

best information available to the Management.

Estimation and underlying assumptions are reviewed

on

ongoing

basis.

Revisions

to

estimates

are

recognized prospectively.

54 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On 31st March, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from 1st April, 2023, as below:

Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements

The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies.

Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions

of primary users of general-purpose financial statements. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant

impact in its financial statements.

Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes

The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations.

The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so

that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The

Company is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial statements

Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors

The amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change

in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates

are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting estimates

if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The

Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.
