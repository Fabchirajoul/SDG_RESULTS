Dear Shareholders,

At INOXGFL Group, we firmly believe in the

value of sustainable growth. All our group

companies, in their respective journeys,

have strived to be value-accretive for all

the stakeholders, be it our shareholders,

creditors, vendors, employees or the

communities in our areas of operations.

Moving towards larger scales, our

companies will remain steadfast in their

growth strategies, and mindful of our

stakeholders’ expectations.

I am pleased to present the Annual Report

of Inox Wind Limited for the financial year

2022-23. The current macro-environment

has created several opportunities, while

at the same time posing its own sets of

challenges.

Countries around the world have adopted

a stronger stance towards climate

action plans. With dedicated policies

and greater emphasis on minimising the

carbon footprint, renewable energy is

currently the primary means for leading

energy transition efforts. India has been

among the forefront when it comes to

embracing renewable energy, ranking

fourth globally with >125 GW of installed

renewables capacity. It also has the fourth

largest installed wind capacity globally,

with a plan to add >100 GW over the next

decade.

India’s wind sector is poised for a decadal

growth journey. Almost all of the policy

issues which plagued the sector over the

past few years have been resolved and is

evident in the radical changes which the

macro environment has witnessed over

the past year. Wind power in India has

several benefits, including but not limited

to – 1) among the cheapest sources of

clean power (lower than India’s APPC),

2) large onshore potential, 3) fixed tariffs

for 25 years, 4) domestic manufacturing

capacity with limited forex outgo, 5) no

subsidy support except for ISTS charges

waiver applicable up to Jun’25.

At INOXGFL Group, we realise the

immense potential of wind energy in

India, given the medium-term 500 GW

non-fossil fuel capacity target by 2030

and long-term Net Zero target for 2070,

which the Government has declared. The

250 GW renewables bidding trajectory

announced by the government over

FY24-28, which includes at least 50GW

of wind bids and 50 GW of hybrid/RTC

bids, provides a clear mandate and

the pathway towards the 500GW RE

target for 2030. It further affirms the

opportunities which the wind sector

in India presents to participants. We

believe that Inox Wind, on the back of the

immense upcoming opportunities, will

continue to be a key contributor providing

sustainable and affordable energy

solutions for the country.

IWL is ready for its next leg of growth with

the Type Certificate for its new 3.3 MW

WTG in place. IWL expects to start the

supplies of the revolutionary new product

shortly, and I believe this will result in

substantial upscaling of execution leading

to profitability for the company.

Over the past year, we’ve taken several

strategic decisions in order to strengthen

IWL’s position and ready it to benefit

from the macro tailwinds which are

now in action. IWL’s balance sheet has

been significantly strengthened and

deleveraged through capital infusion at

various points of time by promoters as

well as other long-term investors. Further,

IWL’s promoters were able to successfully

raise ~ Rs 500 crores by way of equity

share sale of IWL through block deals

with long-term investors on the stock

exchanges in August 2023, which was

subsequently infused into IWL.

November 2022 saw the successful listing

of Inox Green Energy Services Ltd., India’s

only pureplay O&M services company, on

both the stock exchanges. The company,

which is a stable annuity growth platform

having long-term cash flow visibility, is

positioned strongly to benefit from both

organic growth opportunities through

its synergistic relationship with IWL, and

inorganic growth opportunities as well.

The approval of merger of IWEL

with IWL was another key strategic

announcement made over the past year.

Once completed, the merger will aid in

simplifying the structure of INOXGFL

group’s renewables business segment

and bringing about operational and

administrative efficiencies.

Looking ahead, I believe Inox Wind is on

course to witness substantial growth

and deliver profitability, a much welcome

change made possible due to all-round

efforts of all our stakeholders.

I would like to express my sincere

appreciation to the Board of Directors

for their continued guidance. I would also

commend our team’s dedication and

commitment to excellence. The invaluable

trust of our shareholders as well as

numerous stakeholders continues to be

the guiding light in the journey of Inox

Wind.

Thank you all for your continuous support.

Regards,

Devansh Jain,

Executive Director, INOXGFL Group

Annual Report 2022-23:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to present

to you the FY2022-23 annual report of

Inox Wind. Your company stands today

as one of the leading players in the Indian

wind energy sector. Having faced several

challenges over the past few years, I

believe Inox Wind today is a substantially

stronger and more resilient company,

ready for a multi-year growth journey.

The accelerated deployment of renewable

energy in India continues to uncover new

opportunities for us on a large scale. The

Indian government remains focused on

ramping up renewable capacity in India

to 500 GW by 2030. Honourable Prime

Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been a

strong advocate for sustainable growth

through clean energy at all the global

platforms. At COP26 of the UNFCCC held

in Glasgow, United Kingdom in February

2022, India presented the following five

nectar elements (Panchamrit) of India’s

climate action: 1) Reach 500 GW non-fossil

energy capacity by 2030, 2) 50 per cent of

its energy requirements from renewable

energy by 2030, 3) reduction of total

projected carbon emissions by one billion

tonnes from now to 2030, 4) reduction of

the carbon intensity of the economy by 45

per cent by 2030, over 2005 levels and, 5)

achieving the target of net zero emissions

by 2070. I believe this will form the base

around which all our policies and strategies

will be formulated over the course of the

next decade and beyond.

In addition to the aforementioned targets,

another major factor aiding the growth

of the renewable energy industry in

India is the power demand growth itself.

Post-covid, India’s power demand has

witnessed tremendous growth. From

the lows of around 120 GW during the

covid period in 2020, India’s peak power

demand has almost doubled in 2023.

Given the strong growth outlook for India

over the next decade, affirmed by most

global agencies, low per capita power

consumption base, rapid urbanisation,

electrification of the economy and other

favourable factors, I believe that India will

continue to witness robust growth in the

demand for power over the next several

years. Majority of this demand will be met

through renewable capacity addition.

India’s commitment towards its renewable

energy targets have resulted in several

policy and regulatory changes being

implemented over the recent past. To

facilitate faster capacity addition in the

country’s journey towards achieving 500

GW of RE capacity, the MNRE has already

set a trajectory for the auction of 250

GW of capacity – 50 GW annually – from

FY23-24 to FY27-28. This includes 10 GW

plain vanilla wind power bids, and 10GW

of hybrid/RTC bids, annually. Together

with the state bids, C&I, retail demand and

green hydrogen initiatives, it is anticipated

that approximately 100 GW wind power

capacity may be commissioned by the

end of 2030. With the current wind

capacity at 43 GW, this addition will

take the total installed capacity of wind

energy to >140 GW by 2030. Recently,

the MNRE has also revised its auction

process for wind energy projects to move

from reverse auctions to closed bidding.

However, irrespective of the bidding

modalities, wind tariffs being discovered

in the latest auctions are favourable for all

the stakeholders – discoms, developers

and OEMs.

The conducive macro environment

provides a remarkable opportunity

for existing players within the wind

energy sector. At Inox Wind, we stand

at the forefront to capitalise on these

opportunities. We are witnessing

increased interest for our WTGs,

particularly from Public Sector Units

(PSUs), Independent Power Producers

(IPPs), Retail, and Commercial & Industrial

(C&I) segments of the market, for both

turnkey projects and equipment supply

orders. This has helped us to significantly

build our order book. As of 30th June

2023, our net order book stood at 1327

MW, aided by the addition of a 150MW

follow-up order from NTPC and a 100MW

order from ABEnergia Renewables in

Q1FY24. The execution of these orders

will result in substantial revenue growth

for our company over the next few

quarters, reinforcing our position in the

wind OEM market.

Our newest product offering – 3.3 MW

WTG – has received type certificate from

TUV SUD, a global certification body

based out of Germany. We are preparing

to commence serial shipments of the

WTG within FY24. Our 3.3MW WTG has

been developed with globally renowned

AMSC as the technology partner and

features a 100 m tubular tower and 145

m rotor diameter. The turbine is built for

Indian wind conditions. We already have

orders in place for the new product and

are in discussion with several customers

for future orders as well. I believe this

state-of-the-art new product offering will

be the growth and profitability engine for

IWL for the next several years.

One of the major focuses for the company

over the past year has been to strengthen

and deleverage its balance sheet. Through

strategic infusion of capital at various

points of time by promoters as well as

other long-term investors, the company

now stands at a much healthier position.

Further, IWL’s promoters were able to

successfully raise ~ Rs 500 crores by way

of equity share sale of IWL through block

deals with long-term investors on the stock

exchanges in August 2023, which was

subsequently infused into IWL and utilized

towards deleveraging.

I would also like to add here about

another remarkable achievement

during the year related to one of our

subsidiaries, Inox Green Energy Services

Limited (IGESL). In November 2022, we

successfully listed our O&M subsidiary, a

significant step towards monetising our

O&M business, on the stock exchanges

through IPO. The proceeds from the IPO

were strategically utilised to reduce IWL’s

debt. Further, IGESL acquired 51% stake

in I-Fox Windtechnik India Private Limited,

an independent O&M service provider,

resulting in IGESL acquiring third-party

O&M servicing capabilities and enhancing

its business scope beyond IWL’s WTGs.

IGESL’s cumulative O&M portfolio stood

at > 3.1 GW as of FY23-end. The company

has robust plans for growth through both

organic and inorganic means.

We have successfully commissioned

the 50 MW Nani Virani SPV, which

now presents a valuable opportunity

to monetise the asset, leading to

deleveraging and optimising the financial

health of our wind business.

As a fully integrated player in the wind

energy sector, we are driven by our

robust manufacturing capabilities,

common infrastructure ownership and

development expertise, as well as our

EPC and O&M service offerings. To deliver

cutting-edge wind energy solutions, we

are constantly focusing on technology

adoption to live up to our commitment

of offering best-in-class wind energy

solutions to our customers.

To achieve our objectives and strengthen

our position in the industry, we strive to

foster an enabling working environment

in our company. By offering multiple

opportunities for professional growth

and development, we intend to nurture

a motivated and engaged workforce

which plays a pivotal role in supporting

our endeavours and shaping our future.

I remain extremely thankful to each one

of our employees for their resilience

and determination to fulfil organisational

objectives.

In closing, I would like to express my

sincere gratitude to all our shareholders,

clients and other stakeholders for their

steadfast belief in our capabilities. Your

trust and support inspire us to aim higher

and accomplish new milestones.

Regards,

Kailash Lal Tarachandani,

Chief Executive Officer
