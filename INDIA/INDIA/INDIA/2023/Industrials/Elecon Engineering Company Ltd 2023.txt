incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components, and

for which discrete financial information is available. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the

Group’s Chairman and: Managing Director (CMD) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and

assess their performance.

The Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic business units. These business

units offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and

marketing strategies. For each of the business units, the Group’s
