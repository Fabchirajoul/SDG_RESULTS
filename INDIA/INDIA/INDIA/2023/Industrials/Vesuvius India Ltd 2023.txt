About the company: Dear Shareholders,

I am delighted to present the annual

report of Vesuvius India Limited as

growth driven by our people,

products and strong technological

expertise. The year 2023 was a

landmark year for the Company as

Company demonstrated robust

performance in 2023. With great pride,

I share our achievements and progress

made during this period, reflecting our

commitment to driving sustainable

growth and creating long-term value

Industry and

macroeconomic context

India is the second largest steel

producer in the world. Domestic

steel demand is experiencing

robust growth fueled by government

investment in infrastructure,

increasing urbanisation,

industrialisation and growing

consumer demand. Steel demand

is estimated to grow roughly by 100

million tons over next decade or

roughly 10 million tons per annum

additional steel capacity.

Most of this new manufacturing

capacity is being built with latest

steel making technologies and

equipment. These plants will

produce complex steel grades

replacing imports.

These new steel plants will require

more advance refractory solutions

to run these complex steel making

processes and equipment. These

plants will demand refractory

technologies to make steel at

much higher efficiency, safety,

quality, productivity, yield and at

optimised cost.

Against this backdrop, Vesuvius is well

positioned to service this emerging

opportunity with its technology

portfolio, stronger manufacturing

capabilities, additional manufacturing

We are deeply

committed to

minimising our

environmental

footprint and

optimising resource

utilisation through

sustainable practices

and initiatives

capacities, ever stronger people

capital as well as efficient capital

allocation. Further, our focus on

cost efficiencies and adoption of

digitalisation process excellence

provides us with a strong foundation.

Performance

I am pleased to report that we

delivered a robust financial

performance in 2023. Our revenue

increased to Rs. 1,603 Crores, from

Rs. 1,343 Crores in the preceding year

with ~19% growth YoY. Our net profit

witnessed significant growth, reaching

Rs. 213 Crores compared to Rs. 117

Crores in the previous year, an ~82%

increase in profitability.
