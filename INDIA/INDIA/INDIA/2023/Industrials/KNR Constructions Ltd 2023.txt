Annual Report 2022-23:

Dear Shareholders,

During the FY 2022-23, the Indian economy exhibited optimism

as it rebounded from the impact of the pandemic. It achieved

a full recovery, surpassing many other nations and positioning

itself to return to the pre-pandemic growth trajectory in during

the reporting period. The current year presented the challenge

of managing inflation, further exacerbated by the European

crisis. The ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict resulted in significant

fluctuations in input costs, particularly for steel, cement, diesel,

and bitumen.

Despite the challenges posed by the geopolitical situation, our

Company remained resilient and unwavering in our commitment

to providing sustainable and reliable infrastructure solutions.

We stayed focussed on our mission, navigating through these

hurdles and continuing to serve our clients with dedication.

Annual Report 2022-23:

Dear stakeholders,

As the director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, I am delighted

to present an overview of our ESG endeavors to our valued shareholders.

Our steadfast commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)

principles stands as the bedrock of our business philosophy.

Environment:

We have adopted effective exhaust mechanisms for machinery and vehicles,

subject to rigorous periodic checks to ensure optimal performance. We’ve

introduced sprinklers on conveyors to reduce air emissions from aggregate

crushers, complemented by regular emissions monitoring. Our electricity

consumption is balanced through captive sources like generators, while innovative

water recycling techniques are applied in casting yards. Recycled wastewater is

utilised for landscaping and plantation activities. We optimise waste materials

generated from structures and pavements, utilising them in diversion roads and

construction layers. Our emphasis on waste reduction, recycling, and efficient

water use reflects our commitment to environmental sustainability.

Social:

Our social commitments include identifying and training individuals for project

deployment, fostering opportunities for career progression, and maintaining

high employee retention levels through supportive policies and welfare activities.

Our dedication to mentoring contributes to staff retention and our consistent

performance.

Governance:

Governance remains a cornerstone of our operations. Frequent Board meetings

diligently monitor accountability, transparency, ethical decision-making, and

business ethics. Internal audits reinforce our commitment to sound governance

practices, enhancing shareholder and investor confidence in our approach.

In conclusion, our ESG initiatives encompass environmental sustainability,

social empowerment, and robust governance practices. We are committed

to addressing challenges, meeting targets, and fostering responsible growth,

guided by our commitment to creating lasting value for all stakeholders.

We deeply appreciate your ongoing support and confidence in our organisation.

Through collaborative efforts, we are poised to forge a brighter and more

sustainable future together.

Sincerely,

K Jalandhar Reddy
