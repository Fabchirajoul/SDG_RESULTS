ORGANISATIONAL OVERVIEW | OUR INTEGRATED PURPOSE FRAMEWORK:

MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN:

Managing Director and CEO.

Additionally, Mr. Gajraj Singh Rathore, our COO, joins the Board as

a Whole Time Director. As we welcome these esteemed leaders

into their new roles, I have no doubt that their expertise and

strategic vision will propel JSW Steel to even greater heights.

I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to our

independent director, Mr. Harsh Mariwala, as his tenure

concludes in July 2023. His invaluable contributions have

greatly enriched our board discussions, and we are immensely

grateful for his guidance and wisdom.

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the outstanding and

diligent team at JSW Steel. It is their persistent commitment

and tireless efforts that drive us towards excellence each

day. I would also like to express my appreciation to our board

members, whose guidance and advice have been vital in

shaping our strategic path and accomplishing our objectives.

As we look towards the future with optimism and

determination, I assure you that JSW Steel remains steadfast

in its pursuit of excellence and sustainable growth. Together,

we will continue to build a brighter future for JSW Steel and

contribute to the progress of our great nation.

Sincerely,

SAJJAN JINDAL

In line with our commitment to renewable energy adoption,

we have already secured contracts for 1 gigawatt (GW)

of capacity while successfully operationalising 225

megawatts (MW) of solar capacity at our Vijayanagar

plant in April 2022, making it the first steel plant in India to

embrace large-scale renewable energy deployment.

As we aim to reach a capacity of 50 million metric tonnes,

our aspiration is to power our entire setup through 10 GW

of renewable capacity, making us possibly the world's first

major steel manufacturer to achieve this milestone. Another

bold step involves incorporating green hydrogen into our

Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) plant at Vijayanagar, propelling us

forward in the production of low-carbon-emission steel.

While renewable energy and hydrogen technology

form a crucial part of our decarbonisation strategy,

we recognise that it alone is insufficient to fully

decarbonise the steelmaking process. The production

of primary steel relies on the utilisation of fossil fuels

to convert iron ore into steel. To address this challenge,

we have launched the Sustainable Energy Environment

& Decarbonisation (SEED) project. Through efficiency

improvements and a comprehensive change management

approach, SEED aims to reduce CO2 emissions from

our existing assets. I am pleased to report that in its

inaugural year of implementation, SEED has already

yielded visible improvements, further bolstering our

environmental stewardship.

I am delighted to share that our commitment to

environmental excellence is only growing. Once again

and for the fifth consecutive year, we have been ranked

‘Sustainability Champion’ by the World Steel Association. We

were also recognised by CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure

Project) as we secured the highest Climate Change

rating of 'A', positioning JSW Steel among an exclusive

group of three global steel manufacturers to receive this

prestigious accolade.

To reinforce our commitment, we have joined Responsible

Steel, the only global multi-stakeholder standard and

certification initiative for responsibly sourced and

produced steel.

Accelerating impact–On and off the factory floor

Our Company has made remarkable progress in driving

diversity and inclusion throughout the organisation.

We have observed the remarkable impact of all-women

teams, shattering conventional stereotypes. These

empowered women are now taking charge of their own

narratives by skillfully operating heavy earth-moving

machinery at mines and production units in mills. This shift

in perspective underscores our unyielding dedication to

nurturing a culture that celebrates diversity and enables

individuals to unleash their maximum potential. As a result

of such endeavours, JSW has once again, for the third

consecutive year, been recognised as a 'Great Place to

Work', highlighting our commitment to a nurturing work

environment that values and empowers the workforce.

In relation to our prominent JSW Foundation, we continue

to drive positive change through initiatives that will have

a lasting impact on society. This year we inaugurated the

JSW School of Public Policy at IIM Ahmedabad, aiming

to become a research-oriented think tank and a premier

training institute for developing robust public policies.

Additionally, our foundation extended its support to the

Tata Memorial Centre, enhancing facilities for cancer

patients. Operating at a national level, the JSW Foundation

remains focused on the upliftment of rural communities

through Education, Health & Nutrition, Skill Development,

Environment & Water, Sports, and Art & Heritage initiatives.

It now operates across 22 rural locations in 11 states

benefiting over a million lives.

Looking ahead with optimism

The Indian growth story continues unabated, propelled by

a strong human capital base, robust domestic consumption,

and expanding manufacturing capabilities. The government

aims to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP to 25%.

The global supply chains are experiencing realignment,

with a defined shift towards a China+1 sourcing approach,

benefiting India, as global buyers seek cost-effectiveness

and stability. India's impressive infrastructure

developments–propelled by the Gati Shakti project–metros,

airports, freight corridors, waterways, high-speed trains,

and road networks, will further accelerate growth.

At JSW Steel, our unwavering commitment to continuous

improvement is reflected not only in our outstanding

financial performance as India's largest steelmaker but also

in our ability to meet essential environmental, social, and

governance (ESG) targets. By delivering on these fronts,

we are enhancing long-term shareholder value.

As a result of such endeavours, this year JSW Group climbed

eight places in the league table of top 50 brands and is now

officially the fastest growing brand over the last 10 years.

ORGANISATIONAL OVERVIEW |: MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Dear stakeholders,

The world is seeing an uncertain geopolitical and economic environment with cross-border

tensions, constrained supply chains and multi-decade high inflation and interest rates. Amid

these uncertainties, India stands out with its vibrant economy, demonstrating its resilience

in a volatile world, and strengthening its position in the global economy.

The government is focusing on increasing the share of manufacturing in India’s GDP,

as global supply chains are getting realigned and multinationals are seeking to diversify their

risk in terms of sourcing manufactured goods and components. India’s digital infrastructure

is redefining last-mile delivery, from banking to welfare schemes. Further, the Government is

concentrating on building and improving physical infrastructure to increase productivity and

increase India’s competitiveness.

These factors bode very well for domestic steel demand, and JSW Steel is well positioned to

serve India’s growing steel requirements.

In sync with India’s growth

India is forecasted to become a $10 trillion economy by 2033, growing almost three times.

As India accelerates its growth trajectory in its ‘nation building’ phase, steel demand is

expected to see a step up. The National Steel Policy envisages India’s installed crude steel

capacity at 300 MTPA by 2030-31. JSW Steel’s growth aligns with this progress, which is

reflected in our medium-term capacity target of 50 MTPA.

We take pride in innovating and manufacturing a diverse range of steel products that

cater to the evolving needs of our customers, be it in Automotive, Packaging, Renewables,

Infrastructure, Construction and General Engineering. While growing our capacities across

locations, we are strategically building manufacturing capabilities and products for sectors

where India is growing.

For the Infrastructure and Construction sectors, we have an array of products for

lighter construction with enhanced durability. Our new facility of LRPC is aiding in faster

construction with better resource efficiency. We continue to expand our value-added

offerings in Advanced High-Strength Steels which help in light weighting of automobiles,

across Renewable Energy, Infrastructure, Oil & Gas and General Engineering sectors. We have

developed various speciality products for Forgings, Bearing, Fasteners and Wire applications

for the domestic and international markets.

In our downstream facilities, we continue to build capacities of products which aid

sustainable living like tinplate for packaging, electrical steels for better energy efficiency and

reduced carbon emissions. With a strong focus on R&D and product development, our target

is to maintain the share of Value Added and Special Product sales mix at over 50%.

Volatile external environment

FY 2022-23 was a year of two halves. The first half witnessed high volatility in raw material

costs, especially coking coal and energy, aggravated by supply chain bottlenecks. A series of

aggressive interest rates hikes by major central banks to rein in runaway inflation dampened

steel demand, leading to inventory build-up and softening steel prices. However, the third

and fourth quarters saw improved sentiment with easing inflation and raw material costs,

coupled with the reopening of China post its stringent ‘Zero COVID’ policy.

MESSAGE FROM

THE JMD AND CEO

India too experienced high inflation for some time. Steel

spreads came under pressure due to higher coking coal and

other input costs. The imposition of export duty on steel in

May 2022 made Indian steel uncompetitive in global markets

while cheaper steel from overseas made its way into the

country, putting pricing pressure on domestic steelmakers.

However, buoyant steel demand in India throughout the year

provided some respite. The withdrawal of export duty in

November 2022 opened up opportunities to tap the overseas

markets, though global demand remained a bit subdued.

Resilient performance in a challenging year

At JSW Steel, we continuously improved our operations

and delivered a robust set of numbers for FY 2022-23.

Our average capacity utilisation was at 90%, which

demonstrates our ability to sweat assets even in a

challenging year. While exports dropped, we strategically

diverted volumes between domestic and overseas; one-third

of our exports was recorded in the fourth quarter alone.

Our consolidated revenue from operations came in at

₹1,65,960 crore and EBITDA at ₹18,547 crore, despite

lower export volumes and pricing pressure. Despite the

challenging external environment, we did not compromise

on our medium-term growth strategy to take our near-term

India capacity to 37 MTPA, given the robust growth in Indian

steel demand.

We maintained a healthy balance sheet, with our net leverage

and gearing below the stated cap. Our strong cash flow from

operations, coupled with access to a diversified funding pool,

provides flexibility to drive value-accretive growth.

Digitisation and innovation focus

At JSW Steel, we aspire to be a digital-first organisation.

As part of our Digital Vision 2026, we are leveraging

technology to make our facilities safer, sustainable and

more efficient. Our AI-enabled safety surveillance platform

at JSW Salem monitors plant safety and security compliance

in real-time while providing geo-fencing features to enable

swift responses to emergencies. We have deployed a ‘Digital

Logistics Management System (DLMS)’ at our Odisha mines,

resulting in faster truck turnaround, improved supply chain

efficiency and cost reduction.

We have digitally enabled our 5 MTPA Vijayanagar expansion,

where drones are being used for project monitoring. Mobile

inspection requests have replaced the traditional manual

methods. Dashboards and analytics provide a real-time view

of the milestones, plans and actual project progress. We are

working with an objective of end-to-end digital transformation

of key functions and focusing on creating a future-ready

digital workforce.

In our downstream facilities,

we continue to build capacities

of products which aid

sustainable living like tinplate

for packaging, electrical steels

for better energy efficiency and

reduced carbon emissions.

ORGANISATIONAL OVERVIEW | MESSAGE FROM THE JMD AND CEO

MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CEO

Sustainability at the heart of everything

During the year under review, we met all our sustainability

targets and remained firmly on track to reduce our CO2

emission intensity by 42% by 2030 (from 2005 base year),

to achieve 100% circularity in all the solid wastes generated,

achieve no net loss for biodiversity and having more than

39% reduction in freshwater consumption by 2030.

As the world moves to a low-carbon economy, it would

always remain a challenge to decouple growth from

emissions in a hard-to-abate sector like ours. However,

we remain focussed to reduce our emission intensities

through conscious efforts by prioritising actions such as

energy transition towards renewable energy, adoption

and promotion of efficiency improvements in energy

consumption, process optimisation, increased use of

available scraps and support circularity through better

resource management and adoption of Best Available

Technologies (BAT).

We launched a specific programme called 'Sustainable

Energy Environment and Decarbonisation' (SEED) at our

Vijayanagar operations to bring in changes at the grassroot

level to remain both operational and CO2 emission efficient.

Steel being an infinitely recyclable and extremely versatile

material, we are certain that it will remain the preferred

choice for building a sustainable future.

Driving meaningful change for inclusive progress

At JSW Steel, we understand that sustainable growth can

only be achieved when our communities flourish. In our

pursuit of driving meaningful change, we have prioritised

key areas such as education, healthcare, environmental

sustainability and more, touching over a million lives across

the country.

Our flagship education programmes provide quality

education to over 30,000 children every year. Further, we

have significantly enhanced access to quality healthcare

services, benefiting half a million individuals. In line with our

vision of building a sustainable and greener future, we have

implemented environment and biodiversity interventions.

These efforts have not only increased access to water for

over 5,00,000 individuals but also facilitated the recharging

of millions of litres of water and increased the overall green

cover. Through an innovative India’s First Skill Impact Bond,

we aim to skill and provide livelihood opportunities to over

50,000 youths in the next four years.

Nurturing our biggest asset

We have recalibrated our values with the strategic intent

of providing a moral compass for our organisation and

its people while pursing growth. With a strong emphasis

on diversity and inclusion, we foster an environment

that celebrates individuality, encourages innovation and

embraces collaboration.

With an aim to place our people first, JSW Steel focuses on

providing holistic wellness, rewarding long-term association

and diverse career opportunities. Being a strong believer

of building leadership pipelines, we have developed

various leadership programmes in partnership with premier

institutions across India and abroad.

Some of the highly invested initiatives in JSW Steel include

Senior Leadership Development Programme, Future Fit

Leaders, JSW Technical Leaders Programme, JSW Sales

Leaders Programme, Young Leaders Programme.

At JSW Steel, women engineers today manage production

lines at our Vijayanagar, Vasind and Tarapur plants. While

over 5% of our workforce are women at present, we have

resolved to increase this to over 15% within the next five

years. We have started programmes like ‘Springboard’,

We launched a programme called

'Sustainable Energy Environment

and Decarbonisation' (SEED) at our

Vijayanagar operations to bring

about changes at the grassroot

level to remain both operational

and CO2 emission efficient.

2) Tackling Climate Change

JSW Steel recognises its role as an industry leader

and its responsibility towards creating a cleaner and

a sustainable planet for the future. To this end, the

company has developed a comprehensive climate

action plan with the goal of achieving carbon dioxide

emission intensity reduction of more than 42% by 2030,

aligning with India’s Nationally Determined Contributions

(NDC), from the base year of 2005. The target is

planned to be achieved through a variety of measures,

including improving the quality of input raw materials

through beneficiation, increasing the use of renewable

energy and scrap, reducing coal consumption in iron

making, increased use of Pulverised Coal Injection

(PCI) and Natural Gas (NG) use in the Blast Furnaces

(BF), improving energy and process efficiency through

the use of the best available technologies (BAT), and

continuing to collaborate towards the development of

deep decarbonisation technologies.

To stay up-to-date with rapid developments related to

climate change, JSW Steel has constituted a Climate

Action Group (CAG). The CAG, facilitated by the Corporate

of FDT. The matter is yet to be heard by SCI. Based on merits of the case and supported by a legal opinion, the Company

has not recognised provision for FDT of I 1043 crores (including paid under protest – I 665 crores) and treated it as a

contingent liability.

as Forest Development Fee (FDF) instead of FDT. In response to the writ petition filed by the Company and others, the

Honourable High Court of Karnataka has vide its order dated 4 October 2017, held that the amendment is ultra-vires the

Constitution of India and directed the State Government to refund the FDF collected. The State Government has filed an

appeal before the SCI, and based on merits of the case duly supported by a legal opinion and a favorable order from the

High Court, the Company has not recognised provision for FDF amount of I 3080 crores (including paid under protest -

I 255 crores) pertaining to the private lease operators & NMDC and treated it as contingent liability.
