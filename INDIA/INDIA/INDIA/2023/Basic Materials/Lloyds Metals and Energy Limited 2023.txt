Lloyds Metals and Energy Limited:

dear stakeholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to look at our

F.y. 2022-23 performance. We have seen multiple

challenges in both domestic as well as International

environments. We set up many new operational benchmarks

and notched up new milestones. I am pleased to share

that we posted unprecedented numbers across operational

and financial metrics during the year in the likes of highest

dispatches, higher capacity utilisation, highest ever

turnover and eBItda. We have built up a secure footing

for the company, which provides a ginormous opportunity

to have more years of higher highs in our operations and

financial performance.

as this performance brings a spate of optimism, strength,

and satisfaction, I thank all our dedicated and motivated

colleagues who have made this accomplishable. I would

take a moment to thank them all for standing us through the

turmoil of the times.

Way ForWard

We see the present macroeconomic and competitive

challenges as an opportunity to create strategic agility in

our operating model. While sustainability continues to be

integral to our strategic approach, we are concurrently

building upon our iron ore reserves. steelmaking is a

coherent approach where iron ore resources are tapped to

their full advantage. Going ahead with our strategy of being

present in the complete value chain of steelmaking, the

Company has laid out a systematic roadmap which shall

transform the Company into a value added fully integrated

steel producer.

our steel Making would involve world-class facilities

generating throughput of high-class value-added steel

products. Our endeavour is not confined to being a

value-added steelmaker, it’s a process which we are more

focused on. as you all are aware of the cyclical nature of

the steel industry, capital allocation is the foremost line

of strategy. In the steel industry, where raw materials like

iron ore, coal etc., have significant importance, Capital is a

crucial raw material with the same grandness, if not more.

We believe it shall be used judiciously, making the company

stand tall in all volatility cycles. With that concept of

prudence, we aim to carve out our roadmap of steelmaking

majorly through internal accruals only. this shall bear

us the rewards in perpetuity. Under the guidance of our

experienced and dynamic leadership, along with the

passion and commitment of our employees, I am confident

that we will be able to realise the full potential of lloyds

Metals and energy limited in the coming years.

CoMMItMent to envIronMent and soCIety

our long-term strategic plans across our business units

and functions are aligned with environment, social

and Governance (esG) principles and give us the

optimism to create a bright future for all our stakeholders.

Corporate Governance remains paramount, and our

philosophy remains committed to strong corporate

governance principles.

appreCIatIon

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the

Members of our Board, our channel partners, and all

other stakeholders for their encouragement and support

throughout the course of the year.

Mr. Mukesh rajnarayan Gupta

Corporate overview

FinanCial StatementS

Statutory reportS:

dear shareholders,

at lloyds Metals, our journey so far has been of many

iconic milestones. F.y. 2022-23 is one of the landmark

years for us. We have come a long way to be here at this

moment. We have embarked on various grounds while

embracing the performance for this year. We had set

ourselves with audacious goals, which prepared us to

scale higher and more sustainable growth balanced with

sustainable value creation.

When we started mining in F.y. 2022-21 at full scale, there

were impeding issues ahead of us, be it topographical,

social or logistical. We mitigated and resolved them

one after another by balancing them with utmost

circumspection. and this year, F.y. 2022-23, we had

record dispatches of 5.3 Million tonnes. along with record

dispatches, we also received clearance to enhance our

mining capacity to 10 Million tonnes from 3 Million tonnes

per annum. proven to execute this run rate through various

periods of operations due to our extensive investment in

necessary infrastructure, this would be a shot in the arm for

the Company to go ahead.

the road ahead For Iron ore MInInG

We are continuously scouting for ways and means to

optimise the iron ore resources. the surjagarh mine,

when we received it in 1993, had an initial reserve tally

of 90mn tonnes based on drilling of mere 17,000 metres.

We scaled up the drilling exploration to reckon its true

reserves potential. With the current drilling of 40,000

metres, our reserves are pegged at 180 Million tonnes for

hematite ore and more than 550 Million tonnes of Blended

hematite Quartz (BhQ). We are further delving into various

alternatives for optimising the BhQ from these mines.

We are essaying a beneficiation process to utilise these

reserves. With the aid of the Central government and their

impending thrust on maximising the utilisation of these

reserves, we are confident of sustainable and justifiable use

of our mammoth reserves during the mine life.

together, these will empower us to effectively capitalise on

the growth opportunities ahead for all the stakeholders.

Mr. Balasubramanian prabhakaran

Lloyds Metals and Energy Limited:

dear shareholders,

We have a proud legacy of pioneering positive change, not

just within the Industry but in the Communities where we

operate as well, and our commitment remains steadfast.

as we all understand, lloyds Metals operates in an

industry influenced by macros of both global and domestic

and remains assailable to their headwinds and tailwinds.

F.y. 2022-23 was a year when geo-political tensions and

global supply chain issues kept hovering around the

global steel industry. Indian steel makers were further

impacted by introducing a 15% export duty from May, 2022

till november, 2022, which created a supply imbalance

compared to historical trends. Further, the export duty on

iron ores and concentrates was raised to 50% from 30%,

which created pressure on domestic iron ore prices

We took this as an opportunity to tone up our operations

further. We put our best foot forward to strengthen our

efforts on operational efficiencies, volume delivery and

cost rationalisation for expanding our production volumes

and driving financial excellence. As a result, our sponge

capacity utilisation improved to 73% in F.y. 2022-23 against

45% a year before and is currently operating at 90% plus

utilisation levels.

a FUtUre to look ForWard to:

These efforts have given us immense confidence to

strive and aim for higher volumes and better efficiencies.

our 70,000 Mt drI expansion at konsari is moving briskly

and is expected to be completed in h2 F.y. 2023-24. this

project is expected to be completed in a record time of

12-15 months from the day we broke ground. execution has

always been lloyds Metals’ core competency, and we

proudly wear that on our sleeves.

Building upon our vision, the Company has undertaken an

embracing Capex programme which shall be a complete

game changer. our Capex programme is categorised

into three phases.

phase I involves a) 3,96,000 tonnes of drI, b)4 mn tonnes

of pellet c) 100 MW Captive power plant, d) 5,00,000 tonnes

of steel melting shop and Wire rod Mill each.

phase 2 involves expanding pellet capacity by additional 4

mn tonnes and building 85 kms of the slurry pipeline, being

the first of its type and length in the western region of India.

phase 3 involves setting up integrated steel-making

facilities include beneficiation also to maximise BHQ

value. the Company is currently pursuing its feasibility

and viability studies, and no financial closure is made

for this phase.

Fiscal discipline and its Management, backed by investment

in sustainability and Csr, will be the key priorities of our

onward journey.
