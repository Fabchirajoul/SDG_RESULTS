Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present to you

the 65th Annual Report for Bayer

CropScience Limited. The report

looks back on the Financial Year

2022-23. By all means an eventful

year, interspersed with challenges,

successes and green shoots of

opportunities that have the potential

to advance Indian agriculture.

We live in a volatile and recession-

prone world and the current world

situation has brought to light very

starkly a mission-critical need to

address the food and nutritional

security requirements of the country.

In addition to the geopolitical

environment, soaring oil prices,

rising

inflationary

pressures,

increasing labour shortage, and

climate change manifesting in

multiple distressing ways are all

alarm bells not only for the agri-

business but the economy at large.

All this has further highlighted the

need for a resilient supply chain,

climate-smart agriculture and a

strong digital and collaborative

ecosystem of all stakeholders.

As

an

organization,

Bayer

has

remained

steadfast

in

its

commitment

to

delivering

innovative solutions to strengthen

farmer resilience. As a leading

player in Indian agriculture, we

rolled out our drone commercial

operations for paddy, soybean,

corn and cotton crops during

the 2022 Kharif season across

key states in India. This was a

positive step towards sustainable

agriculture

thereby

enhancing

smallholder farmers’ prosperity.

The company drove collaborative

innovations to enhance farmer

incomes,

rural

livelihoods,

expanding access to innovative

agri-inputs, modern technologies,

training and capacity building while

swiftly mapping and resolving

customers’ future needs, leading to

significant gains.

In 2022-23, we persevered and

delivered strong value for all our

stakeholders. On the back of a

strong crop protection portfolio,

better corn acreages and strong

Bayer CropScience Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

The world as we know it today is

testing the resilience of our people

and planet, whether it is with regard

to food & nutritional security or

climate change concerns. But these

adverse events, whether they are

caused by the actions of humans

or the forces of nature – tend

to affect farmers, especially the

smallholders, worse than others.

The burden of serving the urgent

and growing need to ensure the

food and nutritional security of

nations lies on their shoulders and

these challenges are expected to

compound in the coming years.

We already know, 80% of the world’s

food needs are met by smallholder

farmers. Now more than ever is the

time to make these smallholders

and their agricultural practices more

sustainable and resilient.

But it is not a problem that can be

solved by any one government or

organization, or corporation alone.

Most of the challenges faced by

our smallholder farmers are firmly

rooted in economic and socio-

cultural norms that need to be

addressed proportionately to bring

about positive change. In addition to

the problem of small land holdings,

some of these challenges include

lack of knowledge; low technology

adoption;

inadequate

market

linkages; gender inequality; and

increasing shortage of labour among

others. Much better progress in

achieving these goals can be made

through collaboration with multiple

stakeholders jointly addressing the

same issues at scale.

A

multi-pronged

approach

is

needed to bridge these gaps and

make farming more productive and

profitable for smallholder farmers;

increase the participation of women

in

agriculture;

make

farming

attractive to future generations and

make the latest agri-innovations

and farming knowledge accessible

to all farmers. Digital technologies

become a great enabler in this

context.

We are seeing work happening at

all levels to advance and modernize
