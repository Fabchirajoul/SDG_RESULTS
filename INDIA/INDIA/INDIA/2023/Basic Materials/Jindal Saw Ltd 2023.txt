1.

Corporate and General Information

Jindal Saw Limited (“JSAW” or ‘’the Company’’) is domiciled and incorporated in India and its shares are publicly traded on

the National Stock Exchange (‘NSE’) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (‘BSE’), in India. The registered office of JSAW is situated

at A-1, UPSIDC Industrial Area, Nandgaon Road, Kosi Kalan, District Mathura, 281403 (U.P.) India.

The Company is a leading manufacturer and supplier of Iron & Steel pipes and pellets having manufacturing facilities in

India. Its products have application in oil and gas exploration, transportation, power generation, supply of water for drinking,

drainage, irrigation purposes and other industrial applications.

Summary of significant accounting policies

2.

Basis of preparation

The standalone financial statements comply in all material aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (IND AS) notified under

Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) [Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] and other relevant

provisions of the Act.

The Company has consistently applied the accounting policies used in the preparation for all periods presented.

The significant accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out in Note 3 of the Notes to the

Standalone Financial Statements.

3.1

Basis of Measurement

The standalone financial statements have been prepared on accrual basis and under the historical cost convention except

following which have been measured at fair value:

•

certain financial assets and liabilities,

•

defined benefit plans – plan assets measured at fair value,

•

derivative financial instruments,

•

share based payments

The standalone financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (`), which is the Company’s functional and presentation

currency and all amounts are rounded to the nearest lakhs (` 00,000) and two decimals thereof, except as stated otherwise.

3.2 Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Actual results could

vary from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to

accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision effects only that period or

in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future years (refer Note 4 on critical

accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements).

3.3 Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision

maker. The board of directors of Jindal Saw Limited has appointed Group CEO who assesses the financial performance and

position of the Company, and make strategic decisions. The Group CEO has been identified as being the chief decision

maker. Refer Note 42 for segment information provided.

3.4 Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, Plant and Equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when

it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can

be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when

replaced. Other maintenance costs are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements:

letter of credit which can be called upon if

the counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.

Impairment

Impairment is made on the expected credit losses, which are the present value of the cash shortfalls over the expected

life of financial assets. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase

in credit risk.The estimated impairment losses are recognised in a separate provision for impairment and the impairment

losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Subsequent changes in assessment of impairment are recognised in provision for impairment and the change in

impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

For foreign currency trade receivable, impairment is assessed after reinstatement at closing rates.

Individual receivables which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount of trade

receivable and the amount of the loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to other Income.

Investment in equity instruments

Investment in equity securities are initially measured at fair value. Any subsequent fair value gain or loss is recognized

through Profit or Loss if such investments in equity securities are held for trading purposes. The fair value gains or losses

of all other equity securities are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. Where the company’s management

has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is

no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit and loss. Dividends from such investments are

recognised in profit and loss as other income when the company’s right to receive payments is established. Impairment

losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from

other changes in fair value.

De-recognition of financial asset

A financial asset is derecognised only when

•

The company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or

•

Retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation

to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients.

Where the entity has transferred an asset, the company evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and

rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. Where the entity has not

transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised.

Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of

the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the company has not retained control of the financial asset.

Where the company retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of

continuing involvement in the financial asset.

b)

Financial liabilities

At initial recognition, all financial liabilities other than fair valued through profit and loss are recognised initially at fair

value less transaction costs that are attributable to the issue of financial liability. Transaction costs of financial liability

carried at fair value through profit or loss is expensed in profit or loss.

i)

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading. The Company has

not designated any financial liabilities upon initial measurement recognition at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are at each reporting date at fair value with all the changes

recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently

measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption

amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid

on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable

that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the

extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised

as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.

Borrowings are derecognised from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged,

cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or

transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed,

is recognised in profit or loss as other gains/(losses).

Borrowings are presented under current liabilities unless the company has unconditional right to defer settlement of

the liability for atleast twelve months after reporting period.

Trade and other payables

A payable is classified as ’trade payable’ if it is in respect of the amount due on account of goods purchased or services

received in the normal course of business. These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to

the Company prior to the end of financial year which are unpaid. Trade and other payables are presented as current

liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period. They are recognised initially at their fair

value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

De-recognition of financial liability

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. The

difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another

party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit

or loss as other income or finance costs.

Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet where there is a legally

enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset

and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must

be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company

or the counterparty.

letter of credit which can be

called upon if the counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.

Impairment

Impairment is made on the expected credit losses, which are the present value of the cash shortfalls over the expected life

of financial assets. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit

risk. The estimated impairment losses are recognised in a separate provision for impairment and the impairment losses are

recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Subsequent changes in assessment of impairment are recognised in provision for impairment and changes in impairment

losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses

For foreign currency trade receivable, impairment is assessed after reinstatement at closing rates.

Individual receivables which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount of trade

receivable and the amount of the loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other expenses.

Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to Other Income.

Investment in equity instruments

Investment in equity securities are initially measured at fair value. Any subsequent fair value gain or loss is recognized through

Profit and Loss if such investments in equity securities are held for trading purposes. Fair value gains or losses of all other

equity securities are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. Where the Group’s management has elected to present

fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification

of fair value gains and losses to profit and loss. Dividends from such investments are recognised in profit and loss as other

income when the Group’s right to receive payments is established. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses)

on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

De-recognition of financial asset

A financial asset is derecognised only when

•

The Group has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or

•

Retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay

the cash flows to one or more recipients.

Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Group evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards

of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. Where the entity has not transferred

substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised.

Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the

financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the Group has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the

Group retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement

in the financial asset.

(iv) Hon’ble Supreme Court’s Judgment dated February 28, 2019, relating to the provident fund, has been evaluated and

assessed by the Group based on a legal opinion obtained by the management. Accordingly, the Group has arrived

at the conclusion that there is no significant impact of this matter and no provision has been made in the books of

accounts.

v)

During the year and after the balance sheet date, Assessment orders for financial Years (FYs) 2014-15 to 2018-19 have

been issued by the Assessing Officer, under reassessment proceedings which were initiated during FY 2021-22 in

respect of FYs 2014-15 to 2019-20. In these Assessment Orders, certain additions have been made by the assessing

officer without substantiating the same and without following the principles of natural justice. Also, the said orders

have some procedural deficiencies. The Company, after considering all the information available and legal opinion

obtained, believes that the resulting Income Tax demand amounting to ` 8,969.05 lakhs is not sustainable and as such

no adjustment to consolidated financial statements is required.

It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigations with accuracy, the Group believes, based on legal

opinions received, that it has meritorious defences to the claims. The management believe the pending actions will

not require outflow of resources embodying economic benefits and will not have a material adverse effect upon the

results of the operations, cash flows or financial conditions of the Group.
