letter of the law to the fullest. To

ensure proper adherence to all tax matters and maintain regulatory compliance, CTIL has developed a well-functioning tax

strategy, which is reviewed periodically by the finance committee. CTIL’s tax approach ensures that the Company follows

all regulations pertaining to tax or compliances, which enables the Company to maintain a healthy business practice and

good reputation in the market. The tax strategy is implemented across all business segments, and the Company ensures

proper accounting of all taxation matters to reduce any tax related risks. The finance committee and the audit committee are

Integrated Annual Report 2022-23:

Dear Shareholders,

We have pleasure in presenting the 126th Annual Report of the Company along with the audited statement of accounts for the

year ended 31st March, 2023. As the Covid-19 pandemic has become self-limiting across the world, there was a positive shift

in sentiments, in terms of demand and realisations, resulting in improved profitability of the Company for the financial year

2022-23 after charging all expenses, interest costs etc. The Company managed to continue the growth momentum despite

multiple global headwinds including the Ukraine- Russia conflict which inflicted inflationary pressure directly or indirectly on the

businesses of the Company and created supply chain disruptions. As the threat of reoccurrence of pandemic is still looming,

though at a feeble state, the Company continues to assess and monitor the business operations regularly and is taking all

possible precautions in terms of safety of its staff and workers at all the locations of its offices and manufacturing plants.

The summarized financial results are given below.
