Managing Director & CEO) to make decisions

about resources to be allocated to the segments

and assess their performance. The Company has

currently two reportable segments (a) Carbon

materials and chemicals; and (b) Power.

(v) Contingent liabilities

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that

arises from past events whose existence will be

confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence

of one or more uncertain future events beyond the

control of the Company or a present obligation

that is not recognised because it is not probable

that an outflow of resources will be required to

settle the obligation. The Company does not

recognize a contingent liability but discloses its

existence in the Standalone financial statements.

(w) Exceptional items

When the items of income and expense within

profit or loss are of such size, nature and incidence

that their disclosure is relevant to explain the

performance of the Company for the period, the

nature and amount of such items is disclosed

separately as exceptional items. Such items

are material by nature or amount to the year’s

Standalone financial statements and require

separate disclosure in accordance with Ind AS.

(x) Business combination

The Company accounts for common control

transaction in accordance with the applicable

method prescribed under Ind AS 103 “Business

Combinations” for common control transactions

and also as per the provisions of the Scheme

approved by National Company Law Tribunal,

where all the assets and liabilities of the Transferor

Company is recorded at the carrying value as on

the Appointed Date.

(y) Determination of fair values

Fair

values

have

been

determined

for

measurement and disclosure purposes based on

the following methods. Where applicable, further

information about the assumptions made in

determining fair values is disclosed in the notes

specific to that asset or liability.

(i) Separable embedded derivative

The fair value of the separable embedded

derivative is measured using the Black-Scholes

Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs

include share price on measurement date,

expected term of the instrument, risk free

rate (based on government bond), expected

volatility.

(ii) Non-derivative financial assets

Non-derivative financial assets are initially

measured at fair value. If the financial asset

is not subsequently accounted for at fair

value through profit or loss, then the initial

measurement includes directly attributable

transaction costs. These are measured at

amortised cost or at FVTPL or at FVOCI.

Investments

in

equity

instruments

are

measured at FVOCI and adjusted net assets

method has been used for fair valuations of

investment in unquoted securities.

(iii) Trade and other receivables

The fair values of trade and other receivables

are estimated at the present value of future

cash flows, discounted at the market rate

of interest at the measurement date. Short-

term receivables with no stated interest rate

are measured at the original invoice amount.

Fair value is determined at initial recognition

and, for disclosure purposes, at each annual

reporting date.

(iv) Derivative financial liabilities

The

Company

uses

derivative

financial

instruments,

such

as

forward

currency

contracts, interest rate swaps, cross currency

swaps to hedge its foreign currency risks,

interest rate risks. Such derivative financial

instruments are initially recognised at fair value

on the date on which a derivative contract is

entered into and are subsequently re-measured

at fair value as at the reporting date.

(v) Other non-derivative financial liabilities

Other non-derivative financial liabilities are

measured at fair value, at initial recognition

and for disclosure purposes, at each annual

reporting date. Fair value is calculated based

on the present value of future principal and

interest cash flows, discounted at the market

rate of interest at the measurement date. For

finance leases the market rate of interest is
