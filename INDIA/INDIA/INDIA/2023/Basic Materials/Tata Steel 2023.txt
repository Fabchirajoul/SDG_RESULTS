T. V. Narendran

CEO &: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to present to you

Tata Steel’s Annual Report for FY2022-23.

I hope this: letter finds you and your

families well and safe.

The macro-economic volatility and

geo-political factors have dominated

the global business environment during

FY2022-23. Looking ahead, global growth

is poised to slow down to 2.8% in 2023

(from 3.4% in 2022), led by a pronounced

slowdown in developed markets. In

contrast, emerging markets, led by India,

will provide some cushion.

India’s growth continues to be

resilient, underpinned by the

Government’s capital outlay and buoyant

private consumption. India’s GDP is

estimated to have registered a growth

of 6.8% in FY2022-23 and is expected to

continue to be the fastest growing large

economy for the third consecutive year.

India's steel consumption grew by

over 10% Y-o-Y to 117 million tonnes in

FY2022-23. Given the current stage of

development of the Indian economy

and the focus on infrastructure

development, steel demand growth

in India is expected to keep pace with

the GDP growth over the next decade.

Demand from key steel consuming

sectors such as construction, capital

goods, railways, and automotive is

expected to remain robust.

For the year ended March 31, 2023,

the Consolidated Revenue of the

Company was ₹2,43,353 crore, which

was marginally lower compared to

the previous year’s Consolidated

Revenue of ₹2,43,959 crore. Both the

Consolidated EBITDA and Profit after

Tax of the Company for FY2022-23

were substantially lower compared to

the previous year. In FY2022-23, the

Consolidated EBITDA of the company

was ₹32,698 crore compared ₹63,830

crore in the previous year. Consolidated

Profit after Tax in FY2022-23 was ₹8,075

crore, compared to ₹41,749 crore in the

previous year. The financial performance

in FY2022-23 was impacted by higher

cost structure due to elevated energy

and emission related costs and raw

material price volatility.

CREATION:

Dear Stakeholders

I am pleased to bring to you our

inaugural Business Responsibility and

Sustainability Report (BRSR). At Tata

Steel, we have long recognised the

Environment, Social and Governance

(ESG) stewardship as a core to our

purpose. We have a proud legacy

of pioneering positive change, not

just within the industry but in the

communities where we operate as well,

and our commitment remains steadfast.

As the shift to a low-carbon economy

is likely to unfold faster, the implications

on steel, a hard-to-abate sector shall be

profound. We take cognisance of the

urgency of the decarbonisation journey

to meet the evolving stakeholder

expectations. Our Net Zero target is in

line with the Tata Group’s target and

is the most ambitious net zero target

adopted by any major steel company

globally.

We continue to seek innovative ways

for this transition, through continuous

experimentation, and investments in

research, technological innovations,

and partnerships. Adoption of Direct

Reduced Iron (DRI) using green

hydrogen, injection of hydrogen in blast

furnaces, carbon capture & utilisation

technologies and use of alternate

low-carbon fuels, such as biomass,

are key areas in this approach. While

the company explores sustainable

alternatives to traditional steel

production methods, it is concurrently

investing in new and alternate materials,

evolving compliance landscape, and the

imperative of improved disclosures. To

effectively mitigate these challenges, we

have in place a comprehensive Code of

Ethics, a holistic compliance framework

and an integrated governance structure

that carries a strong commitment

to global ESG disclosure standards

for promoting transparency and

accountability.

Our efforts towards ESG initiatives

during the past year are detailed in

the later pages and I encourage you to

read our Integrated Report and BRSR to

gain a comprehensive understanding

of the progress we have made. Our

commitment to ESG not only aligns to

the global expectations but also serves

as a catalyst for our long-term success

and resilience in the face of evolving

market dynamics.

Warm Regards,

T. V. Narendran

Chief Executive Officer &

Managing Director

as part of its efforts to offer more

sustainable alternatives to steel. Within

the realm of biodiversity conservation,

we have implemented initiatives aimed

at revitalising and safeguarding the flora

and fauna and restoring the natural

habitats.

We aspire to be a global benchmark

for corporate citizenship. Our efforts are

aligned to this vision as we endeavour

to improve workforce Diversity, Equity

and Inclusion (DE&I), health and safety,

and community well-being. We have

established clear and measurable

objectives for our DE&I journey and have

charted out holistic plans for broadening

the number of lives positively impacted

through CSR initiatives, developing a

responsible supply chain through ethical

sourcing and ensuring the code of

conduct compliance.

Tata Steel consciously embeds

the highest standards of governance

in its operations. We recognise the

criticality of governance challenges

relating to business ethics, ever-

MoU with Punjab Government to set up a steel scrap

based electric arc furnace steel plant

On August 26, 2022, the Company signed a Memorandum

of Understanding ('MoU') with the Government of Punjab

for setting up a 0.75 MnTPA long products steel plant with

a scrap-based electric arc furnace (‘EAF’). This greenfield

facility will be set up at Kadiana Khurd, Hitech Valley,

Ludhiana in Punjab.

The state-of-the-art EAF-based steel plant would produce

construction grade steel rebar under the Company’s

flagship retail brand ‘Tata Tiscon’, which would enable

Tata Steel to further augment its market presence in the

construction segment.

This is a part of the Company’s commitment to investing

in a circular economy and transitioning to low-carbon

steelmaking through the steel recycling route. It is a step

aligned to the Company’s goal of achieving Net Zero

carbon emission by 2045.:

insight generation. The Company rolled out its channel and

sales management application, Sampoorna, across its retail

letter of support from T S Global

Holdings Pte. Ltd. to either refinance or repay its Revolving

Credit Facility and uncommitted facilities due to expire on

or before June 2024. T S Global Procurement Company Pte.

Ltd. has also provided a: letter of support to the UK business

for access to £300m of additional working capital, which

is more than estimated to be required under a severe but

plausible downside scenario over the next twelve months.

The letters state that they represent present policy, are

given by way of comfort only and are not to be construed

as constituting a promise as to the future conduct of the

entities or Tata Steel Limited. Accordingly, there can be

no certainty that the funds required by Tata Steel Europe

Limited will be made available. These conditions, along

with the other matters explained in the special purpose

financial information, indicate the existence of a material

uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the

entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. The special

purpose financial information does not include the

adjustments that would result if the entity were unable to

continue as a going concern.”

c.

Nature, material terms, monetary value and

particulars of contracts or arrangement

TSUK requires iron ore for its manufacturing unit in Europe which can be supplied by TSMC.

TSUK has limited access to multi-user port i.e., Port of Sept-Îles located in the Province of

Quebec, where TSMC operates its iron ore mines. Therefore, TSMC supplies iron ore to TSUK

for its manufacturing units in Europe through TSGPL. In order to ease out the logistics, TSMC

has secured an arrangement with IOC Sales (i.e., a third party who has a private captive port for

its exclusive use for iron ore operations in Canada) to use its private port for sale of iron ore to

TSGPL. Under this arrangement, TSMC sells the iron ore it produces to IOC Sales who in turn sells

it to TSGPL which ultimately supplies the iron ore to TSUK.

The aforementioned transactions are proposed to be entered during FY2023-24 for an aggregate

amount of up to ₹1,200 crore.
