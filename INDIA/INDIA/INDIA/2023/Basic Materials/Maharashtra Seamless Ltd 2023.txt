3.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due

causing ﬁnancial loss to the Company. Credit risk arises from Company’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives

and receivables from customers.

The Company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business

activities. Credit risk across the Company, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, advance

payments and security deposits .

The Company extends credit to customers in normal course of business. The Company considers factors such as credit

track record in the market and past dealings for extension of credit to customers. The Company monitors the payment

track record of the customers. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The company evaluates the

concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and

operate in largely independent markets.

The ageing of trade receivable is as below:
