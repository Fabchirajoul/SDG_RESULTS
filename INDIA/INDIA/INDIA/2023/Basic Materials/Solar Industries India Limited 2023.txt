Dear shareholders,

Looking back at the year with

a sense of contentment, I

am pleased to present the

28th annual report of our

Company at the conclusion

of the fiscal year 2022-23.

Despite the Russia-Ukraine

war impacting the supply

of essential commodities in

the market, we maintained

steady supplies and earned

customer confidence across

the globe. While the global

challenges persisted, our

team strived for excellence,

introduced innovative

products and processes and

secured robust financial

performance. It not only

proves the merit of our

growth-focused strategies

but also demonstrates our

commitment to leading

responsible transformation.

Economic

Overview

During the financial year

2022-23, the Government’s

emphasis on a favourable

policy environment and the

Central Bank’s efforts to

revive monetary policy bode

well for the Indian economy.

Considering the facts that

the country reported robust

demand growth in the

domestic market and the

RBI policies helped tame

inflation to a certain extent,

the future economic outlook

remains quite optimistic.

While there is an impending

recession in many parts of

the world, India is expected

to retain its position as

one of the fastest-growing

economies in the world.

Growth

Opportunities

The Indian government is

seeking to strengthen an

indigenous defence market.

We believe that the emphasis

on the Defence sector opens

up numerous opportunities

for us. To make India

‘Atmanirbhar’ in defence

procurement, the Government

has listed over Four thousand

items that have to be

procured from the domestic

market instead of relying on

imports.

As a domestic manufacturer,

we are motivated to seize

this opportunity. With the

Government increasing

private participation in the

Defence sector our aim is

to become an organisation

that delivers value to our

stakeholders, through

manufacturing best-in-class

and sustainable products.

We are consistently investing

in enhancing our capacities,

adding new products to the

defence portfolio, adopting

new technologies, upgrading

existing processes and hiring

highly skilled manpower

to create an organisation

that can deftly deal with

challenges in the future.

In line with India’s aim of

becoming a USD 5 trillion

economy, huge capital

investments are being

made in sectors such as

mining, road construction,

infrastructure, housing

development, power and

coal mining. The Government

also aims to fulfil its coal

production target of 1.23

billion tonnes by 2025, up

from the current 900 million

tonnes.

Moreover, the Government’s

plans to increase 4 lane

highways from the current 2%

to 10% of total roadways in

the next decade are expected

to create greater demand

for explosives. In addition,

the Government’s decision to

phase out electric detonators

by March 2024 will help us

expand our portfolio with

value-added products.

Social Endeavours

At Solar, we place utmost

importance on environmental

preservation, which guides

our product development,

process establishment, and

policy creation. We take

pride in being more than just

a business, as our corporate

social responsibility

initiatives encompass a wide

range of activities, including

education promotion,

preventive healthcare efforts,

sanitation advocacy, and

skill development initiatives.

Our CSR policy is therefore

focused on uplifting the

underprivileged and the

underserved. Together, we

are motivated to shape a

future where more people

will have access to the

resources required for living

independent lives.

At Solar, we place

utmost importance

on environmental

preservation, which guides

our product development,

process establishment,

and policy creation.

28th Annual General Meeting:

Dear Shareholders,

Another fortunate year for me

to write to the stakeholders

of Solar Group after an

eventful year of robust

results, which serve as a

testament to our strategic

clarity, the power of our

brands, our exceptional

execution capabilities, and

our remarkable agility.

A year of

exceptional

financial

achievements

The fiscal year 2023 started

as a promising year and

ended with record breaking

performance as follows:

•

Consolidated revenue of

H 6923 crore in 2022-23

over H 3948 crore in

2021-22, registering a

growth of 75%

•

A record high EBITDA of

H 1320 crore, which was

72% up from the previous

year

•

A healthy operational

net profit for the year

stood at H 811 crore which

was up more than 78%

compared with H 455

crore in the previous year

•

Our order book value

stood at H 2944 crore

•

We also made solid

progress on some of our

key issues and continued

to strengthen our balance

sheet. Leveraging our

robust operating cash

flows, we brought down

our net debt to underlying

EBITDA to 0.69 from 1.02

•

The Board of Directors

have recommended a

dividend of 400% this

year compared to 375% in

the previous year which is

H 8 per share

An energised

performance

Our business is powered by

the continued trust that our

investors place in us.

We achieve this through

operational excellence,

continued strengthening

of our balance sheet, and

efficient capital allocation

that supports capex projects

and new business ventures.

During the year, we have

strengthened our market

share across key customers

in the mining sector, with

products that continue to

bring value to our customers.

The export and overseas

businesses have also

recorded the highest sales

ever and have contributed

effectively to our excellent

operational and financial

performance for the year.

Defence is a very different

ballgame and Solar has

the necessary facilities

for high-energy materials,

propellants, storage, and

testing. This makes us a one-

stop-shop for most defence

programs. To build on this

strength, we require Capex to

incorporate new technologies

and develop new products.

We have already proven

our capabilities with the

successful launch of the

Vikram S space rocket, the

delivery of the first batch of

Brahmos thrust motors and

the much-coveted first batch

of 100% indigenous 30 MM

ammunition.

Our defence portfolio

has secured export orders

from several countries,

highlighting our credibility as

a trusted supplier of quality

products. Having established

ourselves in the Indian

ammunition market, we have

become the first private

sector company in India to

receive an export order for

ready- to-use ammunition.

Besides, we have received the

first ever indigenous order

for MMHG, from the Indian

Army, further reiterating our

commendable performance.

Energised to serve

our customers in

future

Our Strategic Business

plans continue to steer

our Company’s growth.

Simultaneously, it also

responds with agility to flux

in the business environment.

Our customers have bestowed

trust and confidence upon

us in lieu of our commitment

towards quality & safety of

the products

The Company’s policy of

aiming for wider geographic

dispersal continues to

yield positive results while

A. CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

The Company has always been a forerunner in conservation of

energy and natural resources. All manufacturing processes and

products are designed for minimising carbon footprints and

are being continuously upgraded to consistently accomplish

this goal. The Company has a distinction of having key plants

certified for ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 which

is a culmination of our sustained efforts and our policy of

protecting environment and natural resources.

The pioneering effort of the Company in rainwater harvesting

has started giving decent outcomes. Construction of benches,

trenches, open reservoirs and check dams in the large open

land areas in the plant will result in considerable increase in

the water table in and around the plant area, thus ensuring

year-round water availability for our plant operation &

plantation. Moreover, availability of rain waters-a soft water-in

the open ponds, saves on water softening and saving in energy

policies

2.1 Basis of preparation

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared

on an accrual basis and under the historical cost convention

except for certain financial instruments (including derivative

instruments) and defined benefit plans which have been

measured at fair value. The accounting policies are consistently

applied by the Company to all the period mentioned in the

financial statements.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance

with the Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) notified under

section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) read with

the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, (as

amended).

Current and non-current classification

sheet based on current / non-current classification.

An asset is treated as current when it is :

•

Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed

in normal operating cycle

•

Held primarily for the purpose of trading

•

Expected to be realised within twelve months after the

reporting period, or

•

Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being

exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve

•

Held primarily for the purpose of trading

•

It is due to be settled within twelve months after the

reporting period, or

•

There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of

the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting

assets and liabilities.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of

assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash

equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its

operating cycle.

2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies

a.

Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires

the management to make judgements, estimates and

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue,

expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying

disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could

result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment

to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future

periods.

b.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of

accumulated impairment loss, if any. Property, Plant

and Equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated

depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if

any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of

the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-

term construction projects if the recognition criteria are

met. The cost comprises the purchase price and directly

attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working

condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts and

rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price.

Capital work-in-progress includes cost of Property, Plant

and Equipment that are not ready for their intended use.

The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant and

equipment comprises the cost of materials and direct

labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing

the item to working condition for its intended use, and

estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and

restoring the site on which it is located.

If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment

have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as

separate items (major components) of property, plant and

of reports of other auditors on separate financial statements and

on the other financial information of the subsidiaries, associate

and jointly controlled entity, the aforesaid consolidated financial

statements give the information required by the Companies Act,

2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give

under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those

Standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities

in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient

and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the

consolidated financial statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional

judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated

financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the

consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our

opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these

matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit

addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key

consolidated financial statements. The results of audit procedures

performed by us and by other auditors of components not audited

by us, as reported by them in their audit reports furnished to us by

the management, including those procedures performed to address

the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the

accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Key audit matters

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Revenue Recognition (as described in note 2.2(j) of the consolidated financial statements)

Revenue from sale of goods is recognized as outlined in

note 20 of the consolidated financial statements.

The Holding Company estimates the provision for

powder factor on sales made to certain customers which

is generally the percentage of blast output achieved at

the time of blasting of the products at the customer’s site.

Powder factor is based on the agreement with customer,

volume of output achieved at the site, which is measured

on the likely powder factor to be achieved on current

sales which is reduced from the sales for the period.

Evaluated the Holding Company’s accounting policies pertaining to revenue

recognition and assessed compliance with those policies in terms of Ind AS

July 31, 2018, authorised the Board of Directors (which term shall

be deemed to include any Committee of the Board) to borrow

money(ies) on behalf of the Company and for creation of charge

on any assets or undertaking of the Company as security in favour

of lending agencies for a sum not exceeding H 1500 Crores (Rupees

One Thousand Five Hundred Crores only), over and above the

aggregate of the paid-up share capital and free reserves of the

Company. The above limit is apart from temporary loans obtained

or to be obtained from the Company’s bankers in the ordinary

course of business.

In the year 2018, when the borrowing limits were increased to

H 1500 Crores the revenue achieved was H 1305 Crores whereas in the

current financial year, revenue of the company has reached to H 4162

Crores which is a growth of around 219%. Based on our estimation

we are targeting compounded growth in the next 3 to 4 years. Apart

from this, the Company has to support its subsidiaries for their business

operations hence we are proposing to increase our borrowing limits

from H1500 Crores to H 3000 Crores for our capex requirements,

working capital and investments needs of the business. The Company

may be further required to borrow money, either secured or unsecured,

from the banks/ financial institutions/other body corporate, from time

to time, and to pledge, mortgage, hypothecate and/or charge any or

all of the movable and immovable properties of the Company and/or

whole or part of the undertaking of the Company.

The Board of Directors of the Company proposes to increase the

limits to borrow money and to secure such borrowings by pledging,

mortgaging, hypothecating the movable or immovable properties

of the Company amounting up to H 3000 Crores (Rupees Three

Thousand Crores only). The above limit is apart from temporary

loans obtained or to be obtained from the Company’s bankers in the

ordinary course of business.

It is, therefore, required to obtain fresh approval of members by

Special Resolution under Sections 180(1) (a) and 180(1)(c) of the

Companies Act, 2013, to enable the Board of Directors (which term

shall be deemed to include any Committee of the Board) to borrow

money and to mortgage and / or create a charge on any of the

movable and / or immovable properties and / or the whole or any

part of the undertaking(s) of the Company to secure its borrowings

up to a sum not exceeding H 3000 Crores (Rupees Three Thousand

Crores only), which may exceed the aggregate of the paid-up share

capital, free reserves and Security Premium of the Company. The

above limit is apart from temporary loans obtained or to be obtained

from the Company’s bankers in the ordinary course of business.

None of the Directors or the Key Managerial Personnel of the

Company including their relatives is in any way concerned or

interested in the resolutions.

The Board recommends the Special Resolutions at Item no. 7 and 8

of this Notice for the approval of the members.
