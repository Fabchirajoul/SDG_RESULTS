Corporate Overview:

Dear Stakeholders,

As a responsible organisation in the cement industry, our Company is constantly analyzing and forecasting both global

and national cement megatrends to stay ahead of the curve. We understand that the world is changing, and so is the

demand for cement. In the global context, the slow but steady shift from developed to developing economies has resulted in

increased demand for cement, especially in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, and African regions. On the other hand, developed

economies focus more on sustainable outcomes as the climate change concern takes global attention. This has led to a

growth in the production of eco-friendly alternatives, which we at our Company have focused on.

On a national level, we recognise that our customers require innovation and high-quality products. We believe that cement

production must consider ecological and social responsibilities alongside other crucial factors. As such, our focus is to

manufacture products that meet the standards of both developed and developing economies. In this regard, we aim to

optimise the use of alternative raw materials, limit energy consumption, streamline supply chain, focus on distribution and

transportation, and invest in research & development. We are committed to meeting and exceeding the expectations of

our customers and forging strong partnerships through excellent customer service, constant innovation, and embracing

cement megatrends.

At our Company, we hold ourselves to rigorous standards of governance. We prioritise accountability and transparency, and

we have implemented various measures to ensure our conduct aligns with industry best practices. This includes conducting

an annual assessment of our governance framework and processes to ensure their effectiveness and efficiency. The

Company has embarked on its ESG Journey during the financial year. As part of this journey we have initiated integrating

ESG factors in decision making and business expansion.

Our organisation’s environment commitment enforces the use of environmentally responsible resources, ensures resource

efficiency in operations and moderates the impact on climate change. We have enhanced the proportion of blended

cement in our production to approximately 90%. We undertake continuous improvement in our energy efficiency and

offset our carbon emissions through afforestation activities in and around its mines and plant operations. Further We have

collaborated with a major petrochemical company for the usage of eco-friendly fuel- “Xtra Green”, which produces lesser

emissions. For the reduction of logistical emissions our Company has made back haul arrangements for transportation

of clinker from Lumshnong to Guwahati with fly ash. We have also enhanced our water positivity through optimisation of

water consumption and securing water from alternative sources.

As part of the social commitment of our organisation, we prioritise on building trust and relationship with our stakeholders

including employee, suppliers, customer, and community groups. The Company promotes eco-efficiency amongst

stakeholders by organising several engagements; one such event is ‘Beat the Plastic Pollution’ initiative, to promote

responsible disposal of plastic.

Our Company’s investment in creating an inclusive and safe workplace “has resulted in making Star Cement one of the great

places to work. The ideation programme, “Star Sujhaav” fosters innovation within the organisation, leading to improved

efficiency and delivering enhanced business value to our customers. Our customer centric approach is centered on

developing digital solutions that enable stakeholders including dealers, engineers and distributors to collaborate effectively

and enhance the customer experience. We are proud to offer a range of applications that promote 24*7 engagement, such

as WhatsApp for Business, Star Lotus App to engage contractors, Star Saathi App for dealer networks, and Star Stellar App

to facilitate loyalty programs and other interactions with each stakeholder group.

(ii) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because

of changes in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates

primarily to the Company’s debt obligations with floating interest rates.

The Company’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings with variable rates, which expose the

Company to cash flow interest rate risk. During 31st March, 2023 and 31st March, 2022 , the Company’s borrowings

at variable rate were denominated in Indian Rupee (INR).

The Company’s Deposit taken from dealers is at fixed rate and measured at amortised cost. They are therefore not

subject to interest rate risk as defined in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will

fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.

letter. Hon’ble Meghalaya High Court has stayed the said demand vide its order dated

16-06-2020 and the matter is subjudice. Based on the legal advice obtained by the Company from an External Counsel

and based on its own assessment there is every likelihood that the said demand shall be quashed and therefore no

provision have been taken in the books of account.

(b) In respect of demand notice dated 19th February, 2020 received by the Company from Director of Mineral Resources,

Meghalaya, for payment of royalty, MEPRF, VAT/GST for ` 4,184.06 Lakhs in pursuance to the National Green Tribunal

(NGT) order dated 17th January, 2020 passed in O.A. No. 110(TCH)/2012 for alleged illegal coal procurement. By passing

the said order NGT has accepted the Recommendation of the 5th Interim Report of the Independent Committee set up

by NGT, which has suggested imposition of penalty on Cement Companies and Thermal Power Plants in Meghalaya.

The Company did not purchase any illegal coal and had complied with all disclosure requirements of the various

Government Departments. The Report of NGT Committee has been founded on the basis of assumptions and views

of the Committee and not on hard facts. Further to note, that neither the Company has been issued a show-cause nor

any opportunity of being heard was given to the Company before submitting the Interim reports by the Independent

Committee to NGT. Even NGT has not served any notice on the Company before passing the impugned order dated

17th January, 2020 which is clear violation of principles of natural justice.The Company backed by the legal opinions,

believes that it has a good case in the matter as the said order was issued based on certain hypothetical assumptions

and views and not on hard facts. No opportunity of being heard was provided to the Company either by NGT committee

or by NGT itself which passed order without going into the merits & facts and accepted the recommendations of 5th

Interim Report. Therefore, there is every likelihood of the Demand Notice and the order of the NGT being set aside.

The Company has preferred an appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the NGT Order.The Hon’ble

Supreme Court in its Order dated 2nd May, 2023 has set the Order of NGT and remand back the same to NGTfor its

further considerations and accordingly, no provisions has been made in the accounts.

(c) During the year the Company has received a demand notice dated 20th March, 2023 from the Divisional Mining Officer

(DMO), Directorate of Mineral Resources, Meghalaya, Jowai towards outstanding dues of royalty & Cess on Coal,

Sandstone, Clay and Shale procured/consumed by the Company in certain specific periods between FY 09-10 to FY

22-23 amounting to ` 2,650.31 Lakhs (including ` 1,552.61 Lakhs towards Penal Interest). As per the provisions of

the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, the liability for payment of royalty in respect of any

mineral removed/ consumed from the mining lease arises on the holder of the mining lease and not on the purchaser

of such mined minerals. Hence, there is no obligation of the Company to pay royalty/cess in case the minerals are

procured from third party vendors. However, as an abundant precaution, the Company has kept liability towards

Royalty & Cess on above mineral products amounting to ` 487.88 Lakhs (including net additional provision of ` 89.79

Lakhs during the year). Since the liability to pay royalty & Cess itself is not applicable to the Company, hence provision

for differential amount of demand amounting to ` 609.82 Lakhs and penal interest amounting to ` 1,552.61 Lakhs has

not been provided and shown as contingent liability. The Company shall contest the above demand and based on the

legal opinion obtained in this regard, it believes the said demand raised by the DMO is not tenable and the matter shall

be disposed off in the favour of the Company.
