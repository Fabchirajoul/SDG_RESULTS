Managing Director,

Mr. Mayank Singhal spoke about the importance

of a new thought architecture for solving global

sustainability challenges. He referred to 4 C’s as core

pillars to drive this shift in thinking viz. Connections,

Collaboration, Cooperation and Conversations, as a

model for re-engineering and recalibrating human

presence on Earth.

Similarly, this report is an endeavor to demonstrate

how we generate value through our business

activities supported by continuous stakeholder

engagement built on a foundation of strong corporate

governance. We measure our ability to create

value for the long-term through the six capitals viz.

financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, social

and relationship, and natural. While we seek to

deliver for the environment, we are also laser-focused

on profitability and reaching our medium-term target

of mid-to high-teens revenue growth. We believe

that our team is on the path to grow intelligently

and profitably and to methodically build a category-

shifting brand. We understand that sustainable value

creation requires us to stretch beyond our immediate

operations. We actively engage with our supply

chain partners, customers and local communities to

bring multiple perspectives into our decision-making

processes. Responsible growth needs a sensitive

organizational culture that fosters positive change in

the organization and the external environment.

As we present this integrated report, we acknowledge

that our journey is ongoing, and we will be faced with

many learning moments and opportunities. We also

understand the importance of continuously improving

and adapting to the ever-changing sustainability

landscape. Lastly, this report is not just a reflection

of our past achievements, but also a blueprint for our

future endeavors. It outlines our strategic priorities,

goals, and targets, serving as a roadmap for our

ongoing commitment to sustainable development.

As we embark on this journey, we acknowledge that

achieving true sustainability requires collaboration

and collective effort. We extend our gratitude to

our employees, customers, suppliers, investors,

communities, and other stakeholders for their

continued support and partnership. Together, we

will drive positive change and build a better future

for all.

We invite you to explore this integrated report,

understand our business model, and join us on our

sustainability journey.

Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present our first ever Integrated

Report for FY23, reflecting upon the progress

and accomplishments of our global agrochemical

Company over the past year. In my last: letter, I

emphasized envisioning our next 75 years, and the

need for a healthier planet. In an era of increasing

environmental awareness and the urgent need for

sustainable solutions, we have remained committed

to our mission of transitioning our business while

reimagining a healthier planet.

Amidst global economic uncertainty, businesses

faced a multitude of challenges in the past year.

Factors such as inflation, fluctuating exchange

rates, and geopolitical tensions added complexity

to the operating environment. The pervasive

impact of supply chain disruptions, raw material

shortages, and escalating input costs significantly

influenced commodity prices. Keeping in mind

the future implications of climate change, this

year we witnessed a significant shift in the

agrochemical industry’s landscape, with a

growing emphasis on sustainable practices,

biodiversity preservation, and the well-being

of our planet. As responsible corporate

citizens, we have proactively embraced this

transition, recognizing the importance of

addressing the challenges posed by climate

change, resource scarcity, food, and nutrition

security.

Agriculture

plays

a

pivotal

role

in

addressing global challenges such as food

and nutritional security, and as a global

agrochemical Company, one of our primary

objectives is to redefine our approach to

agrochemicals and develop innovative,

Responsible growth that nurtures the

needs of today without compromising

the possibilities of tomorrow is a motto

that PI has embedded in its growth

journey.

environmentally friendly solutions. Our research

and development teams have been hard at work,

collaborating with leading scientists and experts to

create a new generation of products that reduce

environmental

impact

without

compromising

productivity to address the food and nutritional

needs of our planet.

With a growing global population, rapid urbanization,

and increased expenditure on food consumption,

our purpose to serve customers in both global

and domestic markets becomes even more vital.

Embracing responsible growth for a better tomorrow,

our key focus areas harmonize with NITI Aayog’s 2030

India vision, encompassing measures to enhance

farmers’ income, ensure nutritional security, and

foster sustainable food systems. Areas we are

focusing on for the future include the following:

Sustainable Crop Protection

Promoting sustainable agricultural practices and

responsible use of crop protection chemicals, we

emphasize adoption of integrated pest management

practices, and follow responsible marketing and

accurate labelling on all our products among the

farming communities in India. Through advanced

biotechnology and precision application techniques,

we aim to minimize the ecological footprint while

ensuring crop protection and productivity. We

are also actively working to increase the share of

biologicals in our product mix. In FY23, biologicals

contributed 9.2 percent to the domestic agri brands

revenues. Further reaffirming our commitment

towards customer safety and protecting human

health and the environment, all our products remain

free from highly toxic substances.

Soil Health and Regeneration

Nurturing soil health today paves the way for

responsible growth, ensuring a better tomorrow

where sustainable agriculture thrives and our precious

earth flourishes. Recognizing the importance of

healthy soils for sustainable agriculture, we have

invested in fostering key strategic alliances, research

and education programs focused on soil conservation,

restoration, and regeneration. In line with this

commitment, PI Foundation has partnered with state

agricultural universities. Furthermore, PI Foundation

has formed a collaborative partnership with the

District Administration in Bharuch district, Gujarat.

This joint effort aims to implement an agricultural

demonstration project, focusing on sustainable

agricultural practices in the region. Our objective is to

assist farmers in enhancing soil health and resilience

by advocating for the promotion of organic matter

enrichment, implementing reduced tillage practices,

and encouraging responsible nutrient management.

Through these approaches, we strive to support

farmers in their efforts to improve soil quality and

strengthen its ability to withstand environmental

stresses.

Biodiversity Conservation

We firmly believe that agriculture should coexist

harmoniously with nature. To that end, we continued

to undertake significant efforts to promote biodiversity

conservation efforts on farmlands, such as creating

pollinator-friendly habitats, implementing integrated

pest management practices, and partnering with

organizations dedicated to increase forest cover and

protect endangered species.

Climate-Smart Agriculture

Climate change presents formidable challenges

to global agriculture. We are focused on driving

innovation in our product offerings by building

resilience to climate change impacts, improving

agricultural productivity while minimizing negative

environmental impacts and increasing farmers’

earnings at the same time. Our national level

climate-smart agriculture initiatives such as the

Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) strive to support farmers

in adapting to climatic change conditions and saving

trillions of litres of water while mitigating greenhouse

gas emissions. We proactively explore climate-

resilient crop varieties, resource-efficient irrigation

techniques, and carbon sequestration practices as

part of our comprehensive approach.

Managing Director

Message from the: Dear Shareholders,

PI Industries has had another remarkable year, marked by consistent growth and high

margins. We saw 23 percent growth in revenue from operations along with more than

46 percent year-on-year growth in profit after tax despite the global challenges that

impacted our operating environment. We are extremely proud of our long-standing

association with our global innovator partners and are equally thankful to the

millions of Indian farmers who continue to trust our brand and use our

products.

Our annual financial performance has exceeded our updated projections.

We registered 26 percent year-on-year growth from exports due to an

increased uptake on existing products and the introduction of 4 new

products. We also saw 12 percent growth in the domestic segment.

Our newly launched brands such as Distruptor®, Brofreya®, Sectin®,

Provide®, Dinoace™, Taurus®, Tomatough® have gained good traction

and acceptance.

Our strong performance has been the result of our focus on a growth

strategy that is based on building a strong customer value chain driven

by digitization and strategic tie-ups, focus on intellectual property to

drive differentiation in the marketplace along with organic expansion

and inorganic growth opportunities.

Our Product Innovation team leveraged the state-of-the-

art integrated R&D set-up for crop protection, with

chemical discovery, laboratory, and green house

facilities for biological testing and farm resources

for first field trials. FY23 we successfully filed 15

INPRV patents, taking the total count of filed

patents to 147.

Our Process R&D team was actively engaged

in more than 50 projects in the areas of

agrochemistry,

electronic

chemicals,

and

product life cycle management. This year, we

commercialized two new process innovations

at Kilo Lab/Pilot Plant stage. With this, we

significantly improved the process efficiency

for large-scale manufacturing. Adding to our

product stewardship initiatives, this approach

will also result in a reduced environmental

footprint, promoting the adoption of this

technology for future projects.

We are creating a roadmap for responsible growth for a better

tomorrow using a multi-pronged growth strategy which is also

supported by prudent financial management”

We also invested extensively in developing a digital

edge and building integrated capabilities throughout

the organization. Our digital initiatives across

application modernization, analytics, adoption of

cloud technology, and strengthening our information

security framework have helped to enhance

operational efficiency, drive innovation, and improve

the overall competitiveness in the marketplace.

One of our major achievements has been the adoption

of cloud technology and the successful modernization

of legacy applications. This has enabled us to be more

agile and responsive to changing business needs. We

have migrated key applications and workloads to

the cloud thus, improving scalability, and reliability

to help us reduce costs. We have also invested

heavily in analytics enabling us to gain deeper

insights into business operations and to make data-

driven decisions. We further introduced electronic

lab notebooks as an analytical tool to digitalize the

process development data and facilitate information

access from archives and other data sources.

Marking another milestone in our 75-year rich

history and our entry into Pharmaceuticals, we

recently completed two key acquisitions in the Active

Pharmaceuticals Ingredients (API) and Contract

Development

and

Manufacturing

Organization

(CDMO) space. This will be an opportunity for us to

leverage our existing chemistry and R&D capabilities

into expanding our global footprint for clinical

research organization (CRO) and CDMO offerings.

As we enter our 76th year, our journey towards

sustainability is being recognized globally. I was

invited to the 4th edition of Engaging India@

Almedalen conference in Sweden to deliver the

keynote address. It is a marquee conference held

during Almedalen Week; Europe’s most prominent

platforms for stakeholders to showcase their success

stories. Our approach of consciously choosing to

embed environmental and societal responsibilities

deep into PI’s core DNA is now generating global

interest. It is a matter of pride that we are seen as

a symbol of a new India where growth is not only

responsible, sensitive, and mindful and but is also

inclusive and focuses on people-centric globalisation.

To that end, we are fundamentally pivoting to an R&D-

driven products and services line where our going in

position is that Nature is our teacher. Our innovation

is focused on learning from nature, mimicking it,

and working harmoniously with chemicals, green

chemistry, and biologicals. Further, it is important to

note that we at PI Industries are pursuing our growth

53

Annual Integrated Report 2022-23

strategy with a strong bias towards respecting the

natural limits and boundaries of Earth’s resources.

We introduced several initiatives under product

stewardship to better manage our impact on the

natural environment. In FY23, we recycled 14,699

KL of water through rain water harvesting and RO

permeate. We also increased our use of renewable

energy to 4.83 percent in the total electricity mix and

reduced our carbon emissions intensity by nearly

17 percent from FY22. This approach to pursuing

responsible growth for a better tomorrow will be the

central tenet of all that we do going forward.

This is our first integrated report in accordance with

the IIRC’s <IR> Framework. It is a pivotal change in

our reporting processes aligned with global best

practices. PI Industries is adapting to the changing

external environment with pronounced concerns

around development that meets the needs of the

present without compromising the ability of future

generations to meet their own needs. By explaining

the impacts and dependencies of our business model

on all stakeholders and the natural environment, we

encourage our readers and existing shareholders to

look beyond our financial reporting and consider

how we create value for the long term by managing

the six forms of capitals viz. financial, manufactured,

intellectual, human, social & relationship, and

natural. The insights presented in this report will help

in building a deeper understanding of the resources

and relationships that are critical to PI’s long-term

success.

We are thus, creating a roadmap for responsible

growth for a better tomorrow using a multi-pronged

growth strategy which is also supported by prudent

financial management. We hope that you will find

this report informative.

Managing Director

Message from the: Dear Shareholders,

This year I am pleased to present our first ever Annual Integrated

Report 2022-23 with a new theme of “Responsible Growth for a

Better Tomorrow”, which is a reflection of my last year’s message

to have a healthier planet and meet various stakeholder’s

expectations at the same time. Our new theme also echoes

our commitment to economic growth and sustainability. As we

accelerate our growth journey, we are conscious of the potential

implications on our planet and communities. Responsible growth

is the key to ensuring a sustainable and prosperous future for PI

Industries and the next generation.

Our strategy of balancing economic growth and prosperity with

sustainability has enabled us to stride ahead responsibly for over 75

years and create value both locally and globally. Our continuous

focus on product innovation, technology, and ESG has

enabled us to set the foundation for sustainable value

creation for our stakeholders.

Despite many uncertainties in the year 2022 due

to the war-induced rise in commodity prices, we

continued to be resilient in times of record-breaking

inflation and a surge in food and energy prices

globally. Our growth in FY23 can be attributed

to various factors which include the strategic

curation of a relevant and favourable product

mix, as evidenced by the increased uptake of our

existing products and the positive reception of

newly launched products. Additionally, notable

enhancements in our operating leverage and

effective management of net working capital

played a significant role, among others. In

terms of export orders, growth was primarily

driven by scaling up the existing product

pipeline and the successful commercialization

of new offerings. This was further supported

by favourable price-mix dynamics within a

conducive foreign currency environment. On the

domestic front, our growth was volume-driven,

while we successfully navigated rising input costs

by implementing appropriate pricing adjustments.

Responsible growth is the compass that guides us towards a better tomorrow

where progress is balanced with compassion and sustainability.”

Furthermore, efforts were made to optimize

efficiencies across our operations. Our continued

thrust on best-in-class research and manufacturing

practices helped in ensuring an uninterrupted scale-

up of our operations. The growth in our people

has enabled us to serve our customers reflecting in

enhanced customer engagement. We have further

strengthened our outreach to over 3 million Indian

farmers enabling them to increase their yield and

productivity, a testament to our partner-centric

approach, further addressing the nutritional needs of

our growing population.

We further progressed on our path towards strategic

diversification, to mark our play in the pharmaceutical

CDMO space. These strategic acquisitions highlight our

ambition to building a differentiated pharmaceutical

business model and serve a large addressable global

market.

Responsible growth is the compass that guides

us towards a better tomorrow, where progress is

balanced with compassion and sustainability. Through

this notion, our approach towards sustainability

has emerged as a viable business strategy driving

product innovation through focused R&D efforts

on developing biological and green solutions for a

sustainable future and driving cost-effectiveness.

We look at ESG as a driver of sustainable value

creation at PI. Our levers for strategic growth in the

form of adaptive controls through digital solutions

have helped us optimize yield, quality, energy

efficiency, and throughput. Our ability to establish

backward integration of key products has enabled

us to drive sustainable solutions and gain cost

competitiveness effectively. These achievements

have significant contribution to our business, and we

see these strategic ESG levers as growth engines for

PI in the future.

Our continuous efforts towards achieving PI’s

2025 Sustainability Goals enhanced our focus on

renewable energy consumption, reduction in specific

CO2 emissions, and water consumption. Our focus on

fostering a positive and inclusive work environment

saw us implement comprehensive wellness programs,

increase access to mental health resources, and more

work-life balance initiatives. These measures have not

only increased employee satisfaction and productivity

but have also reinforced our commitment to valuing

our greatest asset: our people. We continued to

foster our community engagement efforts, through

diverse programs implemented by PI Foundation.

From supporting local education, skill development,

agricultural, health, and women empowerment

programs to volunteering efforts, we strived to make

a meaningful difference in the lives of those around

us.

As we venture into the future, the year 2023 brings

with it a landscape of potential global challenges. The

Agrochemical industry must navigate the evolving

complexities of issues such as inflation, energy crisis,

climate change, shifting consumer preferences,

war conflicts, supply chain shocks, and fluctuating

commodity prices. These challenges present both

hurdles and opportunities for the industry to adapt,

innovate, and contribute towards sustainable

solutions.

We must anticipate and address these challenges

proactively, fostering resilience and driving positive

change in the face of a rapidly changing world.

Grounded in the belief that responsible growth will

create a better tomorrow, we hope to be able to

cater to not just customer needs but also societal

concerns at large while remaining true to our growth

strategy. We remain bullish on the Company’s

outlook, supported by a multi-pronged strategy

of sustaining the growth momentum of our core

business and aggressively pursuing inorganic growth

opportunities. This approach entails two key aspects:

first, sustaining the growth momentum of our core

business; and second, effectively integrating and

expanding new business ventures. We must continue

diversifying our product portfolio and enhancing our

technology offerings, thereby bolstering our product

pipelines. By diligently pursuing these strategies,

we aim to ensure the long-term sustainability and

success of our Company.

With a future-looking outlook and a new

journey ahead of us in life sciences, we are well

prepared through our innovative product offering,

technologically driven operations, sound global

relationships, and sustainability focus along with

a strong team backed by a visionary Board. I thank

all our shareholders for being committed to our

philosophy of Responsible Growth and we seek

your continued support and look forward to your

patronage in the future.

(listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)

True to our purpose, “Reimagining a healthier planet”, we believe that growth of society and community around organization is integral to

PI’s growth.

A common thread ties our stakeholders together- our purpose to create value while keeping mankind at the center. We emphasize strongly

on holistic well-being of our employees which is reflected in our human centric policies, career-oriented learning and development opportu-

nities and Health and Safety practices at our plants and offices.

Communities near our plant sites are an important stakeholder. We make constant efforts to enhance their livelihoods, access to good

healthcare and education and promote rural value chains.

PI’s focus on creating value is also demonstrated in our focus on circularity and resource efficiency and minimizing environmental footprint.

Eighty-nine percent of solvent used in our processes was recovered and used in last FY. Thirty-nine percent of the raw materials procured

come from renewable sources, which makes up approximately 30% of our total products.

At PI, we recognize the urgent need to address challenges to achieve sustainable long-term growth and we have set ambitious targets for

2025 to address these challenges.

One of the key challenges is reducing our carbon footprint, and we have set a target to reduce our specific CO2 emissions by 25% by 2025.

. To achieve this, we have implemented various measures such as investing in renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and

encouraging sustainable practices among our employees. We are also working towards reducing our waste and increasing use of sustainable

materials.:
