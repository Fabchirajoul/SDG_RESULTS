Letter of Intent granted by the State Government of

Jharkhand for execution of Mining Lease in this respect expired on 11 January,2017. The Company had filed a Writ Petition

before the High Court of Jharkhand on 10 January, 2017 praying for exemption on the above Sunset Date and obtained

interim stay on 19 January, 2017. The above order has not been modified, vacated or altered till date.

The Forest Advisory Committee (FAC - an apex body of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)

in their meeting on 17 August, 2017 deferred their decision on Forest Clearance of Dirsumburu Mines of the Company till

outcome of Judgement from Ranchi High Court. FAC has not rejected the Company’s case on issue of validity period of: Letter of Intent (LOI) for Mining Lease.

In a similar Case a major hurdle has been mitigated by Ministry of Mines – Government of India by accepting the judgment

of Delhi High Court in the case of Arcelor Mittal India Ltd. It was expected that the Ministry of Mines would appeal against

the High Court Order, but in fact gave a go ahead to MoEFCC to process the Forest Clearance proposal of Arcelor Mittal.

MoEFCC has given Forest Clearance to Arcelor Mittal India Ltd on 04 October,2021. However, the Courts will have to

restore the validity of LOI beyond 11 January, 2017 in all recommended cases of allocated Mines in Saranda of Jharkhand.

The Company is keeping a track of the decision of the Courts as and when it happens, in the case of Arcelor Mittal. This

action of the Ministry of Mines and revalidation by the courts will become a favourable precedence for us.

The Government of Jharkhand till a few months back was vigorously following up with the Central Government to amend

Mining Plan for Sustainable Mining (MPSM) which had put majority of allocated Iron Ore Leases of Saranda Forest area in

conservation zone resulting in locking up huge quantities of Iron Ore Reserve.

However, the State Government for the time being has taken a back seat due to political situation in the State and now is

not following up with the Central Government for the same.

There is no development in this matter, however, the Company’s Mining Lease along with many other lease holders

Mining rights have been protected by various High Courts..

Exports

In the FY 2022-23, the demand of the Company’s products has been healthy. However, there was pressure on cost due to

surge in raw material costs due to the Ukraine war as well as robust steel demand. The Company has been able to pass

letter of credits and/or bank guarantee to mitigate

its credit risk.

The carrying amount of respective financial assets recognised in the financial statements, (net of impairment losses) represents the

Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.

Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year (other than subsidiaries), there are no single customer accounted for more than

10% of the accounts receivable and 10% of revenue as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022. The company takes collateral or other credit

enhancements to secure its credit risk.

The Company extends credit to customers as per the internal credit policy. Any deviation are approved by appropriate authorities, after

due consideration of the customers credentials and financial capacity, trade practices and prevailing business and economic conditions.

The Company’s historical experience of collecting receivables and the level of default indicate that credit risk is low and generally uniform

across markets; consequently, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. All overdue customer balances are

evaluated taking into account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the customers etc. The company

computes credit loss allowance based on a matrix based historically observed default rates over the expected life of trade receivables and

is adjusted for forward-looking estimates.

Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired

Cash and cash equivalents, investment and deposits with banks are neither past due nor impaired. Cash and cash equivalents with banks

are held with reputed and credit worthy banking institutions.

Financial assets that are past due but not impaired

Trade receivables amounts that are past due at the end of the reporting period, no credit losses there against are expected to arise. The

company also takes advance,: letter of credit and bank guarantee from its customers, which mitigates the credit risk to that extent.

3.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.

The Company's objective is to maintain optimum level of liquidity to meet it's cash and collateral requirements at all times. The company

relies on borrowings and internal accruals to meet its long term and short term fund requirement. The current committed line of credit are

sufficient to meet its short to medium term fund requirement.

i)

Liquidity and interest risk tables

The following tables detail the Company’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment

periods. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which

the Company can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows as at balance sheet date:

guarantee to mitigate its credit risk.

The carrying amount of respective financial assets recognised in the financial statements, (net of impairment losses) represents the Group’s

maximum exposure to credit risk. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Of the

trade receivables balance at the end of the year , there are no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable

and 10% of revenue as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022. The Group takes collateral or other credit enhancements to secure its credit

risk.

The Group extends credit to customers as per the internal credit policy. Any deviation are approved by appropriate authorities, after

due consideration of the customers credentials and financial capacity, trade practices and prevailing business and economic conditions.

The Group’s historical experience of collecting receivables and the level of default indicate that credit risk is low and generally uniform
