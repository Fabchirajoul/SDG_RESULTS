INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23

Integrated Report Statutory Report Financial Statement

&:

Dear Stakeholders,

Over the past two years, the global economy has

grappled with a multitude of overlapping crises,

including trade wars, the pandemic, geo-political

conicts such as the war in Ukraine and the

subsequent lockdowns in China. These challenges

have created a complex landscape, further

compounded by liquidity troubles arising from a

series of global bank crises. Although efforts have

been made to mitigate the effects, these ongoing

uncertainties have had an impact on customer and

business condence, consequently impacting

economic growth.

Chairman’s Message

During FY 2022-23, your company reached a signicant milestone

by attaining its consolidated EBITDA of ` 896 crore. This highlights

The attractiveness of India as an investment destination is something

that cannot be understated. At JK Lakshmi Cement Ltd., we are

committed to intensifying our capital footprint across six key

verticals, with a steadfast focus on augmenting the value of our

human capital through people-centric initiatives. We also strive to

enhance our manufacturing excellence, thereby strengthening our

manufactured capital. Simultaneously, we are dedicated to fostering

green growth, recognising the signicance of preserving our natural

capital. In addition, our commitment to community development

ensures the growth of our social capital, while our relentless pursuit

of innovation bolsters our intellectual capital. Ultimately, our

endeavours are geared towards driving improvements in both our

top-line as well as our bottom-line performance; reinforcing our

nancial capital.

The GDP data reveals that India has emerged from the pandemic in a

more resilient manner than initially anticipated, with consistent

momentum in growth observed since FY 2021–22. Notably, the

growth gures for FY 2021–22 have been revised upward from 8.7%

to 9.1%, indicating a more robust rebound.

Despite the prevailing global slowdown, numerous market analysts

hold the belief that the current era holds great potential for India,

positioning it as a dominant player at the World stage. This assertion

is substantiated by compelling reasons and empirical evidence.

Recent data revisions by India indicate that the Nation's economic

performance has surpassed previous estimates, even in the face of

persistent global uncertainties. The International Monetary Fund

(IMF) further projects India's growth to reach 5.9% in FY 2023–24

and sustain an average growth rate of 6.1% over the next ve years;

underscoring the Country's resilience and prospects for long-term

economic advancement.

JK LAKSHMI CEMENT LTD.:

Dear Stakeholders, Associates and Team JKLC,

Recent years have been relentless with the global pandemic,

military conicts, growing inequality and supply chain

shortages. We have condensed decades of experience into a

VCMD’S Message

Infra push and increasing housing demand resulted in domestic

consumption of cement in FY 2022-23 at an estimated 390

million tons, up from 360 million tons in FY 2021-22. This is

projected to surpass 500 million tons by the end of FY 2026-27.

The Net Prot After Tax stood at ` 331 crore during

FY 2022-23, lower than the previous year mainly due to volatility

in the market and stagnant prices. Thanks to robust operating

cash ows, our capital employed metrics have reported

progress, leading to improved return ratios. We have also repaid

borrowings during this year, making our company a Net Debt-

Free company. Your company continues to focus on shareholder

value creation by capturing cost-efciencies and leveraging

Your company has also performed well while operating within

the constraints. At this juncture, we remain committed to

advancing our country's interests and expressing solidarity with

the Nation and its leadership.

Infrastructure-led investments and mass residential projects will

keep India’s cement demand strong, according to Moody’s

Investors Service report. Also, continued large investments in

roads and infrastructure projects will fuel cement demand. The

Government has launched signicant infrastructure mega

projects such as the ambitious Bharatmala Pariyojana,

Sagarmala Project, Smart Cities Mission, AMRUT (Atal Mission

for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) and PMAY

(Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana); providing a boost to the

industry.

JKLC recorded revenues of ` 6,071 crore during FY 2022-23,

registering a growth of 20%. This growth was aided by higher

volumes with improved manufacturing activity amidst a volatile

macro backdrop.

Despite near-term challenges like heightened competition, fuel

price ination, increased interest rates and commodity ination,

the outlook remains promising. JKLC is well-prepared to

navigate these challenges and I am condent that the business

will continue to strengthen and be future-ready.

Performance Review

India's cement production has grown by around 9% in

FY 2022-23 and is expected to continue its momentum with 8%

growth over the next couple of years. The growing housing

sector, which typically accounts for 60-65% of India's cement

consumption, along with the Government’s clear focus on

infrastructure development, comprising 25% of cement

consumption, will remain the key demand drivers.

short period, requiring businesses to adapt with speed and

adapt with utmost agility. Robust self-belief and resilience are

the keys to success in times of uncertainty and challenge. It is

indeed creditable that amidst these macro-economic and

geo-political upheavals, India has managed to stay the course in

its quest for growth.

In a year marked by several disruptions, your company has

delivered a creditable performance and registered appreciable

recovery across key performance parameters.

business portfolio, geographical dispersion, robust balance

sheet and strong presence in the market are reliable signposts

pointing to a brighter future. Additionally, our committed

workforce and proven execution strengths enable a seamless

transition to a more digitally evolved work environment.

Strategic Plan

Our strategic plan continues to guide the growth of the

Company. We are moving ahead with a series of actions toward

this, which includes the following:

4 Setting up a project for capacity expansion of 1.5 mn. tons

of clinker and 2.50 mn. tons of cement capacity at our Group

company UCWL

4 Installing solar power plants at Sirohi, Durg and UCWL to

further reduce power cost

Industry's best performers

Sustainable Growth

As a responsible corporation, JKLC is striving to drive its business

sustainably through focused action, collaboration, advocacy

and thought leadership. Resource efciency and circularity are

the foundation of our sustainability programme. Over the past

decade, we have prioritised energy and water efciencies.

We are continuously reducing emissions and working towards

carbon neutrality across Scopes 1, 2, and 3. We are committed

to Science Based Target Initiatives. On renewable power, our

green power share (on a consolidated basis), has increased to

37% of the total power requirement in FY 2022-23. By 2040, we

aim to meet all our electrical energy requirements through

renewable energy, as committed to RE100. We have also

committed to doubling our energy productivity by 2040, based

on the 2014-15 baseline, as part of EP100.

To further enhance the circular economy, JKLC is working on

utilising alternative fuels at its integrated units and our thermal

substitution rate has gone up to about 4.1% in FY 2022-23 with

rm plans to take it up to 20% by FY 2029-30. Rolling out of the

LNG eet of trucks for our logistics operations will reduce 270

metric tons of CO per annum.

We have, under the carbon offset programme, migrated over

1,84,000 rural families from traditional cooking to sustainable

cooking methods, helping reduce deforestation and air

pollution, as well as enhancing the health of the women of the

households.

of cement in the Industry

4 Expanding our capacity to 30 million tons by 2030 and

ranking among the top 5 EBIDTA / ton earning cement

Water is a precious resource and to preserve planet’s lifeline we

have taken the target of becoming 5 times water positive by

FY 2024-25.

Expansion and Innovation

Aligarh and the expansion of our RMC business in key markets

like Gurgaon, Bhavnagar and Delhi NCR. Additionally, a

greeneld putty plant at Alwar is being set up and will be

commissioned in FY 2023-24, paving the way for capacity

enhancement.

Community Well-being

Creating an inclusive society is a fundamental business

responsibility we strongly believe in. JKLC has been unwavering

communities near its plant locations through high-impact and

need-based CSR projects in key areas of nation-building such as

education, healthcare, skill development, livelihood

intervention, water and sanitation, rural development and

environmental conservation.

time-saving products facilitating faster and cleaner

President & Director:

letter of credit which can be called upon if the

counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement. For trade receivables and contract assets, the

Company applies a simplied approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Company does not track changes in

credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.

1.3 Investment in Equity Shares

Investment in Equity Securities are initially measured at cost. Any subsequent fair value gain or loss is recognized

through Statement of Prot and Loss if such investments in Equity Securities are held for trading purposes. The

fair value gains or losses of all other Equity Securities are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income.

1.4 Investment in Associates, Joint Ventures and Subsidiaries

The Company has accounted for its investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture at cost.

1.5 Derecognition of Financial Assets

A Financial Asset is primarily derecognized when:

•

The right to receive cash ows from asset has expired, or

•

The Company has transferred its right to receive cash ows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to

pay the received cash ows in full without material delay to a third party under a “pass-through”

arrangement and either:

a)

The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or

b) The Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has

transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its right to receive cash ows from an asset or has entered into a pass through

arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has

neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the

asset, the Company continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing

involvement. In that case, the Company also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the

associated liability are measured on a basis that reects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of

the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company could be

required to repay.

2.

Financial Liabilities

2.1 Denition

Financial liabilities include Long-term and Short-term Borrowings, Trade and Other payables and Other eligible

Current and Non-current Liabilities.

(a) Initial Recognition and Measurement

All nancial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and

payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company’s nancial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank

overdrafts, and derivative nancial instruments.

(b) Subsequent Measurement

The measurement of nancial liabilities depends on their classication, as described below :

i) Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Prot or Loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through prot or loss include nancial liabilities held for trading. The

Company has designated any nancial liabilities upon initial measurement recognition at fair value

through prot or loss. Financial liabilities at fair value through prot or loss are at each reporting date at

fair value with all the changes recognized in the Statement of Prot and Loss.

ii) Financial Liabilities measured at Amortized Cost

After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized

cost using the effective interest rate method (‘’EIR’’) except for those designated in an effective hedging

JK Lakshmi Cement Limited

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the Year ended March 31, 2023:

Managing Director (Chief Operating Decision Maker).

The Chief Operational Decision Maker monitors the operating results of its business Segments separately for the

purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is

evaluated based on each segments prot or loss and is measured consistently with prot or loss in the nancial

statements.

(21) Cash dividend

The Company recognises a Liability to pay dividend to Equity Holders of the Company when the distribution is

authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a

distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in

Other Equity. Interim Dividends are recognised as a Liability on the date of declaration by the Company's Board of

Directors.

(22) Recent Pronouncements

Recent pronouncements Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) noties new standard or amendments to the existing

standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023,

MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian

Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:

Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements The amendments require companies to disclose their material

accounting policies rather than their signicant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with

other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to inuence decisions of primary users of general

purpose nancial statements. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any signicant impact in its

nancial statements.

Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as

leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in

paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial

recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Company is evaluating the impact, if

any, in its nancial statements.

Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors The amendments will help entities to

distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The denition of a change in accounting

estimates has been replaced with a denition of accounting estimates. Under the new denition, accounting

estimates are “monetary amounts in nancial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities

develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in nancial statements to be measured in a way that

involves measurement uncertainty. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any signicant impact in

its nancial statements.

letter of credits/part advance

payments/post dated cheques. The outstanding’s of different parties are reviewed periodically at different level of

organization. The outstanding from the trade segment is secured by two tier security – security deposit from the dealer

himself, and our business associates who manage the dealers are also responsible for the outstanding from any of the

dealers in their respective region. Impairment analysis is performed based on historical data at each reporting period on

an individual basis. Foraging of trade receivables refer note 12

Financial Instruments and Deposits with Banks:

The Company considers factors such as track record, size of institution, market reputation and service standards to select

the bank with which balances and deposits are maintained. Generally, balances are maintained with the institutions with

which the Company has also availed borrowings. The Company does not maintain signicant cash and deposit balances

other than those required for its day to day operation.

44.3

Liquidity Risk:

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difculty in meeting the obligations associated with its nancial

liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another nancial asset. The Company’s approach is to ensure, as far as

possible, that it will have sufcient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due.

The Company relies on a mix of borrowings, and excess operating cash ows to meet its needs for funds. The current

committed lines of credit are sufcient to meet its short to medium term expansion needs. The Company monitors rolling

forecasts of its liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufcient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining

sufcient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowings facilities at all times so that the Company does not breach

borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.

Maturity Prole of Financial Liabilities:

remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.

Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity

For the year ended 31st March 2023

JK Lakshmi Cement Limited:

letter of credit which can be called

upon if the counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement. For trade receivables and contract

assets, the Company applies a simplied approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Company does not track

changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.

1.3 Investment in Equity Shares:

Managing Director (Chief Operating

Decision Maker).

The Chief Operational Decision Maker monitors the operating results of its business Segments separately for the

purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is

evaluated based on each segments prot or loss and is measured consistently with prot or loss in the nancial

statements.

(21) Cash Dividend

The Group recognises a Liability to pay Dividend to Equity Holders of the Group when the distribution is authorised

and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is

authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in Other Equity.

Interim Dividends are recognised as a Liability on the date of declaration by the Company's Board of Directors.

1.4

Recent pronouncement

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) noties new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules,

2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:

Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting

policies rather than their signicant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information,

is material when it can reasonably be expected to inuence decisions of primary users of general purpose nancial

statements. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any signicant impact in its nancial statements.

Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases

and decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15

and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give

rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, in its nancial

statements.

Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors The amendments will help entities to

distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The denition of a change in accounting estimates has

been replaced with a denition of accounting JK Lakshmi Cement Limited Notes to the Standalone Financial Statement for

the Year ended March 31, 2023 estimates. Under the new denition, accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in

nancial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting

policies require items in nancial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The

Company does not expect this amendment to have any signicant impact in its nancial statements.:

Letter of Credits/part advance

payments/post dated cheques.The Outstanding’s of different parties are reviewed periodically at different level of

organization. The outstanding from the trade segment is secured by two tier security – security deposit from the dealer

himself, and our business associates who manage the dealers are also responsible for the outstanding from any of the

dealers in their respective region. Impairment analysis is performed based on historical data at each reporting period on an

individual basis. Foraging of trade receivables refer note 12

Financial Instruments and Deposits with Banks:

The Group considers factors such as track record, size of institution, market reputation and service standards to select the

bank with which balances and deposits are maintained. Generally, balances are maintained with the institutions with

which the Group has also availed borrowings. The Group does not maintain signicant cash and deposit balances other

than those required for its day to day operation.

41.3 Liquidity Risk:

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difculty in meeting the obligations associated with its nancial

liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another nancial asset. The Group’s approach is to ensure, as far as

possible, that it will have sufcient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due.

The Group relies on a mix of borrowings, and excess operating cash ows to meet its needs for funds. The current

committed lines of credit are sufcient to meet its short to medium term expansion needs. The Group monitors rolling

forecasts of its liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufcient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining

sufcient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowings facilities at all times so that the Group does not breach

borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.

Maturity Prole of Financial Liabilities:

The following Table provides undiscounted cash ows towards nancial liabilitiesinto relevant maturity based on the

remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
