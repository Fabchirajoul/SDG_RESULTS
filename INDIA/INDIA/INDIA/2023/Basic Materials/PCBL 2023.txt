Dear Shareholders,

I am proud and delighted to announce that

our performance in Fy 2022-23 has set new

benchmarks and has achieved an impressive

revenue growth of 32% to ₹ 5,874 Crores, compared

to the previous Fy while EBITDA increased by 14%

yoy to ₹ 775 Crores. This remarkable progress can

be attributed to several key initiatives. Our planned

capacity expansions, strong focus on research and

development to build a diverse product portfolio

and strengthening footprint in the global market

have been key catalysts of this performance.

however, Fy 2022-23 came with new challenges

as the global economy faces several setbacks such

as rising inflation, climate challenges, disruptions

to the supply chains caused by the war in ukraine,

and the re-emergence of COvID-19 in China.

Consequently, the global economic growth rate

slowed down. however, it is truly encouraging that

India maintained its position as the fastest-growing

major economy worldwide. This remarkable feat

has been made achievable due to a convergence

of favourable factors and opportunities. These

include the presence of a youthful and expanding

population, the steady rise in middle-class incomes,

the rapid growth of the service sector, and proactive

Government initiatives aimed at promoting

domestic investments. This, in turn, has propelled

the Indian economy to emerge as the fifth-largest

globally.

Critical focus areas of our strategy to tackle the

effects of economic slowdown are optimising

operational cost, stricter controls on all capital

expenditure, and maintaining efficiency across all

functions. Agility in implementing actions aligned

with the adopted strategy will be the key to success

in the upcoming time.

PCBL Limited has a rich legacy of over six decades.

having started as a carbon black manufacturer

in 1960, we are now in the process of evolving

horizons to emerge as a prominent chemical

manufacturer, and subsequently embark on a

journey towards material science. Furthermore,

we have deployed dedicated production lines for

our specialty chemicals portfolio comprising more

than 40 grades. This enables us to cater to the

evolving requirements of our customer partners

worldwide across various segments such as rubber,

engineering plastics, inks & coatings, conductives,

batteries, and so on. During Fy 2022-23, we reported

our best financial performance ever.

we continued witnessing positive demand for

specialty black from various geographical regions,

driven by a mix of new customer acquisitions. Our

Company’s power segment revenue in Fy 2022-23

was at ₹ 142 Crores as compared to ₹ 93 Crores in Fy

2021-22, due to higher sales volume as well as higher

realisation. In line with our vision of becoming

a trusted global player, we have strategically

positioned all our manufacturing facilities near

ports, thus allowing for convenient access to raw

materials and effective service to international

clients, all while minimising logistics costs.

To further enhance our capabilities, we have

embarked on two capacity expansions. The first

is greenfield expansion in Chennai (Tamil Nadu)

through our wholly owned subsidiary PCBL (TN)

Limited. The first phase with 63,000 MTPA capacity

has been successfully commissioned, and upon

completion, the plant will add 1,47,000 MTPA of

carbon black capacity and 24 Mw of green power.

The second is a brownfield expansion at our Mundra

plant in Gujarat, with an estimated specialty

chemical capacity of 40,000 MTPA. This expansion

is divided into two phases, and the first phase

of the specialty chemical line is projected to be

commissioned by Q1 Fy 2023-24. with accelerated

capacity augmentation plans in place, PCBL is well-

equipped for the next phase of growth, ready to

cater to national as well as international markets.

At PCBL, we are committed to consistently scaling

up the value chain through R&D initiatives. Our R&D

team is dedicated to enhancing various aspects

of our operations such as improving processes,

maximising yield, optimising feedstock efficiency,

tailoring grades to specific requirements, and

exploring new avenues for product development.

One of our key business themes is digital

transformation, and we have initiated multiple

endeavours across our entire network of

manufacturing facilities. These initiatives aim to

facilitate a seamless transition to an enhanced

system and improve processes across all domains.

we have effectively collaborated with various

departments and have implemented various

digitalisation initiatives across all functions. Further,

our greenfield project in Chennai is being set up as

per Industry 4.0 standards.

Recognising our role as a socially and

environmentally responsible corporate citizen, we

acknowledge our commitment to the well-being of

the environment and society. we have undertaken

multiple initiatives aligned with our sustainability

goals and uNSDGs, such as ensuring zero liquid

discharge, recycling wastewater, managing energy

and water consumption, mitigating emissions,

harvesting rainwater, and undertaking plantation

drives, among other things. As part of our vision of

giving back to society, we have also been proactively

working towards empowering the underprivileged

communities in spheres such as education, health

and sanitation, sports, environmental sustainability,

and holistic community development.

As a testament to our unwavering commitment to

our esteemed shareholders, an interim dividend

of ₹ 207.60 Crores (₹ 5.50/- per Equity Share on the

face value of Re. 1/- per equity share) was declared

on 31 January, 2023, and paid during the quarter

ended 31 March, 2023.

As I reflect upon yet another incredible milestone,

I would like to sincerely express my gratitude

for your unwavering support and steadfast

commitment to our organisational vision. Through

the synergies forged by this support, we have

exceeded expectations and embarked on an

exhilarating journey of exploring new horizons and

generating value for all involved. with immense

pride, I applaud our collective efforts, as PCBLites

have unified talent, passion, and resilience to reach

new heights. As we bid farewell to a rewarding and

transformative year, let us embrace the dawn of a

new era, pioneer innovation, and make a lasting

impact. with gratitude and unity, we shall face

challenges and craft a legacy that endures. Thank

you for your unwavering commitment to our shared

vision, and here’s to an extraordinary journey ahead,

where every success resonates with the spirit of

PCBLites and our esteemed stakeholders.

yours sincerely,

AMONG OThERS.: Dear Stakeholders,

The Fy 2022-23 will go down as one of the most significant

ones in PCBL’s history. Our accomplishments during this time

have established new benchmarks for our business, both in

terms of revenue and volume. Furthermore, our profitability has

consistently shown an upward trend, culminating in our strongest

financial performance to date.

however, it wasn’t a consistently smooth journey throughout

the year. The second half of 2022 witnessed disruptions owing to

the Russia-ukraine war, with high oil prices leading to inflation.

with the global economic slowdown serving as the backdrop, it

is imperative that we adopt flexible strategies based on strong

market intelligence and as per the dynamic microeconomic

and macroeconomic factors. By remaining agile in our

implementation, we can navigate these challenges effectively.

Our expansion projects – greenfield project at

Chennai and brownfield project at Mundra – are in

full swing and post completion, our total capacity

will be 7,90,000 MT and 122 Mw of green power.

we have successfully commissioned the first

phase of our Chennai plant, and it is being set

up with cutting-edge technology that includes

AI, machine learning, and data analytics. It is a

smart manufacturing unit and leverages the full

potential of Industry 4.0, offering lean and efficient

operations.

Further, in alignment with our business theme of

digital transformation, we are driving a transition

from digitisation to digitalisation across various

funtions. This paradigm shift has been facilitated

by a multitude of initiatives introduced across all

aspects of our organisation. As a result, we have

achieved enhanced clarity, improved efficiency, and

expedited decision-making processes, leading to

faster and more informed outcomes.

Our R&D Centre in India and Innovation Centre at

Belgium, in tandem with the Process Technology

team, is enabling us to expand our product portfolio

as well as undertake process innovations to cater

to the evolving needs of our customers. As a result,

we have been able to develop new and improved

grades of performance and specialty chemicals

for various segments such as tyres, inks & coatings,

engineering plastics, fibres, conductives and

batteries, among others. Further, we have various

products in the pipeline, set to be launched in the

next three years.

Our commitment to customer centricity and

the pursuit of growing our market share involves

implementing several key strategies. As we

embark on this journey, one of our key focus areas

is penetrating new geographies and expanding

our global footprint. we aim to accomplish this by

exploring the emerging opportunities presented in

untapped markets. hence, it becomes imperative

to deliver cutting edge products, impeccable

service, and strong technical support, for acquiring

new customer partners and nurturing long-term

relationships with them. we are also strategically

shifting our focus from customer relationship

management (CRM) towards a more holistic

approach to customer experience management

(CEM). The idea is to create exceptional and

memorable experiences for our customer partners.

As we advance towards achieving our strategic

priorities, we are consistently focussing on

mitigating our carbon footprint and building a

sustainable organisation. Key material factors have

been sharply defined keeping in mind the context

of the business. Even though we are rated as one of

the best in ESG parameters among competitors,

these are the early stages of our ESG journey, and

we are committed to create new benchmarks in

the coming years. By integrating good governance

practices throughout our operations, we are

dedicated to upholding principles of transparency,

accountability, fairness, and integrity. These

practices form the bedrock of our decision-making

processes and govern our interactions with all

stakeholders involved.

we firmly believe, investing in our employees

skill, knowledge and competency is paramount

to our success. Throughout the year, we have

implemented comprehensive training and

development programme fostering a culture of

continuous learning and upskilling. Moreover, our

focus on diversity, equity and inclusion has created

an environment where every individual feels valued

and respected.

Being a responsible corporate citizen, we are

actively engaged in community development

projects, collaborating with local organisations to

support education, healthcare and infrastructure

projects. Our employee volunteer programmes

have allowed our team members to actively

participate in initiatives that makes positive impact

on the society.

we are brimming with excitement and confidence

as we strive to evolve and expand horizons to

achieve business leadership across geographies,

technology leadership, and business sustainability.

with our current performance serving as the launch

pad, we are perfectly poised to embark upon the

next chapter of our growth journey and surpass new

milestones of our financial performance.

PERFORMAnCE OVERVIEW

Carbon Black

Your Company’s FY23 EBITDA was ` 775 Crores as

against ` 682 Crores in the previous year. PAT for the

year was ` 444 Crores, as against previous year’s PAT

of ` 427 Crores.

Power

Your Company’s power segment revenue (excluding

inter segment revenue) in FY’23 was at ` 142 Crores

as compared to ` 93 Crores in FY’22, which is an

increase by ` 49 Crores due to higher sales volume

as well as higher realisation.

A detailed review of the operations of the Company

for the financial year ended 31 March, 2023 is given

in the Management Discussion and Analysis Report,

which forms a part of this Report.

MAnuFACTuRInG

Carbon Black production during FY23 was 4,47,003

MT as compared to 4,56,484 MT in FY22. However,

we are focusing on the production of value-added

products in the performance and specialty chemical

segment, which is having higher contribution

margin.

As

a

manifestation

of

our

commitment

to

sustainability, we are continuously working towards

a reduction in water and power consumption.

We are endlessly strategising towards conversion

cost

reduction

through

inventory

and

spare

management as well as improving our reliability by

strengthening preventive measure compliances,

condition-based monitoring and periodic reviews

of SOPs.

First

phase

commercial

production

63,000

MTPA of 147,000 MTPA Greenfield carbon black

manufacturing facility in the state of Tamil Nadu

being set up by PCBL (TN) Limited, (a wholly owned

subsidiary of the Company) has commenced w.e.f.

14 April, 2023. Upon its full completion expected

in FY’24, this project will augment the Company’s

Carbon Black capacity by 1,47,000 MPTA and

contribute an additional 24 MW green power. The

brown-field expansion at our existing facility in

Mundra plant to produce specialty chemicals is in

full swing.

During the year the Company commissioned a

green power plant at Kochi, in Kerala with a capacity

of 7 MW. With this, the total green power capacity of

the Company has reached 98 MW.

With its strategically located plants, PCBL Limited is

well equipped to service customers in India as well

as all over the globe. Proximity to seaports reduces

logistics costs.

eNViroNMeNtAL, sociAL AND GoVerNANce

(ESG)

With

its

continuous

commitment

towards

sustainability, the Company has been working

on enhancing its ESG efforts by undertaking a

comprehensive and independent ESG strategy

and assessment exercise by adhering to certain

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) derived out of

materiality targets. Key material factors have been

sharply defined in alignment with the context of

the business. These are Greenhouse Gas (GHG)

emissions

and

energy

management,

Water

management, Solid waste management, Health and

safety, Human rights and community engagement,

Product stewardship, Leadership and Governance.

For the FY 2022-23, the Company had conducted

a carbon footprint accounting process across

all manufacturing plants and offices. The GHG

emissions covered by the report includes both direct

and indirect emissions generated by the business

under Scope1, 2 and 3. The GHG emission intensity

(tCO2 emission/MT production of carbon black) was

1.94 tCO2e/MT) in FY 2022-23.

The Company’s specific key risks and opportunities

relating to ESG material issues have been identified.

Implementation of some of the action plans to

mitigate these risks and exploring the opportunities

may have long lead times, but PCBL is committed

to this.

Your Company is now in the process of reviewing

its ESG strategy by balancing business needs with

sustainability needs and fine-tuning future KPIs.

To achieve the goals, the Company is identifying

remedial action plans for environmental, social and

governance specific issues.

Risk Management Policy of the Company with

respect to the Commodities and Forex:

Commodities form a major part of the raw

materials required for the Company’s products

of the important market risks for the Company.

Commodity price risk results from changes in

market prices for raw materials, mainly carbon

of company’s cost of sales. The Company

endeavours to reduce such risks by maintaining

inventory at optimum level through a highly

probable sales forecast on quarterly basis and:
