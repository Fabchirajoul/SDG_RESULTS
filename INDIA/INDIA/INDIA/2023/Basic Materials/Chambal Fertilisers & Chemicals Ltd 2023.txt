letter

in an earlier year from GAIL (India) Limited, informing about the possibility of levy of Central Sales Tax. The Company

has been taking the delivery of Gas in the State of Rajasthan and has been accordingly paying Rajasthan Sales Tax on

the supply. Therefore, the Company is of the view that no Central Sales Tax is payable by it. Further, the amount of such

levy is not ascertainable. However, in the event of its levy, it is reimbursable by FICC, Government of India under Subsidy

Scheme.

(h)

Under the Jute Packaging Material (Compulsory use of Packing Commodities) Act, 1987, a specified percentage of

fertilisers dispatched were required to be supplied in Jute bags up to August 31, 2001. The provisions of the said Act

were challenged in the Supreme Court, which upheld the constitutional validity of this Act in its judgment in 1996. In

spite of making conscious efforts to step up use of jute packaging material, the Company had been unable to adhere to

the specified percentage, due to strong customer resistance to use of jute bags. The Company had received show cause

notice from the Office of the Jute Commissioner, Kolkata, for levying a penalty of Rs. 73.80 Crore (Previous Year: Rs. 73.80

Crore) for non compliance of the provisions of the said Act. The Company has obtained a stay order from Delhi High

Court against the above show cause notice. Management believes that it had a strong case and basis merit of the case,

the Company is of the view that the said levy is not tenable in law and accordingly no provision has been considered.

Based on favorable decisions in similar cases, legal opinion taken by the Company, discussions with the solicitors, etc.,

the Company believes that there is fair chance of decisions in its favour in respect of all the items listed above and hence

no provision is considered necessary against the same.

In respect of above contingent liabilities, it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the timings of cash outflows,

if any, pending resolution of the respective proceedings.

The erstwhile Shipping Division of the Company had claimed cenvat credit in the service tax returns in the earlier years.

However, such service tax credit receivable has not been recognised in the financial statements due to uncertainty in

utilisation of the same.:

Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer of the Company has been identified as the chief operating decision maker

(CODM) as defined by Ind AS 108, ‘Operating Segments’. The Company is in the business of manufacturing / marketing of Fertilisers

and other Agri-inputs. Looking at the nature of business and risk involved, the CODM has determined that the operations of the

Company falls into single business segment. Further, all the customers and assets are located in India. Accordingly, no segment

information is provided.

letter in an earlier year from GAIL (India) Limited, informing about the possibility of levy of Central Sales

Tax. The Parent Company has been taking the delivery of Gas in the State of Rajasthan and has been accordingly

paying Rajasthan Sales Tax on the supply. Therefore, the Parent Company is of the view that no Central Sales

Tax is payable by it. Further, the amount of such levy is not ascertainable. However, in the event of its levy, it is

reimbursable by FICC, Government of India under Subsidy Scheme.

(h)

Under the Jute Packaging Material (Compulsory use of Packing Commodities) Act, 1987, a specified percentage of

fertilisers dispatched were required to be supplied in Jute bags up to August 31, 2001. The provisions of the said

Act were challenged in the Supreme Court, which upheld the constitutional validity of this Act in its judgment in

1996. In spite of making conscious efforts to step up use of jute packaging material, the Parent Company had been

unable to adhere to the specified percentage, due to strong customer resistance to use of jute bags. The Parent

Company had received show cause notice from the Office of the Jute Commissioner, Kolkata, for levying a penalty

of Rs. 73.80 Crore (Previous Year: Rs. 73.80 Crore) for non compliance of the provisions of the said Act. The Parent

Company has obtained a stay order from Delhi High Court against the above show cause notice. Management

believes that it had a strong case and basis merit of the case, the Parent Company is of the view that the said levy

is not tenable in law and accordingly no provision has been considered.

Based on favorable decisions in similar cases, legal opinion taken by the Parent Company, discussions with the solicitors,

etc., the Parent Company believes that there is fair chance of decisions in its favour in respect of all the items listed above

and hence no provision is considered necessary against the same.
