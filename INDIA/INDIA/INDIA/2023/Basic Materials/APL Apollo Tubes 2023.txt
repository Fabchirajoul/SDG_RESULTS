18 | Integrated Annual Report 2022-23:

Dear Shareholders,

It is an excellent time to

share this communique as

the Company has sustained

its growth momentum in a

year rife with challenges from

unexpected quarters. This

growth demonstrates the

resilience and robustness of our

Company’s business model in

surmounting all kinds of odds

and emerging ever so stronger.

Our sales volumes crossed

the 2 Mn mark – a goal which

remained elusive for quite

some years. We reached a sales

volume of 2.3 Mn in a year

when the environment was not

conducive to volume growth.

Revenue, EBITDA and Net Profit

increased by 24%, 8% and 4%,

respectively, which is very commendable

considering the inflationary headwinds

and other negatives that prevailed

during the year. EBITDA per tonne stood

at C4,481 in FY23 against C5,386 in FY22,

which is owing to our Raipur facility, the

most demonstrative milestone of our

journey.

The Raipur facility

It is with great pride that I mention that

we started the commercial operations

of our Raipur facility, which rolled out

approx 167K tonnes of super-value-

added products in FY23, and are novel

innovations for the Indian market.

The team went above and beyond to

create markets for these innovative

products by traveling nationwide to

engage with diverse categories of

product influencers, thus creating a

demand pull for the products as they

rolled out of our Raipur facility.

But since this is a new facility in its first

year of commercial operations, we

staggered our production. As a result,

the average utilization of the Raipur

facility was about 16.7%, which weighed

down profits and profitability. Our ROCE

was 29.2% in FY23 against 34.6% in FY22.

If we exclude Raipur from the equation,

our ROCE would be 37% for FY23. This

showcases the relevance of our products

and the resilience of our all-weather

business model.

I am very excited and hopeful about

the Raipur facility. Our market creation

efforts have already yielded good

results as more orders await in the

pipeline. This success is mainly owing

to the creation of large and pin code-

defining structures deploying our

tubular technology. These are work-in-

progress as I speak.

I am confident that the demand for our

heavy sections will surge in the current

year (FY24). My confidence stems from

the Government’s resolve to create

world-class infrastructure in India,

evidenced in the Union Budget 2024

proposals.

The Government has been particularly

aggressive in allocating funds in

two segments – railways, and water

infrastructure. Interestingly, we

initiated our engagement with relevant

authorities in these sectors since the

start of FY23. Further, the Government

continues to invest in building airports

across Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities to

strengthen air connectivity and expand

and modernise existing airports in

urban India. Across the world, airports

of today use tubular technology.

Being the first movers in this space

with demonstrated capabilities,

we feel confident about securing

larger volumes of business from the

infrastructure creation thrust in India.

What is particularly heartening is that

the Raipur facility, because of its super-

value-added product basket, will play

a pivotal role in scaling the EBITDA

per tonne for the organisation. I am

confident about achieving optimum

Corporate Overview | Statutory Reports | Financial Statements:

Managing Director. A team

of experienced and enthusiastic

professionals ably supports him. The

Company’s equity is listed on the BSE

and NSE.

Our operational performance

The Company’s operational efficiency

climbed a few notches higher,

recording the highest production of

more than 2.2 Mn tonnes. This increase

was owing to improved productivity

in the manufacturing facilities, de-

bottlenecking at some facilities and

the partial commissioning of the

Company’s greenfield Raipur facility.

The marketing team worked diligently

towards the market creation of the

novel product coming out of the Raipur

facility with considerable success.

Having completed the hospital projects

leveraging the tubular technology,

the Company bagged several new

projects to deploy this contemporary

technology. The Management is also

conversing with several companies

for more such projects, some of which

should see the light of day in the

current year (FY24).

The Company intensified its branding

and awareness initiatives to enhance

brand recall among decision-makers.

On the ESG front, the Company upped

its DJSI ranking considerably. This

is a recognition of the Company’s

efforts toward its social responsibility

towards the Earth and marginalized

communities residing on Earth.
