Message from the Chairman: Dear Shareholders,

Our Group's foundation rests upon a

trusteeship philosophy, which imagines

corporations as institutions that drive

collective prosperity. This philosophy

has played an integral role in shaping

our actions for generations, guiding our

quest to enrich lives. Over the years, this

purpose, though unstated, has been our

unwavering anchor.

In FY2022-23, we formally put to words

our Group's purpose statement. At its

heart is the commitment to enriching

lives by building dynamic, responsible

businesses and institutions that

inspire trust.

We strive to honour this commitment

daily through our brands, products,

services, solutions, actions,

relationships, and institutions.

Our purpose statement stands both

timeless and fresh against the backdrop

of our extensive history. In a world of

increasing opportunity and accelerating

uncertainty, our purpose statement is

meant to act as a talisman and remain at

the core of our business decisions.

Our purpose offers us a unique lens

through which to view the world, bring

perspective, and thrive in it. Guided by

this unique perspective, we navigate

the evolving global landscape with

resilience and foresight.

As we turn our attention to the current

state of the global economy, it is evident

that we are charting a course through a

'new normal’.

Our enduring success amidst global

uncertainties stems from our unyielding

commitment to purpose, anchored in principles

that are much more than words.

Global Economy: Finding a New

Normal

The global economy continues to

pull itself out of the pandemic-

triggered shock. It does so amid

a complex environment marked

by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine,

geo-economic fragmentation, soaring

interest rates, and looming risks of a

banking contagion.

Reflecting these concerns, the

International Monetary Fund (IMF)

expects global economic growth to dip

from 3.4% in CY22 to 2.8% in CY23.

Developed countries are predicted

to experience a more pronounced

deceleration, their aggregate growth

stumbling to just 1.3% in CY23 – the

slowest pace in a decade, excluding the

pandemic-impacted CY20.

On the brighter side, China's economy

marches towards normalisation after

lifting its Covid-related restrictions.

Both China and India are set to

significantly contribute to global

economic growth in CY23, providing a

much-needed stimulus as developed

economies grapple with challenges.

Meanwhile, global supply chain

pressures have largely normalised,

helping ease commodity prices and

peak inflation levels in most economies.

Central banks, led by the US Federal

Reserve, are nearing the end of their

rate-hiking phase, signalling cautious

optimism for the global economy and

financial markets.

However, vigilance remains crucial in

the face of potential risk events in this

fragile environment.

India: The Shining Star

India's economic narrative paints

a much brighter picture. With a

government-led push to infrastructure

investments and pragmatic policies

such as the production-linked incentives

scheme, private capex has seen a surge.

This rise triggers a multi-year boom,

providing valuable support to economic

growth in the face of softening

global demand.

A decadal reshaping of supply chains

is underway. As global corporations

start to look at countries across Asia

as part of their China + 1 strategies,

India is well-positioned to benefit.

The dynamism of its tech-based 'new

economy' enterprises and the expanding

digitisation across sectors supports

India's growth momentum.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) projects

India's economy to grow 6.5% in FY24,

demonstrating the nation's resilience

amidst subdued global economic

conditions. Inflation has peaked

globally and in India. Easing inflation,

robust foreign exchange reserves, and

improving bank assets' quality provide

a cushion against potential destabilising

events in global markets.

A vital component of the rise of any

industrial ecosystem is the presence

of a confident and skilled workforce.

This year, India surpassed China

in population and already has the

largest and youngest working-age

population globally. The lessons

learnt from the transformations of

other economies through the last few

decades point to the importance of this

demographic dividend.

In the grand theatre of global economic

evolution, India is not a mere spectator

but a charismatic lead.

Aditya Birla Group in Perspective

As India takes centre stage in this grand

narrative, the Aditya Birla Group finds

itself in a unique position to contribute to

this monumental journey. Our enduring

success amidst global uncertainties

stems from our unyielding commitment

to purpose, anchored in principles that

are much more than words.

And therefore, the articulation of our

Purpose was just the first step. We

cultivated a deep understanding of our

Purpose across the depth and breadth

of the Group, including the last mile.

To transform Purpose from a concept to

an embodied experience, approximately

24:

Managing Director: Dear Stakeholders,

Amid the persisting geopolitical

instability and dynamic market

environment, Hindalco stayed buoyant

and delivered a good performance.

Before delving into the annual

performance review, I would like to

talk about the engine that powers our

performance and achievements year after

year – our Group Purpose. In April 2022,

Aditya Birla Group articulated the Group

Purpose: ‘To enrich lives by building

dynamic and responsible businesses

and institutions that inspire trust.’ This

simple thought captures the underlying

philosophy that has inspired the vision

and actions of Group Businesses

for decades.

The Purpose encapsulates Hindalco's

values, culture, inclusivity, social

consciousness, and future-readiness

attributes. It also explains Hindalco's

dynamism and resilience.

All our endeavours are driven by the

objective of maximising value for all our

stakeholders, including our customers,

employees, shareholders, suppliers,

business partners, associates, and

communities. Despite challenging

conditions, the Company remains

unwavering in its pursuit of growth

opportunities, a journey that has seen

us progressively advancing from a

manufacturing company to an innovative

manufacturing solutions provider.

Our consistent efforts alongside our

stakeholders have been instrumental

in expanding our geographic footprint

across 10 countries, strengthening our

position as the world’s largest producer

and recycler of aluminium Flat Rolled

Products (FRP) and India’s largest

The Group's Purpose encapsulates Hindalco's values, culture,

inclusivity, social consciousness, and future-readiness attributes.

It also explains Hindalco's dynamism and resilience.

can sheet and automotive aluminium

in North America. Novelis is the largest

supplier of beverage can sheet with 40%

global market share (excluding China).

The company is also the #1 player in the

automotive aluminium sheet market and

a top player in aerospace and specialty

products markets. Novelis is the largest

recycler of aluminium in the world,

recycling 2.3 Mt of aluminium scrap in

FY23, including 82 billion used beverage

cans. Novelis’ established global network

of customer solution centres enhances its

capacity to serve the growing aluminium

sheet market.

Responsible Progress

integrated aluminium player with a strong

downstream presence.

The Purpose also underscores Hindalco’s

steadfast mission to work towards a

Greener, Stronger, Smarter world. We

have undertaken dedicated initiatives

to power our sustainability actions and

progress towards carbon neutrality,

zero waste to landfill, no net loss to

biodiversity, water positivity, and health

and safety. As a result, your Company has

consistently been ranked at the top for

ESG scores in the global aluminium sector

in the S&P Dow Jones Indices since 2020.

Embedding Resilience

Even amid an uncertain business

environment, the India aluminium

business achieved industry-leading

EBITDA margins of 25%. The copper

business delivered an exemplary

performance with record EBITDA and a

higher share of value-added products.

Our India aluminium downstream

business also reported its highest-ever

EBITDA growth this year, reflecting

our strategic focus on enhancing this

segment. Despite macroeconomic

headwinds, Novelis’ performance was

supported by improved pricing and a

favourable product mix.

Consolidated revenue for the full year was

J223,202 Crore, up by 14% year on year,

primarily driven by growth in value-added

products across all our businesses. In the

reporting year, 72% of our revenue was

delinked from LME volatility, reflecting the

strength of our integrated business model.

The net revenue of Novelis reached an all-

time high of $18.5 Billion.

Despite an increase in consolidated

revenue, our net profit for the reporting

year was impacted mainly due to various

transitory factors, including higher energy

costs, inflationary pressures, and supply

chain disruptions.

Our decisive response to the fluctuations

in the business environment has

helped cushion the impact, enabling

us to progress with our long-term

strategic plans. We have prioritised cost

optimisation and enhanced resource

securitisation of coal and bauxite.

We envisage that net debt-free Indian

operations, a resilient balance sheet,

and prudent capital allocation will firmly

position our business for the future.

Exploring Customer-focused

Solutions

We remain resolute in our commitment

to drive value through organic expansion

and have developed a wide range of

downstream solutions in aluminium,

copper, and specialty alumina. Our

diverse portfolio is equipped with flexible

capabilities that allow for capacity

enhancement across regions.

Novelis’ low-carbon, state-of-the art

aluminium recycling and rolling facility

being built in Alabama will serve the

growing demand for aluminium beverage

In addition to this, the increasing

popularity of aluminium, as an alternative

to other materials, such as steel and PET,

adds to Novelis’ traction. To support its

growth plans, Novelis is fast pacing its

capital expenditure, with $3.3 Billion of

projects already underway.

The copper business delivered an

exceptional performance as the

demand for the precious metal saw

a strong recovery in India with the

push on renewables, acceleration in

urbanisation and infrastructure creation,

and digitalisation. We were able to

significantly increase the utilisation

of our copper rod mills (including the

recently acquired Ryker facility now Asoj)

to emerge as a top-3 copper rod player

globally outside of China.

Further, seeing the opportunity, we are

investing in creating new downstream

products needed in India (such as inner-

grooved tubes for air conditioning and

refrigeration) and speciality copper

alloys for high-speed railways. We

are also setting up India's first-of-its-

kind, state-of-art copper and e-waste

recycling facility.

Managing Director

Our specialty alumina business has

also showcased remarkable growth.

In FY2022-23, the business successfully

expanded its portfolio and introduced

several new high-demand products.

These include VAPs like High Precision

SMA Series, HCA series with reduced

soda content, and IC series of alumina

with enhanced purity. The business has

also commenced the construction of

its first Precipitated Superfine Hydrates

project targeted at specialised halogen-

free flame retardants markets.

The consumption trends for specialty

alumina on both the global and domestic

fronts are highly promising, providing

ample opportunities for further

advancement and market success.

Envisaging a Green Future

We are cognisant of climate change

and believe that organisations must

act urgently to limit the likely loss to

the environment and society. We have

established milestones across different

focus areas by translating our thoughts

into strategy and action and aligning with

India’s target of achieving net zero by

2070. By 2025, we aim to reduce specific

energy consumption and specific GHG

emissions by 25% vis-à-vis the base

year 2011-12. For our Novelis operations,

our plans include a 30% reduction in

carbon footprint and a 10% decrease in

energy intensity by 2026. Furthermore,

we are committed to expanding our

renewable energy capacity in India to

300 megawatts by 2025.

Central to our strategies is the principle of

circularity. Novelis recycled 2.3 Million Mt

of aluminium scrap, amounting to 61% of

the material used in production in FY23.

Meanwhile, we have utilised over 100%

of fly ash and bauxite residue in three of

our four alumina refineries in India. We

recognise the critical importance of water

conservation and are on track to cut down

our specific freshwater consumption in

Indian operations by 20% by 2025 from

2019 levels.

Ensuring Responsible Progress

We are honoured to receive numerous

accolades recognising our efforts to

adopt best-in-class ESG practices.

For the third consecutive year, we

achieved the highest score in the

S&P Global Corporate Sustainability

Assessment 2022, where we were

assessed against 29 companies from the

aluminium industry.

Our endeavour to attain long-term

business sustenance is demonstrated

by several targeted initiatives we have

taken over the years. Underscoring

our commitment to biodiversity and

fostering a healthier ecosystem, we have

completed CII’s biodiversity index and

carbon sequestration field study for six

sites in India.

Additionally, we have conducted an

all-season study of the Biodiversity

Management Plan which has been

launched at five sites. We have attained

single-use plastic (SUP) free certifications

across 12 sites in India. In our quest to

achieve water positivity across all mines

by 2025, we have effectively conserved

groundwater in Chhattisgarh's water-

scarce Samri mines area, contributing to a

higher water positivity rate.

Regarding renewable energy integration

in India, we have increased our

consumption by 54% from the previous

year, taking our capacity to 108 MW by

the end of FY2023.

We are enhancing biomass co-firing in

all our thermal plants in India. Another

notable initiative is the Novelis Net Zero

Lab in Valais, Sierre, Switzerland. These

projects are pivotal in reducing our carbon

footprint and transitioning to a more

sustainable energy mix.

Additionally, our Wind-Solar Hybrid

project in Dahej and Belagavi in India

and the Utkal Red Mud Roads initiative

further exemplify our commitment

to renewable energy and sustainable

infrastructure development.

As we continue our journey, we are

proud to contribute to the global

efforts to create a more sustainable and

resilient future.

Inspiring Trust

The Great Place to Work Institute® India

has certified Hindalco as a ‘Great Place to

Work’ in 2022 for the second consecutive

year. We have witnessed a remarkable

improvement across all dimensions,

ongoing efforts to build a high-trust,

high-performance culture towards

making Hindalco a High Performing

Our employees and workers provide

us with implicit strength as we proceed

onward. We have pledged to safeguard

our employees and workers from harm,

resulting in the industry’s lowest LTIFR of

0.25. We intend to ensure a completely

safe environment for our employees and

workers: safety is a key concern on the job

and off it.

Strengthening our relationships with

communities around us is an ongoing

endeavour, and our well-structured CSR

initiatives cut across education, health,

sustainable livelihood, infrastructure,

and other social causes which help enrich

their quality of life.

We also proactively engage with our

suppliers and vendors and ensure that the

suppliers demonstrate the same level of

commitment to ethics, people, safety, and

communities. Through such initiatives,

we have touched over 2 Million lives.

Our community expenditure on a

consolidated basis for FY2022-23 stands

at J136 Crore.

Advancing Together

We find inspiration in our achievements

and failures alike, which continuously

drives us to raise the bar. I express

my heartfelt appreciation to every

individual at Hindalco for their

unstinting cooperation and dedicated

efforts. I extend my gratitude to all our

stakeholders for their trust and support

throughout our journey.

It gives me great pleasure to present

the Integrated Report for the fiscal year

future endeavours.

I started my journey with many hopes and dreams

in my eyes as a GET in July 2011 in Renukoot.

These years have been a real learning experience

for me as a young engineer. I worked in our

6 X 150 MW CPP power plant, starting from

documentation jobs in electrical and advancing

to a project leader – planning, resource

management of Erection, Testing, Commissioning

& CEI(G) Inspection of Units in Electrical, leading a

team of 30, including contractual workers.

As a woman, I have never experienced fear or

gender bias in my plant. I proudly say, “Hindalco is

really a very safe place for any woman employee.”

The next turning point that came in my journey

was Internal Recruitment Scheme.

I got selected as Manager, Technical Services CPP.

Now I am involved in ‘breakdown of electrical

equipment to condition monitoring of electrical

equipment’. My belief: “Gender is not a barrier to

growth at Hindalco. Gender equality is real here.”

Senior Management : As decided by the Board

III.

Business and Talent Competitors

We benchmark our executive pay practices and levels against peer companies in similar industries, geographies and of

similar size. In addition, we look at secondary reference (internal and external) benchmarks in order to ensure that pay

policies and levels across the Group are broadly equitable and support the Group’s global mobility objectives for executive

talent. Secondary reference points bring to the table, the executive pay practices and pay levels in other markets and

industries, to appreciate the differences in levels and medium of pay and build in as appropriate for decision making.

IV.

Executive Pay Positioning

We aim to provide competitive remuneration opportunities to our executives by positioning target total remuneration

(including perks and benefits, annual incentive pay-outs, long term incentive pay-outs at target performance) and target

total cash compensation (including annual incentive pay-outs) at target performance directionally between median and

top quartile of the primary talent market. We recognize the size and scope of the role and the market standing, skills and

experience of incumbents while positioning our executives.

Annexure VI

We use secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while

principally believing that target total remuneration packages should reflect the typical cost of comparable executive talent

available in the sector.

V.

Executive Pay-Mix

Our executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic

Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Benefits

Annual Incentive Plan:

We tie annual incentive plan pay-outs of our executives to relevant financial and operational metrics achievement and their

individual performance. We annually align the financial and operational metrics with priorities/ focus areas for the business.

Long-Term Incentive:

Our Long-term incentive plans incentivize stretch performance, link executive remuneration to sustained long term growth

and act as a retention and reward tool.

We use stock options as the primary long-term incentive vehicles for our executives as we believe that they best align

executive incentives with stockholder interests.

We grant restricted stock units as a secondary long term incentive vehicles, to motivate and retain our executives.

VI.

Performance Goal Setting

We aim to ensure that for both annual incentive plans and long term incentive plans, the target performance goals shall

be achievable and realistic.

Threshold performance (the point at which incentive plans are paid out at their minimum, but non-zero, level) shall reflect

a base-line level of performance, reflecting an estimated 90% probability of achievement.

Target performance is the expected level of performance at the beginning of the performance cycle, taking into account

all known relevant facts likely to impact measured performance.

Maximum performance (the point at which the maximum plan payout is made) shall be based on an exceptional level of

achievement, reflecting no more than an estimated 10% probability of achievement.

VII. Executive Benefits and Perquisites

Our executives are eligible to participate in our broad-based retirement, health and welfare, and other employee benefit

plans. In addition to these broad-based plans, they are eligible for perquisites and benefits plans commensurate with their

roles. These benefits are designed to encourage long-term careers with the Group.

Other Remuneration Elements

Each of our executives is subject to an employment agreement. Each such agreement generally provides for a total remuneration

package for our executives including continuity of service across the Group Companies.

We limit other remuneration elements, for e.g. Change in Control (CIC) agreements, severance agreements, to instances

of compelling business need or competitive rationale and generally do not provide for any tax gross-ups for

our executives.

letter dated 25th April,

2018, NA imposed a penalty equal to 20% of PBG amounting to ` 64 crore for GP-4, ` 74 crore for GP-5 and ` 118 crore

for Kathautia (Refer note - 12(c)). As the PBG for GP-5 is still with NA, it also appropriated an amount equal to the penalty

from the PBG of the GP-5 mines. For Kathautia Coal Mine only appropriated amount of ` 118 crore is with NA. In terms of

agreement, we have not renewed the PBG for remaining amount.

The above actions were contested by the Company. The Hon’ble Chhattisgarh High Court at Bilaspur has already given its

judgment in favour of the Company in the matter related to GP-5. As per the judgment, Hon’ble High Court has asked NA

to refund the amount appropriated by them and return the PBG to the Company. The NA has filed an appeal before the

Hon’ble Supreme Court. The Company’s appeal to quash the demand raised by NA in case of GP-4 and Kathautia is yet to

be decided and is pending before the Mines Tribunal at Bilaspur and Ranchi respectively.

44. Segment Information:

Refer Note 1B(AA) for accounting policy on Segment Reporting

The Group is primarily engaged in the business of manufacture and distribution of aulminium, copper and its products

across the globe. Based on the information reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), the Group

has determined four reporting segments, namely (1) Novelis; (2) Aluminium Upstream; (3) Aluminium Upstream; and (4)

Copper. The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments,

has been identified as the Company’s Board of Directors.

(1)

Novelis Segment: This segment represents Novelis Inc, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of the Company and it’s step

down subsidiaries engaged in producing and selling aluminium sheet and light gauge products and operating in four

continents viz. North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. This is identified as a separate segment based on its

geographical area and regulatory environment.

(2)

Aluminium Upstream Segment: This segment represents Aluminium Upstream business namely Bauxite & Coal Mining,

Alumina Specials, Refineries, Metal and Power. This is identified as separate segment based on its nature of products and

different risks and returns.

(3)

Aluminium Downstream Segment: This segment represents aluminium downstream business of the Group which include

Aluminium value-added products e.g., Flat Rolled Products, Extrusion, Foils. This is identified as separate segment based

on its nature of products and different risks and returns.

(4) Copper Segment: This segment represents copper business of the Group e.g. Copper Cathode, Copper Rods, Precious

metals and Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) This is identified as separate segment based on its nature of products and

different risks and returns.

Last year, there were four reporting segments, namely (1) Novelis; (2) Aluminium; (3) Copper; and (4) All Other Segments,

reported by the Group. During the year, in line with the changes in the internal structure for reporting financial information to

the entity’s CODM, the Aluminium segment has been segregated into “Aluminium Upstream” and “Aluminium Downstream”.

Further, from this year the Group has also discontinued “All Other segment” since a subsidiary which was primarily used to

represent this segment was disposed of by the Group in March 2022. The corresponding segment information of previous year

has been restated accordingly.

The CODM primarily uses a measure of adjusted earnings from continuing operations before interest, tax and depreciation

and amortization excluding certain items of income amd expenses (Adjusted EBITDA) The CODM also receives information

about the segment’s revenue, assets and liabilities on a regular basis. The information of Group’s reportable segments is given

below:

(A) Adjusted EBITDA:

For Aluminium Upstream, Aluminium Downstream and Copper segment, Adjusted EBITDA is the earnings from Continuing

Operations before (a) finance cost, (b) tax, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) impairment of non-current assets, (e)

exceptional items, (f) investment income, (g) fair value gains/ (losses) on financial assets, (h) share in profit/ (loss) in equity

accounted investments, (i) metal price lag (the base metal price movement between the procurement at transfer price

from the Aluminium Upstream segment and sale price of the Aluminium Downstream segment), (j) corporate income/

expenses, and (k) certain unallocable income/ expenses) which are not related to the performance of the segment.

For Novelis segment, Adjusted EBITDA is the earnings from Continuing Operations before (a) depreciation and amortization;

(b) finance cost - net; (c) interest income; (d) unrealized gains or losses on change in fair value of derivative instruments,

net, except for foreign currency remeasurement hedging activities, which are included in Adjusted EBITDA; (e) impairment

loss or reversal on non financial assets, net; (f) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (g) restructuring costs; (h) profit

or loss on plant property and equipment and intangibles sold or discarded, net; (i) other costs/income, net; (j) litigation

settlement, net of insurance recoveries; (k) sale transaction fees; (l) cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax; (m)

metal price lag; (n) exceptional income or cost; (o) business acquisition and other integration related costs; (p) purchase

price accounting adjustments; and (q) gains or losses from discontinued operations, net of tax; (r) tax expenses/ (benefits),

which is in line with the segment information for Novelis that has been reported in accordance with its US GAAP financial

information filed with the Securities Exchange Commission of the United States of America. Recognition and measurement

differences between US GAAP and Ind AS accounting policies have been separately presented as part of reconciliation in the

segment information. Gains and losses on metal derivative contracts are not recognized in “Adjusted EBITDA” until realized.

letter dated 25th April, 2018, NA imposed a penalty equal to 20% of PBG amounting to ` 64 Crore for GP-4, ` 74 Crore

for GP-5 and ` 118 Crore for Kathautia (Refer Note - 14(e)). As the PBG for GP-5 is still with NA, it also appropriated an

amount equal to the penalty from the PBG of the GP-5 mines. For Kathautia Coal Mine only appropriated amount of

` 118 Crore is with NA. In terms of agreement, the Company has not renewed the PBG for remaining amount.

The above actions were contested by the Company. The Hon’ble Chhattisgarh High Court at Bilaspur has already

given its judgment in favour of the Company in the matter related to GP-5. As per the judgment, Hon’ble High Court

has asked NA to refund the amount appropriated by them and return the PBG to the Company. The NA has filed an

(b) For the period from 1st July 2021 to 25th November 2021, there was lack of clarity with regard to the deduction of tax at

source on procurement of coal as there were concurrent provision for collection as well as deduction of tax at source.

There was an existing provision for tax collection at source by the seller u/s 206C(1) whereas the newly introduced

section 194Q provided for deduction of tax at source by the buyer. At the same time, subsection 5 of section 194Q

specifically excluded the operation of section 194Q in cases where tax collection at source was already applicable. It

Notes

forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements

was, therefore, evident that there was no need for deduction of tax at source by the buyer (in the present case, the

Company). However, on 25th November 2021, CBDT came out with a circular stating that tax deduction was applicable in

cases where buyer is using coal for his own consumption, tax need to be deducted at source by the buyer. Accordingly,

the Company started deducting and depositing tax on such purchases with effect from 1st November 2021. However,

the tax for the period from 1st July 2021 to 31st October 2021 was deposited by the Company in October 2022 along

with applicable interest.

46. Segment Reporting

The Company has presented segment information in its Consolidated Financial Statements, which are part of the same

annual report. Accordingly, in terms of provisions of Accounting Standard on Segment Reporting (Ind AS 108), no disclosure

related to the segment are presented in the Standalone Financial Statements.

Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

HINDALCO INDUSTRIES LIMITED

616:

Managing Director of the Company. The present value of the above pension liability

determined based on the actuarial valuation is accounted by the Company in the financial statements. Amount charged

as expenses in the statement of profit and loss towards such post-employment benefit amounting to ` 3 Crore and does

not include the impact of acturial (gains)/losses recognised in other comprehensive income.

48. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

Refer Note 1B (L) for accounting policy on Provisions and contingencies

A.

Contingent Liabilities

The Company is party to, and may in the future be involved in, or subject to, disputes, claims and proceedings arising in

the ordinary course of our business, including some we assert against others, such as environmental, health and safety,

product liability, employee, tax, personal injury and other matters. The Company has established a liability with respect

to contingencies for which a loss is probable and estimable. While the ultimate resolution of liability and costs related

to these matters cannot be determined with certainty, the Management does not believe any of these pending actions,

individually or in the aggregate, will materially impact our operations or materially affect our financial condition or liquidity.

The Company’s estimates involve significant judgment, and therefore, the estimate will change from time to time and

actual losses may differ from the current estimate.

Management reviews the status of, and estimated liability related to, pending claims and civil actions on a quarterly basis.

The evaluation model includes all asserted and unasserted claims that can be reasonably identified including claims relating

Notes

forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements

to our responsibility for compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. The estimated costs in

respect of such reported liabilities are not offset by amounts related to insurance or indemnification arrangements unless

otherwise noted.

(a)

Claims against Company not acknowledged as Debt:

Following demands are disputed by the Company and are not provided for:

(i)

The tax authorities issued an arbitrary Demand Notice to the company for payment of interest on Entry Tax.

Company has challenged the said notice by filing a Writ Tax -218/2023 in Allahabad High Court. The High

Court by its Order gave protection against any coercive action till next date of listing. The challenge is to the

power of levy of interest as well as legitimacy of such levy in the face of the facts as well as applicable law.

(ii)

Customs duty implication on goods importing during transition into GST regime. The matter is pending

at Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT).

-

(iii)

Demand for Stamp Duty by Collector (Stamp), Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) on merger of Copper Business of

Indo-Gulf Corporation with the Company.The matter is pending before the Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad.

The Company believes that there is no substantive/computation provision for levy/calculation of stamp

duty within the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Stamp Act on scheme of arrangement under the Companies

Act, 1956, approved by the Court. Moreover, the properties in question are located in the State of Gujarat

and, thus, the Collector (Stamp), Kanpur, has no territorial jurisdiction to make such a demand. Further,

the Company has already paid the stamp duty for the same in 2003-04 which has been accepted as per

the provisions of the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958.
