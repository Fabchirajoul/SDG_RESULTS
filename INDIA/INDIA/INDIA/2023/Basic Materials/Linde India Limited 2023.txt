Dear Shareholders,

I am indeed honoured and delighted to

communicate with you as the newly appointed

Chairman of Linde India Ltd. As this marks my

first correspondence to shareholders since

assuming office, I would like to extend my

heartfelt gratitude to each of you for your

unwavering support and trust in our Company.

Your commitment has been vital in driving our

continued growth and success.

As we embark on a new financial year, it is

essential to reflect on the global economic

landscape in 2022 and the progress of the

Indian economy in FY 2023-24.

The year 2022 witnessed a global economy

grappling with various challenges. One

significant factor was the ongoing conflict

between Russia and Ukraine, which began

in February 2022 and had far-reaching

implications. Geopolitical tensions in several

regions caused disruptions in supply chains,

resulting in increased energy prices and

inflation worldwide. These circumstances

posed unique challenges to economies across

the globe, and India was not exempt from

their impact.

However, amidst these challenges, I am

pleased to share that the Indian economy has

made remarkable progress in FY 2023-24.

We have seen significant improvement in the

economic landscape, marked by increased

investments across sectors. This positive trend

reflects renewed confidence in the Indian

market, paving the way for a promising future.

India’s GDP grew impressively by 7.2% in

FY 2023-24, surpassing market expectations

and the RBI’s estimate of 7%. This positions

India among the world’s fastest-growing

major economies. The estimated real GDP

for FY22-23, measured at constant prices, is

approximately ₹160.06 lakh crore.

These figures testify to the resilience and

potential of the Indian economy. Despite

challenges, we have witnessed robust growth,

showcasing the strength and dynamism of

emerging India.

Review of Performance

During the year under review, Regional

Director - Eastern Region, MCA, approved our

application to change our Financial Year from

a calendar year to a uniform FY. The current FY

will be for 15 months, from 1 January 2022 to

31 March 2023. Going forward, our FY will be

from 1 April to 31 March.

I am pleased to present the key highlights of

our financial performance for the 15 months

period ended on 31 March 2023. During this

period, Linde India achieved remarkable

results, demonstrating strong growth and

financial resilience. Our total revenues

from operations stood at Rs. 31,355 million,

marking a substantial increase compared

to the previous financial year’s figure of

Rs. 21,120 million, reflecting an impressive

growth rate of 48.5% compared to FY 2021.

The growth was driven by both our Gases and

Project Engineering divisions. Gases revenues

witnessed a significant surge, growing by

33.3% from Rs. 16,611 million to Rs. 22,144

million. This growth was attributed to higher

demand for merchant liquid, increased

gas consumption by the steel sector, and

enhanced business in helium and special

products. Our Project Engineering Division

delivered exceptional performance, with

revenues doubling from Rs. 4,509 million to

Rs. 9,211 million during the 15 months period.

In terms of profitability, we achieved earnings

before interest, depreciation and amortization

(EBITDA) of Rs. 8,729 million, indicating a

growth rate of 45.2% compared to FY 2021’s

figure of Rs. 6,013 million. Our focus on

operational efficiency and effective cost

management contributed to this positive

outcome. Profit after tax (PAT) for the period

under review amounted to Rs. 5,358 million,

slightly surpassing the previous year’s figure of

Rs. 5,139 million. It is worth mentioning

that the PAT for FY 2021 included a pre-tax

exceptional profit of Rs. 2,944 million from

the sale of land in Kolkata.

The strong financial performance of Linde India

during this period underscores our commitment

to sustainable growth and delivering value to

our shareholders. We are confident that our

robust order book, particularly in the steel,

refineries and electronics sectors, positions us

well for future success.

Environment Responsibility

Linde India is committed to environmental

sustainability and has made significant

progress in various areas. We have

implemented energy intensity reduction

initiatives, resulting in a remarkable 9%

reduction in energy intensity compared to the

previous year. Additionally, we continue to

monitor and reduce water intensity, achieving

a commendable 12% reduction in water

consumption intensity.

In terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,

we have undertaken several initiatives

aligned with our global decarbonisation

target. This year, we achieved a notable 15%

reduction in scope 1 and 2 GHG intensity

compared to the previous year.

Waste management practices at all Linde

India sites comply with state and central

pollution control norms. We segregate and

store hazardous and non-hazardous waste

separately and dispose them off through

pollution control-approved recyclers.

The Company recently made a strategic

investment in Avaada MHYavat Pvt. Ltd.,

FP Solar Shakti Pvt. Ltd. and FPEL Surya

Pvt. Ltd. The primary objective of these

investments is to gain access to renewable

power procurement under a captive

mechanism. By utilising this mechanism, we

aim to secure renewable power at lower

tariffs, leading to significant cost savings for

our operations. These investments align with

our commitment to sustainable practices and

optimising our cost structure for the benefit of

our shareholders.

In conclusion, I would like to express my

sincere gratitude for your continued support

and trust in Linde India. As we navigate

the uncertainties of the global economy,

we remain steadfast in our commitment to

creating long-term value for our shareholders.

Together we will embrace the opportunities

that lie ahead and forge a path of growth,

resilience and success.

Warm regards,

M J Devine

holding risk workshops periodically to refresh its risks in line with

the dynamic and ever-changing business environment and the last

refresher risk workshop was conducted on 25 October 2021, which

was attended by senior management team of the Company. The senior

management team deliberated on the carried forward risks and the

new risks identified at the workshop and prioritized them on the basis

of their EBIT impact and probability scores. These risks were thereafter

assigned to various risk owners within the Company and appropriate

During the 15 months period ended 31 March 2023, the performance

evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual directors

including the process and criteria thereof was done through a

combination of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC),

the Board and a separate meeting of Independent Directors.

During the 15 months period ended 31 March 2023, the Nomination

and Remuneration Committee of the Board reviewed and approved

the process and various attributes considered in the previous year for

evaluating the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual

directors. As a result of the review, the performance evaluation form

for the 15 months period ended 31 March 2023 was approved by the

Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board. As per the

process, which contained a structured questionnaire for seeking

feedback from the directors on certain pre-defined attributes applicable

to them, including some specific ones for the Independent Directors

and similar attributes for the Board as a whole and its Committees

as approved by the NRC. In respect of Independent Directors, the

criteria or the attributes included ensuring independence and avoiding

conflict of interest, safeguarding the interest of minority shareholders,

application of independent judgement while taking decisions at the

Board Meeting and ensuring adequate deliberations while approving

material decisions including Related Party Transactions. Subsequently,

the Independent Directors at their separate meeting held on 22 March

2023, reviewed the performance of the Board, Chairman of the Board

and the Non-Independent Directors and also assessed the quality,

quantity and timeliness of flow of information between the Company

management and the Board. The Chairman of the Board was thereafter

briefed on the outcome of the review carried out by the Independent

Directors.

The result of the performance evaluation continues to remain

encouraging with consistent improvement recorded in the overall

ratings of all the Board members for self & peer assessment, Board as

a whole and its Committees over the last year. The rating during the
