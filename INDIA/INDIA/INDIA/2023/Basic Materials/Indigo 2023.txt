Dear Shareholders,

It is a genuine privilege for me to share

my thoughts with you, for the first time

in this annual report. Ever since my start

at IndiGo in September 2022, I have

been equally excited and proud to be a

part of this wonderful company.

Aviation has had a hold on me ever

since I joined the industry over 30 years

ago, back in 1992. At IndiGo the

entrepreneurial spirit, the energy and

passion displayed by our employees,

combined with the rich diversity of India

have been a true pleasure for me that

I intend to enjoy for long.

The financial year 2023 was a year of

first recovery and thereafter growth. In

the first half of the year, the path to

recovery became clearly visible when

the impact of Covid-19 subsided and

travel restrictions were lifted. As a

reported the highest ever annual

revenues of 558.8 billion rupees. With

that, the year had two very distinct

halves.

The first two quarters we still suffered

losses, yet we were recovering. The

third and fourth quarter were profitable,

result, travel rebounded at an

extraordinary speed and scale. In the

second half of 2022, a lot of exciting

things have been launched and

implemented at IndiGo, which we will

share throughout this annual report.

Consequently, and proudly, IndiGo

became the first Indian airline to

surpass pre-covid levels of capacity,

taking us into the highest passenger

number ever - of 86 million for the

Financial Year 2023. The relentless

efforts of our professional and resilient

employees enabled us to emerge

stronger after this period of crisis.

As a result of the improved external

environment and a wide range of

internal initiatives that were taken

as part of the new IndiGo strategy,

IndiGo’s financial performance

considerably improved in FY 2023.

Our revenues more than doubled as

compared to last year and we also

As a result of the

improved external

environment and as

part of the new IndiGo

strategy, IndiGo’s

financial performance

considerably

improved in FY 2023

Board Meetings and Procedure:

The Board and committee meetings are pre-scheduled, and an annual calendar of such meetings is decided and informed to all the

Directors in advance. In exceptional circumstances and on matters requiring immediate action, the meetings are either held at shorter

notice, with necessary approval in compliance with applicable provisions, or the approval of such matter(s) is taken by passing

resolution(s) through circulation, subject to complying with all regulatory requirements.

The Board meets at regular intervals to discuss and decide on the Company’s business policy and strategies apart from other normal

business activities. The maximum interval between any two meetings of the Board/committee did not exceed 120 days during the

year. Agenda papers containing all necessary information/documents are made available to the Board / committee members in

advance to enable them to discharge their responsibilities effectively and take informed decisions. All necessary information as

specified in the Act, Secretarial Standard -1, and the SEBI LODR Regulations, is regularly made available to the Board.

The Company Secretary finalises the agenda for the Board meetings in consultation with the Chairman, the CEO and the Managing

Director. The agenda for committee meetings is circulated after consultation with the Chairpersons of the respective committees. The

relevant members of the Management team are invited for discussions on the Company’s performance at these meetings. In special

and exceptional circumstances, additional item(s) are taken up as ‘any other item’ with the permission of the Chairperson of the Board

/ respective committee and with the consent of majority of the Board / committee members present at the meeting.

Board Support:

The Company Secretary is responsible for convening of the Board and committee meetings along with preparation of the agenda

papers for such meetings. The Company Secretary attends all the meetings of the Board and its committees and ensures that the

Board and its committees, function in accordance with compliance and governance principles. The Company Secretary also ensures

appropriate recording of minutes of the meetings after incorporating the comments received from the members of the Board or

respective committees on the draft minutes within the timeline as specified in the Act.

In compliance of the provisions of the Act, the Company Secretary annually obtains from each Director, details of the Board and Board’s

committees positions he/ she occupies in other companies, and changes, if any, regarding their directorships and places the same at

the subsequent Board meetings.

Post-Meeting Follow-up System:

We have an effective post-meeting follow-up system, whereby all-important decisions taken at Board/committee meetings are tracked

until their closure.

Independent Directors:

Pursuant to Regulation 25(8) of the SEBI LODR Regulations, the Independent Directors have confirmed that they are not aware of any

circumstances or situation which exist, or which may be reasonably anticipated, that could impact their ability to discharge their duties

with an objective independent judgment and without any external influence. As confirmed to the Board, the Independent Directors

meet the criteria of independence and are independent of the Management, as mentioned under Regulation 16(1)(b) of the SEBI

LODR Regulations.

Ms. Pallavi Shardul Shroff, Independent Director of the Company, is the Managing Partner of Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.,

Solicitors & Advocates, which is one of the legal firms from which the Company avails professional services. The Company has paid

Rs. 2.43 million during FY 2023 to such firm for availing the professional services. The Board has determined that such payment in the

context of gross turnover of such legal firm or total income of the Company is negligible and does not affect independence of Ms. Shroff.

options in determination of lease term for contracts having such option. Extension options have not been included in determination of

event of exercising the extension options.

(iii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk

comprises two types of risks namely: currency risk and interest rate risk. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control

market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.

A. Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates primarily relates to certain bank deposits, foreign currency term

loan and certain lease liabilities carrying floating rate of interest.

Exposure to interest rate risk

The Company’s interest rate risk arises from certain bank deposits, foreign currency term loan and certain lease liabilities carrying floating

rate of interest. These deposits and obligations expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. The exposure of the Company to

interest rate changes as reported to the management at the end of the reporting period are as follows:
