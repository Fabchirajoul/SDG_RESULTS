Dear Stakeholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to

address you after another year of

growth across our businesses. This

year has been pivotal in our journey

as we embraced a new vision to shape

our path forward. Our vision is to

become a green and trusted mobility

partner, a commitment that reflects

our intention to combine growth

with sustainability.

FY 2022-23, proved to be a

remarkable period of expansion

and achievements for JK Tyre,

rightfully characterised as a year of

‘Exceleration’. I am proud to share that

we have surpassed the ₹14,000 crore

mark, achieving the highest-ever

revenue in our Company’s history.

A New Vision

We at JK Tyre are continuously

evolving and adapting to the

rapidly changing world. In order to

re-emphasise our green ethos and

conduct of business sustainably,

we have carefully deliberated and

developed our new vision: “Be a

Green & Trusted Mobility Partner”.

This vision recognises that we do

not only manufacture and sell tyres

but also contribute to society in

terms of mobility, safety, health and

happiness. The mission associated

with this vision has been detailed in

other sections of this report.

Celebrating 25 Years of Vikrant Plant

In 1997, we acquired the Vikrant Tyre plant in Mysuru

and transformed it into a state-of-the-art facility.

I am immensely proud to announce that JK Tyre is

celebrating 25 years of its acquisition. Vikrant stands as

a testament to our growth story and has played a crucial

role in creating shared value for the larger communities

in Mysuru.

which will aid our growth efforts.

Vikrant Silver Jubilee

I am also delighted to share that

this year we completed 25 years

of acquisition of Vikrant Tyre,

Mysuru by JK Tyre, which has been

transformed into a

state-of-the-art facility backed by

world class research, innovation and

technology. Even more satisfying

is that we have been able to enrich

the lives economically and socially,

of not only our employees but

communities in the vicinity of our

plant and the city of Mysuru at large.

Our Green Journey – a Shared

Responsibility for the Future

India, like other major economies,

faces two significant challenges:

the need to create a sustainable

growth-oriented economy and the

need to maintain competitiveness

in the global market. At JK Tyre,

we have demonstrated our

strong commitment to ensuring

Environment, Social, and

Governance (ESG) considerations in

our business practices, driving our

non-financial performance.

JK Tyre has adopted a comprehensive

‘Cradle-to-grave’ approach to

address sustainability challenges.

Our Research and Development

(R&D) efforts prioritise sustainability,

aiming to minimise our impact

on the environment. We have set

ourselves a target to reduce carbon

emission intensity to 50% by 2030,

A Milestone Year

We look back with great

satisfaction at a year characterised

by highly successful operations.

JK Tyre successfully navigated

through the challenges of high

input costs in the tyre industry

during the first half of the year. Our

proactive approach and timely

strategic business interventions

played a crucial role in maintaining

our profitable growth trajectory.

Notably, our revenue grew by 22%,

culminating in the highest-ever

consolidated turnover of ₹14681

crore. Prudent financial management

and a strong focus on enhancing

operating efficiencies at JK Tyre

and its subsidiaries resulted in

robust outcomes, with a 32% rise in

net profit.

The International Finance

Corporation (IFC), a prominent

member of the World Bank Group

and the largest global development

institution, has reposed confidence

in your Company by making

reflecting our commitment to combat

climate change.

It is heartening that our ESG efforts

have garnered recognition, with

JK Tyre being rated as the best

among our peers in the tyre

industry by CareEdge. As a green

manufacturer, we continue to be

amongst the best in areas of energy,

water consumption and usage of

green power. You will be glad to

know that we have incorporated an

ESG Data Book in this report which

is a best-in-class practice and an

Industry first in India.
