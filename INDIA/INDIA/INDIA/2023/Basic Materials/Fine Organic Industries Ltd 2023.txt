Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to address you all as we

come to the end of another successful financial year at Fine

Organics. Despite the challenges posed by the geopolitical

tension between Ukraine and Russia and supply chain

disruption, our team worked tirelessly to achieve our goals

and maintain a strong position in the specialty additives

market.

Financial performance

We are thrilled to announce that despite the challenging

economic landscape and global tensions, the Company

delivered outstanding financial results. We are proud to

report that we achieved a total net revenue of ` 3,029

crores, representing a remarkable 63% increase compared

to the previous year.

In addition, our EBIDTA soared to ` 781 crores, reflecting

a substantial 124% growth from ` 349 crores last year. The

Company’s exceptional performance was further highlighted

by our PAT, which rose to ` 591 crores, marking a remarkable

136% increase from ` 251 crores in the previous year.

Our unwavering commitment to delivering value to our

clients allowed us to achieve a remarkable milestone of

over ` 3,029 crores in sales. These outstanding results are a

testament to the hard work, dedication, and relentless pursuit

of excellence exhibited by every member of our team.

Growth + Sustainability = Value

At Fine Organics, we believe that growth and sustainability

are mutually inclusive, and can work together to create long-

term value for all our stakeholders. We also recognise that

sustainability is not just an environmental issue, but a social

and economic issue as well. This is why we are committed to

supporting the communities in which we operate, ensuring

that all our stakeholders are treated fairly and with respect.

Forward outline

Our commitment to sustainability remains persistent, and we

have taken several initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint

and promote sustainability. Our focus on sustainability has

not only helped us reduce our environmental impact, but

also resulted in cost savings and improved efficiency. We

firmly believe that sustainable practices are essential for the

long-term success of our business.

As we move forward, our focus will continue to be

on delivering exceptional value to our customers and

shareholders. We understand the importance of maintaining

strong financial performance and remain committed to

generating sustainable profits and delivering long-term

shareholder value.

Closing note

I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees,

customers, and shareholders for their continuous support and

belief. Our success would not have been possible without

their hard work and dedication. We are also thankful for the

trust and confidence that our customers and shareholders

have shown on us.

I am confident that Fine Organics is well-positioned to

capitalise on the opportunities that lie ahead. With a strong

team, a diverse product portfolio, and commitment to growth

and sustainability, the Company is ready to take on the

challenges of the future. We are also committed to delivering

value for all our stakeholders even as we continue to grow.
