location in Karnataka, we seek

mining operation at the Devadari

Iron Ore Mine.: Dear Shareholders,

It is a privilege to speak to you at the conclusion of

the fiscal year 2022-23.

Let me begin by addressing the operating

environment during the year gone by. Nonetheless, it

the industry made swift progress on the back of

strong post-Covid recovery and growing infrastructure

investments around the world.

However, the conflict in Ukraine aggravated existing

inflationary pressures. Gas and coal prices surged,

leading to a sharp increase in steel prices. The

Dear Shareholders,

The Board of Directors hereby submits the 47th Annual Report on the business and operations of your Company (“the Company”

or “KIOCL”) and its Audited Financial Statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 (FY’23), together with the Auditors’

Report and Comments on the Accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India.

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND STATE OF COMPANY'S AFFAIRS

Impact of Export Duty @ 45%

Export duty @ 45% on Pellets was levied by Govt. of

India vide Customs Notice No. 29/2022 - Customs dated

21-05-2022. Accordingly, mainly due to unviable operation

in view of levy of export duty, the Company’s Pellet Plant

operation was suspended for 187 days and was operated only

for 178 days during the year.

However, Govt. of India vide notification No. 58/2022-Customs

dated 18-11-2022 withdrew the export duty w.e.f. 19-11-2022.

Despite the aforesaid challenges posed, your Company’s

production during the year was 1.510 Million Tonnes (Mt) and

dispatch was 1.460 Million Tonnes (against FY’22 production

and dispatch of 2.030 Mt and 2.072 Mt respectively).

Impact of Russia-Ukraine War

The year under review was a tumultuous year for the steel

industry. Globally, the industry started well on the back of a

strong post-Covid recovery and the infrastructure investments

that many governments across the world had announced to

support this recovery. However, the conflict in Ukraine made

worse the inflationary pressures being felt due to supply chain

bottlenecks in the post Covid world. Gas prices shot up as did

coal prices which led to steel prices shooting up. Economic

crisis induced by war caused decreasing steel demand and

redirection of trade flows. The war worsened current economic

situation globally.

Corporate Overview

KIOCL Limited

47th Annual Report 2022-23:

letter No. H/C.474 Classification/11

dated 21st October, 2011 raised an issue regarding

the applicability of distance-based charge (DBC) over

and above normal freight on Iron ore transported

through railway network for manufacture of pellets

and their subsequent export. Both South Western

Railway (SWR) and East Coast Railway (ECR) have

raised demand of H 14,463.93 Lakhs and H 10,361.38

Lakhs respectively towards distance-based charge

(DBC) over and above normal freight on Iron ore

transported.

As per the Company’s view, DBC should attract

only for iron ore fines and lumps which are directly

exported and not on the Iron Ore so moved and

utilized in the steel plants for manufacture of finished

product and exported thereafter. The same is also

not applicable to Pig iron and Sponge Iron Industry.

Accordingly, against the demand of H 14,463.93

Lakhs of SWR, KIOCL had filed writ petition before

the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka. The writ

petition was dismissed and KIOCL filed writ appeal

challenging the dismissal of the writ petition. The

Hon’ble High Court has granted interim order

staying DBC, subject to the condition that 50% of

the demand excluding penalty is to be deposited.

Thus, H 8,325.16 Lakhs was paid and for the balance

amount of H 6,138.77 Lakhs provision has been

made in the books in the FY 2013-14.

Similarly, against the demand of H 10,361.38 Lakhs

for DBC and H 31,084.14 Lakhs towards penalty, of

ECR which after considering the freight already paid,

DBC worked out to be H 6,740.94 Lakhs. KIOCL has

filed WRIT petition before High Court of Orissa

and High Court granted stay subject to deposit of

50% amount excluding the penalty. Against the

worked-out liability, the Company paid H 5,188.86

Lakhs and the balance amount of H 1,552.08 Lakhs

provision has been made in the books FY 2013-14.

The balance demand toward DBC and penalty of

H 3,4704.58 Lakhs has been included in contingent

liabilities.

Both the cases are not listed so far. Railway has filed

transfer petition before Hon’ble Supreme Court and

both the cases are stayed by Supreme Court. The

transfer petition is still pending before the Hon’ble

Supreme Court.

28.3.2

During the FY 2008-09, the Company has claimed

refund of congestion surcharge amounting to

H 6,877.86 Lakh from South Western Railway (SWR)

in respect of 573 rakes moved during 1st April, 2007

to 21st May, 2008 through the Company’s private

Railway Siding at Panambur, Mangalore which was

commissioned in January 2006. SWR refunded

only H 2,725.39 Lakh till FY 2013-14 which includes

H 206.70 Lakh adjusted by SWR towards DBC. During

the FY 2014-15, the Company had approached

Railway Claims Tribunal (RCT), Bangalore for

refund of the balance amount of H 4,152.70 Lakh

with interest. The Tribunal allowed the claim by its

order dated 7th December, 2018 and directed SWR

to compute and pay the amount together with

interest at 6% per annum and in case SWR fails to

comply with the order, interest at 9% per annum is

payable from 1st April, 2019. SWR has filed petition

against the order of Tribunal in Hon’ble High Court

of Karnataka on 11th April, 2019 vide case no

MFA/3165/2019. KIOCL filed cross objection in the

appeal and the case is still pending. The Company

has not recognized the above as income in line with

the Company’s significant accounting policy No.1.5,

pending realization.

The Konkan Railway offered concessional freight

to the Company for movement of rakes through

Konkan route instead of shorter route i.e., Hassan-

Mangaluru, which has been accepted by the

Company and 110 rakes were booked for the

Konkan route. Subsequently, Konkan Railway

allowed concessional freight for 92 rakes only and

balance 18 rakes were moved through shorter routes

i.e., Hassan-Mangaluru. Hence, during the FY 2008-

09 the Company claimed refund of H 254.45 Lakhs

from SWR towards differential freight. However, SWR

has not refunded the amount. Hence, during the FY

2014-15 the Company approached RCT, Bengaluru

and has claimed H 254.45 Lakhs with interest. The

Tribunal dismissed the claim and the Company filed

appeal before Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka

during the FY 2018-19 and the same is pending.

206:

letter no. MS/CMG/Fe-38-

52 dated 6th May, 2005. At the time of closure of

the mine, the Company filed a petition with prayers

for direction, inter-alia, to permit utilization of 54.01

hectares of land required for the purpose of safety

and slope stability of the mine.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in its judgment

(December 2006), directed IIT Delhi to issue global

tender for, inter-alia, re-analyzing the stability

of slopes, drawing up of mine closure plan,

implementation of the above plan and drawing up

of detailed terms for the work to be done, consistent

with basic paradigm of “no or minimal disturbance

to un-broken area”.

The expenditure for this purpose was to be met

out of H 1,900 Lakhs paid by the company before

closure of mining i.e. 31st December, 2005, which

is presently lying with the adhoc Compensatory

Afforestation Fund Management and Planning

Authority (CAMPA).

The Hon’ble Supreme Court has also directed that if

any funds are required in excess of H 1,900 Lakhs, the

agency or the designated officer shall move to the

Court for necessary direction.

Ministry of Mines Government of India, vide: letter dated 7th February, 2014, nominated the

Regional Controller of Mines, IBM Bangalore

as the ‘Designated Officer’ to take possession

of Kudremukh Iron Ore Mines. Accordingly, the

Company has handed over the possession of the

Kudremukh Iron Ore Mines on 3rd April, 2014 to the

Regional Controller of Mines, IBM Bangalore.

Subsequently, officials of IBM Bangalore and IIT,

Delhi inspected the mine site on 20th May, 2014, in

which IIT Delhi opined that, keeping in view of the

environment and safety concerns, the residual task

of mine closure is relatively minor as compared to

what was originally envisaged. Hence, the amount

of H 1,900 Lakhs paid by the company to Central

Empowered Committee (CEC) already lying with

the CAMPA would be utilized for restoration of

Kudremukh iron ore mine. In addition to above, the

Company has also made provision to the extent of

H 600 Lakhs during the FY 2003-04 to 2005-06.

28.3.4.

Total mining lease areas of 4,605.02 hectares of

land at Kudremukh include an extent of 1,220.03

hectares of government revenue land, apart from

forest land as well as the Company’s free hold land.

Regional Controller of Mines IBM, the designated

officer has taken over the entire mining lease area

on 3rd April, 2014 for carrying out the mine closure

activities in compliance with Hon’ble Supreme Court

orders dated 15th December, 2006. However, the

infrastructure and buildings located on Revenue

land and other lands being the property of the

Company shall continue to remain in their physical

possession till the cessation of mine closure

activities. Till the year 2013-14, the land records of

revenue land were in the name of the Company.

Meanwhile Government of Karnataka has changed

the revenue records removing the Company’s name.

Hence the Company was constrained to file a suit

before Civil Judge Court, Mudigere for an injunction

against Government and others, restraining them

from dispossessing the Company from the said

revenue land. The court heard the arguments and

passed an interim order on 5th November, 2013

restraining the defendants or anybody under them

from dispossessing the Company from the schedule

property (i.e. Revenue land) in any manner till the

disposal of the suit or till the modalities have been

worked out and implemented as directed by the

Hon’ble Supreme court. The suit was dismissed on

20th November, 2017.

Taking into consideration of taking over the entire

mining lease area of 4,605.02 hectors comprising forest

land, revenue land, Company’s own land and other

lands by the designated officer IBM for carrying out the

mine closure activities in the mine in compliance with

the Hon’ble Court’s direction, although their physical

possession held with the Company, the Company

depreciated all its township assets in full during the

year 2014-15 as a prudent measure.
