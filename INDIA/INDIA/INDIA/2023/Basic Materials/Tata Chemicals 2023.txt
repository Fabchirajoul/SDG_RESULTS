Dear Shareholders,

I hope you and your families are safe and

well and I thank you all for your enduring

trust in Tata Chemicals. In retrospect,

CY 2022 was the year of surprises and

challenges. At the start, impact of pandemic

seemed waning, however, geopolitical

conflict in Europe posed fresh challenges

of disrupted global supply chains,

unprecedented energy shock and sharp

increase in food & commodity prices. As a

result, inflationary stress slowed the global

economic growth from 6.1% in 2021 to

~3.2% in CY 2022 and is projected to further

decline to ~2.2% in CY 2023. Despite above

challenges, India emerged as one of the

fastest growing economies in CY 2022.

Tata Chemicals too faced a slew of

challenges across geographies. Our

businesses were also impacted by rising

energy cost, availability of feedstock,

shipping cost and availability of vessels

& containers across geographies. Agile

teamwork coupled with efficient operations

and resilient supply chain ensured seamless

supplies to our customers. As a result, we

delivered robust performance, with the

Company achieving consolidated revenue

of ₹ 16,789 Crore, an increase of 33% over

FY 2021-22, EBITDA of ₹ 3,822 Crore, an

increase of 66% over FY 2021-22.

The Basic Chemistry portfolio led by

Soda Ash grew by 35% on the back of

robust demand across geographies and

application sectors including demand

from solar glass and lithium carbonate.

Salt and Sodium Bicarbonate also

witnessed steady demand. The Company

recorded its highest ever sales of salt

at 16.28 Lakh MT. With commissioning

of carbon capture utilisation plant, UK

is now producing high grade Sodium

Bicarbonate with own CO2 and has also

reduced process emissions by 10%, also

making it a circular process.

We are pivoting towards sustainable

applications and green chemistries for

growth. Our core portfolio led by Soda Ash

and Sodium Bicarbonate is growing on

drivers linked to sustainability applications

i.e. Solar Glass, Lithium Carbonate, Flue Gas

treatment, sustainable packaging, etc. It

is our ambition to lead in this business by

increasing our Soda Ash, Bicarb and Salt

capacities substantially in the medium term

of 3 to 5 years.

The Specialty Products revenue grew by

13% in FY 2022-23. Rallis' business grew by

14% in a challenging business environment,

however, margins were affected due to

steep cost volatility and price pressures

mainly in exports business. Rallis has set its

ambition to emerge as partner of choice

to Indian farmers by deeper engagement

with Agri-Ecosystem. Specialty Silica

sales grew by ~69% driven by emerging

applications, such as green tyres, silicones

and battery separators. Prebiotics developed

on a sustainable fermentation platform,

also improved its capacity utilisation.

The Specialty Products businesses need

continued support and they have potential

to deliver sustained growth.

In addition, our growth plans embrace and

embed data and digital tools & platforms

to truly become a connected integrated

agile Enterprise. This will further drive

performance excellence and stakeholder

value creation.

Chemistry for Sustainable Growth

At Tata Chemicals, we strongly believe

that Chemistry has a key role in delivering

sustainability outcomes by producing

materials that are environmentally friendly

and energy efficient. Tata Chemicals'

transformation is aligned to Project

Aalingana, Tata Group’s flagship programme

having a vision for greener, sustainable

and equitable future for the planet. We are

embedding sustainability into our business

by focussing on three interconnected pillars

i.e. decarbonisation of our businesses;

circular economy approach and preserving

the natural environment.

Our decarbonisation strategy has four

elements: Low Carbon Fuel Switch,

Renewable Power, Energy Efficiency

and Carbon Capture & Utilization (CCU).

Successful commissioning of CCU plant by

Tata Chemicals UK is one such step. Our US

operations will gradually increase the share

of Natural Gas. Our Mithapur manufacturing

complex is already freshwater neutral. With

respect to biodiversity, we have planted

over ~2.2 Lakh saplings in our mangrove

plantation programme. We have also saved

more than 900 whale sharks till date under

whale shark conservation program. As a

responsible organisation, we have impacted

~2.6 Lakh people and we continue to work

towards enabling inclusive growth and

equitable development through our CSR

programmes which are focussed on creating

livelihood, promoting health & wellness.

On behalf of Tata Chemicals, I thank you all

for your continued support in our ongoing

journey of transformation to deliver

chemistry for sustainable growth.

strategy of the Company. The Board composition analysis

reflects in-depth understanding of the Company, including

its strategies, environment, operations, financial condition

and compliance requirements.

The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the profiles

including expert knowledge expected is communicated to

the appointee.

The list of core skills, expertise and competencies of the

Board of Directors as are required in the context of the

businesses and sectors applicable to the Company are

identified by the Board and are available with the Board. The

Directors have also reviewed the list of core skills, expertise

and competencies which were mapped against them.

The same is disclosed in the Corporate Governance Report

forming part of this Integrated Annual Report.

Scientific Advisory Board

The Board has constituted a Scientific Advisory Board

consisting of scientists with relevant domain expertise

under the Chairmanship of Dr. C. V. Natraj, Independent

Director of the Company with a view to synergise the

and the SEBI Listing Regulations. The same is available at

https://www.tatachemicals.com/criteriadetermining.pdf.

Board Evaluation

The Board has carried out the annual evaluation of its own

performance and that of its Committees and individual

Directors for the year pursuant to the provisions of the

Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations. The exercise of

performance evaluation was carried out electronically

confidentiality and accuracy.

The performance of the Board and individual Directors was

evaluated by the Board after seeking inputs from all the

Directors. The criteria for performance evaluation of the

Board included aspects such as Board composition and

structure, effectiveness of Board processes, contribution in

the long-term strategic planning, etc. The performance of

the Committees was evaluated by the Board after seeking

inputs from the Committee Members. The criteria for

performance evaluation are broadly based on the Guidance

Note issued by SEBI on Board Evaluation.

Integrated Annual Report 2022-23:

Managing Director and Chief Executive

Officer (who is the Company’s chief operating decision

maker) in deciding how to allocate resources and in

assessing performance.

The accounting policies adopted for segment reporting

are in conformity with the accounting policies of the

Company. Segment revenue, segment expenses,

segment assets and segment liabilities have been

identified to segments on the basis of their relationship

to the operating activities of the segment. Inter segment

revenue is accounted on the basis of transactions which

are primarily determined based on market / fair value

factors. Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities which

relate to the Company as a whole and are not allocable

to segments on a reasonable basis have been included

under ‘unallocated revenue / expenses / assets / liabilities’.

2.21 Income tax

Tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred

tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for

the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported

in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss because

it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable

or deductible in other years and it further excludes items

that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s

liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and

tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted

by the end of the reporting period.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset

when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the

recognised amounts and there is an intention to realise

the asset or to settle the liability on a net basis.

incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the

incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the

lease liability comprise the fixed payments, including

in-substance fixed payments and lease payments in an

optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably

certain to exercise an extension option;

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the

effective interest method.

The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use

assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have

a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value

assets. The Company recognises the lease payments

associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-

line basis over the lease term. The Company applied a

single discount rate to a portfolio of leases of similar

assets in similar economic environment with a similar

end date.

2.16 Employee benefits plans

Employee benefits consist of provident fund,

superannuation fund, gratuity fund, compensated

absences, long service awards, post-retirement medical

benefits, directors’ retirement obligations and family

benefit scheme.

2.16.1 Post-employment benefit plans

Defined contribution plans

Payments to a defined contribution retirement

benefit scheme for eligible employees in the

form of superannuation fund are charged as

an expense as they fall due. Such benefits are

classified as Defined Contribution Schemes as the

Company does not carry any further obligations,

apart from the contributions made.

Defined benefit plans

Contributions to a Provident Fund are made to

Tata Chemicals Limited Employees’ Provident

Fund Trust, administered by the Company, and

are charged to the Standalone Statement of

Profit and Loss as incurred. The Trust invests in

specific designated instruments as permitted by

Indian law. The remaining portion is contributed

to the government administered pension fund.

The Company is liable for the contribution and

any shortfall in interest between the amount

of interest realised by the investments and the

interest payable to members at the rate declared

by the Government of India in respect of the Trust

administered by the Company.

For defined benefit schemes in the form of

gratuity fund, provident fund, post-retirement

medical benefits, pension liabilities (including

directors’) and family benefit scheme, the cost

of providing benefits is actuarially determined

using the projected unit credit method, with

actuarial valuations being carried out at each

balance sheet date.

The retirement benefit obligation recognised

in the Standalone Balance Sheet represents the

present value of the defined benefit obligation

as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.

The present value of the said obligation is

determined by discounting the estimated

future cash outflows, using market yields of

government bonds of equivalent term and

currency to the liability.

The interest income / (expense) are calculated

by applying the discount rate to the net defined

benefit liability or asset. The net interest income

/ (expense) on the net defined benefit liability is

recognised in the Standalone Statement of Profit

and Loss.

Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains

and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if any),

are recognised immediately in the Standalone

Balance Sheet with a corresponding charge or

credit to retained earnings through OCI in the

period in which they occur. Remeasurements are

not reclassified to the Standalone Statement of

Profit and Loss in subsequent periods.

Changes in the present value of the defined

benefit obligation resulting from plan

amendments or curtailments are recognised

immediately in the Standalone Statement of

Profit and Loss as past service cost.

2.16.2 Short-term employee benefits

The short-term employee benefits expected to

be paid in exchange for the services rendered by

employees is recognised during the period when

the employee renders the service. These benefits

include compensated absences such as paid

Integrated Annual Report 2022-23:

letter of credit - as

and where considered necessary, setting appropriate credit terms and by setting and monitoring internal limits on exposure to

individual customers.

There is no substantial concentration of credit risk as the revenue and trade receivables from any of the single customer do not

exceed 10% of Company revenue and trade receivables, except as disclosed in note 35.1.

For certain other receivables, where recoveries are expected beyond twelve months of the balance sheet date, the time value

of money is appropriately considered in determining the carrying amount of such receivables.

Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances/investments with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Company’s

treasury risk management policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within limits

assigned to each counterparty. The limits are assigned based on corpus of investable surplus and corpus of the investment

avenue. The limits are set to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty’s

potential failure to make payments.

Financial guarantees

Financial guarantees disclosed in note 41.1(b) have been provided as corporate guarantees to financial institutions and banks

that have extended credit facilities to the Company's subsidiaries. In this regard, the Company does not foresee any significant

credit risk exposure.

Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market

prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and

commodity risk. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency

exchange rates, equity price fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Financial instruments affected by market risk

include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments, forex receivable, forex payables and derivative financial instruments.

Foreign currency risk management

Foreign exchange risk arises on future commercial transactions and on all recognised monetary assets and liabilities, which are

denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. The Company’s management has set a policy

wherein exposure is identified, a benchmark is set and monitored closely, and accordingly suitable hedges are undertaken. The

policy also includes mandatory initial hedging requirements for exposure above a threshold.

The Company's foreign currency exposure arises mainly from foreign exchange imports, exports and foreign currency borrowings,

primarily with respect to USD.

As at the end of the reporting period , the carrying amounts of the Company's foreign currency denominated monetary assets

and liabilities in respect of the primary foreign currency i.e. USD and derivative to hedge the exposure, are as follows:

Based on the movements in the foreign exchange rates historically and the prevailing market conditions as at the reporting date,

the Company's Management has concluded that the above mentioned rates used for sensitivity are reasonable benchmarks.

Equity price risk management

The Company's exposure to equity price risk arises from investment held by the Company and classified as FVTOCI. In general,

these investments are strategic investments and are not held for trading purposes. Reports on the equity portfolio are submitted

to the Company’s senior management on a regular basis.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The objective of

liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as and when required.

The Treasury Risk Management Policy includes an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the

short-term, medium-term and long term funding and cash management requirements. The Company manages the liquidity risk

by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast

and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Company invests its surplus

funds in bank fixed deposit and liquid schemes of mutual funds, which carry no/negligible mark to market risks.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements

1.

Corporate Information

Tata Chemicals Limited (the ‘Company’) is a public limited

company domiciled in India. Its shares are listed on two

stock exchanges in India; the Bombay Stock Exchange

(‘BSE’) and the National Stock Exchange (‘NSE’). The

Company and its subsidiaries (collectively the ‘Group’) is

a diversified business dealing in basic chemistry products

and specialty products. The Group also has interests in Joint

ventures and an associate.

The Group has a global presence with key subsidiaries in

United States of America (USA), United Kingdom (UK) and

Kenya that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of soda

ash, industrial salt and related products. The Group has a

subsidiary in India that is engaged in Speciality products.

2.

Summary of basis of compliance, basis

of preparation and presentation, critical

accounting estimates, assumptions and

judgements and significant accounting

policies

2.1 Basis of compliance

The Consolidated Financial Statements (‘CFS’) comply,

in all material aspects, with Indian Accounting

Standards (‘Ind AS’) notified under Section 133 of the

Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read with Rule 3 of

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015

and other relevant provisions of the Act.

2.2 Basis of preparation and presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been

prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain

financial instruments and defined benefit plans which

are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting

period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair

value of the consideration given in exchange for

goods and services. Fair value is the price that would

be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability

in an orderly transaction between market participants

at the measurement date.

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current

or noncurrent as per the Group’s normal operating

cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to

the Act.

2.3 Critical accounting estimates, assumptions

and judgements

The preparation of the CFS requires management

to make estimates, assumptions and judgments

that affect the reported balances of assets and

liabilities and disclosures as at the date of the

Consolidated Financial Statements and the

reported amounts of income and expense for the

periods presented.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based

on historical experience and other factors that are

considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ

from these estimates under different assumptions

and conditions.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed

on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting

estimates are recognised in the period in which

the estimates are revised and future periods

are affected.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant

risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying

values of assets and liabilities within the next financial

year are discussed below.

2.3.1 Impairment of goodwill, goodwill on consolidation

and other intangible assets

Goodwill and other Intangible assets are tested

for impairment at least on an annual basis or more

frequently, whenever circumstances indicate that

the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit

(‘CGU’) is less than its carrying value. The impairment

indicators, the estimation of expected future cash

flows and the determination of the fair value of

CGU require the Management to make significant

estimates, assumptions and judgments. These are

in respect of revenue growth rates and operating

margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,

relevant risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic

and market conditions, etc.

2.3.2 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities

Significant management judgment is required to

determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can

be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the

level of future taxable profits.

Integrated Annual Report 2022-23:

Managing Director and Chief

Executive Officer (who is the Group’s chief operating

decision maker) in deciding how to allocate resources

and in assessing performance.

The accounting policies adopted for segment

reporting are in conformity with the accounting

policies of the Group. Segment revenue, segment

expenses, segment assets and segment liabilities

have been identified to segments on the basis of their

relationship to the operating activities of the segment.

Inter segment revenue is accounted on the basis of

transactions which are primarily determined based on

market / fair value factors. Revenue, expenses, assets

and liabilities which relate to the Group as a whole

and are not allocable to segments on a reasonable

basis have been included under ‘unallocated revenue

/ expenses / assets / liabilities’.

2.25 Income tax

Tax expense for the year comprises current and

deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on

taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from

net profit as reported in the Statement of Profit and

Loss because it excludes items of income or expense

that are taxable or deductible in other years and it

further excludes items that are never taxable or

deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is

calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been

enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the

reporting period.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset

when there is a legally enforceable right to set off

the recognised amounts and there is an intention to

realise the asset or to settle the liability on a net basis.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or

recoverable on differences between the carrying

values of assets and liabilities in the financial

statements and the corresponding tax bases used in

the computation of taxable profit and is accounted

for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred

tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable

temporary differences arising between the tax base of

assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except

when the deferred income tax arises from the initial

recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction

that is not a business combination and affects neither

accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of

the transaction. In contrast, deferred tax assets are

only recognised to the extent that it is probable that

future taxable profits will be available against which

the temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed

at the end of each reporting period and reduced to

the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient

taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of

the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are

expected to apply in the period when the liability is

settled or the asset is realised based on the tax rates

and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially

enacted by the end of the reporting period. The

measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets

reflects the tax consequences that would follow from

the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of

the reporting period, to cover or settle the carrying

value of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to the

extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same

tax authority and there are legally enforceable rights

to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities

within that jurisdiction.

Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense

or income in the statement of Consolidated Statement

of Profit and Loss, except when they relate to items

credited or debited either in Other Comprehensive

Income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is

also recognised in OCI or directly in equity.

Deferred tax assets include a credit for the Minimum

Alternate Tax (‘MAT’) paid in accordance with the tax

laws, which is likely to give future economic benefits in

the form of availability of set off against future income

tax liability. MAT asset is recognised as deferred tax

assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the

asset can be measured reliably, and it is probable that

the future economic benefit associated with the asset

will be realised.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable

temporary differences associated with investments

in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures,

except where the Group is able to control the

reversal of the temporary difference and it is

probable that the temporary difference will

not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred

tax assets arising from deductible temporary

differences associated with such investments and

interests are only recognised to the extent that

it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable

profits against which to utilise the benefits of the

temporary differences and they are expected to

reverse in the foreseeable future.

2.26 Provisions and contingencies

A provision is recognised when the Group has a

present obligation as a result of past events and it is

probable that an outflow of resources will be required

to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable

estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are

determined based on best estimate required to settle

the obligation at the Balance Sheet date. When a

provision is measured using the cash flows estimated

to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount

is the present value of those cash flows (when the

effect of the time value of the money is material). The

increase in the provisions due to passage of time is

recognised as interest expense.

Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date

and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If

it is no longer probable that the outflow of resources

would be required to settle the obligation, the

provision is reversed.

Land rates Demand for ` 711 crore (KShs 11.48 Billion) (2022: ` 678 crore (KShs 10.28 Billion)

On May 3, 2019, the High Court delivered its judgement in respect of the petition against a demand for land rates

levied on the Subsidiary Company by the Kajiado County Government during the year. The Court’s judgment quashed

this demand in entirety. In its judgement, the court also ordered that both parties submit themselves to a consultation

process to be led by the Cabinet Secretary for Mining, supervised by the Court in order to agree on the acreage to which

land rates should be levied. Following the lapse of period for negotiations as directed by the High Court, the company

proceeded to the court of appeal to seek directions on the land rates and the Court of Appeal is yet to give a hearing

date. On February 20, 2023, the Kajiado County issued an adjusted demand of ` 711 crore (KShs 11.48 Billion) (2022:

` 678 crore (KShs 10.28 Billion) for outstanding land rates, which was objected to. The Subsidiary company has also

approached the Ministry of Mining to intervene and try to have the matter resolved. In the opinion of management,

after taking appropriate legal advice, the liability is not considered to be probable at this stage and hence it has been

disclosed as a contingent liability.

(c)

In respect of UK operations, there are certain ongoing claims from customers/vendors for potential non compliance with

contractual matters. In the opinion of management, after taking appropriate legal advice, the amounts are presently not

determinable and liability, if any, is not considered to be probable at this stage and hence these have been disclosed as a

contingent liability.

(d)

Rallis has taken four godowns on lease from Mumbai Port Authority (MbPA), erstwhile Bombay Port Trust and has received

demand notices from MbPA of ` 50 crore towards differential arrears of rentals for the period October, 2012 upto March,

2023 for these godowns. Based on the legal advice received by Rallis, the demand raised by MbPA is being contested

and a suitable reply has been filed.

(e)

Various claims pending before Industrial Tribunals and Labour Courts of which amounts are indeterminate.

** The Company has on-going disputes with income tax authorities mainly pertaining to disallowance of expenses and the

computation of, or eligibility of the Company’s availment of certain tax incentives or allowances. Most of these disputes

and/or disallowances are repetitive in nature spanning across multiple years. All the Tax demands are being contested by

the company.

@ Excise Duty cases include disputes pertaining to reversal of input tax credit on common input, refund of duty paid under

protest. Custom Duty cases include disputes pertaining to import of capital equipment against scripts, tariff classification

issues, denial of FTA benefit. VAT/CST/Entry Tax cases include disputes pertaining to Way Bill, reversal/disallowance of input

tax credit, pending declaration forms. All the Tax demands are being contested by the company.

It is not practicable for the Group to estimate the timings of cash outflows, if any, in respect of the above pending resolution

of the respective proceedings as it is determinable only on receipt of judgments/decisions pending with various forums/

authorities.

The Group has reviewed all its pending litigations and proceedings and has adequately provided for where provisions are

required and disclosed as contingent liabilities where applicable, in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
