Managing Director’s Message: Dear Stakeholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to share our performance for

the year gone by and our aspirations for the journey ahead.

The previous year was no walk in the park. We faced

rising energy prices, inflation, and a challenging business

environment. Global economic challenges, including the

aftermath of the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and

supply-side shocks, made things even more complicated.

Despite all these hurdles, the Indian economy has steadily

recovered. India’s GDP grew by a strong 7.2% in FY23,

setting the stage for a return to pre-pandemic growth levels.

This growth story is nothing short of incredible, with India’s

manufacturing prowess gaining global recognition and a

shift in the supply chain in our favour.

Industry Embarking on a Golden Decade of Growth and

Dominance

Over the past decade, the speciality chemical industry has

experienced exponential growth. It’s a crucial contributor

to initiatives like Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat

Abhiyaan, positioning itself as a significant player on the

global stage. With rapid economic growth, an expanding

working class populace, rising incomes, strong talent pool

and lower skilled-labour costs, India has the potential to

become a key player in the global chemicals industry. As

global companies seek to diversify their supply chains,

India’s compelling value proposition and changing

geopolitical landscape make it an attractive destination.

The sector is becoming a reliable supplier for global

companies looking to de-risk their operations through a

China+1 and Europe+1 strategy. The speciality chemicals

segment in India is performing robustly with strong market

attractiveness and projected significant long-term growth

rates. With favourable policy reforms expected to stimulate

demand for various chemicals, the industry will benefit

from India’s strong macroeconomic indicators and crucial

role in building blocks and raw materials for major sectors.

This truly seems like the ‘Golden Decade’ for the Indian

chemicals industry.
