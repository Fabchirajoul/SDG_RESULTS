Mumbai, 8th May, 2023

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT UNDER SECTION 102 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013:

Managing Director, the

organisation took an approach to create a work environment

that considers and fulfils the needs of one of the organisation’s

most important assets, its employees. The underlying belief

is that success of the organisation is strongly connected

with its employees’ well-being and growth. The approach

revolved around creating a culture of openness, collaboration

and empowerment. Special efforts were made for employee

well-being, training and development and ensuring high

engagement levels. Employee surveys conducted at the

start and end of the year reflected a clear positive shift in

organisation culture regarding openness and empowerment.

Innovation, Collaboration, Empowerment

Innovation, Collaboration and Empowerment were key thrust

areas for the Company. During the year, we had multiple

innovation drives, wherein, employees participated across

the organisation to generate ideas that will bring value to

the organisation. We had atleast 3 such innovation drives

with more than 500 idea submissions by employees across

functions and levels. The ideas ranged across diverse areas

such as topline growth, improving bottom line, operational

efficiency, and sustainability. These ideas were reviewed by

a cross-functional team, wherein, ideas were evaluated basis

of a set of criteria, including benefits envisaged, uniqueness,

feasibility and resources required for implementation. This

multi-disciplinary approach and teamwork ensured a

collaborative approach and alignment across functions.

There was positive interdependence created during

collaboration and it also opened up hidden opportunities

or challenges.

During the year, several important projects of strategic nature

were given to employees. The approach was to empower

employees with delegation, autonomy, key decision making

and provided required resources. During the process, both

the individual employee as well as the team of employees

had an experience which capitalised on their expertise

and judgement, increasing their sense of commitment to

the organisation and aiding them to feel empowered and

motivated.
