letter.

Often times, it so happens that the community representatives register the grievance with the local district

administration and the latter then forwards it to the site BU. In such a case, the grievance shall be registered

duly in the GRR.

Mechanism to operationalise the system is as follows:

1.

The person in custody of the grievance register will make an entry as soon as the grievance is received.

(Turn Around Time – 2 days)

2.

The CSR in-charge at site will regularly monitor the register and will lead the efforts to find an amicable

resolve to the grievance registered. (Turn Around Time – 1 year)

3.

Any new grievances registered shall be scrutinised and prioritised by the site CSR Head and the important

ones (those that may impact the business operations or those matters that are deemed genuinely important

by the site CSR Head) shall be promptly brought to the notice of site BU Head. (Turn Around Time –

Immediately)

4.

Once the grievance is addressed adequately, the same shall be marked completed in the GRR.

5.

A summary report of the grievances received and tackled shall be reported to AF HO on a quarterly basis
