Message from the: Managing

Managing Director

Dear esteemed stakeholders,

I am delighted to reach out to you once

again, reflecting upon a year filled with

challenges and uncertainty on a global

scale. As I present the Integrated Annual

Report 2022-23, I take pride in showcasing

how JSP has adeptly manoeuvred through

this evolving landscape, wholeheartedly

reinforcing our mission of ‘Building

Nations, Empowering Communities.’ This

comprehensive report offers an insightful

account of our achievements and highlights

our efforts in creating a positive impact in

the world we serve.

I am proud to present our success in

de-leveraging our balance sheet while

maintaining our focus on investments to

build a stronger future.

IN TUNE WITH A DIFFERENT

DRUMBEAT

In FY 2022-23, India moved to a different

drumbeat compared to the rest of the

world. India achieved a remarkable growth

rate of 7.2% in FY 2022-23 compared to

the world GDP growth rate of 3.1%. With

a projected GDP growth of over 6% in the

coming years, India is poised to embark on a

new phase of expansion.

Post pandemic, India continued to have

a fundamentally sound growth story,

underpinned by robust private

consumption and strong government

investment.

From the perspective of the steel industry,

India is a bright spot for global demand

and supply. It stood out as the only major

economy to experience robust growth in

steel demand during the year. Moreover,

India retained its position as the second-

largest producer of steel in the world, with

crude steel production of 125.32 MMT

in 2022.

Looking towards the future, India’s domestic

steel demand is projected to reach 128.85

million metric tonnes in FY 2023-24,

presenting an opportunity for us to create

value for our stakeholders.

Aligned with India’s growth aspirations,

we have made significant investments to

expand our production capacity. During the

year, we made significant progress in

phase 1 of Angul’s expansion. To usher in

a new era of growth, we have allocated

substantial investments towards projects

focussed on extending our product

portfolio to cover flat products and

downstream value addition.

THE YEAR GONE BY

We maintained our position as the leader

in providing the most extensive range

of products for the infrastructure and

construction industry in India.

We successfully increased our crude

production to 7.89 MT and achieved a sales

volume of 7.68 MT during the year.

In FY 2022-23, we achieved a consolidated

gross revenue of H60,505 crore, representing

a 6% year-on-year growth compared

to the previous year’s H56,841 crore. Our

performance resulted in an adjusted EBITDA

of H9,700 crore and a PAT of H3,193 crore for

FY 2022-23. Demonstrating our dedication

to shareholder value, we have announced a

dividend of H2 per share.

We continued on our journey to

strengthen our balance sheet and

reduced our net debt to H6,953 crore

in FY 2022-23 from a level of H8,876

crore. This strategic focus positions

us to make confident investments

in expanding our capacities. We are

determined to realise our vision of

transforming Angul into the largest and

greenest steel plant in the world.

We made significant progress in fulfilling

our commitment to backward and forward

integration. In FY 2022-23, we achieved a

major milestone by securing three new

non-coking coal mines (Utkal B1, B2, and C

in Odisha, Gare Palma IV/6 in Chhattisgarh),

which are set to commence operations

in FY 2023-24.

These mines provide us with a significant

competitive advantage. As we ramp up

our operations, we anticipate meeting our

entire thermal coal requirements from these

mines when they reach their peak capacity.

This achievement not only strengthens our

self-reliance but also ensures a reliable and

cost-effective supply of key raw materials for

our operations.

SAFETY ABOVE ALL

At JSP, safety is one of our foremost areas

of priority. This encompasses not only

limiting physical risks but also placing equal

emphasis on cultivating the right attitudes

for a strong safety culture.

We have implemented stringent measures

to safeguard the well-being of our

employees and stakeholders alike. Our

commitment extends to developing and

implementing world-class safety standards

across all our locations, with the goal of

achieving a ‘Zero Harm’ workplace.

THE PURSUIT OF NEAR ZERO STEEL

JSP has consistently taken the lead in

nation-building throughout its rich

history. We are the first company in India

to build a coal gasification plant and the

first in the world to produce DRI/Steel

via the coal gasification process at scale.

Decarbonisation and responsibility towards

the environment is at the core of our

thinking and future investments. We are

committed to bringing near zero carbon

steel to build our nation.

ENVISIONING TOMORROW

As we forge ahead into the future, guided

by our newly articulated mission, vision,

and core values, I am confident that we will

renew our commitment to nation-building

and establish new standards of success for

both our organisation and the communities

we are dedicated to serving. Together, we

shall forge a path toward a more prosperous

and sustainable future.

75% of the new India is yet to be built. With

rising infrastructure projects, urbanisation

and government initiatives such as Gati-

Shakti, I am confident that JSP will not

only thrive but also embark on a new era

of growth.

In closing, I extend my sincere thanks to

JSP team for their dedication and pursuit

of excellence. I also express my heartfelt

gratitude to the Board of Directors for

their continued guidance. Finally, I would

also like to extend my gratitude to all our

stakeholders for their support over many

years and hope for their continued support

in our journey to take the Company to

greater heights.

Stay safe, stay healthy.

REPORT ON THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING UNDER CLAUSE (I) OF SUB-SECTION 3

OF SECTION 143 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 (“THE ACT”)

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting

of JINDAL STEEL & POWER LIMITED (“the Company”) as of 31st

March 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial

statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL

FINANCIAL CONTROLS

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and

maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control

over financial reporting criteria established by the Company

considering the essential components of internal control stated

in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants

of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation

and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were

operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct

of its business, including adherence to respective company’s policies,

the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds

and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,

and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required

under the Companies Act, 2013.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal

financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We

conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit

of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance

Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and

the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the

Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal

financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require

that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform

the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate

internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and

maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material

respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence

about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over

financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of

internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining

an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting,

assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and

evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control

based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the

auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material

misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and

appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s

internal financial controls system over financial reporting.

MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a

process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial

statements for external purposes in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control

over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that

(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,

accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of

the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of

financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting

principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are

being made only in accordance with authorisations of management

and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance

regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition,

use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material

effect on the financial statements.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL

CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over

financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper

management override of controls, material misstatements due to

error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any

evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to

future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control

over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes

in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or

procedures may deteriorate.

OPINION

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate

internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such

internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating

effectively as at 31st March, 2023, based on the internal control over

financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering

the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance

Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

India’s leading steel producers. It is listed on the National Stock

Exchange of India and Bombay Stock Exchange in India. The

registered office is situated in the state of Haryana, the corporate

The Company has global presence through subsidiaries, mainly

There are several business initiatives running simultaneously

across continents.

These financial statements have been approved and adopted

by the Board of Directors of the Company in their meeting held

on 16th May,2023.

2.

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance

with Indian accounting standards as prescribed under Section

133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the 'Act') read with Companies

(Accounts) Rules, 2015 (Indian Accounting Standards (IND AS)).

The Company has consistently applied the accounting policies

used in the preparation of its financial statements.

The standalone financial statements provide comparative

information in respect of previous year.

The significant accounting policies used in preparing the

financial statements are set out in Note no. 3 of the Notes to the

Standalone Financial Statements.

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with

Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) requires management

to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect

the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and

liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures at the date of the

financial statements. The judgments, estimates and underlying

assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to

accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the

estimate is revised if the revision effects only that period or in the

period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects

both current and future years and, if material, their effects are

disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Actual results

could vary from these estimates. (Refer Note no. 4 on critical

accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments).

3.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

3.1 Basis of Measurement

These financial statements have been prepared under the historical

cost convention on the accrual basis, except for the following

assets and liabilities which have been measured fair value:

• Property, Plant & Equipment (at fair value as deemed cost as

at 1st April 2015),

• Derivative financial instruments,

• Defined benefit plans- plan assets measured at fair value

• Financial assets and liabilities except certain investments and

borrowings carried at amortised cost (refer accounting policy

regarding financial instruments).

• Share based payments

The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (H) which

is the Company’s functional and presentation currency and all

amounts are rounded to the nearest crore (H 00,00,000) and two

decimals thereof, except as otherwise stated.

3.2 Fair Value Measurement

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset

or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between

market participants at the measurement date.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the

assumptions that market participants would use when pricing

the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their

economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non- financial asset takes into

account a market participant’s ability to generate economic

benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by

selling it to another market participant that would use the asset

in its highest and best use.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has

determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the

nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the

level of the fair value hierarchy in which they fall.

3.3 Property, plant and equipment

On transition to IND AS, the Company has adopted optional

exception under IND AS 101 to measure Property, Plant and

Equipment at fair value. Consequently the fair value has been

assumed to be deemed cost of Property, Plant and Equipment

on the date of transition. Subsequently Property, Plant and

Equipment are stated at cost/ deemed cost less accumulated

depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Costs include costs of

acquisition or construction including incidental expenses thereto,

borrowing costs, and other attributable costs of bringing the

asset to its working condition for its intended use and are net of

available duty/tax credits.

Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and

equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future

economic benefits associated with these will flow to the

Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All

other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in Statement

of Profit & Loss as incurred.

Gains or losses arising from discard/sale of Property, Plant and

Equipment are measured as the difference between the net

disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and

are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the asset

is discarded / sold.

The Company adjusts exchange differences arising on translation/

settlement of long-term foreign currency monetary items as

referred in Policy for Foreign exchange transactions.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of

property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial

year end and adjusted prospectively.

Capital work-in-progress: Expenditure related to and incurred

on implementation of new/expansion-cum-modernisation

projects is included under capital work-in-progress until

the relevant assets are ready for its intended use. All other
