Dear Stakeholders,

CPIL as a market leader in India’s wood products industry constantly analyses and forecasts trends to stay ahead of the curve.

The Company aligns its production with the evolving consumer demand and expectations. While doing so, CPIL recognizes

the need for eco-friendly alternatives and has focused on producing sustainable products that meet the international standard

requirements. Currently, the Company sources about ~98% of its timber requirements through plantation activities by

providing local farmers around its manufacturing facilities with subsidized saplings of plant varieties like eucalyptus and other

trees around their field. Furthermore, CPIL is committed to optimize the use of alternative raw materials, limit non-renewable

energy consumption, streamline its supply chain and focus on sustainable methods of distribution and transportation. It is

dedicated to meeting and exceeding the expectations of the customers and forging strong partnerships through excellent

customer service, constant innovation, and embracing industry megatrends.

At CPIL, accountability and transparency are prioritised, and the Company has implemented various measures to ensure its

conduct aligns with industry best practices. CPIL is delighted to announce about publishing its first Business Responsibility

Report in accordance with SEBI’s prescribed framework. Through this report, the stakeholders will have a better insight into

the Company’s commitment to developing long-term value for stakeholders and incorporating ESG into every facet of CPIL’s

overall business approach.

The organization’s environmental responsibilities encompass the responsible usage of natural resources like fossil fuels,

appropriate wastewater treatment, responsible waste management and such other measures to tackle the effects of climate

change.

On the social front, CPIL prioritizes investment in employees, vendors, customers, and communities. The Company’s intranet

portal ‘Centurion’ continues to serve as an interactive platform, bringing employees together and closer to the management

besides keeping them informed of the activities of the Company. Besides this, the ‘Centurion Helpdesk’, a WhatsApp group,

also facilitates the time-bound resolution of employee grievances.

The wood products industry faces several challenges including rising costs of raw materials, energy and transportation as well

as increasing competition in the market. However, CPIL is committed to addressing these challenges and remains focused on

continuous improvement with respect to environmental and social impacts due to business activities. To leverage its sustainable

practices, CPIL aims to ensure 100% procurement of timber through agroforestry, partnering with local farmers and providing

training for sustainable practices. Furthermore, CPIL has successfully reduced its coal consumption in operations by nearly 6%

(YoY) through its substitution with biomass fuel, against an average 15% increase in the company’s production volume. CPIL

endeavours to continue building its renewable energy profile and reducing carbon footprint by implementing various energy

efficient equipment and practices across all operations. Further, the Company believes in sustainable business practices for

long-term success and plans to invest in research and development for innovative solutions to the challenges faced.

CPIL conveys its deepest appreciation to all its stakeholders for their unwavering support and confidence in the company’s

efforts as it encourages the company to keep striving for business excellence. Being driven to accelerate its efforts to emerge

as a sustainability leader, CPIL looks forward to your continued appreciation and support for the future.

SUCCESSION PLANNING

Essentially, succession planning is a conscious decision by an

organisation to foster and promote the continual development

of employees and ensure that key positions maintain some

measure of stability, thus enabling the organisation to achieve

business objectives. Succession Planning is a win-win solution

for both, employers and employees. At Centuryply, we help

the employees to grow their potential through job shadowing

and creating a future-ready workforce for the Company. In

terms of Regulation 17(4) of the Listing Regulations, the

Nomination and Remuneration Committee works with the

Board on the leadership succession plan for orderly succession

in the appointments of the Board of Directors and Senior

Management. By integrating workforce planning with strategic

business planning, the Company deploys necessary financial

and human resources to meet its objectives. Succession

planning and elevation within the organization, fuel the

ambitions of its talent force, to earn future leadership roles. A

well-defined succession planning ensures that attrition does

not impact operations. Your Company believes that an orderly

succession plan is a means to pave way for the young talent to

learn, implement and grow on an accelerated basis.

As the Company move through various stages of life cycle

and build growth strategies to deal with changing business

environments, the issue of leadership becomes critical and with

it, the related issue of succession. The succession strategy of

your Company essentially look ahead and plan appropriately to

ensure that there is continuity and the right kind of leadership

in the business, both at executive and Board level through a

process of proper identification and nurturing of individuals for

taking over senior management positions.

Designated Persons and their immediate relatives towards

achieving compliance with the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider

Trading) Regulations, 2015 and is designed to maintain the

highest ethical standards of trading in Securities of the Company

Guidelines, which advises them on procedures to be followed

and disclosures to be made, while dealing with securities of the

Company and cautions them of the consequences of violations.

Company operate.

t.

Provisions (other than employee benefits)

Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is

probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable

estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are

discounted at a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase

in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate

asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the

statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.

u. Contingent Liabilities

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the

occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present

obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the

obligation. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements.

2.3 Measurement of fair value

a.

Financial instruments - The estimated fair value of the Company’s financial instruments is based on market prices

and valuation techniques. Valuations are made with the objective to include relevant factors that market participants

would consider in setting a price, and to apply accepted economic and financial methodologies for the pricing of financial

instruments. References for less active markets are carefully reviewed to establish relevant and comparable data.

b.

Marketable and non-marketable equity securities - Fair value for listed shares is based on quoted market prices as of

the reporting date. Fair value for unlisted shares is calculated based on commonly accepted valuation techniques utilizing

significant unobservable data, primarily cash flow based models. If fair value cannot be measured reliably unlisted shares

are recognized at cost.

c.

Derivatives - Fair value of financial derivatives is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, calculated by

reference to quoted price curves and exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Options are valued using appropriate

option pricing models and credit spreads are applied where deemed to be significant
