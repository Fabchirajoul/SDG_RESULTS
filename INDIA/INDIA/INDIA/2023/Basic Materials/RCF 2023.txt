COMPANY SECRETARY

WHOLE TIME DIRECTORS:

Dear Shareholders,

I am happy to share that Government of India has granted

the NAVRATNA Status to Rashtriya Chemicals and

Fertilizers Limited on August 29, 2023. RCF is the first PSU

in fertilizer sector to be elevated to NAVRATNA Category.

This recognition is a testament to RCF team’s (Past &

present) dedication and commitment to the chemicals &

fertilizers Sector. With the coveted NAVRATNA Status, RCF

further commits itself towards playing a more decisive and

significant role in our country’s growth and prosperity. I wish

you all the best and congratulate all stakeholders of the

Company for their unwavering support and sincere efforts in

achieving the NAVRATNA Status.

It gives me immense pleasure to present the 45th Annual

Report on the performance of your Company for the year

2022-23.

India remains to be one of the fastest growing economies

in the world in 2022-23. The growth figures are, in part,

attributed to the performance of agriculture and allied

activities surpassing the growth levels of pandemic years.

The buoyant performance of the Indian agriculture sector

could be ascribed to the sustained and timely measures

taken by the Central and State Governments to ensure that

there was no interruption in any of the agriculture related

activities. This ensured food security not just for India but

also for other countries impacted by the pandemic and

geopolitical conditions. In recent years, the country has

emerged as one of the major exporters of agricultural

products with rising share in overall exports since 2019-20

Overview of the Economy

India’s GDP growth accelerated to 6.1% in the January to

March 2023 quarter, lifting the economy’s uptick in 2022-

23 to 7.2% from the 7% estimated earlier, according to the

provisional national income data released by the National

Statistical Office (NSO).

The outlook for Indian macroeconomic and corporate

performance remains positive, with stronger GDP growth

and a notable moderation in inflation. This puts us in a

favourable position compared to many struggling global

economies facing low economic growth and high inflation.

This year, weak El Nino conditions emerged in May. However,

normal rainfall at 96% of the long-term average is forecasted

by the Indian Meteorological Department.

The perceived risk of a global economic slowdown also

poses challenges for India. India is witnessing weakening of

operating performance in export-oriented sectors like textiles

and gems & jewellery. However, the negative impact at an

overall economic level is likely to be mitigated by declining

import volumes , primarily due to lower oil prices that have

decreased by 37% over the last 12 months.

The ongoing Russia- Ukraine conflict presents the most

challenging variable. While 2022-23 saw sharp rise in

commodity prices due to disruptions in energy supply chains,

a new order seems to have settled in 2023-24, supported

by mild winters in Europe and slowing Western economies.

However, the risk lies in any unexpected escalation, which

could have severe economic and strategic disruptions.

India’s GDP 2023-24 growth is projected at 6.5% for 2023-

24, driven by domestic consumption, government capex, and

to some extent, private capex.

Overview of the Fertilizer Industry

Overall fertilizers production has increased by 11.23%

during financial year 2022-23 as against financial year

2021-22 due to increase in production of Urea, NPK, DAP &

SSP. Imports have increased by 3.03% due to the increase in

DAP & NPK imports.

Production of urea has increased by 13.63% during

the financial year 2022-23 as against 2021-22 due to

favourable weather and market conditions. Urea is largely

sourced domestically & with revival of urea plants, imports

have decreased by 17.03% during the year 2022-23.

Domestic DAP production increased by 2.96% during

financial year 2022-23 as against financial year 2021-22.

Imports also have risen by 20.52% in financial year 2022-23

as against financial year 2021-22.:

Compliance/ Action Taken

1.

Revenue from operation included an additional incentive of ` 50 per MT for

acknowledging receipt and reporting the stock in MFMS which was not being

passed on to the retailer by RCF citing OM no 14011/44/2017 DBT dated

18.05.2018. Clarification regarding non-payment of incentive of ` 50 per

month to the retailers perpetually on account of adjustment of expenditure

on PoS machine as per OM dated 18.05.18 needs to be obtained from the

ministry to ensure correct booking of revenue from operation.

The Company has replied that accounting

is in Order. However, this being an

interpretation

issue,

the

Company

had given an assurance to audit that

that they shall seek clarification in this

regard. Accordingly, the Company has

approached the Department of Fertilizer

(“the DOF”) for seeking a clarification on

the said matter.

However, clarification is still awaited from

the DOF.

2.

O.M No 10212/20/2007-FPP dated 04.09.2017 stipulated charging of 5% on

MRP by the Urea manufacturers for Neem coating on every 45 kg bag with

no change in existing MRP of Urea i.e ` 5360per MT. RCFs contention that

MRP for urea was subsequently fixed at ` 242 per 45 kg bag needs to be

clarified by the Ministry to clear the ambiguity in interpretation of O M dated

04.09.2017and ensuring the correct booking of Revenue from operation.

The Company had given an assurance

that they shall also seek clarification from

DOF for said matter. Accordingly, the

matter has been taken up with the DOF

for seeking a clarification in this regard.

However, clarification is still awaited from

the DOF.

3.

Subsidy income should have been calculated based on annual average

water charges for the year claimed in the Annual Escalation Claim submitted

to FICC for the financial year instead of calculating on the basis of water

charges allowed in the retention price notified.

The Company has complied with the audit

observations.

4.

Rent received from investment property should have been shown as cash

flow from investing activities instead of cash flow from operating activities.

The Company has complied with the audit

observation.

5.

Company needs to adopt a unified estimated useful life policy for same type

of asset class.

The Company has complied with the audit

observation.

6.

Along with value and quantity of Carbon Emission Certificates (CER) and

Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) disclosed, for better understanding RCF

Nature and purpose of reserves

a.

General Reserve: General reserve represents appropriation of profits. This represents a free reserve and is available for dividend

distributions. As the general reserve is created by a transfer from one component of equity to another and is not an item of other

comprehensive income, items included in the general reserve will not be reclassified subsequently to the statement of profit and loss.

b.

Retained Earnings: Retained earnings are the profits that the Company has earned till date, less any transfers to general reserve,

dividends or other distributions paid to shareholders.

c.

Equity Instruments through Other Comprehensive Income Reserve: This reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses arising on

the revaluation of equity and debt instruments on the balance sheet date measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.

The reserves accumulated will be reclassified to retained earnings and profit and loss respectively, when such instruments are disposed.:
