Managing Director, for whom, also, necessary provision is made based on an actuarial

valuation.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation

and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Statement of Profit and

Loss.

Re-measurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are

recognized in the period in which they occur, directly in OCI. They are included in “Retained Earnings” in the

“Statement of Changes in Equity” and in the Balance Sheet.

Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, resulting from plan amendments or curtailments,

are recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss, as past service cost.

(b) Defined contribution plans such as provident fund: The Company pays provident fund contributions to publicly

administered provident funds as per local regulations. The Company has no further payment obligations once

the contributions have been paid. The contributions are accounted for as defined contribution plans and the

contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized

as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

(iv) Share based payment transactions:

Employee Stock Option Plans (“ESOPs”):

The fair value of options determined at the grant date is recognized as an employee expense on a straight line basis

(on the basis of multiple vesting of options granted), with a corresponding increase in “Other Equity” under “Employee

Stock Options Outstanding account”, over the vesting period of the grant, where the employee becomes unconditionally

entitled to the options. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity

instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement

of Profit and Loss, such that the cumulative expenses reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment

to the “Employee Stock Options Outstanding account”.

Stock Options are granted to eligible employees in accordance with “Alkyl Amines Employees Stock Option Plan”

(ESOPs 2018), as approved by the Shareholders and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board of

Directors (the Committee) in accordance with the SEBI (Share based employee benefits) Regulations, 2014.

Eligible employees for this purpose includes employees falling under the following schemes:

Plan A : Rewards ESOPs (based on past performance)

Plan B : Retention ESOPs (based on future performance)

Under Ind AS 102 on Share based Payment, the cost of stock options is recognised based on the fair value of stock

options as on the grant date (refer note 37B).
