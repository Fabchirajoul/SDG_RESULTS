Original title deed is not

in the possession of the

Company; certified true copy

of the deed is available.

(d) The Company has not revalued its property, plant and

equipment (including Right-of-use assets) or intangible

assets or both during the year. Consequently, as stated

in Note 38 to the Standalone Financial Statements, the

question of our commenting on whether the revaluation

is based on the valuation by a Registered Valuer, or

specifying the amount of change, if the change is 10%

or more in the aggregate of the net carrying value of

each class of Property, plant and equipment (including

Right-of-use assets) or Intangible assets does not arise.

(e) Based on the information and explanations furnished

to us, as stated in Note 38 to the Standalone Financial

Statements, no proceedings have been initiated on or

are pending against the Company for holding benami

property under the Prohibition of Benami Property

Transactions Act, 1988 (as amended in 2016) (formerly

the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 (45 of

1988)) and Rules made thereunder, and therefore the

question of our commenting on whether the Company

has appropriately disclosed the details in its Standalone

Financial Statements does not arise.

ii.

(a) The physical verification of inventory (excluding stocks

with third parties) and goods in transit has been

conducted at reasonable intervals by the management

during the year and, in our opinion, the coverage

and procedure of such verification by management

is appropriate. In respect of inventory lying with third

parties, these have substantially been confirmed by them

and for goods in transit, the goods have been received

subsequent to the year end in most of the cases. The

discrepancies noticed on physical verification of inventory

as compared to book records were not 10% or more in

aggregate for each class of inventory.

(b) During the year, the Company has not been sanctioned

working capital limits in excess of Rs. 5 crores, in

aggregate from banks and financial institutions on the

basis of security of current assets and accordingly, the

question of our commenting on whether the quarterly

returns or statements are in agreement with the unaudited

books of account of the Company does not arise. Also

refer Note 38 to the Standalone Financial Statements.

iii.

(a) The Company has granted unsecured loans to few

employees. The aggregate amount during the year,

and balance outstanding at the balance sheet date

with respect to such loans to parties other than the

subsidiary are as per the table given below:

Managing Director, Chief

Financial Officer, Head HR, Company Secretary) which

has been identified as the chief operating decision maker

(CODM), to assess the financial performance and position of

the Group and make strategic decisions. Refer note 33 for

reportable segments determined by the Group.

s)

Leases

As a lessee

Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a

corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset

is available for use by the Group. Contracts may contain

both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates

the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease

components based on their relative stand-alone prices.

However, for leases of real estate for which the Group is a

lessee, it has elected not to separate lease and non-lease

components and instead accounts for these as a single

lease component.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially

measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include

the net present value of the following lease payments:

a.

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments),

less any lease incentives receivable

b.

variable lease payments that are based on an index or a

rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the

commencement date

c.

amounts expected to be payable by the Group under

residual value guarantees

d.

the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is

reasonably certain to exercise that option and

e.

payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the

lease term reflects the Group exercising that option

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain

extension options are also included in the measurement

of the liability. The lease payments are discounted using

the interest rate implicit in the lease. If the rate cannot be

readily determined, which is generally the case for leases

in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is

used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have

to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of

similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic

environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group

obtains the general purpose borrowing rates and makes

necessary adjustments specific to the lease e.g. lease term,

security etc.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance

cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the

lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of

interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each

period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the

following:

a.

the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability

b.

any lease payments made at or before the

commencement date less any lease incentives received

c.

any initial direct costs, and

d.

restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the

shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on

straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to

exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is

depreciated over the underlying assets useful life.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment

and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a

straight-line basis as an expense in the Statement of Profit
