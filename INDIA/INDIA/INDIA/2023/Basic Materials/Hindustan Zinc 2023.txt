Dear Stakeholders,

I would like to first thank the Board and the shareholders of the Company for reposing their trust in me

for steering Hindustan Zinc as its new Chairperson. This is indeed an honour, and I hope, together we

will be able to work towards achieving our ambitious goals, in line with the landmark accomplishments

of my predecessor Ms. Kiran Agarwal.

Hindustan Zinc is a shining beacon in the Group’s portfolio. Since assuming the role of Chairperson,

I have witnessed the organisation achieve many milestones. Not only did Hindustan Zinc remain

on course to realise its goals, but also stayed ahead of the market curve to deliver an excellent

performance during the year.

Setting New Records of Excellence

It gives me immense pleasure to share that we reported yet

another record-breaking annual performance, with historic

highs in terms of revenue, EBITDA, net profit and cash flow

generation during the year. Technology and digitisation

have been key in boosting operational efficiencies,

while enabling continual volume enhancement and cost

optimisation through agile decision-making.

Committed to People Safety

I also want to take this opportunity to thank our stellar team

for their dedication, hard work and for their belief in our

ambitious goals. I am confident that together we can scale

unfathomable heights.

I would like to reiterate our commitment to people safety

by implementing all possible measures to identify gaps and

ensure zero fatalities across all our facilities. I would like to

assure you all that we shall continue to leverage the power

of automation and technology to enhance employee safety

across all our operations.

Promoting Diversity to Drive Inclusive Growth

In an endeavour to ensure inclusivity and promote diversity,

we have developed a robust recruitment strategy and we

encourage our business partners to have a diverse and

inclusive workforce. I am pleased to share that across the

Company, as many as 501 women employees, including

146 women engineers, are breaking the glass ceiling in

mining and smelting operations. At Hindustan Zinc, women

are working and flourishing in all the key functions, from

driving large mining vehicles to operating plants and

working in nightshifts – and we are all proud of them.

At present, women make up 19.5% of our executive

workforce, 35% of our Management Committee and 21%

of our Executive Committee. As a frontrunner in promoting

gender, geographical, cultural and racial inclusivity, we

have set a target to achieve and maintain 30% diversity

among all our Executive and Management Committees.

Our commitment to develop a conducive and inclusive

work environment is also visible through the induction of

transgender employees across roles at Hindustan Zinc.

Powering our Sustainability Goals

At the heart of our futuristic growth strategy is our strong

commitment to sustainability, which continues to be

pivotal to our success as a market and industry leader. In

2020, Hindustan Zinc listed a set of goals for steering its

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) journey over

the next 5 years. We had also laid out a clear strategic

roadmap to achieve these goals, especially through

implementation of innovations and digitisation.

Aligning ourselves with global trends and the United

Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), we

have prioritised climate change, water stewardship, circular

economy, biodiversity conservation, zero harm, social

impact, diversity in workforce and responsible sourcing as

key tenets of our sustainability efforts.

In addition to signing a long-term renewable energy (RE)

power delivery agreement, we are also the first in the

country to introduce electric vehicles in underground

mining. We have also set a target of converting all 900

diesel-run mining vehicles into battery-operated ones and

have earmarked an investment of over US$ 1 billion for the

same. Furthermore, an ‘A’ rating in climate change by CDP

is testament to our commitment towards achieving net-zero

emissions by 2050.

MANAGEMENT SPEAK:

letter dated November

27, 1982. HZWF, the sole negotiating agent for workers

at the apex level, is a body that believes in the dictum

that ‘If the company grows, our growth will be taken care

of.’ It consists of core members from recognised unions

across locations.

All matters pertaining to service conditions, wages and

benefits, strategic policies in respect of workmen are

discussed across the table by the Federation/unions, at the

unit and at the corporate level. Discussions are driven by

the philosophy of ‘organisation above all’ and we believe

in resolving all matters through effective dialogue and

mutual consideration.

All executive members of the Federation are either

employees or ex-employees of the Company and represent

the recognised unions in their respective units. They decide

the strategy to deal with employee issues together with

the management.

Further, there exist across our locations multiple

bipartite forums, like Joint Consultation Committee,

Welfare Committee, House Allotment Committee, Safety

Committee, Canteen Committee and Transport Committee,

that serve to deal with matters of workmen in all facets of

life. These committees have equal representation from the

management and the union.

MAINTAINING CORDIAL LABOUR RELATIONS

Remuneration Governance Practices

Our Remuneration Philosophy

Hindustan Zinc has always endeavoured to build

a workplace which provides an environment of

entrepreneurship and well-being for all our employees. The

foundation of this culture is trust and a sense of purpose,

which serves to propel the short-term and long-term

interests of the Company and its shareholders.

The remuneration philosophy at Hindustan Zinc is driven

by the core objective of promoting a ‘Pay for Performance’

culture that is focussed on linking rewards with business

priorities. The executive compensation at the Company

emphasises operational/financial fundamentals, social

licence for operations and business sustainability, with

efforts continually directed towards wealth creation for all

our stakeholders.

As part of our remuneration philosophy, we strongly believe

that being valued and driven by the common purpose

is vital not only for productivity, but also for profits. The

rewards strategy operates with this belief at its fulcrum

whereby all reward schemes are perfectly aligned with the

Company’s performance-driven culture.

Performance Orientation

The exercise of business planning sets the tone for the

year and we lay great emphasis on not just setting the key

performance indicators (KPIs) but also ensuring the quality

of such goals, coupled with a mechanism of continual

performance dialogue.

y

The key elements of environment, social, governance,

risk and compliance are mandatory goals for all leaders

across the Company and embedded in the various

reward schemes, as we strive towards achievement

of our ultimate vision of ‘Zero Harm, Zero Waste,

Zero Discharge’

*Target plus scheme (“TPS”) as a part of foreign trade policy was announced on August 31, 2004 w.e.f. April 01, 2004, with an objective of accelerating

growth in exports. Pursuant to this scheme, Vedanta Limited (“erstwhile Sterlite Industries Ltd.”) (Holding Company) had applied for TPS scrips of value

of ` 306 Crore. However, certain retrospective amendments in this scheme were made by Directorate General of Foreign Trade (‘DGFT’) resulting in

reduction in these scrips value by ` 216 Crore in which HZL had a share of ` 48 Crore. This was challenged by the Holding Company in the Hon’ble

Supreme Court. Basis the favourable judgements from the Hon’ble Supreme Court, HZL had recognised an income of ` 48 Crore as an export incentive

recoverable in December 2015. However, during FY 2020-21, the TPS scrips of value of ` 216 Crore were issued by Directorate General of Foreign Trade

(‘DGFT’) in the name of Vedanta Limited (“Holding Company”) basis which, the export incentive recoverable was reclassified to recoverable from Vedanta

Limited. The Company has realised ` 20 Crore from Vedanta Limited on the basis of proportionate scrips utilization by Vedanta Limited and has created a

provision of remaining ` 28 Crore considering the expiry of the utilization timeline for these scrips till February 24, 2023 and no favorable outcome of the

petition filed by the Holding Company in the Hon’ble Supreme Court for extension of the utilization timeline (see note 27(4)).

* Target plus scheme (“TPS”) as a part of foreign trade policy was announced on August 31, 2004 w.e.f. April 01, 2004, with an objective of accelerating

growth in exports. Pursuant to this scheme, Vedanta Limited (“erstwhile Sterlite Industries Ltd.”) (Holding Company) had applied for TPS scrips of value

of ` 306 Crore. However, certain retrospective amendments in this scheme were made by Directorate General of Foreign Trade (‘DGFT’) resulting in

reduction in these scrips value by ` 216 Crore in which HZL had a share of ` 48 Crore. This was challenged by the Holding Company in the Hon’ble

Supreme Court. Basis the favourable judgements from the Hon’ble Supreme Court, HZL had recognised an income of ` 48 Crore as an export incentive

recoverable in December 2015. However, during FY 2020-21, the TPS scrips of value of ` 216 Crore were issued by Directorate General of Foreign

Trade (‘DGFT’) in the name of Vedanta Limited (“Holding Company”) basis which, the export incentive recoverable was reclassified to recoverable from

Vedanta Limited. The Company has realised ` 20 Crore from Vedanta Limited on the basis of proportionate scrips utilization by Vedanta Limited and

has created a provision of remaining ` 28 Crore considering the expiry of the utilization timeline for these scrips till February 24, 2023 and no favorable

outcome of the petition filed by the Holding Company in the Hon’ble Supreme Court for extension of the utilization timeline (see note 27(4)).
