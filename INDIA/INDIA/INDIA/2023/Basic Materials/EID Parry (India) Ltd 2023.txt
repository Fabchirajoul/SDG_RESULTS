Annual Report 2022-23 | 05:

Dear shareholders,

A decade ago, EID Parry began reimagining

its business model, adding non-sugar

businesses to its core sugar business with

the objective of generating more value,

getting closer to the consumer and making

its operations more sustainable.

The reimagined business model was

unprecedented in the industry and was

a proof to your Company’s capacity to be

innovative and decisive when required. I

am pleased to report that the steps taken in

that direction have given the organisation

a clear path that is now actively being

pursued to ensure profitable and

sustainable growth.

Your Company’s plans are being further

validated and given thrust by the optimism

and growth that we are witnessing in India.

Our country is also undergoing a large

reimagining phase wherein it is preparing

for its next phase of growth, driven by

rising consumption from evolving lifestyle

choices, renewed focus on manufacturing

and a thriving digital ecosystem, all of

which are being enabled by progressive

governmental reforms and forward-looking

policies. India is expected to emerge as

the third largest economy in the world by

FY2027-28.

This rapidly evolving landscape opens a

range of possibilities for your Company,

and the need of the hour is to match

changes on the outside with swift steps

and actions on the inside. The reimagining

journey at EID Parry is well under progress

and strong platforms for growth are being

created. From a largely singular vertical of

wholesale sugar, your Company is now

engaged across four business verticals of

institutional sugar, retail sugar, distillery

operations, power generation and

sweetener derivatives (with the possibility

of extending to food retail). Your Company

is working on other synergetic and

adjacent avenues for growth.

The result is that from a time when EID

Parry addressed largely one conventional

application through the manufacture

of sugar, your reimagined company is

more mainstreamed: it manufactures

ethanol that is used in blending with

petrol to reduce vehicular pollution; it

is engaged in power generation that is

helping moderate the use of fossil fuels;

it manufactures refined packaged sugar

and specialty sweeteners that address the

aspects of health, hygiene and well-being

of consumers.

At EID Parry, we believe that the initiatives

taken during the last few years have

prepared us for a larger play in the branded

and packaged foods segment. In the

process of reimagining our business, your

Company has been building capabilities

– in product development (sugar

and sweeteners), in better consumer

connect and understanding of consumer

preferences, in brand building and in

engagements with channel partners. Your

Company intends to leverage all these

capabilities towards a larger outcome – to

become an essential brand in every home’s

monthly shopping basket with a significant

share of the wallet.

The EID Parry of the future is to be largely

positioned as a bioenergy, food and

nutrition company. This reimagining will

help de-link your Company from the

cyclical and tightly controlled aspects of

the conventional sugar industry and will

empower it to compete and succeed based

on the strength of its business model and

capabilities.

In view of this, your Company is headed

towards a sustainable multi-year growth

phase, transforming from a single vertical

(sugar) to multiple verticals (sugar &

sweeteners, bioenergy, food & nutrition)

making it increasingly intrinsic in all our

lives.

M. M. Venkatachalam

Chairman

At EID Parry, we

believe that the

initiatives taken

during the last few

years have prepared

us for a larger play

in the branded and

packaged foods

segment.

Chairman’s statement

The EID Parry of the future is

to be largely positioned as a

bioenergy, food and nutrition

company. This reimagining

will help de-link your

Company from the cyclical

and tightly controlled

aspects of the conventional

sugar industry and will

empower it to compete

and succeed based on the

strength of its business

model and capabilities.

Annual Report 2022-23 | 11:

Managing Director’s vision

Overview

During the last decade, EID Parry has

undergone a courageous transformation

in the way it does business. This transition

from sugar to food, bioenergy and nutrition

businesses is of an extent that has perhaps

never been attempted within the sector.

The transition is a validation of your

Company’s foresight and ability to reinvent

with the objective to build momentum in a

sustainable way.

Background

The transition in our business model

was the result of an ability to discern

geographic and government realities

that would have endangered our

competitiveness as a long-term sugar

commodity manufacturer.

For instance, the Company recognised a

complete dependence of its business on

government policies, starting from the

pricing of cane and volume of sale, which

moderated the room for improvements in

our business. Your Company acknowledges

farmers as one of our key stakeholders

and is committed to collaborate and

make them more sustainable, help build

their adaptive capacity, make them more

sustainable and raise their awareness on

yield, recovery and crop quality etc.

Besides, the viability of some of our

manufacturing facilities was affected by

multi-year drought, farmer migration

to alternative cash crops (coconut and

banana) and farmers being compelled

to commission unviable water bore wells

down to 1000 feet.

Your Company recognised the writing

on the wall. Rather than persist with

suboptimal manufacturing facilities in the

hope of a revival, it closed under-utilised

factories at Pudukkottai, Pettavaithalai

and Pondicherry in Tamil Nadu in 2019

after having addressed farmer dues,

guided them towards alternative crops

and allocated the left-over cane area to

proximate sugar mills. Your Company

shifted the assets of one of the factories

to Karnataka where there is larger cane

availability and better recovery. This

strategy, coupled with the organic growth

of cane through an innate connect with

farmers, helped increase our cane volumes

from 37 Lakh MT/annum to more than 50

Lakh MT/annum over the past five years.

The higher the recovery, the better is the

profitability of any company operating in

this industry. The closure of non-operating

factories also brought down our fixed

costs and improved the profitability of our

Company. The result of this timely capacity

churn has been that Karnataka, which

once accounted for 30% of our sugar, now

accounts for half our sugar output. Besides,

thanks to our efforts towards organic

cane development, your Company’s

Pugalur manufacturing facility that once

had virtually no cane, crushed 9.27 LMT

of cane during the last financial year. The

combination of capacity relocation and

organic cane development enhanced the

Company’s predictability in cane access

and crushing operations, moderating

variables and providing our Company with

a more sustainable growth platform.

Managing the variables

At EID Parry, we believe that in a business

influenced by the weather, farmer crop

choice and government policies, there is

a premium on the curation of a business

model that moderates variables and

enhances predictability.

Over the last few years, there was a

growing recognition that scattered

intervention could do so much and no

more; what the Company now needed was

a commitment to holistically reinvent the

business. We stayed committed to our four

core strategies that emerged from our zeal

to reinventing the organisation.

One, we closed some underperforming

factories and augmented capacities in areas

with better recovery and cane availability.

This, coupled with organic growth in cane

volumes through dedicated interventions

across the cane farming value chain, led to

a growth in volumes at a CAGR of 9% since

FY2018-19.

Two, the Company recognised its excessive

dependence on the commodity business,

the cyclical fortunes of which inevitably

At EID Parry, we are

optimistic of the way

our business model is

being evolved – not just

for its revenue diversity

but due to widening of

our product mix

and the considerably

larger addressable

markets for each.

During the year under review, your Company delivered a creditable

performance: sugar division profits surged on account of higher

realizations from Sugar, Co-generation and Distillery segments and

enhanced process efficiencies along with better recoveries lead to

cost optimization. Higher sales volume in the Retail and Institutional

segments contributed to increased realisations of sugar. Your

Company has been able to deliver this despite an increase in FRP

and premature end to the cane season in the State of Karnataka.

This has been due to the ability of your company to leverage its

strengths and its ability to stay agile and resilient in driving profitable

growth. The strategic positioning of your Company’s sugar assets

and large-scale expansion of ethanol production capacity has been

instrumental in delivering superior results which has been gaining

momentum over the past few years. Focus on execution excellence,
