Message from the Chairman

Message from the Chairman and: Managing

Managing Director

Currently nearly 13% of our energy sourcing is coming

from renewable source which we are looking to more than

double this year. Simultaneously, the company completed

various projects on energy conservations which resulted

in more than 5 lakhs KWh of saving. Nearly 90% of waste

is recycled in our Organization with zero liquid discharge

initiatives. We planted more than 55,000/- trees. Our

strong occupational health & safety management system

with zero accident goal enabled us to sustain zero life loss

operations historically.

Our ESG endeavours are positioned on six strategic ESG

Pillars i.e. Sustainable Products, Sustainable Operations,

Employee Growth & Diversity, Sustainable Supply Chain,

Community Development through employee engagement

and Governance & Sustainable Growth.

COMPANY OVERVIEW

13

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23:

Dear Shareholders,

Our Company had to face lot of turbulence

during the last three years due to multiple

waves of pandemic, chips shortages, geo-

political and associated economic challenges.

However, management took some bold

decisions at the right time and exited the

4-wheeler lighting business in Europe and

America to stem the losses. Though the cash

inflow from this divestment was much lower

than the initial expectations, it enabled our

Company to prevent further deterioration in its

financial health.

During the fiscal year 2022-23, our ongoing

operations registered a revenue of H68,631

million with an impressive 17.4% growth as

compared to the previous year. Our EBITDA

surged to H5,986 million (or 8.7%) from H3,892

million (or 6.6%) in FY 2021-22 and PAT was

at H388 million in comparison to a loss of H783

million in FY 2021-22.

As the GCFO, I see tremendous opportunity

for value creation in the coming years as we

continue to focus more on revenue growth

and internal efficiencies. I would like to present

an overview of how we would like to embark

on this journey towards improved financial

performance and value creation. We have

already made free cashflow (FCF) as the

cornerstone of our performance measurement

across businesses. We understand that it is

the consistent growth in free cash flows which

drives growth in shareholder value.

Our approach is to reap the benefits of

operating leverage at every stage so that

the growth in profits is higher than growth in

revenue as depicted below:

Dear Shareholders,

The Directors of your Company take pleasure in presenting

the 35th Annual Report on the business and operations of

the Company together with financial statements for the

financial year ended March 31, 2023.

FINANCIAL RESULTS & APPROPRIATION

As reported last year and pursuant to the Securities

Purchase Agreement [“SPA”], your Company has divested

its 4-wheeler lighting system operations in Americas &

Europe and identified R&D business in India to Compagnie

Plastic Omnium SE of France and its Affiliate/Associate

Companies, and Subsidiaries by signing Business Transfer

Agreement and other related agreements/documents

with the subsidiaries and other parties involved.

The deal size of €600 million was adjusted downward by €80

million due to higher raw material inflation, lower demand

caused by the Ukraine war, and other geopolitical issues.

The said divestment was concluded on October 06, 2022.

Your Company continues its lighting operations in Asia

and continues to operate its joint venture in China, other

international two-wheeler business in Italy and Vietnam,

and global electronics business in Poland and Romania.

The said transaction enabled the Company to focus on

emerging areas such as electric vehicle components,

electronics, and connectivity in the Indian market and the

global two-wheeler lighting business.

The equity value agreed under the SPA was €69.5 Million

(subject to closing adjustments as provided under SPA). In

our standalone financials, the Company has recognised

loss on equity investments and loans given to Varroc

lighting systems operations (“VLS Business”) of Rs. 13,240

million during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, as an

exceptional item. Further loss of Rs. 81.90 million recognised

during the quarter March 31, 2023, pertains to expenses

related to sale of investment in VLS business. Pursuant to

amendment to SPA on May 12, 2023, a mutual settlement

is being attempted for the disagreements between the

parties in accordance with the provisions of SPA.

The summarized Financial Results for the year ended

March 31, 2023, and for previous year ended March 31,

2022 are as follows:
