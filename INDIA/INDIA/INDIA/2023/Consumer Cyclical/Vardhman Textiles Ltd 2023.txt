Dear Shareholders,

I hope this message finds you in good

health and high spirits. I am writing

to provide you the performance of

Vardhman Textiles Limited in the fiscal

year 2022-23.

We need to take a moment to

reflect on the remarkable journey

of Vardhman Textiles and share our

collective achievements. As one of the

largest manufacturers of yarn in India

with an impressive spindle count of

1.23 million and a fabric processing

capacity of 180 million meters, we

have truly established ourselves as a

world-class organization.

Our success is a testament to

the synergy of vision, passion and

technology. Across our 15 state-of-

the-art manufacturing units spread

across four states, we manufacture an

extensive range of products including

different varieties of Yarns, Fabrics,

Garments and Acrylic Fibre. Such

diverse operations are made possible

by the dedication and hard work of our

over 28,000 employees, with women

workers comprising 35 percent of our

workforce.

Macro-economic Overview

Over the past year, the world

economy has faced numerous

disruptions, with the ongoing Russia-

Ukraine conflict playing a significant

role in disrupting supply chains. The

resulting surge in the prices of critical

commodities, including crude oil,

natural gas, fertilizers and wheat, has

intensified inflationary pressures.

Central banks, initially slow to react,

have now recognized the need for a

strong monetary policy response.

Despite these challenges, I am

pleased to share that the Indian

economy has shown remarkable

resilience in the face of the pandemic.

In fact, so far as the pace of recovery is

concerned, we remained ahead of many

other nations, positioning ourselves to

return to the pre-pandemic growth path

in FY23. However, we have also faced

the challenge of reining in inflation,

particularly due to the US and European

strife. Through concerted efforts by the

Government and the Reserve Bank of

India (RBI), we have been successful in

containing the inflation as compared to

many other countries.

While various developed economies

are passing through tough times with

strong possibility of further policy rate

increases by the US Federal Reserve

and European Central Banks, we remain

optimistic about India’s economic

growth comparatively. Despite the

shrinking global market size in the

second half of this year, agencies

worldwide project India as the fastest-

growing major economy. This optimism

is underpinned by the resilience of our

economy, characterized by the rebound

of private consumption as the primary

driver of growth. This shift in focus has

also stimulated production activity and

increased capacity utilization across

sectors, leading to a decline in urban

unemployment rates.

Global and Indian Textiles

Industry

Now, turning our attention to the global

and Indian textile industries, we have

witnessed a volatile period in the

market. Fluctuating cotton prices on the

international front, reaching as high as

US Cents 140 to 150 per pound, have

had a direct impact on Indian cotton

prices. Further, imposition of 10%

customs duty on import of cotton fiber

by India has resulted into higher cotton

fiber cost in India than the international

prices making downward industry less

competitive. The demand for yarn is

also not showing encouraging signs

because of recession like conditions

in US & Europe and the same is also

reflected in stagnating cotton yarn

prices while cotton fiber prices remain

firm. To illustrate, cotton yarn exports

from India have fallen from about 1300

mn kg in 2021 to less than 700 mn kg

in 2022 due to low demand of yarn in

leading garment exporting countries

like Bangladesh and China thereby

creating stress on capacity utilization

for Indian textiles mills and subdued

prices for textile products in domestic

market. Despite these challenges,

the opening up of the Chinese market

after stringent Covid-19 restrictions has

brought a sense of some relief. Gradual

market reopening may lead to increased

demand for yarn from the Chinese

market, which had been lacking earlier.

Financial Performance

Our consolidated revenue for the fiscal

22-23 stands at H 10,137.49 crore as

against H 9,622.34 crore in 2021-22.

We have recorded an EBITDA of H

1,556.49 crore with an EBITDA margin

of approximately 15.07%. Our robust

manufacturing capabilities, combined

with our ability to cater to diverse

customer needs, have positioned us

as a preferred partner in the textile

industry. Furthermore, our efficient cost

management practices and optimized

supply chain have contributed to the

profit margins.

Innovation and

Developments

We remain committed to enhancing

our performance through incremental

improvements and trailblazing

innovations. By focusing on developing

new products and adopting a customer-

centric approach, we have built enduring

relationships with all our stakeholders.

Our non-negotiable value system and

ethical business practices have been the

bedrock of our incredible success story.

Our commitment to excellence extends

to the adoption of Six Sigma, which

has yielded positive outcomes and

improved responses. As the country’s

largest vertically integrated textile

manufacturer, we take pride in offering

our clients unmatched agility, flexibility,

consistency, reliability, traceability and

sustainability through every stage of

production.

Our workforce

At Vardhman Textiles, we believe in

being proactive rather than reactive.

This philosophy has kept us ahead of

the curve, enabling us to anticipate

and assess any situation. We foster a

culture of skill development and talent

encouragement which is reflected in the

loyalty and dedication of our employees.

Inclusive growth is at the heart of our

leadership approach. We strive to create

an environment that promotes the

development of people through trust,

transparency and empowerment. This

includes creating ample opportunities for

women, who are central to our vision.

We actively encourage their growth and

development through training programs,

mentorship opportunities and career

advancement pathways. By fostering

an inclusive workplace, we empower

women to unleash their full potential,

contributing not only to the success of

our company but also to the economic

and social progress of our nation.

Responsible Corporate Citizen

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

is deeply ingrained in our aspirations.

We are committed to empowering

the communities that host us through

initiatives focused on education,

sustainable livelihood, healthcare and

sanitation. Leading with compassion, we

envision a better world of opportunities

where people can lead lives with dignity.

Sustainability is a core driver of our

operations. Recognizing the global shift

towards greener and more sustainable

products, we have actively pursued

sustainable technologies, processes and

products over the past few years.

In addition, our prudent financial

management practices and adherence

to corporate governance principles have

garnered trust and confidence from

our stakeholders, including investors,

shareholders and financial institutions.

We remain committed to transparent

and ethical business dealings, ensuring

the long-term sustainability and growth

of our organization.

Way forward

Looking ahead, we are optimistic about

the future prospects of Vardhman

Textiles. We will continue to leverage

our strengths, drive innovation and

explore new avenues for growth. Our

unwavering commitment to excellence,

customer satisfaction and social

responsibility will remain at the forefront

of our strategic priorities.

Thank you for your continued trust and

support.

Sincerely,

Responsibilities

of

Management

and Those

Charged with Governance for the Standalone

Financial Statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the

matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to

the preparation of these standalone financial statements that

give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial

performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows

and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the

Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in

India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate

accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act

for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing

and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection

and application of appropriate accounting policies; making

judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal

financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the

accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant

to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial

statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, management

is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue

as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to

going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting

unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the

Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative

but to do so.

The Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for

overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the

Standalone Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about

whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or

error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not

a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs

will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered

material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably

be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken

on the basis of these standalone financial statements.:

2.22 Leases

The Group as Lessee

The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases

for land and buildings. The Group assesses whether a

contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A

contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the

right to control the use of an identified asset for a period

of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a

contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified

asset, the Group assesses whether: (i) the contract involves

the use of an identified asset (ii) the Group has substantially

all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through

the period of the lease and (iii) the Group has the right to

direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group

recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding

lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a

lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months

or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these

short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the

lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line

basis over the term of the lease.

Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend

or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term.

ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options

when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost,

which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability

adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the

commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct:

and no significant business decisions relating to debts

restructuring and business restructuring in the above

said associate can be implemented without prior

approval of the Company.

2.24.2

Key sources of uncertainty

In the application of the Group accounting policies,

the management of the Group is required to make

judgements, estimates and assumptions about the

carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not

readily apparent from other sources. The estimates

and associated assumptions are based on historical

experience and other factors that are considered to be

relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are

reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting

estimates are recognised in the period in which the

estimate is revised if the revision affects only that

period or in the period of the revision and future periods

if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The following are the areas of estimation uncertainty

and critical judgements that the management has

made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting

policies and that have the most significant effect on the

amounts recognised in the financial statements:

2.24.3

Defined benefit plans

The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-

employment benefits and the present value of such

obligation are determined using actuarial valuations.

An actuarial valuation involves making various

assumptions that may differ from actual developments

in the future. These include the determination of the

discount rate, future, salary increases, mortality rates

and future pension increases. Due to the complexities

involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a

defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes

in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at

each reporting date.

2.24.4

Useful lives of depreciable tangible assets and

intangible assets

Management reviews the useful lives of depreciable/

amortisable assets at each reporting date.

As at March 31, 2023 management assessed that the

useful lives represent the expected utility of the assets

to the Group.

2.24.5

Fair Value measurements and valuation processes

Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured

at fair value for financial reporting purposes. The Board

of Directors of the respective Company approves the

fair values determined by the Chief Financial Officer

of the respective Company including determining the

appropriate valuation techniques and inputs for fair

value measurements.:

(ii) There are no major customers that represent more than 10% of total balances of trade receivables.:

letter of credit of H 237.10 crores (2022: H 548.31 crores)

c.

The amounts shown above represents the best possible estimates arrived at on the basis of available information. The

obligations that arise from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle or a

reliable estimate cannot be made. The Group has been advised that it has strong legal positions against such disputes.
