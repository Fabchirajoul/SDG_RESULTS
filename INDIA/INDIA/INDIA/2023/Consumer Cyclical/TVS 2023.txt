Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and future period. The estimates

and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgment or complexity, and of items

which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than

those originally assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgments are included in the

relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the financial

statements.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies mentioned herein are relating to the consolidated financial statements of TVS Motor Company

Limited and its subsidiaries and associates.

a)

Brief description of the Group

TVS Motor Company Limited (the Company) is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in India

whose shares are publicly traded. The registered office is located at "Chaitanya", No. 12, Khader Nawaz Khan

Road, Nungambakkam, Chennai - 600006, Tamil Nadu, India. The Company together with its subsidiaries and

associates (collectively referred to as the "Group") operate in a wide range of activities such as manufacturing of

automotive vehicles, automotive components, spare parts & accessories thereof, housing development and financial

services.

b)

Basis of preparation

The financial statements comply in all material aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under

Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) [Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] and

other relevant provisions of the Act.

The financial statement has been prepared on the historical cost convention under accrual basis of accounting

except for certain assets and liabilities (as per the accounting policy below), which have been measured at fair

value. These financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2023 have been approved and authorised for

issue by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on 4th May 2023.

Principles of Consolidation

Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. The group controls an entity when the group is

exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those

returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the

date on which control is transferred to the group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The group combines the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like

items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains

on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the

transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have

been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.

Non-controlling interests (if any) in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated

statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and balance sheet, respectively.

Associates

Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control or joint control. (This is

generally the case where the group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights). Investments in associates

are accounted for using the equity method of accounting after initially being recognised at cost.

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to

recognise the group's share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit and loss, and the

group's share of other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received

or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the

investment.

When the group's share of losses in an investment accounted under equity method equals or exceeds its interest

in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the group does not recognise further losses,

unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the

extent of the group's interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides

evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of investees accounted under equity method

have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.

The carrying amount of investments accounted under equity method are tested for impairment in accordance with

the policy described in note 1(k) below.:

letter of credit issued by a bank in India.

b)

A loan of $ 8.25 crores in USD and $ 8.21 crores in IDR obtained from a bank, partly secured (80%) by a credit guarantee

issued by the EXIM bank of Indonesia.

c)

Working capital loan and cash credit of $ 2,195.16 crores obtained are secured by hypothecation of receivables under the

financing activity of the Subsidiary.

d)

Cash credit and working capital loan of $ 207.03 crores obtained are secured by hypothecation of receivables and inventories

of the Subsidiary, both present and future.
