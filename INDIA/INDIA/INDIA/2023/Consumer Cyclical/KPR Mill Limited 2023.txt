LETTER

I am pleased to share with you all that during FY 2023, the

Consolidated revenue grew by 28% YoY. Due to high-cost

inventory and raw material price inﬂation the gross margin in

Spinning activities contracted. Finance cost increased due to

additional working Capital availment, given the inventory

buﬀer and Term Loans for new Sugar and Apparel projects.

However, the unstinted support from the Garment segment

and our inherent strengths enabled KPR to repeat its

performance level, despite the challenges. Now the Cotton

prices started stabilizing and the Textile industry is optimistic

with Government policies and FTAs.

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

v Processing & Printing expansion at ` 50 Crores will be over

in First Half of the Current Financial year.

MAJOR CAPEX-EXPANSION

To accelerate our performance further, we implemented

certain modernization and expansion plans. a brief on the

same is reported below:

v The ‘Roof top’ Solar Power Plant at ` 50 Crores completed

and commissioned.

v The Modernisation plan at an outlay of ` 100 Crores in

Textile segment is expected to be completed during the

current Financial Year.

v Setting up of exclusive Vortex Spinning mill at an outlay of

`100 Crores will be completed during current Financial

Year.

v Ethanol Capacity expansion at ` 150 Crores will be

commenced before the coming Sugar Season 2023-24.

The solar power should help in saving power cost, the

increase in the processing capacity to be utilised internally to

meet our additional demand; the Brown ﬁeld Garment

capacity expansion may add up 10-20 Million pieces per

annum; the Ethanol capacity expansion may increase KPR’s

total capacity to 480 KLPD.

In the vortex business, margins are expected to be relatively

stable, given the high demand for viscose yarn. On our unique

Retail Brand FASO, the Pan-India plan is on track and is

looking to expand its footprint in the current year.

The Margin from the Sugar & Ethanol segment is sustainable

due to higher returns from the ethanol and co-gen segments.
