AS REQUIRED BY SCHEDULE V TO SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA

(LISTING OBLIGATIONS AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS) REGULATIONS, 2015

I, Puneet Chhatwal,: Managing

Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer): As one of the oldest operating company in the Tata Group, we have always

operated in the spirit of our founder Mr. Jamsetji Tata who believed that the community is not just another stakeholder in business, but is in

fact the very purpose of its existence. Over the years, we have adopted a responsible approach to ESG in all we do. We have announced an

Industry leading ESG+ program called Paathya wherein clear milestones have been set for various ESG related initiatives by 2030. We have

also signed up to SBTI and are working towards our commitment to Net Zero Emissions. We have subscribed to the Earthcheck program – 77

of our hotels go through this certification currently, with 57 achieving Platinum status, a global benchmark.

We continue to work on decarbonisation in our operations through efforts such as elimination of single use plastic and other measures. On

Scope 2, we have entered into significant green power arrangements for a number of properties. On Scope 3, we have a comprehensive

program of working with our supply chain partners. We are evaluating various measures relating to Scope 3 for our customers. As a company,

we are growing significantly through management contracts – consequently, we are working with our partners to implement ESG measures

in their respective hotels.

Our people are the backbone of our business. We are immensely grateful to our colleagues for their dedication and care towards our

community, customers, and each other. Empowering and enabling our employees to execute our strategic priorities while keeping

sustainability at the core of our operations is the key to our future success.

Note 1: Corporate Information

The Indian Hotels Company Limited (“IHCL” or the

“Company”), is primarily engaged in the business of owning,

operating & managing hotels, palaces and resorts.

The Company is domiciled and incorporated in India in 1902

and has its registered office at Mandlik House, Mandlik Road,

Mumbai – 400 001, India. It is promoted by Tata Sons Private

Limited (formerly Tata Sons Limited), which holds a significant

stake in the Company.

The financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023

were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for

issue on April 27, 2023.

Note 2: Basis of Preparation, Critical Accounting

Estimates and Judgements, Significant Accounting

Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The financial statements have been prepared on the

following basis:

(a) Statement of Compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in

accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind

AS”) as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies

Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 and other provisions of the

Companies Act, 2013 as amended from time to time.

(b) Basis of Preparation

These financial statements have been prepared on

a historical cost basis, except for certain financial

instruments which are measured at fair value at the

end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally

based on the fair value of the consideration given in

exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price

that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer

a liability in an orderly transaction between market

participants at the measurement date, regardless of

whether that price is directly observable or estimated

using another valuation technique.

All assets and liabilities are classified as current and

non-current as per company’s normal operating cycle

of 12 months which is based on the nature of business

of the Company. Current Assets do not include elements

which are not expected to be realised within 1 year and

Current Liabilities do not include items which are due

after 1 year, the period of 1 year being reckoned from

the reporting date.

(c) Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements

The preparation of these financial statements in

conformity with the recognition and measurement

principles of Ind AS requires management to make

judgements, estimates and assumptions, that affect the

reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures

relating to contingent liabilities as at the date of the

financial statements and the reported amounts of

income and expenses for the years presented. The

estimates and associated assumptions are based

on historical experience and other factors that are

considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from

these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed

on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates

are recognised in the period in which the estimates are

revised and in any future periods affected.

In particular, information about significant areas

of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements

in applying accounting policies that have the most

significant effect on the amounts recognised in the

financial statements pertain to:

− Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment

and Intangible Assets: The Company has estimated

useful life of each class of assets based on the

nature of assets, the estimated usage of the asset,

the operating condition of the asset, past history

of replacement, anticipated technological changes,

etc. The Company reviews the useful life of property,

plant and equipment and Intangible assets as at the

end of each reporting period. This reassessment

may result in change in depreciation expense in

future periods.

− Impairment Testing: Property, plant and equipment,

Right-of-Use assets and intangible assets that are

subject to depreciation/ amortisation are tested

for impairment periodically including when events

occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the

recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is

less than its carrying value. The recoverable amount

of cash generating units is higher of value-in-use and

fair value less cost to sell. The calculation involves

use of significant estimates and assumptions which

includes turnover and earnings multiples, growth

rates and net margins used to calculate projected

future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future

economic and market conditions.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (Contd.)

for the year ended March 31, 2023

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2023

Note 1. Corporate Information

The Indian Hotels Company Limited (“IHCL” or the

“Company”), and its subsidiaries (referred collectively as

the “Group”) is primarily engaged in the business of owning,

operating & managing hotels, palaces and resorts. These

consolidated financial statements of the Group also include

the Group’s interest in associates and joint ventures.

The Company is domiciled and incorporated in India in 1902

and has its registered office at Mandlik House, Mandlik

Road, Mumbai – 400 001, India. It is promoted by Tata Sons

Private Limited (Formerly Tata Sons Limited), which holds a

significant stake in the Company.

These consolidated financial statements for the year ended

March 31, 2023 were approved by the Board of Directors and

authorised for issue on April 27, 2023.

Note 2. Basis

of

preparation,

Principles

of

consolidation

and

equity

accounting,

Critical

accounting estimates and judgements, Significant

accounting

policies

and

Recent

accounting

pronouncements

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared

on the following basis:

(a) Statement of Compliance

These consolidated financial statements have been

prepared in accordance with Ind AS as prescribed

under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read

with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015 and other provisions of the Companies Act, 2013

as amended from time to time.

(b) Basis of Preparation

The Consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain

financial instruments that are measured at fair value

at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is

generally based on the fair value of the consideration

given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value

is the price that would be received to sell an asset or

paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction

between market participants at the measurement date,

regardless of whether that price is directly observable

or estimated using another valuation technique.

All assets and liabilities are classified as current and

non-current as per company’s normal operating cycle

of 12 months, which is based on the nature of business

of the Group. Current Assets do not include elements,

which are not expected to be realised within 1 year

and Current Liabilities do not include items which are

due after 1 year, the period of 1 year being reckoned

from the reporting date.

(c) Principles of Consolidation and Equity Accounting

(i)

Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities (including structured entities)

over which the Group has control. The Group controls

an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights

to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity

and has the ability to affect those returns through its

power to direct the relevant activities of that entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on

which control is transferred to the Group.

The Group combines the financial statements of the

parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like

items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses.

Intra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains

on transactions between entities within the Group are

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless

the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of

the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries

have been changed, where necessary, to ensure

consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of

subsidiaries are shown separately in the Consolidated

Statement of Profit and Loss, Consolidated Statement

of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Balance

Sheet respectively.

(ii) Joint Ventures, Associates and Equity Method

Accounting

Joint ventures are joint arrangements, whereby the

parties that have joint control of the arrangements have

rights to the net assets and obligations for the liabilities,

relating to the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures

are accounted for using the equity method, after

initially being recognised at cost in the Consolidated

Balance sheet.

Associates are entities over which the Group has

significant influence but not control or joint control.

Investments in associates are accounted for using

the equity method of accounting, after initially being

recognised at cost.

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments

are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter

to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition
