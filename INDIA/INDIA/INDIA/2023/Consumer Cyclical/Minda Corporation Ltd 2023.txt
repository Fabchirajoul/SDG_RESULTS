Dear Shareholders,

The world around us is in a constant state of ‘change’. The Indian automotive sector is

transitioning fast, witnessing remarkable changes like shifting to connected cars, on-

demand mobility, rising adoption of electric vehicles and accelerated technological

content in vehicles. While these changes have the potential to disrupt the industry, they

also offer a path to real transformation, giving us the opportunity to stay ahead of the

curve. As one of the leading auto component manufacturer, Spark Minda has embraced

and evolved amid this revolution. Empowered by technology, innovation, and

collaboration, we clocked sustainable progress during the last fiscal year. We focused

on incorporating advanced technologies to meet the evolving needs of the industry in

transition.

Our revenue from operations reached

H 43,001 million, representing a 45%

growth. Notably, our EBITDA rose

from H 2,946 million in FY 2021- 22

to H 4,615 million in FY 2022-23,

reflecting a 57% expansion.

Fiscal 2022-23 posed immense

challenges: geopolitical crisis in

Europe, supply chain disruptions, and

mounting inflationary pressures. Yet,

our resilience steered us through.

Leveraging innovation, Spark Minda

achieved remarkable milestones

in FY2023. Strategic investments

in technology and infrastructure

enhanced our manufacturing

capabilities and supply chain

efficiency. Our diversified portfolio

consistently delivered value to

stakeholders.

Through the collaborative efforts

of our team, we have successfully

sustained our growth momentum.

We maintained double-digit EBITDA

margins for eleven consecutive

quarters. Our revenue from operations

reached H 43,001 million, representing

a 45% growth. Notably, our EBITDA

rose from H 2,946 million in FY 2021-

22 to H 4,615 million in FY 2022-

23, reflecting a 57% expansion.

Additionally, our PAT margin stood at

6.6%, with our PAT increasing from

H 1,919 million to H 2,845 million.

These figures were driven by

enhanced revenue visibility across

business verticals, an improved

product mix, increased content per

vehicle, and a notable surge in market

share. We owe this success to our

shareholders and value the trust that

they have bestowed upon us. Layering

this commitment further, the board

announced a dividend of H1.20 per

equity share.

Collaboration is key

Reaffirming our commitment to deliver

products backed with cutting-edge

technologies, we entered into a

strategic technical collaboration with

DAESUNG, Korea. This collaboration

aims to introduce Next-Gen Advanced

Driver Assistance System (ADAS)

solutions to the Indian automotive

market.

Spark Minda also secured a

Technology License Agreement

with LocoNav for white labelling of

Telematics Software across Web,

Android, and iOS platforms. The

partnership with LocoNav will help

Spark Minda strengthen its existing

relationship with the leading OEMs

by integrating LocoNav’s proprietary

telematics software making us a
