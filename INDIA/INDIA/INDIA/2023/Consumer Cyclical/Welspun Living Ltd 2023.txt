solutions and advance textile. It has become imperative to have a name which is more inclusive and

having wider perspective.

The Board of Directors deliberated on this and decided to recommend to the shareholders to approve

change of name of the Company from Welspun India Limited to Welspun Living Limited. This name

effectively encapsulates the Company’s present business focus while also allowing the flexibility to

incorporate the other broader categories in the future.

The proposed name reflects a more dynamic and inclusive brand image that is driven by a purpose of

positioning the Company for growth and adaptability in the evolving market landscape. It indicates

the Company's proactive approach to staying relevant and agile in the face of changing market

dynamics. The new brand identity, Welspun Living not only reflects the current business verticals,

but also offers opportunities for potential expansion into other areas, which may drive further growth

and value creation for the Company’s stakeholders.:

letter ‘W’ is inspired by 2 ticks, ‘Doing

things right’, and ‘Doing the right thing’ that signifies how the growth of our

business is helping us realize our potential to rise to the power of our Vision…

The Power of Right.

The new logo captures the essence of Welspun’s growth, innovation,

and adaptability in a rapidly changing business landscape, reflecting our

evolution. It encapsulates our Company’s core values, vision, and mission,

making it easier for customers to identify and connect with us.

Tomorrows are inevitable. Challenges will keep coming. How good the future

will depend on how well we plan and prepare our present, to create the next

level opportunities and experiences for tomorrow.

At Welspun, we commit to Foresee the Change, Predict the Potential, Gauge

the Growth, Evaluate the Value, Expand to Prepare, Innovate to Equip, and

Leap to Go Beyond. So, when tomorrow comes, we are ready to conquer it.:

Letter from the Chairman’s desk

Our vision for the future

Dear esteemed stakeholders,

I would like to share with you the Company’s

performance and operational efficiency against the

backdrop of a challenging global environment.

In the economic landscape of 2022–23, countries

worldwide experienced headwinds, geopolitical

tensions escalated, causing economic uncertainty,

including surging energy and food prices, mounting

inflation rates, and volatile markets. Organisations

faced operational hurdles, such as soaring commodity

prices, logistics disruptions, and the impact of the

Ukraine-Russia conflict, coupled with rising Fed rates,

despite these considerable difficulties, Welspun

India Limited (WIL) displayed high resilience and

unprecedented commitment to overcome the same

while keeping innovation, sustainability and growth

at the core of operations during the financial year

2022-23 (FY23).

Demand surge expected

The correction in cotton and container prices will

impact margins favourably, while energy basket price

remains high. As consumer prices adjust and retailers

adjust inventory, demand for Home Textiles is expected

to rise. Operational efficiency, lower commodity costs,

and increased demand will offset the consumer price

revision. This year, the domestic business achieved

near break-even EBITDA after substantial investments.

Our power brands, ‘Welspun’ and ‘Spaces,’ have the

widest distribution in the country, present in 500+

towns and 11,170+ retail units, making us the market

leaders. We aim to further strengthen the distribution

network by increasing the number of retail units to

50,000+ by FY26, thereby capturing a bigger market

share in the nation. We would like to capitalise on our

global leadership and experience to further penetrate

the domestic market.

B. K. Goenka

Chairman

8:

Dear Stakeholders,

I am happy to share the Annual Report for FY23 which

marks another successful year for Welspun India.

We have again surpassed $1 billion in revenues, a

remarkable milestone that highlights our commitment

to deliver superior products and services across

the globe.

The previous year witnessed significant shifts in the

global industry, including changing consumption

patterns and the constant rise of online platforms.

Prices of cotton and containers have a great impact

on our profitability and they have started correcting,

however, the cost of natural and other forms of

energy remain steadfast at elevated levels. We have

proactively responded to global challenges and

commodity costs by embracing our key enablers:

innovation, digitisation, and ESG practices. These

initiatives have allowed us to harness the opportunities

presented by the evolving landscape and propel

our growth trajectory. We will continue to make

inroads globally across bath, bedding, flooring and

advanced materials.

Domestic boost despite global

challenges!

India remains the brightest spot of growth. Committed

to aggressive growth, we are scaling our presence

across all major cities and towns, increasing brand

awareness for our power brands, ‘SPACES’ and

‘Welspun’. Currently, we have 11,170+ retail stores pan

India spread across 500+ towns making us the No. 1

distributed home textile brand in the country.

Committed to aggressive

growth, we are scaling our

presence across all major

cities and towns, increasing

brand awareness for our

power brands, ‘SPACES’

and ‘Welspun’.

June 1, 2023, in respect of the agreed indicators /

parameters listed below (the “Identified Sustainability

Indicators”). These parameters are as included in the

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report

(BRSR) of the Company for the year ended March

31, 2023. The reporting boundary for BRSR is as

disclosed in Question 13 of Section A of the BRSR,

with exceptions, if any, been disclosed as a note under

the respective questions under BRSR.

Identified Sustainability Indicators

The Identified Sustainability Indicators for the year

ended March 31, 2023 are summarised in Appendix 1

to this report.

Our limited assurance engagement was with respect

to the year ended March 31, 2023 information only

and we have not performed any procedures with

respect to comparative previous year information i.e.

year ended March 31, 2o22 reported in the Business

Responsibility and Sustainability Report for the year

ended March 31, 2023 and, therefore, do not express

any conclusion thereon.

Criteria

The criteria used by Welspun India Limited is

Guidance note for BRSR format.

Management’s Responsibility

The Company’s Management is responsible for

engagement with stakeholders, content and

presentation of the Business Responsibility and

Sustainability Report in accordance with the Criteria

mentioned above. This responsibility includes the

design, implementation and maintenance of internal

control relevant to the preparation of the Business

Responsibility and Sustainability Report and

measurement of Identified Sustainability Indicators,

which are free from material misstatement, whether

due to fraud or error.

Inherent limitations

The absence of a significant body of established

practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure

non-financial indicators allows for different, but

acceptable, measures and measurement techniques

and can affect comparability between entities. In

addition, Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) quantification

is subject to inherent uncertainty because of

incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine

emissions factors and the values needed to combine

emissions of different gases.

Our Independence and Quality

Management

We have complied with the independence and

other ethical requirements of the International Code

of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including

International Independence Standards) issued by the

International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants

(IESBA Code) and Code of Ethics issued by the

Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI),

which is founded on fundamental principles of

integrity, objectivity, professional competence and

due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality

Management 1 “Quality Management for Firms that

Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or

Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements”

and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system

of quality management including documented

policies and procedures regarding compliance with

ethical requirements, professional standards and

applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Our Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance

conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Indicators

based on the procedures we have performed and

evidence we have obtained. We conducted our

limited assurance engagement in accordance with

International Standard on Assurance Engagements

3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance Engagements other

than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial

Information’ and International Standard on Assurance

Engagements 3410 ‘Assurance Engagements

on Greenhouse Gas Statements’, issued by the

International Auditing and Assurance Standards

Board. These standards require that we plan and

perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance

about whether the Identified Sustainability Indicators

are free from material misstatement.:

vehicles while other equipment generally have lease terms between 2 and 5 years. The Group’s obligations

under its leases are secured by the lessor’s title to the leased assets. Generally, the Group is restricted from

assigning and subleasing the leased assets and some contracts require the Group to maintain certain financial

ratios. There are several lease contracts that include extension and termination options and variable lease

payments, which are further discussed below.

applies the ‘short-term lease’ and ‘lease of low-value assets’ recognition exemptions for these leases.:
