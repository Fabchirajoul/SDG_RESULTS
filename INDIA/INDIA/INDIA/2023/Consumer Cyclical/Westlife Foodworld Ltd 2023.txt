Managing Director, Saurabh Bhudolia as

CFO, Rohit Kumar as CHRO, and Sohel Nalwalla

as Supply Chain Head to steer the company’s

roadmap, strengthening our market dominance

and set new benchmarks. Our people efforts

were recognised with the prestigious ‘Great

Place to Work’ Laureate Award for being in the

top 100 list for 10 consecutive years.

Building the future with Vision

2027

We created a bold vision for ourselves in

FY 22-23, setting a roadmap for the next

five years under the aegis of Vision 2027.

With this strategy, we seek to double sales

and add about 300 restaurants in the

next five years, while fortifying market

leadership and delivering a return on

capital of over 40%. With an investment of

over H14+ bn in the network, we expect this

expansion to deliver a high single-digit

SSSG, 18-20% operating EBITDA margin,

over 40% return on capital employed, over

25% plus return on equity, and over 60%

plus free cash flow conversion. We aim to

drive this strategically through our most

potent business drivers – meals, omni-

channel customer engagement, network

expansion and financial outperformance.

Our meal strategy will focus on protecting

market leadership through menu

innovation and marketing. To improve

seamlessness of the customer experience,

our omnichannel strategy will integrate

channels and touchpoints into a single

McDonald’s platform. Additionally, as a part

of our commitment to accelerate network

expansion, the business will strengthen its

position in existing markets and expand

into underserved niches. These initiatives

will not only improve our business

performance but also help realise this

vision.

Pursuing purpose-driven growth

The concept of purpose-driven growth,

which upholds inclusivity sustainability,

reflective of changing employee and

stakeholder needs, serves as the foundation

of our growth strategy. We are focused on

priorities that influence long-term growth

and priorities that enable us to expand

our purpose of feeding and fostering

communities.

In addition to delivering accelerated

business results and building a resilient

growth business, our priorities include

social responsibility, risk management,

and sustainable stewardship of our People,

Food and Planet. To accomplish this, we

are constantly integrating environmental,

social, and governance (ESG) priorities into

our business strategy and implementing

responsible practices that are consistent

with our purpose, vision, and values.

What lies ahead

As an organisation, we made remarkable

progress across our strategic growth

levers, which included driving profitable

growth, increasing wallet share, exploring

whitespace opportunities, expanding

our geographic footprint, and increasing

market penetration. I believe we are on a

strong growth trajectory and will continue

to build on our competitive strengths and

widen our business advantage.

Vision 2027, our velocity growth plan,

provides us with a consistent framework,

and we are geared up to make sure our

go-forward strategy also reflects the new

operating environment and consistent

support from well-wishers like you. We are

ready to address the opportunities of the

future through the institutionalisation of

this vision and are committed to aggressive

footprint expansion, modernising

restaurants, and unlocking new growth

prospects. We will consistently drive

innovations in our menu, and efficiencies

in our operations leading to enhanced

profitability.

We wrapped FY 22-23 with outstanding

performance. We are energised and

confident about accelerating our growth

in FY 23-24 to deliver an industry-leading

performance and maximise shareholder

value. As I say, the best is yet to be.

In closing, I would like to thank our

shareholders, for your continued

investment, our customers for your

continued support and enjoyment, and

the entire Westlife Foodworld team for all

you do every day to serve customers and

communities across West and South India.

Income tax related matters

x

Pursuant to search and seizure conducted in 2018, the income-tax authorities issued an Order

in July 2021 under Section 153A of the Income-Tax Act, 1961 directing the Group to file revised

returns for 7 years under block assessment. Block assessment for the period A.Y 2013-14 to A.Y.

2019-20 was completed during the year and the tax authorities had raised a demand amounting

to H477.53 Million. There were apparent errors in determining the tax demand of H477.53

Million for which the Group has filed rectification applications in July 2021. The rectification

orders were passed in February 2022. However, while determining the revised demand as per

the rectification order, multiple errors were made in the Tax Computation Sheet resulting in

a tax demand of H425.49 Million against original demand of H477.53 Million. The Group has

approached the income tax authorities to revise the rectification order. Upon the rectification

being given effect to by the income-tax authorities, the possible tax demand shall stand rectified

from H425.49 Million to H75.45 Million. The Group has also filed an appeal in October 2021 before

the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) against the origional tax demand of H477.53 Million.

The hearing is yet to be concluded and the company believes the case is not tenable.

Notes

i)

estimate the timings of cash outflows, if any, in respect of the above as it is determinable

only on receipt of judgements / decisions pending with various forums / authorities.

provided for where provisions are required and disclosed as contingent liabilities where

applicable, in its financial statements. The Group does not expect the outcome of these

proceedings to have a materially adverse effect on its financial position. The Group does not

expect any reimbursements in respect of the above contingent liabilities.
