An organization that is nearing a century

of its existence and touching a wide

Indian diaspora must calibrate itself

constantly.

We

at

Raymond

have

demonstrated this by strengthening our

core to shape an organization for

tomorrow

with

our

affirmative

corporate

actions. Now, with a sharper

focus on our two core

businesses of Lifestyle and

Realty while being a net debt free group,

Raymond is primed for growth to achieve

new milestones.

GROWTH

Forward-looking statement

This Annual Report contains statements about expected future

events and financial and operating results of Raymond Group,

which may be classified as forward-looking. By their nature,

forward-looking statements require the Company to make

assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties.

There is high possibility that the assumptions, predictions and

other forward-looking statements will not prove to be accurate.

Further, certain key performance indicators mentioned in the

Annual Report are based on classifications made by the

Company. Do not place undue reliance on forward-looking

statements as a number of factors could cause assumptions and

actual future results or events to differ materially from those

expressed in these forward-looking statements.

‘The Raymond Group’ or (‘The Company’) includes reference to

Raymond Limited (standalone as well as consolidated), its

Subsidiaries, Joint Venture and Associates.:

Dear Shareholders,

It has always been a pleasure to write to you this annual

message and apprise you of the business performance for

the year. The year gone by has left its mark particularly on

the Indian economy that reached the landmark of

becoming the 5th largest economy in the world and

optimistically reaching $5 trillion GDP milestone by FY27

seems to be a new reality. To attain this, Indian economy

will require to register a strong growth and there are

numerous growth drivers to fuel the same.

The core strength of India lies in its population of 1.4 billion

and diversified demographics. India has a relatively young

population with ~26% below 14 years and ~67% between

15-64 years when compared to the developed world. Even as

the world is striving to fight away the economic fallout of the

pandemic, inflation and recession, fears have kept global

consumption damp. However, India’s overall domestic growth

is an exemplary tale of resilience. While there have been a few

blips, recovery has stayed on course and Indian consumer’s

demand for goods and services will

remain robust in the coming decade.

Additionally, the altering

geopolitical shifts are redefining the

way business is done across the

world with the rising consciousness

of buyers carefully evaluating

sourcing destinations. Consumer

consciousness is undergoing a

rapid transformation and

embracing change is the new norm.

It is heartening to see the rise of a

new age India booming with hope

and optimism.

Considering this backdrop, I am

extremely optimistic about India’s

positioning as the manufacturer to

the world. Our resilience as a

nation has proved us to be an

outlier in comparison to the western

world and today, we are in a bright

spot as a surging economy and a

preferred sourcing destination for

the Textile and Apparel Industry.

The rapid strides taken by Indian industry across sectors is

hard to ignore and has also led to a growing population

of new age India who are spending on buying smaller

apartments. This context spells good news for Raymond

Group that today has two Core businesses namely –

Lifestyle and Real Estate.

Energising the Cores

As a 98-year young brand, we have always strived to

reinvent ourselves for the future. In an endeavour to

emerge as an agile, future ready organisation with a

sharper business focus we have embarked on new

initiatives that have empowered us to achieve our goal.

Recently, we announced the sale of our FMCG Business

which has enabled us to become net debt free at group

level. The sale of deodorants and sexual wellness

portfolio along with the Park Avenue and Kamasutra

trademarks which is under Raymond Consumer Care Ltd

(RCCL), to Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) for

`2,825 Crores is a move in this direction.

The recent announcement of the demerger of our lifestyle

business into Raymond Consumer Care Ltd will create a

listed entity with pure-play B2C-focused lifestyle business.

Going forward, we intend to structure Raymond into two

separate entities — one focused on Real estate and the

other on the legacy fabric & apparel business. The fabric

& apparel business is being demerged to the Raymond

Consumer Care Ltd which will be listed, with Raymond

shareholders getting four shares of RCCL for every five

shares held in Raymond Ltd.

Fashioning the Future

At the heart of our heritage, Raymond is integral to India

across households – from the common man to the ones

seeking luxury. It is rare to find a trusted brand name that

holds immense pride in hearts and minds of people and

spans across price points. We remain committed to offer

the best in fashion through all our brands while holding

onto our innate core values of Trust, Quality and

Excellence which will always be at the soul of all our

initiatives. We are committed to our craft of creating the

finest textiles and apparel in India while being inspired by

the latest fashion trends through all our brands.

Building New Benchmarks

Fulfilling the dreams of new age India seeking high

quality homes of their own at value-based pricing has

been the goal of Raymond Realty. I believe that the belly

of the market lies in building 1, 2 and 3 BHK homes.

Having launched Raymond Realty in 2019, we have made

phenomenal progress in the sector with the launch of

three projects. The highlight of the year was the

completion of the first 3 towers of our maiden project

TenX Habitat 2 years ahead of RERA timelines which was

a big milestone. The testimony to our success is that 80%

of the inventory has already been sold in our projects

TenX Habitat and Address by GS. Additionally, we are

expanding through an asset light model for this business

through JDAs. Going forward, we envisage Raymond

Realty as a core business which will continue and take on

new projects and JDAs in the MMR region that has

enormous growth potential. A great product with right

pricing has amped up our sales velocity coupled with fast

paced construction activity have been encouraging.

New Ideas for Young Minds

Beyond Business, it has been our endeavour to do our bit

for the society. Through our Singhania schools we believe

in offering holistic value driven education has been the

stepladder of great learning. I have taken on a mission to

educate 1,00,000 children a year. As I pen this message,

we are educating 20,000+ students through our seven

Singhania schools and I hope to take this dream ahead.

To conclude, this annual report is a special one as from

next year we would have two separate listed entities

namely Raymond Ltd and Raymond Consumer Care Ltd.

Our journey during the last financial year has been

stupendous where we achieved the highest revenue and

profitability and have set new benchmarks for ourselves.

It’s a wonderful feeling to have delivered on a promise as

we remain steadfast to reshape the organisation for the

future which is now Primed for Growth.

Gautam Hari Singhania

Chairman and: Managing Director, Raymond Ltd.

About Raymond & Year in Review

About Raymond & Year in Review

Dear Shareholders,

It has been a remarkable year of turnaround for us at

Raymond! In the last 3 years, we have steadily been at the

forefront of implementing initiatives that will amp up our agility

while imbibing a sense of financial prudence. Having

delivered consistent six quarters of strong performance with

highest revenue and profitability has etched a new history in

Raymond. Creating shareholder value while sharpening the

focus towards our two growth engines namely Lifestyle

business (which is primarily our Textile and Apparel Business)

and Real Estate business have been critical to our journey and

going forward will pave the way for a future ready Raymond.

This financial year is a testimony to the promises delivered of

emerging as a net debt free company. We have demerged

our lifestyle business into Raymond Consumer Care (RCCL)

which will be listed, with Raymond shareholders getting four

shares of RCCL for every five shares held in Raymond Ltd. The

demerger of lifestyle business to RCCL will create an exclusive

listed entity with pure-play B2C-focused lifestyle business. The

lifestyle business consists of suiting business with

manufacturing plants, B2C shirting, branded apparel and

subsidiaries including garmenting business and B2B shirting.

Consequently, the currently listed Raymond Ltd will primarily

become a real estate company with investments in

engineering and denim businesses.

Nearing the pivotal century mark, our key focus is to now

accelerate our transformation. We have thus embarked on

a strategic journey at Raymond with which we intend to

reinvent our growth path. As far as our B2C businesses of

Branded Textile and Branded Apparel is concerned, we

successfully leveraged the core strength of our brands

coupled with our wide distribution network across the

country. We worked relentlessly on product innovation and

introduced fresh collections throughout the year for all our

brands such as Park Avenue, Raymond Ready to Wear,

ColorPlus, Parx etc. In addition to regular shopping by

customers, FY23 had incremental wedding dates, wherein

we witnessed good demand for our branded textile and

branded apparel products. Our latest addition ‘Ethnix by

Raymond’ witnessed a good traction with consumers

especially during festivities and celebrations.

Clothier to the World

India is in a bright spot and we at Raymond intend to

capitalize on being the clothier to the world. In the exports

market, adoption of China Plus One strategy and vendor

consolidation by global brands continued to drive the

performance of the Garmenting segment.

We are happy to share the key consolidated financial

highlights for the financial year FY23. We recorded the

highest ever revenue of `8,337 Crores, a 31% increase from

previous year revenues of `6,348 Crores. We also recorded

the highest ever EBITDA of `1,322 Crores with EBITDA

margin of 15.9%, a 50% increase from previous year EBITDA

of `881 Crores with EBITDA margin of 13.9%. That apart, we

recorded the highest ever Net Profit of `529 Crores, doubling

from `260 Crores in the previous year. All businesses

contributed in delivering the highest EBITDA in the quarter

with Branded Textile, Branded Apparel and Real Estate

leading the front.

Sprinting ahead for Growth

FY22-23 year saw a focus on cost optimisation across all our

businesses and delivered 15.9% EBITDA margin on a

consolidated basis while managing the growth. Additionally,

continued focus on working capital optimisation has driven

free cash flows which helped in further reducing the debt

during the year.

Further, the recent demerger will result into two separate

entities - one focused on lifestyle and one focused on the

realty business. These two independent net debt free entities

will have a clear path in terms of growth opportunities.

Continuing the Winning Streak

The branded textile segment maintained a

quarter-on-quarter strong performance with a top line of

`3,364 Crores in FY23, a 21% growth over `2,789 Crores in

FY22 with EBITDA margin of 20.9%. Strong topline growth

achieved through higher volumes and realisations driven by

consumer demand throughout the year. Raymond is the

largest shirting player in India and the opportunities relating

to this look extremely strong. Alongside, the suiting category

also has a large value proposition through innovative

product offerings at attractive price points.

The top line growth for the branded apparel business was

driven by incremental customer conversions especially in

EBOs and MBOs. The growth was showcased by all our

brands. Our brand 'Ethnix by Raymond' showed good

performance and currently has a network of 61 stores. Going

forward we intend to open more stores. Our branded

apparel segment showed a healthy sales growth of 49% to

`1,328 Crores in FY23 as compared to `891 Crores during

the previous year with EBITDA margins of 10.8%.

The high value cotton shirting also showed strong sales of

33% to `762 Crores as opposed to the previous year of `572

Crores with EBITDA margins of 11.1%.

We continued to further strengthen our retail footprint by

opening about 150 new stores during the year led by ‘Ethnix

by Raymond’ EBOs along with new EBOs for Raymond Ready

to Wear, Park Avenue and ColorPlus stores. The expansion

was across metros, Tier I to Tier VI towns on Pan India basis.

Amidst the backdrop of evolving consumer sentiments, we

have witnessed strong traction in secondary sales with a

significant improvement in the average transaction value in

The Raymond Shop network.

The garmenting business is also shaping well. We have

reported a strong growth of 52% to `1,100 Crores compared

to `725 Crores in the previous year, with EBITDA margins of

7.6%, due to higher demand from our existing and newly

acquired global customers. The China Plus One strategy

makes India one of its largest beneficiaries and Raymond has

leveraged this into opportunity. We have plans to expand our

capacity and become one of the top three suit players in the

world.

Real-estate has become a core business for us and the total

value of bookings for the three projects amounted to `1,609

Crores during the year. The sales grew 58% to `1,115 Crores

from `707 Crores in the previous year, with EBITDA margins

of 25.7%. Incepted merely four years ago, we have built a

strong realty team of nearly 300 members and have been

successful to the extent that we have delivered first three

towers in TenX Habitat project two years ahead of the RERA

deadline. We launched our 3rd project Ten X Era in Thane

and received about 100 bookings within 7 days of launch.

We are also expanding beyond Thane in MMR region

through asset light model of joint development with land

owners focus on value-based offerings

The engineering business has also shown promising growth

prospects. The sales grew by 6% to `864 Crores in FY23 as

compared to `812 Crores in the previous year, with EBITDA

margins of 14.1%. Raymond is the market leader in the steel

files category, with a 65% domestic market share and a 25%

global manufacturing capacity. We also supply ring gears to

the country's top OEMs and have a 45-55% market share in

the passenger and commercial vehicle categories.

Sharpen, Innovate and Transform

Having battled numerous headwinds, we are committed to

drive continuous innovation, eliminate inefficiencies, and

enhance productivity across business verticals. Going

forward, we will further galvanise our growth with key

near-term priorities focused on our two main cores of

Lifestyle and Real Estate Business. As we prime ourselves for

next phase of growth in the Raymond journey, we look

forward to your unrelenting support.

Note :- 1 - STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES AND PRACTICES

1(i) Raymond Limited ('RL' or the 'Company' or the 'Holding

Company') [CIN: L17117MH1925PLC001208] and its

subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries

together referred to as the ‘Group’) and its associates and

joint ventures mainly deals in Textiles, Lifestyle, Branded

apparel, Engineering, FMCG, Auto components, etc.

The Group and its associates and joint ventures have its

wide network of operations in local as well as in foreign

markets. The Group and its associates and joint ventures

sells its products through multiple channels including

wholesale, franchisee, retail etc. The Holding Company

had commenced activities to develop part of its land for

residential / commercial purpose a few years back.

The Company is a public limited company and is listed

on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock

Exchange (NSE). During the current year, the outstanding

Global Depository Receipt (GDR’s) has been delisted

from Luxembourg Stock Exchange effective November

4, 2022. The Company has its registered office at Plot

No.156/H.No. 2, Village Zadgaon, Ratnagiri - 415 612,

Maharashtra.

(a) Basis of preparation

(i) Compliance with Ind AS

These consolidated financial statements ('financial

statements') have been prepared in accordance

with the Indian Accounting Standards (hereinafter

referred to as the 'Ind AS') as notified by Ministry of

Corporate Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the

Companies Act, 2013 ('Act') read with the Companies

(Indian Accounting standards) Rules, 2015, as

amended, and other relevant provisions of the Act

and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange

Board of India (SEBI)..

The accounting policies are applied consistently to

all the periods presented in the financial statements.

The financial statements of the Group have been

consolidated using uniform accounting policies.

(ii) Historical cost convention

The financial statements have been prepared on a

historical cost basis, except for the following:

1)

certain financial assets and liabilities that are

measured at fair value;

2)

assets held for sale - measured at the lower of

carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell;

3)

defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at

fair value;

(iii) Current non-current classification

All assets and liabilities have been classified as

current or non-current based on the Group’s normal

operating cycle for each of its businesses, as per the

criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Act.

(iv) Rounding of amounts

All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and

notes have been rounded off to the nearest lakhs as

per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise

stated.

(b) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting

(i) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Holding

Company has control. The Holding Company

controls an entity when the Holding Company is

exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from

its involvement with the entity and has the ability

to affect those returns through its power to direct

the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are

fully consolidated from the date on which control

is transferred to the Holding Company. They are

deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to

account for business combinations by the Group.

The Group combines the financial statements of the

Holding Company and its subsidiaries line by line

adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity,

income and expenses. Intercompany transactions,

balances and unrealised gains on transactions

between group companies are eliminated.

Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the

transaction provides evidence of an impairment

of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of

subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to

ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the

Holding Company.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of

subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated:

managing director, all of them constitute as chief

operating decision maker ('CODM').

(n) Borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at net of transaction

costs incurred and measured at amortised cost. Any

difference between the proceeds (net of transaction

costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the

Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the period

of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

(o) Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs consist of interest, ancillary costs and

other costs in connection with the borrowing of funds

and exchange differences arising from foreign currency

borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an

adjustment to interest costs..

Interest and other borrowing costs attributable to

qualifying assets are capitalised upto the date such assets

are ready for their intended use. Other interest and

borrowing costs are charged to Statement of Profit and

Loss.

(p) Provisions and contingent liabilities

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present

legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events,

it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required

to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably

estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future

operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of

management’s best estimate of the expenditure required

to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting

period. The discount rate used to determine the present

value is a pre tax rate that reflects current market

assessments of the time value of money and the risks

specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to

the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

Contingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect of possible

obligations that arise from past events but their existence

will be confirmed by the occurrence or non occurrence

of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within

the control of the Group or where any present obligation

cannot be measured in terms of future outflow of

resources or where a reliable estimate of the obligation

cannot be made.

A contingent asset is disclosed, where an inflow of

economic benefits is probable. The Group shall not

recognize a contingent asset unless the recovery is

virtually certain.

(q) Revenue recognition

The Group derives revenues primarily from sale of

manufactured goods, traded goods and related services.

The Group has also engaged in real estate property

development.

Revenue is recognized on satisfaction of performance

obligation upon transfer of control of promised products

or services to customers in an amount that reflects the

consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those

products or services.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price

(which is the consideration, adjusted to discounts,

incentives and returns, etc., if any) that is allocated

to that performance obligation. These are generally

accounted for as variable consideration estimated in the

same period the related sales occur. The methodology

and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns

are monitored and adjusted regularly in the light of

contractual and legal obligations, historical trends, past

experience and projected market conditions."

The Group operates a loyalty programme for the

customers and franchisees of the Group for the sale of

goods. The customers accumulate points for purchases

made which entitles them to discount on future purchases.

A contract liability for the award points is recognized

at the time of the sale. Revenue is recognized when the

points are redeemed or on expiry. The expenditure of

loyalty programme is netted-off to revenue.

The Group recognises provision for sales return, based

on the historical results, measured on net basis of the

margin of the sale. Therefore, a refund liability, included

in other current liabilities, are recognized for the products

expected to be returned.

The Group does not expect to have any contracts where

the period between the transfer of the promised goods

or services to the customer and payment by the customer

exceeds one year. As a consequence, it does not adjust

any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.

The Group satisfies a performance obligation and

recognises revenue over time, if one of the following

criteria is met:

1.

The customer simultaneously receives and consumes

the benefits provided by the Group's performance as

the Group performs; or

2.

The Group's performance creates or enhances

an asset that the customer controls as the asset is

created or enhanced; or

3.

The Group's performance does not create an asset

with an alternative use to the Group and an entity

has an enforceable right to payment for performance

completed to date.

For performance obligations where one of the above

conditions are not met, revenue is recognised at the

point in time at which the performance obligation is

satisfied."

Revenue from sale of products and services are

recognised at the time of satisfaction of performance

obligation, except Revenue from real estate property

development where in revenue is recognised over

the time, from the financial year in which the entity's

right to payment for performance completed, is

established. In determining whether an entity has

right to payment, the entity shall consider whether it

would have an enforceable right to demand or retain:

Mrs. Shephali Ruia was included in the ‘Promoter and Promoter

Group’ merely because of her relation (“Sister”) as per the

definition of Promoter Group as provided in Regulation 2(1)

(pp) of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements)

Regulations, 2018 as amended, and her children, Mr. Advait

Ruia and Mr. Ritwik Ruia do not fall within the ambit of said

definition. Mrs. Shephali Ruia and her children are financially

independent and take independent investment decisions,

without consulting other Members of the Promoter/Promoter

Group. They are in no way controlling or participating in any of

the business activities carried out by the Company.

Mrs. Shephali Ruia, Mr. Advait Ruia and Mr. Ritwik Ruia have

in their respective request letters informed the Company that

they are not involved in the operations of the Company in any

manner whatsoever and neither exercise any control over the

Company, directly or indirectly, nor do they have any influence

over the Board of Directors or hold any Key Managerial

Personnel position in the Company.

Mrs. Shephali Ruia, Mr. Advait Ruia and Mr. Ritwik Ruia, in their

respective request letters, have also separately confirmed that

each one of them:

a)

does not hold more than 10% of the voting rights in the

not represented on the Board (including not having a

nominee director) of the Company;

e)

f)

is not ‘wilful defaulter’ as per the Reserve Bank of India

Guidelines; and

g)

is not fugitive economic offenders.

In view of the above, and on the basis of the above rationale

and the confirmations received from each of the persons

mentioned above, the Board of Directors of the Company, at its

meeting held on May 9, 2023, analyzed the requests made by

Mrs. Shephali Ruia, Mr. Advait Ruia and Mr. Ritwik Ruia and in

compliance with Regulation 31A of the SEBI Listing Regulations,

approved the request for reclassification, inter alia subject to

approval by the members, the Stock Exchanges where the

shares of the Company are listed i.e. BSE Limited and National

Stock Exchange of India Limited (collectively “Stock Exchanges”),

and/or such other approval, if any as may be necessary in this

regard.

As required under Regulation 31A(8) of the SEBI Listing

Regulations, the Company had intimated the Stock Exchanges

on May 9, 2023 regarding receipt of reclassification requests

from Mrs. Shephali Ruia, Mr. Advait Ruia and Mr. Ritwik Ruia.

In accordance with Regulation 31A of the SEBI Listing

Regulations, the reclassification of status of a shareholder from

the ‘Promoter and Promoter Group’ category to the ‘Public’

category, inter alia requires approval of the Members of the

Company. Therefore, the aforesaid requests are being placed

before the Members of the Company for approval by way of an

Ordinary Resolution.

The Members may note that Company is in compliance with

the requirement for minimum public shareholding as required

under Regulation 38 of the SEBI Listing Regulations. The

Company neither has trading in its shares suspended by the

Stock Exchanges nor any outstanding dues to the SEBI, Stock

Exchanges and the Depositories as mentioned in Regulation

31A(c) of the SEBI Listing Regulations.

The Promoter(s) seeking reclassification and persons related to

them shall not vote to approve such reclassification request.

The Board of Directors of the Company recommends the

Ordinary Resolution set out in Item No. 6 of the Notice for the

approval by the Members of the Company.

None of the Directors or Key Managerial Personnel of

the Company (except Mr. Gautam Hari Singhania and

Mrs. Nawaz Gautam Singhania) or their relatives, are in anyway

concerned or interested in the proposed resolution as set out in

Item No. 6 of the Notice.
