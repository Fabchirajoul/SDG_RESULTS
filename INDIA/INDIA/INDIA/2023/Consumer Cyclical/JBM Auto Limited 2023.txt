Letter from the Chairman’s Desk

Message from Vice Chairman &: Managing

LETTER FROM THE

CHAIRMAN’S DESK: Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to write to you at the end

of an exciting year in JBM Auto’s journey of innovation

and excellence, as manifest in the Company’s sustained

and sustainable growth across the key metrics of its

performance. FY23 was, for us, a year of reinforcing our

commitment to clean mobility, in line with the Government

of India’s stated sustainability development goals. It was

a period of enhancing our innovation thrust to deliver

more energy-efficient and sustainable solutions to cater

to the emerging consumer preference for e-mobility. We

proactively partnered with the Government in its ‘Make

in India’ journey to create a self-sufficient ecosystem for

driving India’s sustainable growth. Our focus on e-mobility

remains central to our growth strategy, and we shall

continue to invest in augmenting our EV presence.

Robust resilience

The positivity in the organization resonated with the overall

resilience in the Indian economy, which remained on the

track of growth despite the global headwinds witnessed in

FY23. The World Bank estimated India’s GDP growth at 6.9%

for FY23 and 6.3% in FY24, with inflation likely to moderate

in the coming quarters. In line with the macroeconomic

environment, the Indian auto industry has also remained on

the growth path, clocking its highest-ever annual domestic

passenger vehicle sales in 2022, which was a robust 23%

growth over the previous year.

In January 2023, India has surpassed Japan in terms of

auto sales last year to become the third largest Auto

market globally for the first time. The industry is expected

to grow 10-15% in FY24, led mainly by the momentum in

the domestic vehicle market, and further aided by impetus

to the Electric Vehicles (EVs) segment as a result of the

favorable government policies initiatives and rising pollution

concerns. India is on track to become one of the world’s

major EV markets by 2030, expanding at a 49% CAGR

between 2021 and 2030. The Indian EV market is likely

to see a total investment opportunity of more than USD

200 billion over the next 8-10 years as the focus towards

decarbonization gets further sharpened.

Favorable policies

The supportive government policies have emerged as

a key propeller of the auto industry’s growth in India.

The Government encourages foreign investment in the

automobile sector, and has allowed 100% FDI under the

automatic route. FY23 witnessed a slew of initiatives by

the Governments at the Centre and in States, to boost the

automobile sector. In Union Budget 2023, the Government

announced various measures to strengthen the industry

growth. These included a reduction in the basic customs

duty rate from 21% to 13%, an increase in rebate on

personal income tax from ₹5 lakh per annum to ₹7 lakh

per annum, focus on greener mobility, and increase in fund

allocation towards the Vehicle Scrappage Policy, etc.

Several EV targeted initiatives were also taken during

the year to promote the adoption of electric vehicles in

the country. The Indian government has committed that

by 2030, 30% of the new vehicle sales in India would be

electric. This effort to make the adoption of electric vehicles

(EVs) a strategic goal fits well with India’s target of reducing

carbon intensity per unit of GDP by 45% by 2030. The

Government’s National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020,

which seeks to enhance national energy security, alleviate

adverse environmental impacts from road transport

vehicles, and boost domestic manufacturing capabilities for

Electric Vehicles, is a significant step in the right direction.

The Government of India’s decision, in July 2022, to advance

from e10 to e20 and likelihood of moving towards e30

target from 2030 to 2025 was a notable initiative, which is

expected to give a big boost to the country’s EV industry

growth. The government has also introduced a battery-

swapping policy, which will allow drained batteries to

be swapped with charged ones at designated charging

stations, thus making EVs more viable for potential

customers.

Further, to promote local production in line with its ‘Make

in India’ focus, the Government has raised the customs

duty on fully imported luxury cars and EVs from 60% to

70%. In fact, the ‘Make in India’ initiative, along with other

government policies like Atmanirbhar Bharat, Fame subsidy,

Industry 4.0, PLIs, etc., are all designed to push the auto

sector’s growth in the coming years.

These policies and measures are aimed at giving a big push

to the automobile sector, with special focus on electric

vehicles. The Government focus is on boosting local

production of EVs and EV components, which will lower

costs and consequently encourage EV adoption.

Harnessing the green opportunity

Amid the marked paradigm shift in the Indian automotive

industry towards alternative / less energy intensive options,

JBM Auto has emerged as a frontrunner in maximizing

the opportunity for growth in the EV segment. As an

end-to-end well-to-wheel solution-based enterprize in

the mobility space, we remain committed to sustainability

and green manufacturing. Our complete ecosystem for

electric buses stands out as a model of excellence, with a

huge potential for scalability for the organization. Our new

ultra-modern plant, built around the principles of green

manufacturing, will help the Company further push its

sustainable growth agenda. With our deep-rooted strengths

and expertize in the business, we strongly believe that we

are ideally poised to harness the emerging clean mobility

opportunity, and will continue to invest in the right levers of

EV growth.

Investing in people growth

Our ability to successfully maximize the growth opportunity

depends, in large measure, on the passion, dedication and

commitment of our JBM families, who continue to partner

us in our sustainability-driven growth journey. At JBM

Auto, we are dedicated to strengthening our employee

E-Verse through proactive initiatives aimed at providing our

people with a dynamic and agile ecosystem to nurture their

capabilities.

During FY23, we launched several programs to enrich our

employee experience, while keeping them motivated to

deliver performance excellence. With the launch of the

JBM L&OD framework, we took a major step forward

towards the capability development of our people. Our

newly launched e-learning platform will help empower our

employees through skill and knowledge enhancement.

The implementation of the HR People Capability Maturity

Model (PCMM) has helped us assess the maturity of

our HR practices and processes, and identify the areas

of improvement. We took several steps during the year

to strengthen our HR systems and processes, and also

launched a Shared Service Center that provides a single

point of contact for the employees. Acknowledging and

appreciating employee excellence is integral to our HR

philosophy and we further augmented our rewards program

during the year.

With the launch of the third leg of our Sankalp Siddhi

initiative – ‘Sankalp se Siddhi 3.0’, we took a significant

leap in our journey towards organizational and individual

development, with focus on employee health and welfare,

education and career, as well as social and cultural

development.

Empowering through skill development

Our Skill Development Centers (SDCs) continued to drive

our efforts towards skilling and upskilling of youth during

the year. More than 2,200 candidates were trained and

placed in FY23, taking the total number of youth benefited

in the last eight years to over 12,000.

We signed an MoU with Andhra Pradesh State Skill

Development Corporation to engage and implement

apprenticeship-based training programs for freshers, ITIs, as

well as Diploma and Graduate candidates. We also signed

an MoU with Bihar Skill Development Mission for providing

Apprenticeship to 100 candidates. We trained 24 candidates

under our MoU with Directorate of Industrial Training,

Arunachal Pradesh.

We will continue to scale up this initiative to create a bigger

pool of skilled manpower for the country.

Financial performance

I am happy to report that your Company posted a robust

growth in a challenging macro environment during FY23.

Net revenue from operations increased by 20.81% to

`3,857.38 crore as compared to `3,193.05 crore in FY22.

The Company’s net worth, as on March 31, 2023, was up

by 14.90%, at `1,029.76 crore, as against `896.21 crore on

March 31, 2022. The book value per share correspondingly

went up by 14.90% to `87.09 per share, from `75.79 per

share in FY22.

In conclusion

The prospects for sustainable future growth are clearly

bright and I am confident that the continued support and

contribution of the Company’s management team and

employees will help us leverage the same effectively, in our

collective interest. I would like to thank all of them, and also

our esteemed stakeholders, whose sustained confidence

continues to motivate and inspire us to deliver consistently

to the needs of our expanding customer E-Verse.

Thank You and Jai Hind!

MANAGING DIRECTOR: Dear Shareholders,

The global automotive industry is in the midst of an

extraordinary revolution. The green energy transition taking

place globally is powering a new growth momentum, with

path breaking technological advancements in electric

vehicles. This transition coupled with the massive green

investments leading to green impact, is fueling the auto

sector towards transforming the eco system with speed and

desterity. The demand for sustainable and clean mobility

is taking the centerstage, necessitating a sharper focus on

new technologies based on emerging trends. This, in turn,

is driving a new level of innovation by the industry to match

the evolving consumer preferences and aspirations.

As the world’s third-largest automotive market in the

world, India is at the forefront of this change, led by the

enhanced focus by the Government on clean mobility. The

G20 presidency has emerged as a motivating and inspiring

driver of this transformation, with India identifying green

hydrogen and climate financing among the key priorities

under its leadership. The Prime Minister’s vision on

e-mobility is also aligned with India’s G20 presidency theme

of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam – The World is One Family!’,

which is centered around the ethos of collective global

efforts to combat key problems like pollution and climate

change, among others.

This vision came to the fore during the Prime Minister’s

recent visit to the United States, when the two nations

decided to build a payment security system to put 10,000

e-buses on the roads. The move will give a major boost to

India’s focussed efforts towards reducing greenhouse gas

emissions through electrification of buses. This will play

a major role in meeting customer expectations of clean,

connected, comfortable and safe public transportation.

The Hon’ble PM led Cabinet’s decision to allocate `57,613

crore for deployment of 10,000 electric buses will truly

take electric buses to the grassroot level pan India. This is a

momentous decision that sees e-mobility as a necessity for

much of India and especially at a time when the country has

committed towards being Net Zero by 2070 and is presiding

G-20. Also, the National e-Bus Programme (NEBP) that aims

to deploy 50,000 electric buses pan India and the FAME-III

policy framework expected in FY24, will further really propel

green public transportation and will aid the development

and expansion of an EV ecosystem across the country.

Ready to seize the future

The OEM Business of JBM Auto is spearheading the EV

revolution through JBM E-Verse – ecosystem solution

with end-to-end convergence for electric mobility. Our

mission is to transform public mobility by creating new and

sustainable global benchmarks. We aim to create a world

where public transport is just not a need but a choice, a

preferred option for travelling. JBM has been a pathbreaker

in the e-mobility segment, and we are here to change how

people commute. JBM has redefined public transportation

through its best-in-class, modern and technologically

superior electric buses that have established benchmarks

in passenger comfort, safety, affordability, and innovation,

reflecting the key ethos of our products. As an organization,

JBM Auto is ideally positioned to make the most of

these multiple opportunities catalysed by government

policy support and backed by proactive actions with

time-bound targets.

The auto systems and tooling business of JBM Auto have

been growing consistently by way of disruption in value

pools for all our key customers. Our efforts to enhance

modularity have led to high asset utilization, improved

productivity and time to market. The upcoming year is

going to be a year of transformation enabling JBM Auto to

change its orbit with respect to automation, innovation and

value creation for all stakeholders.

Celebrating our customers

At the core of JBM Auto is our belief in our ability to

celebrate our customers by delivering reliable and

everlasting experiences. Steering this journey at JBM Auto

is our robust nucleus of world class customer experience

which is based on the bedrock of expertise and experience.

Our sustained investments in the three core pillars, namely

Technology, Innovative business models and People (TIP),

has been a consistent propeller of our growth journey.

As we align ourselves to the emerging trends and move

ahead towards creating newer benchmarks, we are getting

more robust by incorporating frugal manufacturing

and digitalization, thereby, reducing time to market for

our customers.

Digitization and Artificial Intelligence

Our efforts towards digitizing our processes and systems

with latest technologies are being executed at a greater

momentum. AI and Digital Manufacturing has been

seamlessly integrated across our business resulting in

real time data-based decision making. At JBM, we have

10 comprehensive pillars of excellence, and they factor

in everything that must be considered for creating

a world-class product or solution. These range from

Technology to TCO to performance to manufacturing to

global deployment.

Making India the EV Capital of the World

Aligned to our vision of making India the EV Capital of the

world, we are committed to contribute to this incredible

vision and ensure that COP nations meet their Net Zero

targets. With a promise towards curating sustainable

solutions, we aim to create a happy and healthy planet

for our future generations. Conserving the environment

is the key focus area for JBM Group’s Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs), which are aligned to the United

Nations’ SDGs.

Strengthening the e-bus ecosystem

JBM electric buses, part of the JBM E-Verse ecosystem, are

innovatively built around our in-house capabilities in fast

charging infrastructure, high efficiency Li-ion EV batteries,

power infra, and a network that delivers round-the-clock

service while ensuring negligible downtime. We believe

these capabilities will help steer our 2025-26 Goal of 1

billion e-kilometers, from the current 50 million green

kilometers already clocked by JBM e-buses till CY. Moreover,

we have over 50% market share in the private bus segment

over the last 3 years, which is a true validation of our

product offerings across multiple applications by various

private customers with varied requirements.

Expanding frontiers of growth

Our orderbook for CY 2023 and CY 2024 stands testimony

to our clean mobility commitment, with JBM Auto having

won orders for 5,000 electric buses under multiple projects,

making the Company “Numero Uno” in e-buses. Aligned

to this, we have increased our manufacturing capacity of

e-buses to cater to these orders, as also the future demand.

We have created the world’s largest integrated dedicated

EV ecosystem facility and e-bus manufacturing (excluding

China). Our new manufacturing plant has led to further

augmentation of the Company’s production edge, making

JBM’s electric bus manufacturing facility the largest in India

and one of the largest in the world.

The brand-new world-class test track is built within the

plant premises and has multiple tracks for various kinds

of stringent tests. Our efforts to reduce the product

development and go-to-market time are also yielding

results, with significant investments made in our R&D

capabilities in the form of the latest CAD tools, CAE software

and virtual simulation to enhance our predictive capability.

These, and other measures that are in the pipeline, will

create an enabling environment for JBMA’s sustained

long-term growth, and will contribute significantly to India’s

carbon footprint reduction goals.

During the financial year 2022-23, our Auto Systems

business revenues increased by 36.32% to Rs. 3,049.69

crore, Tool Room division revenue increased by 4.92% to

Rs. 268.02 crore and the OEM Division registered revenues

of Rs. 549.74 crore. As on 31st July 2023, the market

capitalization of JBM Auto stood at Rs. 16,574 crore. JBM

Auto has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at

good rates of return and the stock has done incredibly well

with a 775% return over the last 5 years.

I welcome you to the JBM e-verse, the complete EV

ecosystem universe, and invite you to partner with us in

creating accelerating experiences.

Before I conclude, I would like to thank all our shareholders,

and each and every stakeholder for their consistent support

and encouragement.

Lets together build a new Nation.
