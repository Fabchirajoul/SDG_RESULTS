Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured

entities) over which the group has control. The group

controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has

rights to, variable returns from its involvement with

the entity and has the ability to affect those returns

through its power to direct the relevant activities of the

entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date

on which control is transferred to the group. They are

deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
