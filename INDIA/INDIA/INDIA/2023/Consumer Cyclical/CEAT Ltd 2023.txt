Dear Shareholders,

The tyre industry in India witnessed

elevated levels of input costs in

the first half of the year. Amidst the

headwinds, CEAT stayed the course and

demonstrated steady growth across all

product segments and markets to end

the year with a fair degree of recovery

in terms of profitability. Besides a strong

push in the domestic market in its key

segments, the Company is creating a

deeper footprint in US and Europe with

a diverse product portfolio, especially in

the Off-Highway business to help drive

growth in the future.

CEAT has sharpened its focus on ESG

practices, including a commitment

to reduce carbon footprint by 50%

by 2030. The Company continued to

advance towards this goal with efficient

water

conservation,

zero

effluent

discharge, increased consumption of

renewable power and biofuel to power

its manufacturing plants. During the

year, the Company was successful in

reducing 17% of its water consumption

per MT of production and was able to

source 24% of its natural rubber via

alternate transport, thus moving closer

to its goals.

We continued our focus on cutting-edge

innovation in products, processes and

systems. CEAT is an industry leader in

adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution

(4IR) technologies and I am very

pleased to share that CEAT received

recognition from the World Economic

Forum at Davos with Global Lighthouse

Designation for 4IR and digitalisation

of operations on the shop floor. With

this, CEAT has joined an elite list of 132

global Lighthouses, or frontrunners in

advanced manufacturing.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)

remains a cornerstone of our culture.

In addition to diversity across gender,

race and geography, we increased

hiring of persons with disabilities and

the transgender community. Further, to

promote and recognize female talent,

CEAT also partnered with the BCCI as

the “strategic timeout” partners in the

inaugural Women’s Premier League.

We continue to engage with the larger

communities by lending our whole-

hearted support in education, community

development, livelihood generation and

heritage restoration.

Our strategic priorities have always

been guided by our mission of ‘Making

Mobility Safer & Smarter. Every Day’. This

remains vital and relevant, especially

in today’s fast-evolving markets. We

are committed to place even higher

emphasis on building environmental

sustainability and digital innovation into

the very core of our business. I thank you

for your continued trust, confidence and

support that has been an unwavering

source of inspiration for CEAT.

H. V. Goenka

Chairman

CEAT has sharpened its

focus on ESG practices,

Dear Shareholders,

on the influence of global

markets…

While the IMF has revised the 2023

global GDP growth rate downward

to reflect the slow economic recovery,

India has emerged as a bright spot and

is projected to grow the fastest assuming

a leading role on the global stage.

I am pleased to share that CEAT has

remained resilient to global headwinds.

The company established its foothold

in the European market capitalising on

its distribution network and extended

its footprint in the US market. Global

headwinds impacted demand but the

year ended with a recovery for value

brands, thus giving some impetus to

overall export volumes.

on CEAT’s performance…

In FY 2022-23, volatility in commodity

prices, particularly crude oil, affected

margins significantly in H1. However,

with

stabilising

commodity

prices,

CEAT was back to registering double-

digit margins from Q3. The OEM

segment grew exceptionally well with

strong traction seen in both, Passenger

and

Commercial

categories.

On

Replacement, we saw good growth in

Passenger segment while 2W demand

was impacted due to weak recovery in

rural markets and high inflation.

CEAT foresees electric vehicles as one

of the megatrends in the automotive

industry over the next few years. We

were one of the first tyre brands to roll

out EV specific tyre range across all

vehicle segments. We worked closely

with leading OEMs especially with 2W

OEMs to become market leaders in 2W

EV space and become the first EV tyre to

be approved by an OEM in Commercial

EV space. We continued our range

expansion in premium passenger space

with the launch of SportDrive and

CrossDrive AT which have received

excellent feedback from customers.

As a result of strong traction for our OHT

range, we have embarked on expanding

Ambernath capacity for Off Highway

Tyres, which is a high margin business

for us. The international market is

important for CEAT, with OHT being the

largest followed by passenger and Truck.

Europe and the US are the two major

markets for PCR and TBR, respectively.

We are developing a product range

to cater to US markets and shall enter

the US for passenger and Commercial

segment in FY 24.

on R&D and Industry 4.0…

Organisations have invested several

years towards adopting ‘Industry 4.0’

by leveraging industrial automation.

Manufacturing and other industries have

begun a new era of digitisation and

advanced technological adoption such

as robotic process automation.

With CEAT’s expansion into the export

market and OEMs, the company had to

move towards greener raw materials and

stringent in-process specifications, which

impacted our productivity and scrap

generation. Our green material usage

increased from 28% to 57% in the last

five years resulting in a 30% increase in

cycle time. Conventional solutions were

unable to improve productivity. Thus,

we started the 4th Industrial Revolution

(4IR) journey to focus on the areas of

productivity, energy conservation and

proactive quality.

CEAT deployed the 4IR use cases

to optimise cycle times and digitise

operator’s touchpoints to incorporate

greener materials and meet stringent

in-process specifications. It is indeed

a proud moment for CEAT to have

been the first ever tyre manufacturing

companies in the world to have received

the Lighthouse designation by the

World Economic Forum (‘WEF’) for its

Halol facility. As a result of Lighthouse

initiatives in Halol, the Company has

reduced cycle times by 20%, processing

scrap by 46%, and energy consumption

by 15%, leading to a ~2.5x increase in

export and OEM sales in the past two

years.

on sustainability…

Sustainability is integrated in the way

we do business at CEAT. CEAT has a

long-term goal of reducing the carbon

footprint by 50% by 2030, with the goal

of minimising negative effects on the

environment and communities and the

company is in the process of monitoring

and managing its value chain emissions.

We have identified the five focus areas

for carbon emission reduction to

achieve our Sustainability VISION – Raw

material procurement, Manufacturing

process, Outbound logistics, Product

usage and End of life disposal of tyres.

on

diversity,

equity

and

inclusion…

Diversity & Inclusion in CEAT goes

beyond gender diversity to include

people with disabilities and those from

different educational backgrounds. This

belief has resulted in us employing over

50 people with disabilities at CEAT.

This belief in creating equal opportunities

translates to the world of sports as well.

CEAT has been active in promoting

and supporting women’s sports. We

associated with the first edition of

Women’s IPL league as the Strategic

Timeout Partner.

This

has

helped

CEAT

establish

itself as an aspirational brand in the

automobile industry and get recognized

amongst the Top 25 best workplaces in

Manufacturing by GPTW for 2022.

In Conclusion…

I am glad to share that the Company has

been able to report a healthy financial

performance

despite

challenges.

I

extend my gratitude to the value chain

partners, customers and communities

for their unwavering support and

instilling confidence and trust.

The dedication of the workforce, the

strength of stakeholder partnerships and

the resolve of customer centricity together

lay the bedrock on which CEAT thrives.

As we move into the next decade of

growth at the company, our dedicated

focus on enhancing customer value,

manufacturing excellence, driving digital

solutions and sustainability will continue

to propel us on the road to delivering

happiness for the people and the planet.

RISK AND THEIR MITIGATION - DETAIL RISK

Risks

Mitigation

1. Margin Impact due to raw materials

Price Volatility and inability to increase

the prices to off-set the RM price

increase

Profit margins can be impacted by the fluctuation

of raw material prices, as well as the presence of

low-cost domestic and international competitors

who engage in aggressive pricing behaviour.

Such factors may have an adverse effect on

profitability.

CEAT is implementing various measures to foster long-term association

with suppliers and improve its margin profile. It is exploring a wider

supplier base and strengthening relationships with existing suppliers. It’s

longstanding relationships with OEMs and the quality of its products have

contributed to brand recognition. To differentiate itself from competitors,

CEAT is expanding its channels, enhancing after-sales service and

providing superior quality products with associated warranties. It is also

focused on growing high-margin profitable segments, implementing

price increases, developing capacity for new products and establishing

a premium segment in new markets. CEAT is leveraging its deep domain

knowledge, technology prowess, brand recall and reach to challenge

both domestic and foreign players.

2. Balance Sheet Ratios (unfavourable)

impacting performance and Perception

issues (Project Investments)

An increase in planned capital expenditure and

investments has the potential to affect profit margins

Investments are planned in a phased manner, taking into consideration

market size and CEAT’s share of business, while sensitivity analysis is

conducted regularly. The Company also continuously focused on the

efficiencies and working capital to reduce the capital required for the

same.

3. Cyber Security Risk

CEAT regularly assesses the risks of cyber-attacks to its system and

takes preventive and detective measures to mitigate them. External IT

consultants are involved to provide inputs for securing systems against

cyber-attacks. A Business Continuity Plan (‘BCP’) is developed and

implemented for all IT platforms.

4. Single Source / Single Geography

Suppliers

CEAT takes action to mitigate the risk of single source/single geography

suppliers by developing alternatives. Additionally, the Company is

working to develop alternate raw materials to mitigate this risk.

5. Geopolitical disruption

The emergence of a big risk, due to factors

such as a debt crisis, war, trust deficit in inter-

state relations and uncertainty leads to supply

disruptions and an overall increase in prices,

including crude. This risk in negatively impacting

GDP growth and inflation, which could lead to a

drop in demand and an increase in overall cost.

To mitigate the risk, proactive measures are being taken in the following

areas:

1. Ensuring supply chain agility

2. Reviewing and taking action on balance sheet ratios

3. Developing long-term supply and demand plans

4. Expanding into new geographies and OEMs/sizes

is circulated to the Directors well in advance to facilitate them

to plan their schedule and to ensure meaningful participation in

the Meetings. However, in case of a special and urgent business

need, the Board’s approval is taken by passing resolutions by

circulation, as permitted by law, which are noted and confirmed

in the subsequent Board Meeting.

The notice of Meetings is given well in advance to all the

Directors. Formal notice of the Meetings are issued at least 7

days in advance in accordance with the provisions of the Act

and Secretarial Standard-1 issued by the Institute of Company

Secretaries of India and no Meetings are held during the year

Taken Report comprising of actions emanating from the

Board Meetings and status updates thereof. The Management

endeavours to provide the Board with sufficient information

apart from the items as mandated for discussion by the Board

under Regulation 17(7) read with Part A of Schedule II to SEBI

Listing Regulations. Through various information being placed

or presented at the Board Meetings, the Board is kept well

informed about the overall functioning of the Company, which

enables the Board to contribute to the growth of the Company

and helps them to take informed decisions. Prior approval

from the Board is obtained for circulating the agenda items

with shorter notice for matters that form part of the Board and

Committee Agenda and are considered to be in the nature of

Unpublished Price Sensitive Information.

The Board periodically reviews the updates on the projects,

business performance, risk management, strategies, people,

processes, ESG related updates and other key affairs of the

Company having impact on the business. The Board is satisfied

that plans are in place for orderly succession for appointment to

the Board and to Senior Management Personnel.
