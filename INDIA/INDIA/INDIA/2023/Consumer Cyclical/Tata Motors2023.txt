Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to write to you and present the Integrated Annual Report of

Tata Motors Ltd. for financial year 2022‑23.

As I mentioned in my: letter last year, recent history has been relentless with the

global pandemic, military conflict, growing inequality, supply chain shortages

and more. In addition, the current year witnessed a surge in inflation requiring

coordinated action by most central banks to increase interest rates to control

inflationary expectations. While inflation is starting to moderate, the rise in interest

rates has also revealed hidden stresses in parts of the banking sector that

enjoyed a long run of low interest rates and hence not prepared for the rate rise.

This could impact global growth in the coming year.

The challenges outlined above are resulting in structural shifts in economies

and societies that I called out last year. These are continuing to play out, viz.

i) Energy transition–irreversible move to green mobility, ii) Supply Chain Transition

rebalancing of supply chains to become resilient, iii) Digital transition–Artificial

Intelligence and Machine Learning becoming mainstream, and iv) Talent

transition – coming of age of the Talent cloud, a diverse, inclusive, global talent

pool that can be accessed remotely.

In this context, I am pleased to report that our Company had a good year

with all automotive verticals delivering on their strategies leading to multiple

achievements. Compared to FY 2021‑22, vehicle sales increased by 23% to

13,35,819 units. Revenues rose to an all‑time high I3.46 lakh crore (up 24%), EBITDA

improved to I37.0K crore (up 110bps) and PBT (bei) turned positive at I1.5K crore

(up I7.841 crore). All three core auto businesses turned profitable in the second

half of the year. Free cash flow (automotive) for the year stood at I7.8K crore

improving substantially from negative I9.5K crore recorded in FY 2021‑22.

Delivering on ambitions

for a greater tomorrow

Tata Motors is emerging stronger after many challenging

years and will remain focused on meeting its financial

commitments while sowing the seeds for a

greener future.

CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE:

Dear Shareholders,

I hope this: letter finds you in good health.

FY 2022‑23 was a year of progression for the Indian commercial vehicle (CV)

industry as it fully emerged from the shadows of two successive years of low

volumes in FY 2019‑20 and FY 2020‑21. Led by the Government’s thrust on

infrastructure building and increased activity in e‑commerce, construction, and

mining, the industry witnessed a robust demand for heavy trucks and passenger

carriers throughout the year to deliver a significant growth over FY 2021‑22.

Tata Motors’ domestic CV business registered 30% growth in retails (VAHAN

registration) over FY 2021‑22. The business recorded its highest‑ever quarterly

and annual revenues in Q4 and FY 2022‑23 respectively, growing by a substantial

35% over FY 2021‑22. A sharp focus on profitable growth resulted in EBIT growing

by a healthy +480 bps over last year.

Being in the agile mode enabled us to swiftly counter the twin challenges of

commodity inflation and high discounting that impacted the CV business in the

first half. We revised our operating model to deliver 'Profitable Growth'. Shifting

gears from 'supply chain push' to 'retail pull', we focused on VAHAN registration

volumes to track real growth.

In FY 2022‑23, we launched over 40 products and 150+ variants for passenger

and cargo transportation to fulfil the growing demand for safer, smarter, and

greener mobility solutions. At the Auto Expo 2023, we unveiled our future ready

aspirations by showcasing 14 new‑age concepts to shape the future of cargo

and passenger mobility in the years ahead. We won several prestigious awards

acknowledging the excellence of our products, services, initiatives, and people.

Our investments in digital marketing with targeted campaigns communicating

brand promise and the overall superior value proposition of our vehicles, resulted

in highest‑ever brand power and net promoter scores. Overall dealer satisfaction

levels also improved with higher vehicle registrations, better profitability, and

cash flows.

Integrated Report / 2022-23

Dear Shareholders,

I hope this: letter finds you safe and in good health.

FY 2022‑23 was a record year for the Indian passenger vehicle (PV) industry as it

posts all time high sales of nearly 3.9 million units. Catalysed by post COVID pent

up demand, easing of the semiconductor shortage, and launch of several new

vehicles, the PV demand grew 27% over FY 2021‑22. Customers rising preference

for SUVs and EVs came to the fore as did their focus on vehicle safety, smarter

technologies, and advanced features.

For Tata Motors, FY 2022‑23 was the third successive year of posting industry

beating growth‑69% (FY 2020‑21), 67% (FY 2021‑22) and 45% (FY 2022‑23),

resulting ~4X growth in terms of volumes and ~5X growth in terms of revenues

over FY 2019‑20. The business recorded its highest‑ever annual revenue in

FY 2022‑23 growing by a substantial 52% vs FY 2021‑22, and delivered its highest

ever profit with EBIT improving by a substantial 300 bps over last year. With

existing capacities nearing saturation, we acquired a state‑of‑the‑art vehicle

manufacturing facility with a capacity scalable to 420,000 units per annum.

The PV and EV business achieved several key milestones in FY 2022‑23:

→ Posted domestic sale of 5,38,518 vehicles, only the 3rd OEM in India to cross

500K sales

→ Crossed the milestone of 50K EV sales, exited Q4 with EV penetration of ~12%

→ Crossed the landmark of 5 million vehicle sales since inception, a strong

endorsement for the Tata brand

→ # 1 SUV manufacturer in India, Nexon ranked #1 and Punch ranked #3 in the

Compact SUV segment

→ Crossed the 2,00,000 sales milestone for Punch in just 19 months of launch

→ #2 brand with NPS score 40

→ In Nepal, market share jumped to 50% from 12% in FY 2019‑20 owing to strong

shift towards EVs

Consistency breeds

sustained triumph

FY 2022‑23 was the milestone year for the business as the industry‑beating

growth witnessed over the last three years has resulted in the business

attaining a 'lifetime' high on multiple metrics. In addition, being the leader in the

fast‑growing EV segment, we continued to accelerate both its adoption as well

as the development of its enabling ecosystem.

TMPV and TPEM MD’s Message

Dear Shareholders,

Throughout the FY 2022‑23, we have continued to deliver Reimagine our strategy

to realise our vision to be proud creators of the most desirable, modern luxury

brands, for the most discerning of clients.

We have maintained momentum under the extraordinary global pressures of

semiconductor constraints, inflation, and geopolitical instability, alongside ongoing

effects of Covid‑19. While we have not escaped the effects of these global factors

on our operations, I am pleased we delivered a resilient performance during

the year to deliver on our wholesale commitments in quarters three and four

and return a profit in quarters three and four. This performance has laid the

foundations for our future success and growth, and the continued realisation of

our strategy.

As we reimagine how we engage with our clients to serve them with a true

modern luxury experience, we have chosen a House of Brands organisation,

to amplify the unique DNA of each of JLR’s brands – Range Rover, Defender,

Discovery, and Jaguar – and accelerate the delivery of JLR's vision to be Proud

Creators of Modern Luxury. By taking this approach we will grow each brand’s

individuality, desirability and appeal in a way that meets the unique needs of its

global client base. Range Rover, Discovery and Defender will continue to bear

the trust mark of Land Rover. The Land Rover name will remain on our vehicles,

reinforcing our all‑terrain credentials and technology capabilities. This year we

expanded our Range Rover and Defender collections and introduced significant

updates across our portfolio. In the coming years we will launch pure electric

versions of all of our Range Rover, Defender and Discovery collections. This starts

with the pure electric Range Rover, for which we will start taking pre‑orders later

this year.

Meanwhile, we have announced the first of three breathtaking new Jaguar

designs will be a 4‑door GT, built in Solihull with power output more than any

previous Jaguar and a range up to 700 km (430 miles). More details of new Jaguar

As we transform our business, at pace and amid intense
