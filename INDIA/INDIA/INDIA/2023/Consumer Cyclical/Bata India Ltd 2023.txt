Theme Intro – It’s Got To Be Stylish;

It’s Got To Be Bata! II:

Dear Shareholders,

Hope that this communication ﬁnds

you and your loved ones in good

health and cheer.

We entered the last ﬁscal year after

two years of pandemic-led disruptions.

This was a full year with encouraging

trends from the beginning. Despite

normalization of demand for footwear,

after an initial surge, your Company

kept continuous focus on refreshing

product portfolio with the strategy of

casualization and premiumization. This

ensured that we maintained growth

in revenue and proﬁtability due to

targeted higher ASP and expansion in

market share of our premium category

brands like Hush Puppies, Marie

Claire, Red Label, etc.,

In spite of the rise in raw material

prices, your Company maintained a

proﬁtable growth trajectory over the

previous years, with a strong trend

setting product portfolio, offered

through the largest retail footwear

presence in India. The ﬁrst quarter of

the last ﬁscal year also saw signiﬁcant

momentum across all sales channels

and registering highest-ever quarterly

sales. The momentum continued to

reflect in key metrics for the rest of the

year. Your Company also made a leap

forward in its retail footprint, crossing

the 2,000+ milestone for the 1st time.

It was heartening to see the strong

recall for the brand backed by efforts

of Bata Team translating into a revenue

growth of over 44% over its previous

year and 13% over pre-COVID year.

The Operating Proﬁt grew almost 380%

over the year 2021-22.

A healthy balance sheet and strong

cash flow generation encouraged us

to state an industry-leading dividend

pay-out ratio in our dividend policy and

recommend distribution of the cash

proﬁts through a dividend of 270%.

This is also in line with our belief in

the strength of the organization to

navigate any headwinds and continue

to emerge stronger.

We are proud of the continuous

support from our employees helping

Bata to remain agile, resilient

and proactive in its approach. We

continue to ensure a great fusion of

professional rigour and leadership

mindset in our diverse talent pool,

under the executive leadership of

Mr. Gunjan Shah,: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

As India Inc. announced return-to-

office and educational institutions

resumed physical classes, we recorded

our highest-ever quarterly sales in

the ﬁrst quarter of FY 2022-23 and

a signiﬁcant momentum across all

sales channels. This momentum

continued to reflect in key metrics for

the remainder of the year. Performance

was broad-based with each of the sales

channels contributing to the growth.

The quality and consistency of our

results reflect our competitive edge and

consumer loyalty.

Highlights of the Year

We accomplished several milestones

in FY 2022-23. The ﬁrst quarter saw

signiﬁcant boost across all sales

channels and we registered highest-

ever quarterly sales. The momentum

continued to reflect in key metrics

for the rest of the year. We made a

signiﬁcant leap forward in our retail

footprint and crossed the 2,000+

milestone for the ﬁrst time. Sneaker
