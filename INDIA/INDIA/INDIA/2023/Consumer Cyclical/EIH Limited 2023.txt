Dear Shareholders,

Globally, 2022 was a tale of two

halves. It was marked by the

uncertainty of the Russia-Ukraine

conflict, stringent Covid-19

lockdowns in China and elevated

inflation, leading to monetary

tightening. However, as the year

progressed, inflation eased, China

reopened earlier than expected

and personal consumption in major

economies remained resilient.

Despite such positive developments,

the world still faces ongoing

challenges and there are risks to

economic growth and recovery that

persist.

INDIA PERSPECTIVE

India, on the other hand, instils

greater optimism, retaining its

status as the fastest growing major

economy and fifth largest economy

in the world. Global headwinds

notwithstanding, India grew at a

higher than earlier estimated rate

of 7.2%, driven by robust private

consumption, steady government

expenditure on infrastructure

development and a revival in

business and investment sentiment.

Private consumption was the highest

since FY 2014-15. This growth is

anticipated to generate increased

employment opportunities, higher

disposable income and, in turn,

enhance spending capacity.

Consumer patterns indicate

travellers are seeking premium

experiences, personalised itineraries,

and quality accommodation at

many unexplored destinations.

Our brand is synonymous with

luxury experiences, and we are well

placed to deliver to this growing

demand. The luxury and upper

upscale segments in India have

demonstrated strong growth, with

an increase in Revenue per Available

Room (RevPAR). This aligns perfectly

with our business focus, setting a

solid foundation for our expansion.

Our recent investments and signings

are consistent with these evolving

trends.

Significant interest in spiritual

tourism, facilitated by increased

accessibility through air travel also

presents opportunities for growth.

Our efforts to secure opportunities

in this growing segment places us in

a favourable position to benefit from

this expanding market.

With major Indian airlines adding

substantial capacity, we anticipate

increased access to multiple

destinations. This presents an

opportunity to deliver unique hotels

at these locations and provide world

class hospitality to our guests. Our

renowned service standards and

strong brand recall will contribute

to the success of establishing new

destinations in India and accelerating

the growth of our footprint.

Our strategic alignment with luxury

and upper upscale segments,

focus on personalised experiences,

reputation for quality and luxury and

presence in outstanding locations

will ensure we are well placed to

continue our consolidation and

growth in the hospitality industry.

A ROBUST RECOVERY

Strong economic growth contributed

to a ripple effect across many

industry sectors. The hospitality

industry witnessed a significant

growth in demand, further aided

by an increase in leisure, social

events, conferences, and business

travel. The trend was validated

by significant growth in domestic

air traffic, increasing 60% over

the previous year to 136 million

passengers and almost at par with

pre-pandemic levels.

India’s G20 presidency has paved

the way for a rise in international

arrivals. This benefited the

hospitality industry across a number

of locations. The industry also

witnessed demand not limited to

large cities and the growth of travel

to niche secondary destinations.

We also witnessed international

travel continuing to recover across

the globe. With borders opening,

India has emerged as an important

travel destination. This was validated

by the substantial increase in Foreign

Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) from 1.5

million in 2021 to 6.2 million during

2022.

The hotel industry is currently facing

challenges of being underinvested.

Demand has consistently exceeded

supply. Room supply increased by

3.5% whilst demand grew by 5.4%.

Of the 170 hotels that opened in

2022, the average inventory was

65 rooms. Remarkably, 93 of these

hotels had 50 rooms or less, with just

2 hotels providing an inventory of

300 room and more. These figures

indicate the pressing need for

increased investment in the hotel

industry, meet rising demand and

address the evident supply shortage.

We live in an era of great change

characterised by enormous volatility as well

as renewed optimism. India has epitomised

resilience and strength in a world grappling

with multiple headwinds. After two years

of pandemic induced disruptions, there

has been a noticeable shift in demand for

premium travel experiences. At EIH, we

are well placed to capitalise on this growing

trend, building on our legacy of distinctive

hotels and exceptional service.

Arjun Singh Oberoi,

Executive Chairman

At EIH Limited, we acknowledge the

pressing issue of climate change

and recognise its significance for

the travel and hospitality industry.

We have been actively involved in

initiatives that would propel our

decarbonising journey and promote

sustainable behaviour among

travellers. Sustainability is a key

pillar of our strategic vision. During

the year, we have partnered with

leading consultants to establish

defined targets and a comprehensive

roadmap to address Environment,

Social, and Governance (ESG)

parameters throughout all aspects

of our operations. Our investments

and initiatives have started

yielding positive results across

our ESG indicators. As part of our

commitment to sustainability, we

are actively engaged in charitable

initiatives at local and national levels,

fostering a sense of community.

Moving forward, we will continue

to develop our ESG ambitions

and transition more hotels to

renewable energy sources, aligning

our operations with sustainable

practices and driving positive change

within our industry.

Finally, I take this opportunity

to thank every member of our

organisation for their commitment

and dedication to our pursuit of

excellence. Their untiring efforts

ensure our guests are provided a

world class hospitality experience

that is sincere and distinguished.

The year ahead will undoubtedly

be challenging but equally, offers

many opportunities. The industry

revival will be further aided by global

marquee events, G20 summits

and the ICC Cricket World Cup. This

together with renewed optimism of

India’s economic prospects bodes

well for our growth prospects and

EIH’s continued success as a leading

hospitality company.

Thank you for your continued

support and trust.

Yours sincerely,

EIH LIMITED

Showcasing the best of

India to the world

EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE:

Dear Shareholders,

India has an enormous potential

for tourism with its rich heritage,

culture, people and geography

diversity among other factors.

Proactive government measures

like investments in infrastructure

and tourism, coupled with

the improvement in private

consumption, are some of the

factors that have helped India

in realising its tourism potential.

Furthermore, India’s presidency

of the G20, and the governments

strong commitment to economic

growth continues to attract business

travellers from around the world.

Another reason that fills us

with increased optimism is the

resurgence of the luxury hospitality

segment, which correlates directly

with us is strong domestic and

international demand. Besides this,

several factors such as the rising

purchasing power among domestic

travellers, the development of the

airline industry, increased foreign

tourist arrivals and relaxed visa

regulations are expected to help

sustain this growth.

At EIH Limited, we were well-

positioned to capitalise on these

developments. In line with the

hospitality industry’s revival, we

were also able to resume our

growth journey. At the very core

of our culture there is a shared

commitment to place the needs and

wellbeing of our guests above all

else and exceed their expectations.

no waste is released into the

environment. This achievement

has resulted in the reuse of 273.3

metric tons of waste, marking an

impressive 1,060% year-on-year

increase, enhancing our water

consumption practices. These

facilities utilise advanced sewage

treatment plants to efficiently treat

sewage water. Through this initiative,

all the treated water is recycled

and reused.

Additionally, we are actively working

towards installing bottling plants

in our facilities aimed at replacing

plastic bottles across our domestic

hotels. We will strive to further

advance our sustainability efforts,

embracing innovative solutions

and practices to drive positive

environmental change, while

providing exceptional levels of

service to our guests.

The well-being and development of

our employees take precedence at

EIH Limited. We recognise that our

success is intertwined with theirs.

We are wholly devoted to fostering

a nurturing work environment

that promotes both personal

and professional development

and growth. Through targeted

initiatives and comprehensive

training programmes, we invest in

the development of our employees,

equipping them with the skills

and knowledge to excel in their

respective roles. Besides this,

we take pride in supporting our

employees both professionally

and personally. We are pleased to

announce that all our employees

receive comprehensive benefits,

ensuring their well-being and job

satisfaction. Our rigorous protocols

and processes prioritise workplace

safety, minimising the risk of

injuries and ensuring the overall

well-being of our workforce. We

believe that a secure workplace not

only safeguards our employees but

During the year, we had the privilege

of hosting 360,943 guests across

our hotels. This impressive number

reflects the trust and preference

that our guests place in Oberoi

Hotels & Resorts and Trident Hotels.

We continually strive to go above

and beyond to ensure that each and

every guest enjoys an exceptionally

memorable stay with us. We deeply

appreciate the trust and loyalty

bestowed upon us by our guests

and we remain steadfast in our

dedication to providing unparalleled

levels of service and experiences to

our guests across our hotels.

We were able to record impressive

numbers across all parameters.

During the year, we recorded

revenue of Rs. 18,358 million, an

increase of 102% compared to Rs.

9,108 million in the previous year.

On the EBITDA front, we stood

at Rs. 6,256 million, a staggering

increase of 1,987%, whereas our

profit after tax stood at `3,202

million compared to a loss of

`1,182 million in the previous year

greatly impacted by the COVID-19

pandemic. With strong guest

recognition we were able to achieve

a sharp rise in hotel occupancies,

surpassing pre-pandemic levels.

We are proud of our achievements

and look forward to continuing this

positive momentum in the future.

Sustainability continues to be

the cornerstone of our business.

For nearly eight decades, we

have operated with the value

of conducting business in a

responsible manner; whether it

be the environment, communities

we engage with, or to our

employees who we see as our most

valuable asset.

We are committed to doing all that

we can for our environment and

reducing our carbon footprint. In

addition to adopting renewable

energy across 16 domestic hotels,

as of Financial Year 2023, we

successfully implemented a Zero

Liquid Discharge Mechanism in 70%

of our domestic hotels, ensuring

NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

This note provides a list of the significant accounting

policies adopted in the preparation of these standalone

financial statements of EIH Limited. These policies have

been consistently applied to all the periods presented,

unless otherwise stated.

a)

Basis of preparation

(i)

Compliance with Indian Accounting Standards

(Ind AS)

The standalone financial statements have been

prepared in accordance with Ind AS prescribed

under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the

Act”) read with the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended, and other

accounting principles generally accepted in India, as

a going concern on accrual basis.

Accounting policies have been consistently applied

except where a newly issued Accounting Standard is

initially adopted, or a revision of an existing Accounting

Standard requires a change in the accounting policy

hitherto in use.

(ii) Historical cost convention

The standalone financial statements have been

prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the

following:

• Equity investments in entities other than

subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates which

are measured at fair value;

• Defined benefit plans – plan assets measured at

fair value;

• Customer loyalty programmes.

(iii) Use of estimates

In preparing the standalone financial statements

in conformity with accounting principles generally

accepted in India, management is required to make

estimates and assumptions that may affect the

reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the

disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of

standalone financial statements and the amounts of

revenue and expenses during the reported period.

Actual results could differ from those estimates. Any

revision to such estimates is recognised in the period

the same is determined.

b) Revenue recognition

(i)

Performance obligation in contracts with

customers is met throughout the stay of guest

in the hotel or on rendering of services and sale

of goods.

(ii)

Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance

obligation is measured at the amount of

transaction price (net of variable consideration)

allocated to that performance obligation. The

transaction price of services rendered is net of

variable consideration on account of various

trade discounts and schemes offered by the

Company as part of the contract.

(iii) Interest income is accrued on a time proportion

basis using the effective interest rate method.

(iv) Interest income from debt instruments is

recognised using the effective interest method.

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly

discounts estimated future cash receipts through

the expected life of the financial asset to the

carrying amount of a financial asset. When

calculating the effective interest rate, the

Company estimates the expected cash flows

by considering all the contractual terms of the

financial instrument (for example, prepayment,

extension, call and similar options) but does not

consider the expected credit losses.

(v)

Dividends are recognised in the Statement of

Profit and Loss only when the right to receive

payment is established, it is probable that the

economic benefits associated with the dividend

will flow to the Company, and the amount of the

dividend can be measured reliably.

The Company recognises revenue when the amount

of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable

that future economic benefits will flow to the entity

and specific criteria have been met for each of

the Company’s activities as described below. The

Company bases its estimates on historical results,

taking into consideration the type of customer,

the type of transaction and the specifics of each

arrangement.

non-current financial assets in its books of

account.

The Division Bench of Hon’ble High Court

of Himachal Pradesh vide its order dated

October 13, 2022 has upheld the Arbitral Award

dated July 23, 2005. The Company and MRL were

legally advised to comply with the directions of

from the High Court order dated October 13,

2022. Consequently, the Company’s intention to

implement the Arbitral Award was communicated

to the Government of Himanchal Pradesh vide: letter dated October 18, 2022 and execution

petition was filed with the Hon’ble High Court of

Himachal Pradesh on March 28, 2023. Accordingly,

the Company has recorded an obligation of

` 140.20 million based on the management’s

best estimate of outflow of economic resources

upon compliance with the Arbitral Award, which

has been classified as “Exceptional items” in the

Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss for the

year ended March 31, 2023. Based on discussion

with Government of Himachal Pradesh, there

may be further obligation of interest on Arbitral

Award therefore the Company has recorded

obligation of ` 105.20 million towards interest

and disclosed as “Exceptional items” which is

included in the above-mentioned obligation.

The Company has recorded an obligation of

`140.20 million based on the management’s

best estimate of expense upon compliance with

the Arbitral Award, which has been classified as

“Exceptional item” in the Standalone Statement

of Profit and Loss for the year ended March 31,

2023. Further, based on subsequent discussion

with The Government of Himachal Pradesh,

the interest on such award is also payable and

accordingly, an interest payable in respect of such

award up to March 31, 2022 of ` 105.20 million

has been recorded as exceptional item in the

Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss for the

year ended March 31, 2023 and interest for the

current year has been accounted as finance cost

execution petition filed before the Hon’ble High

Court of Himachal Pradesh.

Further, as per the Arbitral Award, upon execution

of the lease deed in respect of land and upon

payment of the stipulated consideration, the

Government of Himachal Pradesh is to facilitate

transfer of all its shares to the Company. Also,

the Company had recognised a liability of ` 70.00

million towards 21.21% of equity share capital

of MRL, payable as consideration for transfer

of shares held by the Government of Himachal

recognised corresponding amount under other

non-current financial assets. Pending transfer

of shares pursuant to the Arbitral Award, the

Company continues to disclose the amount of

` 1,361.93 million as ‘Advance towards equity’,

under Other non-current financial assets in its

books of account.

(iii) Claims, provisions and contingent

liabilities:

The Company has ongoing litigations with various

regulatory authorities and third parties with

respect to tax/legal matters. Where an outflow

of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable

estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be

made based on management’s assessment

of specific circumstances of each dispute

and relevant external advice, management

provides for its best estimate of the liability.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations

whose existence will be confirmed only on the

occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future

events outside the Company’s control, or present

obligations that are not recognised because it is

not probable that a settlement will be required

or the value of such a payment cannot be reliably

estimated. These are subjective in nature and

involve judgement in determining the likely

outcome of such tax/legal matters.

GENERAL INFORMATION

EIH Limited (“the Company” or “the Parent Company”) is

a public Company limited by shares, incorporated and

domiciled in India having its Registered Office at 4, Mangoe

Lane, Kolkata – 700 001. The Company is primarily engaged

in owning and managing premium luxury hotels and

cruisers under the luxury ‘Oberoi’ and ‘Trident’ brands. The

Group is also engaged in flight catering, airport restaurants,

project management and corporate air charters. The

consolidated financial statements relate to EIH Limited

and its subsidiary companies (collectively referred as “the

Group”) and associates and joint ventures.

NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

This note provides a list of the significant accounting

policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated

financial statements of EIH Limited. These policies have

been consistently applied to all the periods presented,

unless otherwise stated.

a)

Basis of preparation

(i)

Compliance with Indian Accounting Standards

(Ind AS)

These consolidated financial statements have been

prepared in accordance with Ind AS prescribed

under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the

Act”) read with the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended, and other

accounting principles generally accepted in India, as

a going concern on accrual basis.

Accounting policies have been consistently applied

except where a newly issued Accounting Standard is

initially adopted, or a revision of an existing Accounting

Standard requires a change in the accounting policy

hitherto in use.

(ii) Historical cost convention

The consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the

following:

• Equity investments in entities other than joint

ventures and associates which are measured at

fair value;

• Defined benefit plans – plan assets measured at

fair value

• Customer loyalty programs

(iii) Use of estimates

In preparing the consolidated financial statements

in conformity with accounting principles generally

accepted in India, management is required to make

estimates and assumptions that may affect the

reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the

disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of

consolidated financial statements and the amounts

of revenue and expenses during the reported period.

Actual results could differ from those estimates. Any

revision to such estimates is recognised in the period

the same is determined.

b) Principles of consolidation and equity

accounting

(i)

Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has

control. The Group controls an entity when the Group

is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from

its involvement with the entity and has the ability

to affect those returns through its power to direct

the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are

fully consolidated from the date on which control is

transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated

from the date that control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to

account for business combinations by the Group.

The Group combines the financial statements of the

parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together

like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and

expenses. Inter-Group transactions, balances and

unrealised gains on transactions between Group

companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also

eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence

of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting

policies of subsidiaries have been changed where

necessary to ensure consistency with the policies

adopted by the Group.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of

subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated

statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement

of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively.

(ii) Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has

significant influence but not control or joint control.

This is generally the case where the Group holds

between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.

Investments in associates are accounted for using

the equity method (see (iv) below) of accounting, after

initially being recognised at cost.

57 IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON BUSINESS OPERATIONS

The consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company’s and its subsidiaries business for the year ended March

31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 had been severe. However, with vaccination programs being implemented in India and

across the globe, domestic air travel improved and international flights resumed. Consequently, both business and

leisure travel resumed, resulting in improved revenue during the year ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the

period prior to outbreak of COVID-19 i.e. the corresponding year in FY 2019-20. With improved business conditions,

management based on its assessment, does not foresee stress on liquidity. Based on current indicators of future

economic conditions, the Company and its subsidiaries expects to recover the carrying amounts of its assets as on

March 31, 2023. The impact of COVID-19 on the business may be different from that estimated on the date of approval

of these Consolidated Financial Statements. The management of the Company will continue to closely monitor any

material changes to future economic conditions.
