Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to present the Annual Report of Swan Energy Limited for the financial year 2022-23. As we

reflect on the past year, we are proud of the achievements and progress made by our company in the dynamic and

challenging energy landscape of India.

In the face of unprecedented global events, Swan Energy has remained steadfast in its commitment to delivering

sustainable growth and creating long-term value for our stakeholders. Our dedication to innovation, responsible

practices, and customer-centricity has been the cornerstone of our success.

Operational Excellence: Our unwavering focus on operational excellence has yielded impressive results across all

our business verticals. In the textile division, we have continued to push boundaries to deliver high-quality products that

meet global standards. Similarly, our realty, and oil and gas operations have showcased resilience and adaptability, even in

the face of industry fluctuations. Compared to FY2021-22, revenues rose to 1438 crore and EBITDA improved to 241

crores. All three existing core businesses showed profits which played a significant role in the company’s performance.

Innovation and Sustainability: Swan Energy remains dedicated to embracing cutting-edge technologies and

practices that promote sustainability. Our efforts to reduce carbon emissions, optimize resource utilization, and foster a

safe work environment have gained momentum and will continue to be a top priority.

Community Engagement: As a responsible corporate citizen, we believe in giving back to society. Our CSR

initiatives have impacted the lives of many, empowering communities through education, healthcare, and skill

development programs. We take immense pride in being a catalyst for positive change.

Financial Strength: I am pleased to report that despite challenges posed by the global economic climate, Swan Energy

has maintained robust financial health. Our prudent financial management practices have provided a stable foundation,

enabling us to explore new opportunities and expand our horizons.

Outlook: After a comprehensive three-year process, Swan Energy has emerged as the successful bidder for the former

Reliance Naval and Engineering Limited. Additionally, this year, Swan Energy has secured a controlling interest in the

Indian listed entity, Veritas India Limited. These strategic moves signify our entry into the shipbuilding and heavy

manufacturing sector, whilst bolstering our foothold in the oil and gas industry. Looking ahead, we see immense

potential for growth and further diversification. Swan Energy will continue to explore new avenues to strengthen our

position and create value for our shareholders.

Acknowledgments: I extend my sincere gratitude to our shareholders, whose trust and confidence have been our

driving force. I would also like to express appreciation to our dedicated team, whose unwavering commitment and hard

work have made all our achievements possible.

In closing, I assure you that Swan Energy remains committed to upholding the highest standards of governance,

transparency, and ethical practices. Together, we shall embrace the future with optimism, determination, and the desire

to build a brighter tomorrow.

Thank you for your continued support.
