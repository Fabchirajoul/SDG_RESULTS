Letter from the

CMD:

dear Stakeholders,

As I reflect on the growth and progress for FY 2022-23, I’m

pleased to share with you that our Company have marked a

robust performance across the businesses, driven by strong

demand and growth in the industry.

The global economy has shown a smart recovery after

the Covid-19 pandemic-induced severe and unimaginable

distress, along with grave and undefining challenges such

as the Russia-Ukraine war, energy crisis, and historically

high inflation and interest rate levels. Labour markets

in most advanced economies have strengthened, and

aggregate demand has exceeded the expectations.

Additionally, the supply chain situation has improved with

the implementation of policy packages by economies

worldwide.

The Indian economy has

demonstrated remarkable

resilience in the face of global

challenges, achieving a growth

rate of 7.2% in FY 2022-23.

India’s economy has gained

recognition as the fastest-

growing major economy, a

testament to the robust demand

observed across various

industries. The Government

is undertaking initiatives to

boost the economy and control

inflation, with a continued focus

on infrastructure development

and rising private investment.

Despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and energy crisis,

India is emerging as an attractive destination for global

investors, particularly in sectors ripe for reforms, such as

energy, transport, and infrastructure.

Amid the global volatility, the Indian automobile industry

ended FY 2022-23 on a positive note, bounced back

from the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Demonstrating strong resilience, rapid innovation, and

robust market demand, the industry achieved record sales

in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment of over 3.9 Million

in FY 2022-23 owing to the strong demand and easing

of supply chain constraints. Consumer preference and

demand in the PV segment are increasing towards SUVs

and the segment has marked 30% year-on-year growth.

The commercial vehicle (CV) segment witnessed a major

uptick in sales volume in FY 2022-23, driven by bounce

back in demand and growth in major economic activities.

The electric vehicle (EV) segment has shown significant

growth potential, with all major companies set to enter the

market in FY 2023-24 by introducing new models in both

the passenger and commercial vehicle segments. On the

export front, there is a substantial downturn, mainly in the

CV segment owing to the geopolitical tensions. Overall,

the industry is optimistic and ready to mark the next leg of

growth in the future.

The Government has announced Production Linked

Incentive (PLI) scheme for the Indian automobile and auto

component industry of ₹ 25,938 Crores in 2021. Currently,

the Union Government has announced Standard Operating

Procedures (SOPs) for the PLI scheme for the automobile

sector. This scheme will allow applicants to request for

testing and certification of products utilising advanced

automotive technology. Furthermore, this scheme will

increase the local production of advanced automotive

technology (AAT) goods and infuse capital in the industry.

On the FAME II front, the outlay of ₹ 5,172 Crores has been

announced as a part of outlay of ₹ 10,000 Crores which was

announced at the launch of the scheme. This amount will

be utilised in a way the Electric Vehicle demand will surge.

According to data released by SIAM, India is the third-

largest car market in the world. This highlight both India’s

qualifications as the fastest-growing economy in general

and the potential of the auto sector in particular. Uno

Minda has been at the forefront of the industry’s transition

to greener, safer, and smarter mobility by leveraging this

expansion in the Indian vehicle sector and our strategic

efforts.

One of the key factors driving Uno Minda’s growth in the

automotive industry is its commitment to innovation and

R&D. The Company has invested heavily in research and

3.9 Million+

Industry achieved record sales in the passenger

vehicle (PV) segment in FY 2022-23

30% year-on-year growth

Increasing towards SUVs and the Segment:

Managing Director:

dear Stakeholders,

The overall GDP growth is revised to 7.2% in FY 2022-23,

remaining one of the fastest growing economies in the

world. This growth was underpinned by strong investment

activity bolstered by the Government’s capex push and

buoyant private consumption particularly among high

income earners. Inflation remains high averaging around

6.7% in FY 2022-23 wherein recently the WPI has spread

into negative with higher base effect, this should lead to

continuation of the pause in interest rate hike. The current

account deficit narrowed on back of strong growth in

service exports and easing global commodity prices.

Industry perspective

Speaking about auto industry the automobile production

achieved robust growth of 13% in FY 2022-23 with growth

witnessed across all vehicle categories. Passenger car

segment achieved highest ever production crossing 4.5

Million for the first time. The steep growth was the function

of series of new model launches and better product

availability due to the easing of supply chain. The demand

for high end variants and premium SUVs remained robust.

After three consecutive fiscal years of headwinds, two-

wheeler category also recorded growth of 10%; however,

production volumes are still significantly lower than pre-

Covid-19 pandemic levels. There is a weakness at the lower

end of the market as visible from sale of smaller cars and

entry level two-wheelers. The industry grew despite rising

interest rates and inflation reducing disposable earnings.

Commercial vehicle category too registered healthy growth

of 29% in FY 2022-23 and is close to the previous peak of

2018-2019 supported by healthy pickup in macroeconomic

activity.

During FY 2022-23 the electric

vehicle market in India has also

delivered significant growth with

a rapid increase in sales of LCV,

two-wheeler and three-wheeler

electric vehicle resultantly the

Indian electric vehicle sales

crossed 1 Million units for the

first time in FY 2022-23.

As per the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicle;

in the electric two-wheeler segment the industry sold

7.26 Lakhs high speed E-two-wheeler in FY 2022-23

in comparison to 2.52 Lakhs units in FY 2021-22. EV

penetration in this category during the year was at 4.5%,

EV two-wheeler sales for the quarter was around 2.16

Lakhs representing overall penetration of around 5.4%.

Penetration level has been gradually increasing quarter-on-

quarter basis. Going forward we expect growth momentum

in the automobile industry to continue into one of the

FY 2022-24 and will be poised for reasonable growth

owing to strong demand especially in passenger cars and

easing supply chain issues. Initiatives allowed in the budget

will also positively affect the passenger vehicle sector

growth in FY 2023-24; however, an increase in cost of

ownership remains near term headwinds for the industry.

The long-term prospect for the auto industry remains highly

optimistic. India embraced the challenges faced in the past

few years and now it is at the cusp of rapid growth over the

next decade.

Company’s perspective

The Company has been well placed to reap benefits

from smart recovery in automotive industry with its well

diversified product portfolio, entrenched OEMs relations

and technology & innovation focussed approach. During

the year, the Company has demonstrated excellent

performance with 35% growth in annual revenues to

₹ 11,236 Crores in FY 2022-23 as against ₹ 8,313 Crores in

FY 2021-22. While industry volumes have grown by 13%,

we continued our outperformance by registering growth

at 35%. EBITDA for the same period in FY 2022-23 is ₹

1,242 Crores in comparison to ₹ 885 Crores in FY 2021-22.

Talking about margins EBITDA margins, were higher at

11.1% in FY 2022-23 as against 10.7% in FY 2021-22 owing

to the benefits of operating leverage partially offset by

higher material costs. We would like to inform you that the

Company has achieved pre-tax ROCE of 19.2% in FY 2022-

23, a significant improvement from previous financial year.

Segment Highlights

Switching Systems

The segment achieved revenues of ₹ 3,203 Crores for

FY 2022-23 contributing 29% of our consolidated

revenues. Increasing features like infotainments, sunroof,

power windows, overhead console, etc., led to increase in

number of switches in PV continue to drive the business

growth along with increasing SOB with Indian and Korean

customers. During the year, we received incremental

orders from Korean customer further strengthening the

relationship. In two-wheeler switch business we have

started export of heated grips and CAN-based switches.

Our expansion of four-wheeler switch plants at Chennai and

Farrukhnagar are going as per the plan and is expected to

commence operations in H2 FY 2023-24.:
