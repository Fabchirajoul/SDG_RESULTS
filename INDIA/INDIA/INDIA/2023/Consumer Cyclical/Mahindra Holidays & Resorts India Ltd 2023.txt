Annexure A:

Dear Shareholders,

As I write my message about the performance of

your Company during the year ended 31st March,

2023, I feel proud of the achievements of your

management and optimistic about the future.

The pride comes from the fact that this year your

Company delivered the best ever results in its

history. Total income on a standalone basis at `

1,306 crore, member additions at 17,477, a growth

of 37% over the previous year and highest ever

resort Income at ` 323 crore compared to ` 193

crore in the previous year, profit before tax at ` 214

crore and profit after tax at ` 159 crore were the

highest in the history of the Company.

The consolidated results were even more

impressive with total income being 20% higher at

` 2,624 crore, EBIDTA 21% higher at ` 579 crore

and profit before tax at ` 171 crore was 54% higher

than the previous year.

All these were possible because of the excellent

work done both by the management of your

Company and that of its subsidiary, Holiday Club

Resorts Oy, Finland (HCR).

I am also happy with the performance of HCR. After

they managed to come out of the after-effects of

Covid, their economy was severely affected by

Russia-Ukraine conflict with a steep increase in

fuel prices, high inflation, substantial increase in

interest rates and worst of all, drop in international

tourism due to sanctions against Russia.

In spite of these major hurdles, the management of

HCR, by focusing on domestic markets, optimizing

utilization of resources, cost rationalization,

improving labour productivity made an operating

profit of Euro 5 million in 2022-23 versus an

operating loss of Euro 0.3 million in 2021-22.

Let me now share where my optimism comes

from.

First and foremost is the validation of customer

confidence by our existing members. The upgrades

in 2022-23 at ` 188 crore were 71% higher than

the previous year. To me, this is the best form

of validation and a sign of customer confidence:

only when a member is extremely happy with

the service and benefits will the members pay to

upgrade. Significant increase in resort income at

` 323 crore (up 67%) and occupancies going up

from 74% in 2021-22 to 84% in 2022-23 are other

major indicators that your management has made

the members happier year after year.

What does this mean to us?

-

Higher customer spends. A happy customer

not only spends more on F&B but also on

various other activities at resorts including

the Spa.

-

Happy members encourage their friends and

families to become new members.

-

Higher referrals lead to lower acquisition

costs.

-

More members mean more new resorts and

an even wider choice for members.

-

More members and higher occupancies

encourage management to build larger

resorts and effect economies of scale.:
