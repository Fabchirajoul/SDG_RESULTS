Dear Shareholders,

At Exide, we believe that our people

are core drivers of business growth.

We, therefore, remain dedicated to

nurture an inclusive talent pipeline and

foster a dynamic working environment

that is conducive for personal as well

as professional development.

At Exide, we perceive every

challenge as an opportunity. It is

with this optimism that we have

navigated through many ups and

downs over the years and aspire to

do so in the future. We believe we

are well positioned in the evolving

market landscape, with a balanced

product portfolio and select strategic

partnerships to serve our customers’

evolving requirements. With this

positive outlook towards the future,

we can achieve our objectives

sustainably.

With this thought, I am delighted to

present our annual report for the year

under review. I would like to highlight

our overall performance involving all

spheres of our business.

Macroeconomic landscape

During the year under review, the

after-effects of the pandemic coupled

with the Russia-Ukraine war posed

further challenges for economies

around the world. The geo-political

tensions led to a surge in inflation,

prompting aggressive monetary

tightening policies in several

developed and developing countries.

This triggered capital outflows and

currency depreciations in developing

countries, increasing balance of

payment pressures and heightening

debt sustainability risks. According

to the World Economic Forum (WEF),

the global GDP for calendar year

2022 is 3.4% which is lower than the

average growth rate seen from 2000-

2018 (pre-pandemic level). Further,

global GDP growth might decelerate

to 2.8% in 2023, as developed

countries will be impacted by

relatively high inflationary pressures

and limited demand scenario.

In India, during Financial Year (FY)

2022-23, government initiatives, along

with the central bank’s monetary

policy enabled the country to navigate

the geo-political tensions effectively.

The country emerged as the fastest

growing economy, with an estimated

growth rate of 7.2% for FY 2022-23.

Considering India’s resilient domestic

demand and the RBI’s success in

containing inflation, the outlook for the

future remains optimistic. Moreover,

India continues to strengthen its

position with prudent fiscal policies

and agile interventions by the

government.

Exide Industries Limited

Annual Report 2022-23:

MESSAGE FROM MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO

Nurturing our quest

for excellence: Dear Shareholders,

In 2022-23, we completed 75 years of

our existence. In the span of over seven

decades, we have continuously evolved

to produce some of the finest batteries

and battery storage solutions for our

customers.

I hope you and your families are

safe and healthy. I am pleased to

present our performance for the fiscal

year under review, as we embrace

opportunities and remain resolute to

to achieve excellence on all fronts.

When we look back at the fiscal year,

our performance does validate the

resilience of our business model.

While appreciating the volatility in

input costs, logistics and banking

channels across several economies,

it gives me a sense of pride to report

that Exide has consistently created

value for all its stakeholders.

To reinforce our position as one of

the leading players in the industry,

we are continuously navigating

challenges in the business landscape

by aligning ourselves with changing

market dynamics. Our unwavering

commitment to technological

advancements has facilitated the

development of cutting-edge products

that cater to the evolving needs of

our customers, while maintaining

a steadfast focus on upholding

sustainable business practices.

75 years of Exide

In 2022-23, we completed 75 years

of our existence. In the span of over

seven decades, we have evolved to

produce some of the finest batteries

and battery storage solutions. Our

journey, from a single factory in West

Bengal to becoming a manufacturing

behemoth with factories in six states

in India and expanding our export

footprint in 60 countries across the

globe, is testimony to our enduring

legacy.

Business performance review

We achieved revenues of H 14,592

crore, along with an EBITDA of

H 1,568 crore for the year under

review. Our Profit after Tax stood at

H 904 crore, growing by nearly

18% Y-o-Y. I am pleased to state

that we are now almost a $2 billion

enterprise as our market capitalisation

surpassed H 15,000 crore on

March 31, 2023.

Looking closely at our business

divisions, the automotive division

enjoyed double-digit topline growth

and market share expansion in

the domestic market. While the

replacement market continued its

healthy demand momentum, we also

witnessed a substantial rebound in

demand from Original Equipment

Manufacturers (OEMs). In the

industrial division, more than 70%

of the vertical comprising Industrial

UPS, traction and solar energy

sectors, grew in high double digits.

However exports, for both automotive

and industrial divisions delivered a

modest performance, as a result of
