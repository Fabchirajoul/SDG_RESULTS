Significant accounting policies

2.1 Basis of preparation of Financial Statements

The standalone financial statements of the Company have

been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting

Standards (Ind AS) notified under the section 133 of the

Companies Act 2013 (to the extent notified) read with Rule

3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter

(Indian GAAP). Accordingly, the Company has prepared

these financial statements which comprise the Balance

Sheet as at 31 March 2023, the Statement of Profit and

Loss, the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of

Changes in Equity for the year ended 31 March 2023, and

a summary of significant accounting policies and other

explanatory information, on accrual and going concern

basis.

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the

financial statements are consistent with those followed in

the previous year.

2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies

a.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity

with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) requires

management to make judgements, estimates and

assumptions that affect the reported amounts

of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and

disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of the

reporting period. Although these estimates are based

upon management’s best knowledge of current events

and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions

and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a

material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets

or liabilities in future periods. Changes in estimates are

reflected in the financial statements in the period in

which changes are made and if material, their effects

are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

Critical accounting estimates and judgments:

The areas involving critical estimates and judgments

are:

(i)

Useful lives and residual value of property,

plant and equipment and intangible assets

Useful life and residual value are determined by

the management based on a technical evaluation

considering nature of asset, past experience,

estimated usage of the asset, vendor’s advice

etc and same is reviewed periodically, including

at each financial year end. Management reviews

the useful economic lives atleast once a year and

any changes could affect the depreciation rates

prospectively and hence the asset carrying values

changes accordingly. The Company also reviews

its property, plant and equipment and intangible

assets, for possible impairment if there are

events or changes in circumstances that indicate

that carrying amount of assets may not be

recoverable. In assessing the property, plant and

equipment and intangible assets for impairment,

factors leading to significant reduction in profits,

the Company’s business plans and changes in

regulatory/ economic environment are taken into

consideration.

(ii) Impairment of investments

The Company has reviewed its carrying value

of long term investments in equity shares as

disclosed in note- 4 of standalone financial

statements at the end of each reporting period, for

possible impairment if there are events or changes

in circumstances that indicate that carrying

amount of assets may not be recoverable. If the

recoverable value, which is based upon market

price or economic circumstances and future plan

is less than its carrying amount, the impairment

loss is accounted.

(iii) Claims and Litigations

The Company is the subject of lawsuits and

claims arising in the ordinary course of business

from time to time. The Company reviews any

such legal proceedings and claims on an ongoing

basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance

when making accrual and disclosure decisions.

The Company establishes accruals for those

contingencies where the incurrence of a loss

is probable and can be reasonably estimated,

and it discloses the amount accrued and the

amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess

of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is

necessary for the Company’s financial statements

subsidiaries (together referred as ‘the Group’) are engaged in

retail sales of food through strong international and home grown

brands addressing different food market segments. International

brands include Domino’s, Dunkin’ and Popeyes. For Domino’s,

the Parent Company has exclusive rights to open and operate

Domino’s Restaurants in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and

Nepal. Currently, Domino’s is operated by the Parent Company

in India and by its subsidiaries in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

The Group has entered into Chinese cuisine segment through

its home grown brand Hong’s Kitchen. The registered office of

the Parent Company is located at Plot No. 1A, Sector 16-A,

Noida-201301, UP, India.

The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue in

accordance with a resolution of the directors on 17th May, 2023.

2.

Significant accounting policies

2.1 Basis of preparation of Financial Statements

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have

been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting

Standards (Ind AS) notified under the section 133 of the

Companies Act 2013 (to the extent notified) read with Rule

3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter

(Indian GAAP). Accordingly, the Group has prepared these

financial statements which comprise the Balance Sheet as

at 31 March 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss, the

Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Changes in

Equity for the year ended 31 March 2023, and a summary

of significant accounting policies and other explanatory

information on accrual and going concern basis.

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the

financial statements are consistent with those followed in

the previous year.

2.2 Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the

financial statement of the Parent Company, its subsidiary

companies Jubilant FoodWorks Lanka (Private) Limited,

Jubilant FoodWorks Bangladesh Limited (formerly Jubilant

Golden Harvest Limited), Jubilant Foodworks Netherland

B.V., Jubilant FoodWorks International Investments Limited,

and Jubilant FoodWorks International Luxembourg and

controlled trust viz. JFL Employee Welfare Trust (together

called as ‘the Group') and of the associates DP Eurasia

N.V., Hashtag Loyalty Private Limited, Wellversed Health

Private Limited and Roadcast Tech Solutions Private

Limited as at March 31, 2023. Control is achieved when

the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns

from its involvement with the investee and has the ability

to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the

Group has:

(i)

Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it

the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the

investee)

(ii) Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its

involvement with the investee, and

(iii) The ability to use its power over the investee to affect

its returns.

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting

rights result in control. To support this presumption and

when the Group has less than a majority of the voting

or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all

relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it

has power over an investee, including:

(i)

The contractual arrangement with the other vote

holders of the investee

(ii)

Rights arising from other contractual arrangements

(iii) The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

(iv) The size of the group’s holding of voting rights relative

to the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other

voting rights holders.

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee

if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to

one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation

of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over

the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of

the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a

subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included

in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group

gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the

subsidiary.

Consolidated financial statements are prepared using

uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other

events in similar circumstances. If a member of the group

uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the

consolidated financial statements for like transactions and

events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are

made to that group member’s financial statements in preparing

the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with

the group’s accounting policies.

The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose

of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as

that of the parent Company, i.e., year ended on March 31,

2023. When the end of the reporting period of the parent is

different from that of a subsidiary or associate, the subsidiary

or associate prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional

financial information as of the same date as the financial

statements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the

financial information of the subsidiary or associate, unless it is:
