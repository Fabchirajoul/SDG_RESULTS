‘Independent Auditor’s Report’ has

been duly incorporated as a part of

this report.:

Dear Shareholders,

The year 2022-23 has been

a landmark year for your

Company in many ways. As we

have shared in earlier investor

communications, a few years

ago we embarked upon our

transformation journey with a

vision to make 2020-2030 the

“Decade of Bajaj Electricals”.

As we completed Horizon 1 of

that strategic roadmap during

the year gone by and have

entered Horizon 2, we are

beginning to see the clear fruits

and milestones in this journey.

• We became net-debt-free in

March 2022 and have exited

the year gone by with surplus

cash. We have maintained

our record of consistently

generating positive cashflow

from operations every quarter,

all through the volatile market

conditions.

• Our business model is

structurally fixed with the right

focus on each business in line

with our strategic goals and

long-term value creation.

• Our EPC (Power Transmission

and Power Distribution) business

has delivered a full turn-around

and been profitable on a

full-year basis, demonstrating

our commitment to set that

business on the right strategic

and operating path.

The scheme of arrangement

that we had announced last

year for the demerger of our

EPC business into a separate

listed entity “Bajel Projects

Limited” is in the final stages

of regulatory approvals and

the process will be completed

in the coming few months.

Operationally the teams are

fully geared up for this.

During the year we relaunched

our flagship brand “BAJAJ” with

the BUILT FOR LIFE positioning.

I believe this will be a clear

pivot and marker for the destiny

and growth of the BAJAJ

brand for several decades to

come – to fortify its relationship

with consumers and its distinct

position in the marketplace.

The investments and efforts in our

research and development are

beginning to deliver outcomes in

the form of a wide range of new,

distinct and innovative products

across various categories.

This along with our renewed

brand thrust, has been and will

continue to be the key enabler

for growth in our market shares

during the year gone by and the

years to come.

Our financial and operational

performance continues to

improve. In a year that has

been challenging all around

due to continuing impact of

the Russia-Ukraine war and

rising interest rates, leading

to subdued consumption

demand, our performance

has been ahead of industry

benchmarks and peers.

ESG (Environmental, Social,

and Governance) is an integral

part of our business strategy.

We prioritize responsible

operations and value creation

for all stakeholders. Through

targeted initiatives, we reduce

our environmental impact,

promote social well-being, and

uphold strong governance

practices. Our commitment

to ESG ensures sustainable

growth, innovation, and

positive contributions to the

environment, society, and

economy.

We have continued to drive

organisational transformation

and strengthening, in

terms of talent at all levels,

systems and processes and

workplace culture. As part

of our commitment to better

corporate governance as

well as professionalising the

management, during the

year our Board decided to

split the roles of Chairman

and: Managing Director.

Accordingly, I continue as

Executive Chairman of the

Company, while our erstwhile

Executive Director, Anuj Poddar

was elevated to the position of

Managing Director and Chief

Executive Officer.

It would be worthy to note that all

these changes and achievements

(not just in the year gone by, but

over the last few years), have

been realised in a period that has

been amongst the most volatile

and challenging for all of industry

and all countries and economies,

based on my experience over

the last several decades. That to

me, is the most gratifying aspect

of it, as it represents the new

Bajaj Electricals Limited – and

the grit, resilient and unwavering

executional and strategic focus

of our leadership and teams. So, I

am tempted to say that while BUILT

FOR LIFE is the positioning of our

flagship consumer brand BAJAJ,

it also reflects the ethos of what

your company stands for and will

become synonymous with.

Our future is equally exciting: as we

soon split into 2 companies going

forward – Bajaj Electricals Limited

and Bajel Projects Limited – we

have laid strong foundations for

each of them to do well and grow

at a faster pace and add more

value in their respective domains.

As always, I remain deeply

grateful for the contributions

of Anuj Poddar, team Bajaj,

business associates, our entire

Board of Directors and you, our

shareholders, for your trust in us.

Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer's Message

Our Consumer Products segment

delivered growth of 13.5% during the

previous year. This points to clear market-

share growth on the back of several

product launches and ongoing portfolio

premiumisation. The segmental PBIT

grew from H 226 crores in 2021-22 to H 247

crores. Despite the various challenges

on costs as well as competitive pricing

intensity, we have held on to our margins.

In the previous year, we carved out

Lighting Solutions as a separate business

segment, given our planned thrust for

that business in the coming years. This

segment delivered growth of 4.1% in a

period where industry de-grew and the

segmental PBIT grew from H 59 crores in

2021-22 to H 87 crores. We shall continue

to invest in this segment to make it a

strong growth driver for us going forward.

Our EPC segment has delivered a

strong turnaround with revenue growth

of 29.5% in the previous year and a

positive PBIT of H 7 crores on a full-year

basis. This marks the culmination of our

phase of consolidating this business to

put it on an operationally robust path

with strong project execution and

controls. Going forward, based on its

strong order book and the benefit of

operating as a separate, focused entity,

I am confident it will deliver strong

growth and value creation.

Our strong financial performance

is the outcome of several ongoing

strategic initiatives, a few of which

I will talk about.

Brand: Our brands are our most

valuable assets as a company in

the consumer space. A couple

of years ago we embarked

upon defining an overall brand

architecture framework that

would propel your Company into

operating as a ‘house of multiple

brands’, each with a distinct

identity and positioning. As a part

of this we relaunched our flagship

brand 'BAJAJ' with the BUILT FOR

LIFE positioning. Going forward

you will see the multiple-brands-

with-distinct-identities strategy play

out and pivot us into becoming a

highly consumer-centric company.

Products: We have developed

a strong product development

roadmap – with meaningful

innovations and consumer value

propositions. During the previous

year we launched 165 SKUs in the

Consumer Products segment and

513 SKUs in the Lighting Solutions

segment. These launches have

helped plug gaps in our portfolio,

drive greater premiumisation

and grow market-shares across

categories. This is enabled by

strong research and development

capabilities, which we shall

continue to invest in, to build long

term perspective competitive

advantage.

Operational excellence: We

have clearly identified areas of

operational improvement. This

covers various aspects of sourcing,

manufacturing, logistics, go-to-

market and technology. Each

of these is being addressed in

a focused manner. During the

previous year we embarked upon

an ambitious digital transformation

exercise that shall culminate

over the next 2 years. All of these

initiatives will not just provide direct

financial benefits but make us a

best-in-class company that is far

more agile and competitive player.

People and culture: A

fundamental aspect of our

ongoing transformation has been

the revamp of our talent pool and

organisational culture. During the

year, we have further strengthened

our organisation across levels from

the induction of our first batch of

management trainees right up to

the onboarding of senior talent

at the leadership level. We were

recognised by Great Place To

Work ® Institute India for the third

time in a row, fostered Diversity

and Inclusion through relevant

policies and are institutionalising

a professionalised and high-

performance-driven organisation.

Sustainability: Sustainability is a

core value that guides our business

decisions. We are committed

to reducing our environmental

impact through sustainable

manufacturing processes,

optimising resource efficiency,

minimising our carbon footprint,

and promoting supply chain

efficiency. We firmly believe that

by prioritising sustainability, we

can provide consumers with

eco-friendly products while

driving circularity, efficient waste: Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to share that

despite the various market

challenges, our financial

performance during the

previous year has been strong

and clearly ahead of industry.

management, water and energy

conservation, and enhancing

community livelihood.

On a personal note, I would like

to acknowledge and thank all of

you, our shareholders as well as
