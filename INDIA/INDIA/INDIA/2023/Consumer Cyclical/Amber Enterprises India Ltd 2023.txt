dear Stakeholders,

“Following a promising start to 2022, the Indian air

conditioning industry maintained a strong performance

as time progressed. The Indian Air Conditioner market

despite several turbulences has travelled a northwards

journey over the years and is expected to continue its

growth trajectory in the upcoming years. Amber has

been an integral part of this journey since the beginning.

Amidst this ever-evolving landscape, one thing remains

unwavering: our steadfast belief in ‘Quality and Innovation’

and to be the ‘First Choice of Customers’.

Despite the geopolitical tensions and resulting inflationary

pressures, we maintained a steady growth across

all business divisions. While navigating the various

concerns and transitions in the economy and industry,

we kept pushing ourselves to be better prepared

and adapt to changing landscapes. Our strategic

collaborations, coupled with our three-decade industry

experience and robust capabilities, positioned us well to

explore opportunities and expand beyond our current

geographical presence.

The Economic Survey of India published in 2020

introduced and advocated the concept of “Assemble in

India for the World” which may enable India to forge an

export trajectory similar to China. Under the survey four

key electronic products segments that are estimated to

witness growing consumer adoption in the forthcoming

years were — 1) Mobile phones; 2) Tablets, notebooks,

and desktop PCs; 3) Smart TVs, audio devices, video and

music streaming devices; 4) Consumer appliances (AC,

washing machine, refrigerator, and heaters).

Progress of nation without transportation is unimaginable,

it’s one of the basic needs. Rapidly changing infrastructure

and ultra modernisation of transportation systems are

changing the way we think of connectivity. Without good,

safe, comfortable efficient transport system, which is also

environment friendly, country will not be able to move

ahead in the global context. Indian railways and metro

network have undergone a seismic reform. All the new

trains are of fast speed and air conditioned, the web

network of metro trains is further expanding from metro

cities to tier 2 and 3 cities which brings sizable opportunity

for Amber to be a part of India’s mobility growth story.

The country witnessed an unprecedented growth in

electronics manufacturing in the past Kive years on

account of strong policy initiatives by the Government of

India. The flagship program of ‘Make in India’ coupled with

‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ is expected to further accelerate the

trajectory.

The growth in electronics is expected to be fuelled

by the middle class aspiring for a higher standard of

living. Rising disposable income, rapid urbanization and

education are likely to drive this aspiration higher. Coupled

with technologies such as big data analytics, artificial

intelligence, robotics, and smart automation that will

deeply embed electronics in everyday life, the electronics

industry is estimated to be a strong pillar of economic

growth and Amber is well positioned to capture and

capitalise on these opportunities.
