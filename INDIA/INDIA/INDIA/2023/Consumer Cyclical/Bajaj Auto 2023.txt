Dear Shareholder,

In my last year’s: letter to you, I had written, “I have never seen…

such a… sheer scarcity of semiconductors. No modern automobile

can exist without a slew of semiconductor chips. Motorcycles and

top-of-the-line electric vehicles like the Chetak are no exceptions.

It is difficult to predict when this supply scarcity will end.”

Thankfully, this terrible supply scarcity was over by the end of the

first quarter of FY2023. Thereafter, your Company was all set to

increase substantially production and sales.

Except for one hiccup — exports. Your Company is by far the

leading exporter of motorcycles and three-wheelers. In FY2022,

exports accounted for 52.7% of Bajaj Auto’s net sales. Thanks to a

host of factors completely outside your Company’s control,

exports dropped both in volume and in value. Political and

economic uncertainties in several major importing countries such

as Nigeria, Egypt, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh; demonetisation in

Nigeria; unavailability of US dollars in the hands of importers; and

more. Bajaj Auto was not the only company that was affected.

All exporters were.

Under the circumstances, your Company consciously decided to

‘bite the bullet’ and reduce its exposure in some of its key

international markets. The rationale: we are in the business to

generate revenues and profits, not receivables.

Thankfully, 2022-23 (FY2023) saw the effects of Covid abate significantly, with citizens as well

as businesses finally reverting to normalcy. However, the flip side was the impact of inflationary

trends, supply chain disruptions emanating from China, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict

impacting commodity prices. India’s retail, or consumer price, inflation remained high and for

much of the year was above 6%. To combat this, the RBI regularly raised its policy repo rate,

starting May 2022, with cumulative increase being 250 basis points. In addition, thanks to

higher global commodity prices and depreciation of the Indian rupee, the current account

deficit increased.

However, despite these critical challenges, India emerged as the fastest growing major economy

in the world. The second advance estimate of national income released by the Central Statistics

office (CSO) on 28 February 2023 expects real GDP growth in to be 7.0%; and that of gross value

added to be 6.6%

Given this overall macroeconomic scenario, it needs to be asked how has Bajaj Auto fared?

Motorcycles (Domestic)

After peaking at 13.6 million units in FY2019, domestic sale of motorcycles for the industry steadily fell

year-on-year right to under 9 million units in FY2022 — a drop of 34% over three consecutive years.

Thankfully, FY2023 finally led to some growth: to 10.2 million units, or a rise of 13.9% over the trough of

the previous year. Even so, domestic sales remained significantly below the all-time high of 13.6 million

units in FY2019.

Given this industry scenario, how did Bajaj Auto perform?

Table 1 gives the data on domestic sales.

17.3%

Despite the Company’s domestic sales in FY2023 being 8.4% higher than in the previous year, it grew

slower than the market. Consequently, Bajaj Auto’s market share witnessed a decline to 17.3%.

The greatest volume of sales occurs at the lower end, comprising 100-110 cc models. Given the strong

competitive price pressures in this segment and in a milieu of increasing commodity prices and

shortages of key semiconductors in the first half of FY2023, it made relatively less sense from the point

of view of profits and shareholder value to push for on these products. Therefore, Bajaj Auto

consciously focused to grow the sales of its more profitable models in the 125 cc range and above.

It was a clear choice where per unit EBIDTA became a key variable.

Below is a segment-wise analysis of the domestic motorcycle market, followed by what it implies for

the Company.

100cc segment: This segment accounts for by far the highest unit-wise sale of motorcycles in India.

Bajaj Auto is represented here by the CT and Platina brands.

l

In FY2023, this segment grew by 6%, but over a lower base in FY2022.

l

For reasons mentioned earlier, Bajaj Auto consciously curtailed presence here. Consequently,

Bajaj Auto’s sales was an average of 53,746 units per month, with market share of 12.2%.

Bajaj Auto’s sales in this segment grew 38%, market share improved by 300 bps to 23.9%.

l

Having introduced this sleek model in FY2020, it sold an average of 52,439 units per month through

FY2023. We look forward to such impressive growth of the Pulsar 125 in FY2024 also.

150cc and above segment: This segment is the fastest growing and represents 22% of the domestic

motorcycle market. Bajaj Auto is represented here by the Pulsar, Avenger, Dominar, KTM and

Husqvarna brands.

l

In FY2023, this segment grew by 27%.

Irrespective of the market segments, Bajaj Auto is firmly entrenched in the domestic motorcycle market

with the brand — Pulsar. For instance, Pulsar 125 is a much sought after bike. It is also worth noting

that in FY2023, the Pulsar’s, as a brand, grew by 33% and sold over 1 million units annually in the

domestic motorcycle market.

Probiking (KTM)

The probiking business consists of two brands: KTM and Husqvarna. The KTM brand and its models are

well recognised across India. At present, the Husqvarna models are being seeded.

Unfortunately, production and hence sales in Q1 FY2023 were badly affected by the shortage of

semiconductors. Consequently, the volume of KTM sales for FY2023 grew by 4% over FY2022.

Thankfully, this crisis abated from the second quarter, and sales picked up. Thus, if we compare

volumetric sales for nine-month period of FY2023 versus the same nine-month period of FY2022,

KTM showed a growth of 16%. Chart C plots the sales of KTMs in India over the years.

Urbanite (Chetak EV)

In FY2021, this legendary brand was re-introduced as a best-in-class electric scooter. Woven together

in this iconic design are simple lines and smooth surfaces – creating a thing of beauty and delight. It

demonstrates the future of mobility, and offers a digitised, fully-connected riding experience by virtue

of being embedded with mobility solutions like data communication, security and user authentication

that enable customers to have a seamless ownership and riding experience.

The global semiconductor shortage that affected the industry right up to the first quarter of FY2023

also affected the Chetak. Thus, despite market demand, Bajaj Auto could not produce the quantities

needed right up to the end of Q1 FY2023. Thereafter, the supply-side constraints eased, and we

increased the manufacturing of the Chetak. To give an example, the Company sold 8,187 units in

FY2022. This has risen to 36,260 in FY2023. Table 2 gives the data on domestic sales by BAL and

Three-Wheelers (Domestic)

Three-wheelers has been a growth story. In FY2019, domestic sales for the industry were 690,425

units. This fell by 10% in FY2020. Thereafter, the Covid-19 lockdown crashed sales in FY2021 by a

staggering 66% to 208,091 units. Thankfully, FY2022 saw an increase of 12% to 234,047 units. Finally,

FY2023 has righted things. The three-wheeler markets picked up across India.

For the industry, sales picked up substantially to reach nearer to the pre-Covid levels. In FY2023

alone, the volume of sales went up by 76% to 411,093 units. This is especially gratifying because it

signals that owners and operators are again back on track — aided by generous financing offers.

l

Bajaj Auto’s domestic sale of three-wheelers also grew by 87% to 300,009 units in FY2023.

l

Domestic sale of Bajaj Auto’s passenger vehicles more than doubled over the previous year to

261,386 units in FY2023.

l

In effect, in the domestic market, Bajaj Auto is the undisputed leader in all the segments.

International Business

Unlike in the recent past, FY2023 has been a difficult year for exports — thanks to serious geo-political

uncertainties, as well as economic challenges like hyper-inflation and scarcity in availability of US

dollars for key importing nations.

In FY2023

l

KTM recorded its highest ever volume of export sales.

l

We sold 1.8 million units versus 2.5 million vehicles in the previous year.

Though Bajaj Auto’s sales have declined, its market share across major geographies is

largely intact.:

Realigning resources to meet new regulatory requirements

The Government of India has notified the following requirements to address fire safety concerns of

electric vehicles as mandatory requirements for CMVR certification and for FAME II, PLI incentives:

l

AIS 156: This standard addresses the functional safety requirements for electric vehicles and

traction batteries. Within it, Amendment 3 focuses on additional safety requirements for REESS /

Traction Battery Packs, charger and battery cell requirements, as well as thermal propagation tests.

l

MHI guidelines: Ministry of Heavy Industry (MHI) also published an office memorandum dated

2 November 2022 mandating various cell / battery pack / BMS level tests, as pre-conditions for

claiming FAME II / PLI scheme incentives.

Although, AIS 156 was issued earlier covering up to Amendment 1, the subsequent Amendment 3 plus

the new MHI guidelines appeared suddenly in November 2022 — thus giving only four months for EV

manufacturers to comply with these before 31 March 2023.

The BS6 OBD 2 norms were a big engineering change. The notification of the OBD norms splitting it into

OBD 2A and 2B came in only in November 2022. The powertrain and vehicle configurations had to be

adjusted to meet the new norms rapidly.

Alternate source needed for de-risking meant that R&D had to calibrate and homologate many more

variants to meet these new norms. Over 47 variants had to be homologated. This was done in an

organised manner. We are proud to state that the entire range of two and three-wheelers has been

successfully homologated in time.

Operations

TPM

Bajaj Auto’s ‘back end’ consists of its Manufacturing, Engineering, Development and Materials functions.

The principles and philosophy of TPM guide these functions in achieving excellence both individually

and collectively to achieve the highest productivity, world-class quality, and lowest cost. ‘The TPM way’

has been successfully extended to include Bajaj Auto’s vendors, dealers and distributors

Bajaj Auto’s TPM at Operations

Bajaj Auto is ‘first in the industry’ in having all its manufacturing plants certified for the ‘Special Award

for TPM Achievement’ by Japan Institute for Plant Maintenance (JIPM). In FY2020, the BAL Chakan plant

was also conferred the ‘Advance Special Award for TPM Achievement’ which is a step behind the ‘World

Class TPM’ award.

Bajaj Auto’s back-end has defined various ‘focused improvement themes’ which get constantly

improved through TPM tools and techniques. In the last few years, we have established a production

system that can flexibly respond to faster new product manufacturing and small-volume production of

multiple items.

Further, to sustain all improvements and excel, we work on the ‘Bajaj Production System (BPS)’ which

aims at ‘Better Flow with Better Quality’. Through this, we are in the process of aligning our efforts at

the back-end to a ‘No Stock Production’ system encompassing the entire supply chain.

BAL engineering has developed capabilities for Digitisation and Industry 4.0 through its various

verticals including automation and robotics. We strive to improve operations parameters through

accelerating digital transformation in both production and process management.:

Vendor TPM Activities

BAL seeks the co-existence and co-prosperity of our business partners based on mutual trust.

We facilitate fair trade, environmentally preferable purchasing, human resources development, safety

and health activities as well as more reinforced and efficient procuring that gives consideration to

various risks.

The TPM concept is pervasive at Tier I vendors’ end with the help of BAVA (Bajaj Auto Vendors

Association). Moreover, Bajaj Auto’s TPM practicing Tier I vendors have extended the TPM practices

down the supply chain to their vendors.

Under the Safety, Health and Environment pillar of Bajaj Auto’s TPM and in alignment with the ‘Green

Purchase Policy’, various activities were initiated — with the majority of our vendors having been

certified for ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. Our 39 vendor groups have started with renewable energy

and have implemented rooftop solar equivalent to 35 MW power.

We have also taken up a drive to maximise supplies to all our plants from vendors within the plant

cluster. The majority of our supplies at respective BAL manufacturing locations are being done by

vendors; located in each cluster. This has significantly shortened the length of our supply chain and

reduced our carbon footprint.

TPM in Dealer Service and Overseas Distributor Plants

TPM methodologies are being continuously spread across our business partners in India and the other

global locations. The tool is kaizen, which is well spread across our dealers and distributors.

We started the implementation of TPM at our international distributor plants. As of FY2023, 19 such

distributor plants have been practicing TPM for over a year. Consequently, these are now experiencing

improvements in manpower productivity, production rate, first-time-right quality and reduction in cost

parameters. Four of our distributor plants were evaluated for the qualification criterion of the ‘BAL TPM

Award’. All of them have experienced more than 30% growth in their KPI parameters. In FY2024, three

more countries are expected to join the league of BAL TPM award.

As on 31 March 2023, we had 1,012 dealerships practicing TPM. As on 31 March 2023, 418 dealerships

were awarded the ‘BAL TPM Award’.

Human Resource

Over the last year, we have refined and focused on 4 key areas – capability building, employee

engagement, learning and development, and employee wellbeing.

As part of our Capability Building, we have been able to recruit, invest, develop and promote internal

talent and have attracted external talent for key leadership roles across functions and BUs. Thus, with

focused efforts, we have been able to build a strong leadership and management cadre.

We launched Lean In which is a global community dedicated to helping foster leadership, advancement,

and inclusion of women in the workplace, strategised and launched campus challenges-TORQ across

28 premier engineering colleges including top 8 IITs and IISc to attract the sharpest minds of the

country and developed teams, from scratch, in record time with niche skills like EMI/EMC design,

reliability engineering, IoT and OS reprogramming and mobile application development.

Through these and other initiatives, Chetak Technology Ltd. (our 100% subsidiary) has 54% female

strength for L4 and below level, and 22% for L3+ level, which is the highest across all business units.

To strengthen Employee Engagement, we launched for the first time, a survey named Pulse across the

organisation to gauge the overall engagement levels, identify the areas of improvement, plan focused

interventions, and ascertain the impact of people interventions. The initiative received an outstanding

response rate of 92%.

We also conducted various events throughout the year such as Mental Health Awareness Week and

Women’s Week Celebration, Prodigy for celebrating the achievements of employee’s children and Disha

as a career guidance service to boost the career of employees’ children in the right direction.

We recognise the importance of investing in the Learning and Development of our employees to keep

up with the changing industry trends and technological advancements. By investing in our employees,

we were able to stay ahead of the curve and continue to deliver innovative and high-quality electric

vehicles to our customers.

We partnered with industry best trainers to provide training and certification in EV related fields.

We collaborated with IIT Madras to upskill employees in EEE-related skills including software and

launched a 6-month certification course on E-mobility and Electric Vehicle Engineering.

Charged and Supercharged were launched for R&D-GTE’s to equip them with foundational skills

necessary to build an EV and also launched up!SURGE and up!SWING which focused on the learning

and development of women employees.

As a part of Employee Wellbeing initiatives and aligning with our principles of ‘incorporating best

market practices’ and ‘continuous improvement’, we have launched Paternity Leave Policy for

our employees.

These initiatives have led us to winning multiple awards and recognitions such as:

‘Significant Achievement in HR Excellence’ as part of the CII National HR Excellence

Award Confluence 2021-22

ET HR World Future Skills Awards 2022 under the category of ‘Best Approach to Implementing a

Learning Experience Platform (LXP)’ and ‘L&D Future Leaders’.

Gold Award as part of the Brandon Hall Group Technology Excellence Awards 2022, under the category

‘Best Advance in Learning Management Technology (LMT)’

And our managers won The Great Manager Awards 2022 and received The HR40under40’s Future HR

Leader Award.:

Corporate governance is about promoting fairness, transparency, accountability, commitment to values,

ethical business conduct and considering the interest of all stakeholders while conducting business.

In accordance with the provisions of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)

Regulations, 2015 and amendments thereto (‘the Listing Regulations, 2015’), given below are the

corporate governance policies and practices of Bajaj Auto Ltd. (‘the Company’, ‘Bajaj Auto’ or ‘BAL’)

for the year 2022-23 (or ‘FY2023’).

This report states compliance as per requirements of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) and the

Listing Regulations, 2015 as applicable to the Company. As will be seen, Bajaj Auto’s corporate

governance practices and disclosures have gone well beyond complying with the statutory and

Philosophy

For us, corporate governance is a reflection of principles entrenched in our values and policies and also

embedded in our day-to-day business practices, leading to value-driven growth. The commitment of the

Bajaj group to the highest standards of good governance practices predates SEBI and the provisions of

the Listing Regulations, 2015. Ethical dealings, transparency, fairness, disclosure and accountability are

fundamental canons of the Bajaj group. Bajaj Auto Ltd. maintains the same tradition and commitment.

Opinion of the Board

The Board confirms that, in its opinion, the independent directors on the Board fulfil the conditions

specified in the Listing Regulations, 2015 and the Act and are independent of the management.

Non-executive directors’ compensation

The shareholders of the Company through a special resolution passed at the annual general meeting of the

Company held on 22 July 2021 have, by way of an enabling provision, approved payment of commission up

to a sum not exceeding one percent of the net profits of the Company, calculated in accordance with the

provisions of section 197 and 198 of the Act, to the non-executive directors, in the manner as may be

decided by the Board of directors from time to time during the five year term up to 31 March 2026.

Consistent with this approval from the shareholders, the Company pays sitting fee of H 100,000 per

meeting to its non-executive directors for attending meetings of the Board and meetings of committees of

the Board (except Duplicate Share Certificate Issuance Committee) as member. The Company also pays

commission to the non-executive directors within the ceiling of one percent of the net profits of the

Company as computed under the applicable provisions of the Act. The said commission is decided by the

Board of directors on the recommendation of the nomination and remuneration committee and distributed

amongst the non-executive directors. With effect from 1 April 2023, the commission payable has been

enhanced from H 250,000 to H 315,000 per meeting of the Board and/or committees.

Compensation to the non-executive (including independent) directors reflects the time, effort, attendance

attendance.

such items as required to be placed before the Board for its noting and/or approval, information is

provided on various other significant items as well.

In terms of quality and importance, the information supplied by the management to the Board of the

Company exceeds the list mandated under regulation 17(7) read with Part A of Schedule II to the Listing

Initiatives for reduction of unclaimed dividend

The Company with a view to reducing the quantum of unclaimed dividend has undertaken several steps

as was done in the last few years. These primarily included proactively reaching out to shareholders,

sending periodic communications, advising the shareholders who approach the Company/KFin for

other service request to claim their dividend, if any and remitting unpaid dividend, if any for KYC

compliant folios. The amount is remitted based on the verification of the documents and bonafides of

the claim.

As a result, significant amount of unclaimed dividend was remitted to the shareholders during the year

under review. The Company will endeavour to undertake additional initiatives in this regard.

Transfer of shares to IEPF

Pursuant to section 124(6) of Companies Act, 2013 and the Investor Education and Protection Fund

Authority (Accounting, Audit, Transfer and Refund) Rules, 2016, as amended (the ‘IEPF Rules’), all

shares in respect of which dividend has not been paid or claimed for seven consecutive years or

more shall be transferred by the Company to the IEPF, within 30 days of such shares becoming due

for transfer.

Accordingly, the Company will send individual letters through ordinary/speed post and e-mail to such

shareholders, whose dividend from the year 2015-16 has remained unclaimed, requesting them to

claim the amount of unpaid dividend on or before the date on which Company must transfer the related

shares to the demat account of IEPF. The Company also publishes, on an annual basis, a notice in the

newspapers intimating the members regarding the said transfer. These details are also be made

available on the Company’s website https://www.bajajauto.com/investors/disclosures

During the year under review, the Company transferred 8,621 (previous year: 6,469) equity shares of

the face value of H 10 each relating to 28 shareholders (previous year: 45) to the demat Account of the

IEPF Authority held with NSDL/CDSL. Details of such shareholders, whose shares are transferred to

IEPF and their unpaid dividends for subsequent years are available on the website of the Company at

www.bajajauto.com

Shareholders can claim such unpaid dividends and underlying shares transferred to the Fund by

following the procedure prescribed in the IEPF Rules. A link to the procedure to claim is available on the

Company’s website at www.bajajauto.com

Shareholders are requested to get in touch with the compliance officer for further details on the subject

at investors@bajajauto.co.in

Share transfer system

SEBI’s amended regulation 40 of the Listing Regulations, 2015, prohibits the transfer of securities

(except transmission or transposition of shares) in physical form from 1 April 2019. Accordingly, the

Company has sent letters to members holding shares in physical form advising them to dematerialise

their holdings.

SEBI vide its circulars dated 25 January 2022 and 25 May 2022 has provided the guidelines to issue the

securities in dematerialised form by issuing a ‘: Letter of Confirmation’ in lieu of physical securities

certificates to the securities holder/claimant within 30 days of its receipt of such request after

removing objections, if any.

Share transfers received by the share transfer agent/Company are registered within 15 days from the

date of receipt, provided the documents are complete in all respects. The total number of shares

transferred in the physical category during 2022-23 due to transmission/deletion of name cases was

54,604 shares versus 117,310 shares during 2021-22. Such details were placed before the Board on a

quarterly basis.

Industrial Relations

Bajaj Auto’s approach to its human resources is premised on the fundamental belief in fostering

meritocracy in the organisation, which promotes diversity and offers equal opportunities to all

employees. We believe in respecting human rights and actively developing people who will contribute to

society by nurturing them and giving them opportunities to apply their skills.

In the financial year 2022-23, the Company continued to deliver on its commitment to excellence.

Passing successive milestones, business excellence has been further strengthened by well-defined

goals and employee engagement strategies. The overall employee relations with staff and workmen

across all the plants viz. Akurdi, Waluj, Chakan and Pantnagar continued to be cordial during the year.

A core component of infusing joy at the workplace is to layer-in non-work activities that get people

excited and encourage involvement. The Company has focused on ‘Yutori’ concept means ‘Joy at

Workplace’. Below are three areas under Yutori, for fostering a more positive and fulfilling professional

experience.

1. Body-Physical Happiness

Various initiatives were carried out to sustain and improve physical fitness. Some of them are

workplace improvement in terms of ergonomics, work environment improvement, health improvement

with medical check-up followed by consultation and physical fitness programs.

2. Mind-Mental Happiness

To improve mental happiness, we focused on education and training, stress-free operations, healthy

communication and interpersonal relationships, rewards and recognition as well as personal and

professional growth.

3. Soul-Spiritual Wellbeing

Various initiatives were taken for spiritual well-being like yoga and meditation sessions, women’s day

celebration, people involvement and participation through kaizen competition, trust building through

family care and trekking activities and collaborative culture development.

With the active participation and involvement of all employees, we have been able to inculcate a TPM

culture for excellence and continuous improvements across all plants. As a result, the plants have

received numerous awards during the year from CII, IIIE, QCFI, Aditya Birla Group etc. Waluj plant has

won two gold medals at the national level in the QCFI competition; both teams are qualified for

international competition.

The Company has been developing and retaining a gender-diverse talent pool of motivated employees.

The Company has taken active steps for engaging women’s talent, contributing to improving women’s

workforce participation in the economy.

With continuous improvement activities through various committees, relations with workers and unions have

improved and all wage settlements are taking place in time and without any trouble. The Company signed a

long-term settlement with the union for a period of 3.5 years on 1 January 2023 at the Chakan plant.

Prioritising employees’ health, various state-of-the-art sports and health facilities have been provided

to the employees. Employees have bagged prizes in multiple sports events like weightlifting, swimming

organised by Industrial Sports Association (ISA), Pune. Employees of Waluj plant won 8 gold medals,

5 silver medals and 6 bronze medals at 42nd National Athletics Championship.

With a view to serving the community, the employees were also involved in Company organised

charitable events. These include donation drives, stalls for NGOs, blood donation camps,

tree plantations etc.

The Company will continue its efforts for building and sustaining a high sense of belongingness and

high-performance culture at the workplace.

sub-section (5) of section 135:

(a) Taking into account the commitments made by the company for the ongoing CSR projects/

programs which are in progress and considering the project mode of CSR activity where the

projects can extend beyond the financial year, there is no shortfall in the CSR expenditure

mandated to be spent by the company during the financial year ended 31 March 2023.

(b) Further, in light of the circular dated 25 August 2021 issued by Ministry of Corporate Affairs

(‘MCA’) on the Frequently Asked Questions on CSR, mere disbursal of funds for implementation

of a project does not amount to spending unless the implementing agency utilises the whole

amount.

(c) As per provisions of section 135(6) of the Act, any amount remaining unspent under section

135(5) pursuant to any ongoing project shall be transferred by the company within a period of

30 days from the end of the financial year to a special account to be opened by the company.

Accordingly, such amount has been transferred by the Company to the specified account so

opened within the prescribed period. As per the said circular of MCA, this amounts to meeting

of the obligation and due compliance under section 135 of the said Act and hence there is no

shortfall of spends.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so,

consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained

in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a

material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management for the standalone financial statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of

these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other

comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally

accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting

records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting

frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates

that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that

were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and

presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether

due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a

going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless

Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable

assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a

material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in

the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone

financial statements.:

Managing Director who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Core Management Committee examines

performance both from a product as well as from a geographical perspective and has identified two operative reportable

segments from which significant risks and rewards are derived viz. Automotive business and Investments.

20 Fair value measurement

The Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each Balance Sheet date. Fair value is the

price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants

at the measurement date.

The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the

asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their best economic interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits

by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest

and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to

measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair

value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

• Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

• Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or

indirectly observable

• Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

The Company has set policies and procedures for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurement of financial assets,

which includes valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.

For fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities based on the nature, characteristics and

risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes.

• Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions (note 1 clause 1)

• Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy (note 32)

• Investment properties (note 3)

• Financial instruments (including those carried at amortised cost) (note 32):

obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there

is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
