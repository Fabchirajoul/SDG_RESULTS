Dear Shareholders,

It is with immense pride and excitement

that I address you in this annual

report, reflecting on the tremendous

achievements of Prestige Group during

FY 23. This year has been nothing short of

remarkable, filled with several highest-

ever milestones, highest-ever sales,

and collections, as well as numerous

successful

project

launches.

We

have ventured into new geographies,

expanded our portfolio, and have a

robust pipeline of exciting projects

ahead.

With

a

commitment

to

excellence and a clear vision, Prestige

is now all set to scale for success and

embark on an even more promising

journey of growth and prosperity.

Allow me to elaborate on some of our

performance highlights for the year:

Highest-ever Sales

We are delighted to announce that we

achieved a record-breaking highest

sale of ₹129,309 Mn during the year.

This

remarkable

accomplishment

represents a significant increase of

25% compared to the previous year’s

(high base) sales of ₹103,822 Mn. The

dedication and hard work of our teams

have resulted in this exceptional growth,

and I extend my heartfelt appreciation

to every member of the Prestige family

for their commitment to our vision.

Highest-ever Collections

Our strong sales were further backed

by the highest-ever yearly collections

of ₹98,055 Mn, which represents a

significant increase of 31% compared

to the previous year’s collections. This

signifies the trust and confidence that

our valued customers place in Prestige,

and it is a testament to the quality,

execution and reliability of our projects.

Project Launches

This year, we proudly launched 26 Mn

sft of projects, including 16 Mn sft of

residential projects and 10 Mn sft of

capex projects. These launches reflect

our focus on providing diverse and

innovative offerings to our customers,

addressing their evolving needs and

preferences. Looking ahead, we are

excited to reveal that we have a robust

pipeline of more than 75 Mn sft of

residential launches planned for the next

couple of years. This extensive pipeline

underscores

our

commitment

to

expanding our presence and delivering

value to a wider audience.

Mumbai Sales and Growth

Prospects

I am delighted to share that our Mumbai

sales have contributed approximately

₹27,132 Mn to the total sales during this

fiscal year, already accounting for an

impressive 21% of our total sales. This

significant contribution is a testament

to our strategic focus on entering and

establishing

ourselves

in

this

new

geography. We are thrilled about the

growth opportunities that lie ahead in

Mumbai and are confident in our ability

to create lasting value in this dynamic

market.

Key Launches Ahead

As we look ahead with great anticipation,

we are gearing up for some major

launches in key cities across India. In

Bengaluru, we have Prestige Park Grove

(TDA 9.23 Mn sft) and Prestige Serenity

Shores (TDA 1.5 Mn sft) in the pipeline.

Hyderabad will witness the grand

unveiling of The Prestige City (TDA

12.65 Mn sft), while Chennai will see

Prestige Pallava Gardens (TDA 4.56 Mn

sft) coming to life. Additionally, Mumbai

will witness the launch of Prestige

Ocean Towers and Prestige Nautilus.

These

strategic

projects

represent

significant opportunities for us to further

strengthen our presence in the market

and contribute significantly to our

sales. With a clear focus on delivering

exceptional value and innovation, we are

poised to seize these opportunities and

scale new heights of success.

Built for the Long-term

In the world of real estate, it’s all about

creating opportunities for our clients

and building relationships that last a

lifetime.

We are not just in the business

of selling properties; we are

in the business of elevating

lifestyle. We don’t just sell

houses; we deliver dreams

and aspirations. We believe

that success in this industry is

not just about making a quick

sale or closing a deal. As they

say, ‘Closing Deals, Opening

Doors.’ It’s about building

long-term

relationships

that are founded on trust,

integrity, and mutual respect.

It’s about creating a reputation as a

company that delivers results and

goes above and beyond to satisfy our

clients. We always keep this in mind

in everything we do. It’s not only the

immediate deal we’re aiming to close,

but also broader doors of opportunity,

relationships, and goodwill that we’re

opening. We strive to deliver excellence

in every transaction.

We are innovators and trailblazers,

always seeking new ways to serve

our clients, rise above challenges, and

exceed the expectations of our patrons.

A Big Thank you

As we celebrate the success of FY 23,

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude

to each of you for your support and

trust in Prestige. It is your belief in our

vision and commitment that drives us

to pursue excellence every day. We look

forward to building on this momentum,

exploring new horizons, and creating a

brighter future for all our stakeholders.

Thank you for being an essential part of

our journey towards greatness.

Best regards,

Venkat K. Narayana,

Managing Director

74

Prestige Estates Projects Limited

Annual Report 2022-23 75

Corporate Overview

Statutory Reports

Financial Statements:

Managing Director of the Prestige Group,

India’s leading property developer, where

he has played a pivotal role in taking the

Company to its present level.

The second son of Mr. Razack Sattar, Mr.

Rezwan entered his family’s retail business

in 1975 and diversified into property

development in 1985. Clearly, he has

inherited his father’s zest for excellence and

is a high flier from the word go. Mr. Rezwan’s

pleasant demeanour and affable nature has

been an asset for the Group’s team building

efforts. He handles all construction and

engineering activities of the Prestige Group,

where he has built a highly motivated team.

His excellent people skills have created an

environment where team members can

execute assignments with confidence and

effectiveness.

Mr. Rezwan is not a person to be limited by

business goals alone. A philanthropist by

nature, he dedicated himself to coordinating

the ‘Terry Fox Run’ – a fundraising event in

aid of Cancer Research in Bengaluru. For

this effort, the Governor General of Canada,

Mr. David Johnston, during his State visit

in 2014, awarded a Medallion and Scroll to

him. Mr. Rezwan staunchly supports the

PRAY (Pain Relief and You) Foundation,

which provides medical assistance to the

underprivileged.

Among a host of other hats that Mr. Rezwan

dons, he is an avid golfer, a music aficionado,

a wildlife photographer, a keen ornithologist,

an F1 motor sports buff and a freewheeling

cook. His interests have stemmed from his

wide travels across the globe.

The most remarkable facet of Mr. Rezwan’s

personality is his passion for collecting

Indian

Banknotes

and

Paper

Money.

His collection of Indian Paper Money is

unrivalled and the most comprehensive in

the world today.

Mr. Noaman Razack’s name is synonymous

with the Prestige retail endeavour. As

Director, Prestige Group and the youngest

son of the founder, the Late Mr. Razack

Sattar, he leads the activities of the Group’s

Retail vertical. This comprises the world-

class mall network that Prestige creates,

establishes and directs, a process he

oversees in its entirety. It includes the

three Prestige Forums in Bengaluru, one

each in Chennai, Hyderabad, Mysuru and

Mangalore. Prestige also has to its credit

Bengaluru’s landmark luxury mall UB City.

He is, as well, Director of Prestige Fashions

Private Limited, the umbrella organisation

for all garment-related retail activity in the

Group. He thus brings to the Group his

unique experience in fashion retail and

footwear, the Group’s richly textured legacy,

as embodied in Prestige The Man Store and

other franchise outlets.

That is where his career began, soon after

he graduated, drawn as he was to the idea

of quality retail as, perhaps, best expressed

in Prestige’s bespoke. The bespoke values

of focus and impeccable attention to

detail combined with his empathy with

Bengaluru and its people, so evident then,

has characterised Prestige retail’s various

avatars.

This hobby, fuelled by Mr. Rezwan’s relentless

passion and zest for knowledge, has created

the most accomplished collection of Indian

Paper Money from its inception to the present.

His collection has been built over a period

of 50 years, which saw in-depth research

and study of this subject. This culminated

in him co-authoring an encyclopedic book,

The Revised Standard Reference Guide to

Indian Paper Money, which was released in

2012. This guide has become the single most

reliable point of reference on Indian Paper

Money and can verily be said to be the Bible

for Indian Paper Money.

In 2017, Mr. Rezwan authored a second book,

One Rupee - One Hundred Years 1917-2017,

to mark the 100th anniversary of the issue

of the One Rupee note in India. Mr. Rezwan

is the Chairman of International Bank

Note Society – India Banknote Collectors’

Chapter. IBNS awarded Mr. Rezwan for his

significant contribution to The Advancement

of Numismatic Knowledge for his article

titled, ‘Banknotes of Portuguese India’. IBNS

also conferred on Mr. Rezwan the Literary

Achievement Award and the ‘Fred Philipson

Award’ Honorable Mention for his article in

the Journal.

Mr. Rezwan shares his knowledge with

students and encourages budding collectors

to promote numismatics as a hobby. He

writes regularly on Indian Paper Money

for numismatic publications in India and

overseas. His long cherished dream to

establish the ‘Rezwan Razack’s Museum on

Indian Paper Money’ in Bengaluru dedicated

to Indian Paper Money became a reality in

February 2020.

In the true sense, Mr. Rezwan is the restorer

and preserver of a national heritage,

which could otherwise have been easily

lost. His name is synonymous with Indian

numismatics and will always resonate at

a mere mention of Indian Paper Money

anywhere and forever.

As he says, “The Prestige retail vertical model

transformed Bengaluru’s lifestyle, elevating

retail to a truly international level in what

has become a world capital. Perhaps the

sum total of our efforts through the years

has been to transform in some way how

Bengaluru lives well. Our father taught us to

retail not just a product or a service but an

ideal: how Bengaluru’s citizens could express

their style”. The progression from retail to

real estate began when Prestige Estates

started in the early eighties and the current

synergy of the two was inevitable for its logic:

Prestige has always enhanced the Bengaluru

an lifestyle the way it has since the fifties

when it began with founder Late Mr. Razack

Sattar.

Work apart, he is a man of wide-ranging

interests. A proficient sportsman, golf

and hockey are his games of choice. In

his understated way, he’s much involved

with various charitable efforts too. The

recognition these bring and the widespread

acknowledgments he’s garnered in the

industry are, for him, inspiration as much as

they are accolades.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (Contd.):

Dear stakeholders ,

As the director responsible for our business responsibility report, it is with great pride and

enthusiasm that I share our unwavering commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance

(ESG) challenges. At Prestige, sustainability is at the heart of everything we do, and we strive

to set new industry standards in responsible practices.

One of our primary focuses is on green building practices, which is evident throughout our

projects’ life cycle. Right from the design stage, we conduct thorough evaluations to identify

areas for improvement, ensuring that each project aligns with our sustainability goals. We

have integrated efficient water recycling and waste management practices into our property

management services after asset handover. This not only minimises our environmental impact

but also helps create a healthier and more sustainable living environment for our customers.

We are also deeply committed to water conservation, and our efforts include the implementation

of Sewage Treatment Plants across various locations. By incorporating water flow reducers,

we not only save water but also enhance user satisfaction, as responsible water usage is a

collective responsibility.

Responsible waste disposal and smart design elements are integral components of our

approach to energy efficiency. These measures enable us to optimise energy usage, and we

are proud to be in compliance with the stringent criteria set forth by IGBC, LEED, and ECBC.

Our accomplishments are a testament to our enduring dedication to creating a greener and

more sustainable future for generations to come.

Beyond our environmental commitments, our ESG efforts extend to addressing challenges

in human rights, diversity, and inclusivity. We believe that fostering a diverse and inclusive

workforce is essential for long-term success. To this end, we have set ambitious targets and

implemented transparent communication channels that allow us to understand and address

the needs of our employees effectively. These efforts have led to significant achievements in

promoting a harmonious workplace where each individual feels valued and respected.

At Prestige, we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards, and our commitment to ethical

corporate conduct and good governance is unwavering. We recognise that the behaviour of

our employees significantly impacts our relationships with stakeholders, and therefore, we

prioritise comprehensive policies that guide and support our people in their day-to-day roles.

As we reflect on our accomplishments, we are inspired to do even more in our journey towards

sustainability. We are dedicated to continuous improvement and innovation, always striving to

find new ways to reduce our environmental footprint and positively impact the communities

we serve.

Thank you for your continued support and trust in our company. Together, we can create a

brighter and more sustainable future.

Sincerely,

Director
