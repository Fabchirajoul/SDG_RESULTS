Dear Shareholders,

FY23 has witnessed a healthy performance by Arvind

despite the persistent uncertainty in the global market. The

Company’s deep-rooted strengths and cautious approach

to the macro changes enabled it to stay on course of its

growth trajectory. This mood of caution was not limited to

Arvind but underlined the general sentiment in the textile

industry, both within and outside India. The latter part of

the year started seeing some postponement in purchases

amid the possibility of softening of consumer demand as

a result of the interest rate hikes initiated to combat the

inflation spikes. On the bright side, however, this means

sharper inventory management, which will augur well for

the industry going forward.

I am happy to share that despite these headwinds, your

Company has had a good FY23, marked by a healthy set of

numbers and progress along the key operational metrics of

our business. The Advanced Material Division (AMD) grew

22% during the year. Notwithstanding the hit suffered by

the Denim and Garment volumes, we also succeeded in

maintaining good volumes in the Woven business. Softer

commodity and energy prices helped maintain margins,

despite volume loss in certain parts of our portfolio. Our

positive financial performance also enabled us to fulfil our

objective of reducing our long-term debt by `300+ Cr.

during the year.

Given this scenario, we believe we are at the right time

and place to make strategic investments that will position

both our businesses to take advantage of the opportunities

that we see emerging ahead. The launch of Productivity

Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme 2.0, state-wise allocation

of seven parks, and focus on concluding the Free Trade

Agreements with key geographies promises an exciting

mix of opportunities for the growth of the Indian textiles

industry. These developments are expected to lead to the

creation of new capacities with scale-up in production,

with the Government’s focus on promoting competitive

manufacturing and volume production.

In recent quarters, we have substantially expanded our

sustainability initiatives, and we are excited to announce

that our new 46.9 MW Hybrid Solar-Wind facility will be

operational by June 2023. With the implementation of this

facility, we will fulfill 47% of our electricity requirements

The Advanced Material

Division (AMD) grew

22% during the year.

Notwithstanding the hit

suffered by the Denim

and Garment volumes,

we also succeeded in

maintaining good overall

volumes in the Woven

business.
