Message from the Chairman

I take great pleasure in welcoming all shareholders to our 42nd Annual General Meeting. Thanks to the

use of technology, participation in the AGM is now possible from anywhere in the world as well as from

all parts of the country. This is surely a big step in better corporate governance and SEBI needs to be

congratulated for being so forward looking.

Last year, we were rejoicing because we had completed 40 years of our partnership with Suzuki,

Japan, and also because our nation had completed 75 years of independence. In the last year, the

national economy has done well. We have controlled inflation better than most others. Infrastructure is

improving rapidly. The stock market is reflecting these events and is at record levels. India is now the

fastest-growing major economy in the world and the future outlook is bright. The reforms and policies

during the last nine years have imparted a new dynamism and made the economy far more resilient

than ever before. This is largely the outcome of the government recognising and encouraging private

enterprise and placing economic growth as the topmost priority for the nation. A just and equitable

society, and social harmony, requires that productive economic opportunities are available to all.

Democracy cannot, in a large and diverse country like ours, strengthen its roots merely on the basis of

doles and promises. Economic growth and wealth creation are needed. I sincerely hope that we continue

to strengthen the efforts that are now being made to promote growth and do not lose our focus on the

importance of creating wealth.

The people have placed their faith in the private sector for accelerating industrial development. All

entrepreneurs have to consider what more they can do to increase the competitiveness of manufacturing

activities in India. The nation will move forward faster if companies grow faster. This requires that

companies must find ways of reducing costs, increasing profits and investing these in technology

development and expansion. Frugal management practices can make a big difference to profit levels

and resource generation, as MSIL has demonstrated over the years. Frugal practices will also lead to the

personal wealth of entrepreneurs increasing much faster because higher growth of companies will result

in the value of equity holdings rising rapidly.

The experience of your Company has shown that workers have a huge untapped potential to make

substantial and sustained improvements to manufacturing systems and practices, resulting in increased

productivity and reduced costs. Manufacturing industries need to find ways to unlock this potential

as that will significantly increase their profitability and growth. To a large extent, the success that your

Company enjoys has been because our workers have understood and experienced the benefits of

helping MSIL grow.

Thanks to the efforts of employees, vendors, dealers and associates, your Company had an excellent

FY 2022-23. Production increased by 19% and was the highest ever. Our sales fell short of 2 million

by a whisker. Our turnover and profits were at record levels. Semiconductor shortages still impacted

production but to a lesser extent. I expect that during the current year, there will be further improvements,

though normalcy in supplies will still not be achieved. Your Company, with the active support of Suzuki

Japan, has been working to strengthen its portfolio of products to meet the changing market situation.

We now have four very well-accepted SUVs in the market and are on our way to assume leadership in

this segment. We will gradually keep increasing our market share that had declined in the last 2-3 years.

Since there are no prospects of demand for the smaller entry level car market recovering to the growth

rates of the past, we are restructuring our production facilities to conform to the realities and what we are

projecting for the future. Despite the slowdown in this category hatchbacks and small cars will remain

a very important part of our total portfolio. The rate of growth of these cars is expected to be less than

2% a year but the industry volume is almost a million cars a year with MSIL having a share of about 70%.

Accordingly, your Company intends to do whatever is necessary to meet customer needs in this segment

in the best possible manner.

Message from the Chairman

Your Board has recommended that the dividend for FY 2022-23 should be increased to `90 per

share-the highest ever. This is within the dividend payout policy. I look forward to your approval.

Your Company has been financing all investments from internal resources. This has enabled us to be a

strong and resilient Company. I believe our share price could never have crossed `10,000 if we had not

followed prudent financial practices. One of the very valuable lessons I learnt from Osamu San was that

the magic mantra for growth is to maximise earnings and to reinvest in growth. Your Company’s frugal

style of management and financial policies, practiced for 40 years, have created the ability to withstand

any kind of shocks from the market and make investments as necessary. As I am sure all of you are

aware, we are now planning to increase our manufacturing capacity by another 2 million cars a year by

FY 2030-31. The required investments will all come from internal resources.

While we do not expect the car industry to grow in double digits, like what happened in China in the past,

we do expect that a 6% growth rate will be maintained till FY 2030-31. In FY 2023-24, your Company

expects to grow at a slightly higher rate. Along with the rising domestic demand, the prospects for

exports are also expected to continue to improve. Our exports rose to 259,000 units last year. We expect

the demand for exports to continue to grow and export volumes are projected at 750,000-800,000 cars

by FY 2030-31. The domestic plus export requirements have made it necessary for your Company to

add another 2 million manufacturing capacity. Work is progressing at the first site in Kharkhoda, Haryana,

and it is expected that the first plant of 250,000 capacity will start production in the first half of 2025.

Thereafter, one similar plant will be added each year to reach a capacity of one million. At the same time,

we are in the process of selecting a second site for adding another one million capacity by FY 2030-31.

What is now being planned can be said to be the start of ‘Maruti 3.0’. Our first phase was when we

were a public enterprise. The second phase ended with the Covid pandemic, and the Indian car market

became the third largest in the world. The challenges before the Company are unprecedented. It took

us 40 years to create a capacity of 2 million units and SMC helped in this process by establishing the

Gujarat facility. Your Company now has to add the next 2 million in a period of 9 years. The task of

managing all the issues relating to the production of 4 million units a year requires considerable thought

and possible reorganisation of the structure of the company keeping in view the best interests of all

shareholders as well as other stakeholders of the company. We will, as soon as possible, announce what

we are proposing.

The challenge is not only to produce 4 million cars a year, and possibly higher volumes in the subsequent

years. We also have to sell this number of cars. By FY 2030-31, your Company could have about

28 different models. Clearly the organisation and systems for selling such a large variety of cars will

require changes from what exists at present.

One of the critical areas will be the development of human resources. Workers, supervisors, engineers

and managers will have to be recruited and trained to match the rapidly increasing production capacity.

It would be important to ensure that the Maruti culture, developed over the last 40 years, is maintained

and strengthened. Enhancing our engineering capabilities will be an important aspect of growth and we

are working with SMC to find the best answers.

The development of electric vehicles is proceeding well at the Gujarat facility. Your Company expects to

start the sale of the first model in 2024-25. By 2030-31 we expect to have 6 EV models. These models

are expected to comprise 15-20% of our total sales by that time. As I have said elsewhere, the conditions

in India require that the attainment of carbon neutrality in the transportation sector should be achieved

by a mix of technologies that are appropriate to our resource endowment and economic conditions.

We must use the enormous amount of animal waste that is generated in the country. Equally large is the

opportunity created by our agricultural and other waste as well as the potential to increase the output

from our land resources. The use of hybrid technology, ethanol, Compressed Bio-gas and CNG in cars

will all lead us faster to our goal of reducing the carbon footprint than relying only on any one technology.

Your Company continues to make its best efforts to reduce the carbon footprint in the production

processes, and also to conserve scarce resources. The Company’s solar power generation capacity

will increase to 48.15 MWp, from the existing 26.3 MWp, by FY 2024-25. All the wastewater is recycled,

and over 65% of the water required for manufacturing cars is met through recycling. The Company

ensures zero waste to landfill through recycling and co-processing of industrial waste. We also promote

best practices among our Tier-1 supplier partners, and 92% of our Tier-1 suppliers have implemented

ISO 14001-based Environment Management Systems.

Another focus area is Occupational Health and Safety management. A three-tier safety committee

under the direct supervision of the MD and CEO monitors progress towards the improvement of safety

systems. Your Company is promoting safe working practices among the Tier-1 suppliers as well. About

89% of Tier-1 suppliers have adopted ISO 45001-based Occupational Health and Safety Management

System. A robust programme of fire safety is also carried out with all Tier-1 suppliers.

The CSR programme continues as approved by the Board. Funds allocated as per law are fully utilised.

There had been a reduction in CSR funds due to drop in profits, but the situation has started to change.

The allocation of funds for FY 2023-24 is about `900 million as compared to about `630 million for

FY 2022-23.

The areas approved for CSR work are road safety, skill development and community development.

By remaining dedicated to these areas, we aim to create a lasting impact and contribute to the

betterment of society. The multispeciality hospital set up in Sitapur, Gujarat has provided quality and

affordable healthcare services needs to over 60,000 patients so far. To further improve the specialty

services in the cardiology area, a Cath lab facility has been set up. Under our road safety initiatives,

through Automated Driving Test Tracks (ADTTs), we facilitated 100% computerised driving license testing

in Delhi. So far, over 5 lakh individuals have taken driving license tests through the ADTTs. This ensures

that only skilled drivers receive a driving license.

The growth of MSIL has been facilitated by the importance paid to the development of a strong supply

chain. The component industry and MSIL have been growing by supporting each other. My grateful

thanks to them. We now have several world class manufacturers. The future prospects of growth of

component manufacturing are huge and large investments will be needed in the near future. I am sure

the number of vendors who reach global scales will increase rapidly. We are working with vendors and

encouraging them to follow our management practices to the maximum extent possible.

The dealer community have always been our interface with the customer and without them our growth

would not have been possible. We look for their continued cooperation and support.

You, our valued shareholders, along with all our customers, who are the reason for our existence, have

been a pillar of support to us and we are duly grateful for that.

I cannot end without expressing my deep appreciation of the role that all our employees who have played

in bringing us to our present position. They deserve all the credit for what your Company has been able

to achieve.

Lastly, I would like to express my thanks and gratitude to Osamu Suzuki San, T. Suzuki San and all others

from SMC, whose continued support is essential for the growth your Company.

Managing Director and CEO

Thank you for your support during my first year in the office. It gives me immense pleasure to convey my

thoughts through this integrated report.

The year was a special year in the history of the Company. The year gave us many reasons for

celebration. We commemorated 40th anniversary this year. The Company recorded its highest-ever

annual sales volume of very close to 2 million units and highest ever exports of about 0.26 million units,

making the Company the largest exporter of passenger vehicles in the country for 2 years in a row. The

Company’s revenue crossed `1 lakh crore mark, making it one of the few Companies in manufacturing

sector in India to achieve this feat. The profit after tax was also at a historic high. As a result, the Board

has recommended a dividend to `90 per share, the highest ever. None of these could have been

achieved without a dedicated and motivated workforce, committed business partners and supportive

government policy environment. I want to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed and went

above and beyond the call of duty to make this happen.

It is not an easy task to produce such results at a time when the business environment has become

far more dynamic and far less predictable than before. Efforts that went in the background along with

the decisions taken in the past have produced these results. Besides, setting a culture of sustainable

business practices by the Company also played a crucial role.

While the semiconductor supply situation improved over the previous year, poor visibility on availability

of semiconductors continued to affect the planning of production and sales. Frequent changes in the

product mix put a huge strain on the entire supply chain. The agility of the Company and its supply

chain has helped achieve record production volume. Besides, to maximise the production volume

under constrained supply situation, lots of efforts in optimization of semiconductor usage, sourcing from

alternate suppliers etc. were made.

The Company kept the market excited by introducing new products and technologies throughout the

year. It introduced three new models, four product refreshers, and extended CNG powertrain to six more

models. Besides, the Company introduced one of the world’s best strong hybrid-electric technologies

with Grand Vitara. The Company strengthened its product line-up, especially in SUV segment, with the

launch of Grand Vitara and Brezza. As a result, the Company’s market share in SUV segment increased

to 17% by the end of financial year, from single digit at the start of the year. Both the models received

an overwhelming response from the market and continue to remain on the wait list. The Company also

introduced 2 more new SUVs, Fronx and Jimny, which are also witnessing a runaway success.

There were some doubts in the market about the Company’s ability to effectively sell the high price range

products. By making Grand Vitara and Invicto successful, the Company proved its ability and established

its brand in that segment. With the success of these products, the Company is confident of achieving

Number 1 position in the SUV segment in FY 2023-24.

Indian automobile industry continued to witness increasing preference towards SUVs. Though the

hatchback segment grew at a slower pace than the SUV segment, it continues to command a

sizeable volume and remains relevant in the Indian market. With fast-changing market preferences, the

Company’s efforts are focused towards making systems, processes and facilities more flexible.

The Company continued to expand the network to enhance customer convenience. In FY 2022-23,

263 sales outlets primarily in non-urban markets, and 310 service touchpoints at a rate of almost

1 service touchpoint per day were added. Digitalisation initiatives also helped enhance customer

convenience. Virtual reality initiative (Metaverse) helped us deliver showroom experience to customers

at the comfort of their homes, especially in non-urban markets that are still to be covered by the sales

outlets. Online car financing initiatives saw an overwhelming response with over 30% of customers

financing their cars through this mode.

Managing Director and CEO

The Company continued its efforts towards Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) areas.

The Company announced its plan to enhance the use of power from renewable sources of energy for

manufacturing cars. Solar power generation capacity will expand to 48.15 MWp by FY 2024-25 from the

current capacity of 26.3 MWp.

The Company dispatched a record 335,000 cars through railmode, which is an environment friendly

mode of transport. With this, the share of rail mode stood at 18% in FY 2022-23. To further increase

the share of rail mode, the Company is building railway sidings at the production facilities in Manesar

and Gujarat.

For an automobile company, the carbon emissions from products contribute to nearly 80% of the

total carbon emissions. Therefore, reducing carbon footprints of the products makes a significant

difference. The Company continues to have the lowest CO2 emitting fleet in the country. For the

benefit of customers, environment and the country, the Company has embraced multiple powertrain

technologies rather than depending on a single technology to reduce carbon footprint. Having multiple

powertrain technologies removes excessive reliance on a single technology and de-risks decarbonisation

achievements. Accordingly, the Company is adopting CNG, Flex fuel (Ethanol blending anywhere from

20% to 85% with petrol), hybrid-electric and Electric vehicles.

The share of models with CNG powertrain in our sales has been increasing and has exceeded an all-time

high of 20% in the year.

During the year, our parent company, Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC) Japan announced a growth

strategy towards FY 2030-31 for the entire group. SMC has committed a huge investment, especially for

decarbonisation efforts. This includes launching of 6 EV models by 2030-31 in India. The Company will

be launching its first EV in FY 2024-25. A prototype of this EV was showcased in Delhi Motor show held

in January 2023. This is a mid-segment SUV with a range of 550 Kms and battery capacity of 60 KWH.

The EV will be manufactured in Suzuki Motor Gujarat, for which the production facility is being set-up. For

EV battery manufacturing, SMC is setting-up a facility in Gujarat.

Ensuring a safe working environment and supporting occupational health for our employees have always

been my top-most priorities. Besides continuously strengthening our safety systems, we encourage the

front-line leaders to provide as many suggestions as possible for continuously improving their respective

workplace safety. A dedicated team then implements all the actionable points in a time bound manner.

The Company also promotes safe working practices among the component suppliers as well. About

89% of Tier-1 suppliers have adopted ISO 45001-based Occupational Health and Safety Management

system. In addition, the Company engages with its Tier-1 suppliers to ensure their preparedness on fire

safety. The sustenance of the practices related to fire safety is also checked on a periodic basis.

With the CSR programme, the Company continues to make positive impact on the lives of the people in

the areas of road safety, skill development and community development.

We are continuing our community development works in our project villages in Haryana and Gujarat.

The multispecialty hospital in Sitapur, Gujarat has served over 60,000 patients so far with quality and

affordable healthcare services. The hospital offers tertiary healthcare service as well. I am happy to

share that recently, the Company has set-up a Cath lab facility in the hospital. The school in Sitapur is

helping children in and around the neighbourhood to have access to quality education, benefitting over

470 children.

Through road safety initiatives, the Company has trained over 4.4 million people so far. Total

12 Automated Driving Test Tracks (ADTTs) set-up by the Company have facilitated 100 percent

computerised driving license testing in Delhi. So far, over 5 lakh individuals have taken driving license

test through the ADTTs.

In the area of skill development, the Company is working towards creating livelihood opportunities to

youth in India by imparting relevant skill training through the Japan India Institute for Manufacturing

(JIMs) set up by the Company as well as by adopting several Industrial Training Institutes across India.

The year also brought cheer to all of us as India became the 3rd largest automobile market in the world.

This gave a further boost to our confidence in India’s huge potential for automobile. The Company is

optimistic not only about India’s domestic automobile market, but also about its export potential. The

Company is planning to triple its export to ~750,000 units by 2030. To cater both domestic and overseas

markets, the Company will need huge capacity. With certain estimation of Indian market growth and

expected export volume, it can be projected that by 2030, we might need a production capacity of

over 4 million, which is close to double of our current capacity. That is quite a challenging task. We

need to construct 2 manufacturing facilities parallelly, each having an annual production capacity of

1 million units. Construction work on the first site (Kharkhoda, Haryana) has been started and a first

plant with annual production capacity of 250,000 units is expected to be operational in the year 2025 at

this location. Three more such plants will be constructed in a phased manner to take the overall annual

capacity to 1 million units at this location. For the second facility of 1 million annual capacity, a suitable

site is being identified. Such a large-scale capacity expansion, simultaneously at 2 locations, has never

been done so far. I am counting on my people, business partners and our parent company SMC, which

in the past accomplished many tasks that appeared impossible at the beginning. We might have to keep

thinking of the best possible ways to manage this scale of operations and make sure that we continue to

stay ahead.

With expanding capacity, offering multiple carbon reduction technologies, bringing many new products,

we are writing a new chapter in the history of the company; “Maruti Suzuki 3.0”. My mission is to provide

the Joy of mobility to as many people as possible while keeping the environment and society in harmony.

We welcome you to be a part of this journey.

Brief outline on CSR policy of the company

The company’s CSR policy aims to create social value for

the local community and society at large. As a policy, the

company’s CSR activities focus on strategic areas including

community development, skill development and road safety.

The company’s CSR activities are guided by the CSR

Committee, and all the projects are monitored and reviewed

by the Committee for their impact on the beneficiaries. A

third-party impact assessment study is also carried out for

the flagship projects.

The Company undertakes community development projects

in villages surrounding the company’s facilities in Haryana

and Gujarat focusing on improving health, education, water

and sanitation, and community infrastructure. Among many

other community development initiatives, the important

projects which have been creating a significant positive

impact on nearby community are multi-specialty hospital

and an english medium school in Gujarat.

The hospital has been established in collaboration with

Ramanbhai Foundation, a philanthropic arm of Zydus

Hospitals, Ahmedabad. As a symbol of quality healthcare

provider, hospital is also accredited with National

Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers

(NABH) certification and recently conferred with ‘Gold

quality certification’ by Quality Council of India (QCI). The

hospital is a landmark project in the region, providing

quality healthcare services to the people of Sitapur and

surrounding areas. The hospital is currently operational with

76 beds and provides advanced clinical facilities such as

General medicine, General surgery, Orthopaedics & trauma,

Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Pediatric, Pulmonology, Urology,

Nephrology, Ophthalmology & ENT, Dermatology, Dental,

Radiology, Pathology, Physiotherapy and Dialysis. Recently,

to further improve the specialty services in cardiology area,

cathlab facility has been set up.

To serve low-income group population, the hospital

is empaneled with Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri

Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PMJAY). Through this project,

the Company has made a significant contribution to the

development of the local community. Apart from providing

quality healthcare, the hospital has also created employment

opportunities for the local population.

The company has established the Maruti Suzuki Podar

Learn School in Sitapur, Gujarat, with the aim of providing

quality education to the children. The school has modern

infrastructure and technology, as well as a team of

experienced and dedicated teachers who give each student

personalized attention. The curriculum is designed to not

only meet academic standards, but also to develop critical

thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills in the

students. The project has had a significant impact on the

community by improving access to education.

The company aligns with the government of India’s ‘Skill

India’ mission for skill development in the country. The skill

development initiatives aim to impart industry relevant skill

training to a large number of youth to help them secure

employment opportunities. Japan-India Institute for

Manufacturing (JIM) set-up by the Company, is a flagship

skill development institute which not only offers vocational

training courses but also inculcates efficient shop-floor

management practices by imparting training on Japanese

manufacturing principles. These courses are based on

Dual System of Training (DST) scheme which offer on-the-

job training (OJT) to students in addition to the classroom

training, making them industry ready. The company provides

on-the-job training to JIM students at its facilities. So far,

the company has set up three JIMs, one in Haryana and

two in Gujarat.

In addition to creating an industry ready workforce

through JIMs, the company also undertakes the

upgradation of the existing government ITIs in the

country by setting up skill labs and Automotive Skill

Enhancement Centers (ASECs) in them. Through these

interventions company imparts specialised trainings to

the ITI trainers and students.

Under Road Safety Initiatives, the company undertakes

various initiatives to support the government in making

the roads safer. To provide quality driving training and

education, the company has set up Institutes of Driving &

Traffic Research (IDTR) and Road Safety Knowledge Centres

(RSKC) in association with state governments in India. The

IDTRs use scientifically designed tracks, driving simulators,

and a well-defined curriculum to conduct learner, refresher,

and evaluation courses for drivers of light motor vehicles,

heavy motor vehicles, two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and

forklifts. The Road Safety Knowledge Centre (RSKC) was

setup to impart road safety training, particularly to learner

license aspirants and traffic violators.

The company also implemented cutting-edge technological

solutions such as (a) The Traffic Safety Management System

(TSMS) to support in enforcing traffic rules and promote

safe driving behaviour and (b) Automated Driving Test

Centers (ADTC) to bring transparency and efficiency in

driving license issuing system.

of internal financial controls including controls over financial

reporting during the financial year 2022-23.

the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the years

presented. Actual results may differ from the estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each

balance sheet date. Revisions to accounting estimates are

recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised

and future periods affected.

In particular, information about significant areas of

estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying

accounting policies that have the most significant effect

on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are

included in the following notes:

Note 32 : Provision for Employee Benefits

Provision for employee benefits requires that certain

assumptions such as expected future salary increases,

average life expectancy and discount rates etc. are made in

order to determine the amount to be recorded for retirement

benefit obligations. Substantial changes in the assumed

development of any of these variables may significantly

change the Company’s retirement benefit obligations.

Note 17 & 37 : Provision for Litigations

Income Tax: The Company’s tax jurisdiction is in India.

Significant judgements are involved in determining

the provision for income taxes including judgement on

whether tax positions are probable of being sustained

in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve

complex issues, which can only be resolved over

extended time periods.

Other litigations: Litigations often involve complex legal/

regulatory issues and are connected with a high degree

of uncertainty. Accordingly, the assessment of whether an

obligation exists on the balance sheet date as a result of

an event in the past, and whether a future cash outflow is

likely and the obligation can be reliably estimated, largely

depends on estimations by the management.

Portfolio diversification

The financial risk management of the Company is carried out under the policies approved by the Board of Directors. Within these

policies, the Board provides written principles for overall risk management including policies covering specific areas, such as foreign

exchange risk management, commodity risk management and investment of funds.

(A) Credit risk

Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter party may not be able to settle their obligations. To manage trade receivable,

the Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial conditions, economic

trends, analysis of historical bad debts and aging of such receivables.

Financial instruments that are subject to such risk, principally consist of investments, trade receivables, loans and advances and

derivative instruments. None of the financial instruments of the Company results in material concentration of credit risks.

Other than financial assets mentioned above, none of the financial assets were impaired and there were no indications that defaults

in payment obligations would occur.

(B) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company can not meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management

is to maintain sufficient liquidity and to ensure funds are available for use as per the requirements.

The Company operates with a low Debt Equity ratio. The Company raises short term rupee borrowings for cash flow mismatches

and hence carries no significant liquidity risk. The Company has access to the borrowing facilities of ` 49,700 million as at

31.03.2023 (` 49,700 million as at 31.03.2022) to honour any liquidity requirements arising for business needs. The Company has

large investments in debt mutual funds which can be redeemed on a very short notice and hence carries negligible liquidity risk.

(i)

Financing arrangements

The Company had access to the following borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:

(ii) Maturities of financial liabilities

The tables below analyse the Company’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities:

The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their

carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
