Managing Director and her sons Mr. Rahul

Mammen Mappillai,: Managing

Managing Director – Re-appointed

for a further period of 5 years w.e.f 04.05.2022.

2. Mr Samir Thariyan Mappillai, Whole Time Director – Re-appointed

for a further period of 5 years w.e.f 04.08.2022.

3. Mr Varun Mammen, Whole Time Director – Re-appointed for a

further period of 5 years w.e.f 04.08.2022.

Though the special resolution passed on 8th October 2021 for payment

of aggregate remuneration exceeding 5% under Regulation 17(6)(e)(ii)

applies to financial year 2022-23 also, in view of the re-appointment

of Mr. Rahul Mammen Mappillai, Mr. Samir Thariyan Mappillai and

Mr. Varun Mammen in May 2022 and August 2022, fresh approval is

required to be taken for the financial year 2022-23.

As mentioned earlier, the unprecedented situation in the business scenario

during the financial years 2021-22 and 2022-23 following the COVID

pandemic resulted in steep increase in raw material prices thereby

adversely impacting profitability. The situation was further aggravated by

the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 which led to supply chain issues.

The overall market scenario limited the Company’s ability to pass on cost

increases fully. This scenario continued during a major part of 2022-23 and

profitability continued to be under stress except the last quarter when the

benefit of lower raw material prices could be realised. Consequently, the

total remuneration of the Promoter Executive Directors, as per the approval

granted by shareholders for the financial year 2022-23, has exceeded the

5% limit set by Regulation 17(6)(e)(ii) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and

Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and therefore approval of the

shareholders by way of a special resolution is sought for the same. The total

remuneration of `89.80 Crores payable to the Promoter Executive Directors

works out to 7.77% of the net profits for the year.

The Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration

Committee, taking into consideration the valuable contribution made

by the Promoter Executive Directors to steer the Company in these

challenging times, have approved the proposal to pay remuneration to

them as per the terms and conditions in force, for the financial year ended

31st March, 2023, notwithstanding the aggregate remuneration exceeding

the limit of 5% of net profits prescribed in Regulation 17(6)(e)(ii). The

Committee noted that despite the challenges faced by the Company

during these two years (2021-22 & 2022-23), the turnover of the Company

has increased from `18989 crores to `22578 crores.

The Committee also noted that the aggregate remuneration paid to all Promoter

Executive Directors till the financial year 2020-21 has remained well below

5% of the net profits of the Company. It is only subsequent to the COVID

pandemic and the war in Ukraine, i.e. financial years 2021-22 and 2022-23,

the aggregate remuneration has exceeded the 5% threshold prescribed under

SEBI Regulations because of the difficult business scenario as explained earlier.

Further the aggregate remuneration for 2022-23 works out to only 7.77% of

the net profits as against 9.05% during the previous year (i.e. 2021-22). The

Committee further noted that the overall growth in aggregate remuneration of

the Promoter Executive Directors, over a five year period on a compounded

annualized basis is only 3.40% (i.e. `75.97 Crores in 2018-19 to ` 89.80

Crores in 2022-23), which is lower than the prevailing inflation rates. Given the

extraordinary circumstances under which the Company’s business operations

were carried on and the above mentioned factors, the Committee felt that it

would be appropriate to recommend the proposal for approval of shareholders.

It may be noted that that there is no change in the remuneration package

approved by the shareholders at the time of their appointment and the

remuneration is in accordance with the remuneration policy of the Company.

It may be further noted that the aggregate remuneration to all Promoter

Executive Directors, to the extent it exceeds 5% of the net profits of the

Company calculated as per Section 198 of the Companies Act, 2013,

will be paid after receipt of the approval of the shareholders as per

Regulation 17(6)(e)(ii).

The remuneration package comprises of both a fixed pay and a variable

component (which is linked to the performance of the company i.e.

net profits). The detailed terms of remuneration of Promoter Executive

Directors as applicable during financial year 2022-23 are follows:-

A)

Monthly salary as applicable for financial year 2022-23

(a)

Mr. K M Mammen - `34,31,250/-; b) Mr. Arun Mammen -

`32,00,750/; c) Mr. Rahul Mammen Mappillali - `28,21,400/;

d) Samir Thariayan Mappillali - `7,00,000/-; and Mr. Varun

Mammen `7,00,000/-.:

Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

In the closing stages of last financial year we were still in the midst of a raw material crisis. The prices of raw

materials were continually increasing necessitating increasing our prices too. Fortunately, over a period of time the

raw material prices have stabilised and this has helped business in the current year.

In the current year we have recorded an all-time high consolidated total income of Rs.23,261 crores which is an

increase of Rs.3,627 crores over the previous year. This huge increase in consolidated total income reveals

the strength of MRF and its products. One of the resounding success of last year was the launching of our Scooter

tyre Zapper C1. It has received excellent response from the customers and it has helped in increasing our

2 wheeler tyre sales.

Last year’s problem of the semi-conductors shortage has more or less disappeared and the production level of

automobile industries have reflected this. Electric vehicles are now coming out in each of the categories and it will

take some time before we can see how this trend plays out.

The Tractor tyre sales, which was rather muted last year, has shown encouraging results in the current year. With

MRF leading in product preference in Farm tyres, this has also helped increase our sale.

Brand Finance, the world’s leading brand valuation consultancy has released the Automotive Industry 2023 study

and ranked MRF Tyres as the 2nd Strongest Tyre Brand in the World.

As we continue to be the market leader, it is essential for us to play an active role in decarbonizing our operations

thereby helping India meet the target of Net Zero emission by 2070. To support this goal, we have set phase-wise

targets and commitments to improve our sustainability performance in the coming years.

I wish to thank the Shareholders, Investors, Central and State Governments, Lenders, Suppliers and Customers for

their great support during these trying times. I also thank all my colleagues on the board for their continued

support.

Best Wishes,

has receded a bit we are yet to see the robust levels of early 2022.

Business from Indonesia was impacted due to the sudden suspension of quotas

being released by the Ministry of Trade & Industry since September 2022.

The Philippines in the far east & the middle eastern region showed substantial

growth and continue to maintain the momentum for brand MRF. Categories of

Truck Radial, Light truck & passenger car tyres showed good growth in these

markets and consumer preferences continue to be high.

Going forward we see immense opportunities in our existing strong markets

The revenue from operations of the Company for the 2022-2023 stood at `22578

Crores against `18989 Crores for the previous year ended 31st March, 2022. During

the year ended 31st March, 2023, the earnings before interest and depreciation

(EBIDTA) stood at `2666 Crores as against `2328 Crores in the previous year ended

31st March, 2022. After providing for depreciation and interest, the profit before

tax for the year ended 31st March, 2023 is `1119 Crores as compared to `879

Crores in the previous year ended 31st March 2022. After making provision for

income tax, the net profit for the year ended 31st March, 2023 is `816 Crores

as against `647 Crores in the previous year ended 31st March, 2022.

There is no significant change (i.e. 25% or more) in key financial ratios viz.

debtors turnover, inventory turnover, current ratio, debt equity ratio and

Interest coverage ratio, net profit margin (%), operating profit margin and return

on net worth.

The return on net worth increased from 4.80% in 2021-2022 to 5.77% in

2022-2023. This is due to the increase in current year’s profit.

Opportunities and Threats

Macro indicators point to continued growth of the Indian economy.

Infrastructure spending and continued emphasis to manufacture in India will

provide impetus for growth. Private sector Capex is also picking up steam.

Inflation continues to be near the upper end of the RBIs tolerance band and is

forecast for a gradual reduction. High Bank interest rates are likely to sustain.

Monsoon forecast is a little to the lower side of normal and El Nino has been

predicted. Any shortfall in the monsoon can impact rural demand. Extreme

weather events can impact agriculture and other activities.

Outlook

Pent up demand in passenger vehicles will cool in financial year 2024 but

secular economic growth should provide steady growth to the auto industry.

Higher capital expenditure by the auto industry points to high levels of capacity

utilization and is a pointer to higher levels of production in the future.

With new BS VI phase-2 transition effective 1st April, 2023, vehicle costs will go

up. However, the reduction in input costs will be a positive for the auto industry.

Impact on the tyre industry would also be similar as outlined above.

Internal Control Systems and their Adequacy

Your Company has established internal control systems commensurate with

the size and nature of business. It has put in place systems and controls across

the Company covering various financial and operational functions. Company

Committee. Some of the salient features of the Internal control systems are:-

(i)

office, etc.

(ii)

growing size and complexity of company’s operations.

(iii)

Assets are recorded and system put in place to safeguard against any

losses or unauthorized disposal.

(iv)

Periodic physical verification of fixed assets and Inventories.

(v)

Key observations arising out of the Internal Audit are reviewed at the

Audit Committee meeting and follow up action taken.:
