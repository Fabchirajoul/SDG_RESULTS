Notice (Contd.):

Dear Shareholders

Recent years have witnessed an increasing demand for

vehicles that are not only comfortable and safe but also

equipped with contemporary aesthetics and sustainable

technologies. In addition, the consumers’ growing

preference for vehicles that offer value for money has come

sharply to the fore. In line with this consumer trend, OEMs

have also enhanced their focus on improving the quality,

design and cost-effectiveness of their products, along with

on-time delivery. There is, among OEMs, a growing thrust on

developing vehicles that have unique features, giving them

a distinctive edge in the market. At the same time, the rise

in demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs) to support the growing

need for sustainable vehicles has triggered an increase in

the number of OEM players in the market. This has led to

new opportunities for the ancillary companies. These factors

have cumulatively led to a significant change in the priorities

of both, the OEMs and the companies engaged in the

manufacturing of auto components.

Acknowledging this reality, we further sharpened our

focus, during FY 2022-23, on supporting the OEMs with

technology, products and solutions that match the demands

of the new-age consumers. Our agility in meeting the OEM’s

product and development needs, strengthened our position

of being a most trusted partner to OEMs. We invested

more actively in the emerging and critical areas driving

business growth, such as EVs, value engineering including

light-weighting, and technology upgradation.

To keep pace with the industry changes and market trends,

we further scaled up the enhancement of products and

processes, and focussed on higher value creation and

profitability, as well as organic and inorganic growth.

We believe these are the areas requiring the maximum

organisational efforts.

Being agile to the external environment

The Indian automobile industry is currently the fifth largest

in the world and is expected to become the third largest

by 2030. According to the Society of Indian Automobile

Manufacturers (SIAM), the industry grew an impressive

11.8% in FY 2022-23, with passenger vehicle volumes

rising to 4.5 million units from 3.6 million units a year ago

and 2W volumes rising to 19.51 million units from 18.01

million units. The industry combatted the challenges of

semi-conductor chip shortage and soaring metal costs that

continued to prevail during the year.

THE FOCUS IS ON MORE

EFFICIENT AND AFFORDABLE

EV PRODUCTS. OUR FOCUS

ON ORDERS FOR EV

COMPONENTS AND OUR

INVESTMENTS IN THE EV

SEGMENT ARE IN LINE

WITH THIS TREND.

THE INDIAN AUTOMOBILE

INDUSTRY IS CURRENTLY

THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE

WORLD AND IS EXPECTED

TO BECOME THE THIRD

LARGEST BY 2030.

India’s economic resilience, favourable government policies,

increasing EV penetration and technological advancements

are among the key drivers of the continued positivity in the

automobile sector. The Indian government has reinforced

its commitment to the industry’s growth by increasing the

budget allocation of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing

of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) II by 78% in the

Union Budget 2023. Several industry players believe that

the long-term success of Indian EV industry will be based

on innovation and efficiency rather than on government

subsidy. In any case, new EV vehicle launches have led

to the emergence of opportunities for the growth of the

industry in India.

At Endurance, our deep-rooted strengths and agility

have equipped us with the ability to quickly harness the

emerging opportunities to steer our growth and expansion.

Our strong innovation capabilities, robust financials, and

presence across multiple products have also led to our

growth as a trusted and reliable partner for an increasing

number of domestic and global OEMs, while strengthening

our dominance in the aftermarket. Our sustainable

product proposition and strategic investments in the areas

of future growth have enabled us to stay consistently

ahead of the market.

Innovating to improve efficiencies across the

value chain

We have, over the years, developed a strong innovation

agility that has enabled us to deliver highly advanced and

affordable products and solutions to our expanding customer

base. It has helped us create a more value-added and

profitable product mix. It has also enabled us to expand

our presence in the value chain through our backward

integration initiatives. We have strategically focussed on

products showing higher demand potential, and have

made investments in technologies that will drive greater

growth going forward. Our focus is on pioneering products,

solutions and processes that are designed for enhanced

efficiencies and can effectively meet the future needs

of our consumers.

In line with this focus, and as a matter of norm, we take

extra precautions – more than what is mandated by the

law in India, in the development of products from the

design stage itself. In fact, many of our existing products,

by default, comply with the new norms announced by the

Indian government, which include AIS-156. While some

minor adjustments will be required in the light of AIS-156,

our technology edge will allow us to comply with ease to the

new norms, without requiring a full redesign. Since we were

selling in international markets, including Europe and the

US, we were already designing as per the global standards.

We believe these initiatives will prepare us even more

intensely to capture the future opportunities of growth across

our business operations. As a part of our future-ready

strategy, we decided to set-up in-house facilities for hoses

and valves manufacturing for our ABS product segment,

and for manufacturing aluminium forged axle clamps and

PA housings for our inverted front forks and rear monoshock

absorbers respectively. Going forward, we shall continue

to augment our innovation thrust to meet the evolving needs

of the customers in both, the domestic and the international

markets. Enhancing business sustenance, and proactive

upgrade in product reliability to delight our customers as

the first choice with environmental responsibility, motivates

us to continue with our focussed approach on war

against weight, SME structure development, inculcation of

innovation DNA, go-green thought-map and best-fit new

generation technologies.

Investing aggressively in EVs

The importance being accorded to sustainability by the

government, the automobile industry and vehicle users

has given a strong impetus to the growth of the Electric

Vehicles segment globally. The focus is on more efficient

and affordable EV products. Our focus on orders for EV

components and our investments in the EV segment are in

The Members,

Endurance Technologies Ltd.

E-92, MIDC Industrial Area, Waluj

Aurangabad 431 136

I have conducted the Secretarial Audit of the compliance

of applicable statutory provisions and the adherence to

good corporate practices by Endurance Technologies Ltd.

(hereinafter called “the Company”). Secretarial Audit was

conducted in a manner that provided me a reasonable basis

for evaluating the corporate conduct / statutory compliances

and expressing my opinion thereon.

Auditor’s Responsibility:

My responsibility is to express an opinion on the compliance

of the applicable laws and maintenance of records based

on audit. I have conducted the audit in accordance with

the applicable Auditing Standards issued by The Institute

of Company Secretaries of India. The Auditing Standards

requires that the Auditor shall comply with statutory and

regulatory requirements and plan and perform the audit

to obtain reasonable assurance about compliance with

applicable laws and maintenance of records.

Due to the inherent limitations of audit including internal,

financial and operating controls, there is an unavoidable risk

that some material misstatements or material non-compliances

may not be detected, even though the audit is properly

planned and performed in accordance with the Standards.

Unmodified opinion:

Based on my verification of the Company’s books, papers,

minute books, forms and returns filed and other records

maintained by the Company and also the information

provided by the Company, its officers, agents and authorised

representatives during the conduct of secretarial audit, I

hereby report that in my opinion, the Company has, during the

audit period covering the financial year ended on 31 March,

2023, complied with the statutory provisions listed hereunder

and also that the Company has proper Board-processes and

compliance-mechanism in place to the extent, in the manner

and subject to the reporting made hereinafter.

area,

Waluj,

Aurangabad, Maharashtra - 431136, India.

The financial statements for the year ended 31st March,

2023 were approved for issue in accordance with the

resolution of the Board of Directors on 17th May, 2023.

Significant Accounting Policies

2.01 Statement of Compliance

The financial statements of the Company have been

prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting

Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) notified under the

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015

(as amended from time to time) and the presentation

requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the

Companies Act, 2013 (Ind AS Compliant Schedule

III), as applicable.

2.02 Basis of preparation and presentation

These financial statements have been prepared on

a historical cost basis, except for certain financial

instruments which have been measured at fair value

at the end of each reporting period, as explained

under accounting policy 2.16. The financial statements

are presented in INR and all values are rounded off

to the nearest million (INR 000,000), except as

stated otherwise.

The Company has prepared the financial statements

on the basis that it will continue to operate as

a going concern.

2.03 Use of estimates and assumptions

The preparation of these financial statements requires

management to make judgements, estimates and

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues,

expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying

disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates

could result in outcomes that require a material

adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities

affected in future periods.

a.

Estimates

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on

an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates

are recognized in the period in which the estimates are

revised and future periods are affected.

Key sources of estimation of uncertainty at the date of

the financial statements, which have a significant risk of

causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts

of assets and liabilities within the next financial year

are in respect of useful lives of property, plant and

equipment, defined benefit plan and impairment of non

current investments.

(i)

Useful lives of Property, plant and equipment

The Company reviews the useful life of property,

plant and equipment at the end of each reporting

period. This reassessment may result in change in

depreciation expense in future periods.

(ii) Defined benefit plan

The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and

other post-employment benefits and the present

value of the gratuity obligation are determined

using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation

involves making various assumptions that may

differ from actual developments in the future.

These include the determination of the discount

rate; future salary increases and mortality rates.

Due to the complexities involved in the valuation

and its long-term nature, a defined benefit

obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these

assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at

each reporting date.

The parameter most subject to change is the

discount rate. In determining the appropriate

discount rate for plans operated in India, the

management considers the interest rates of

government bonds where remaining maturity of

such bond correspond to expected term of defined

benefit obligation.

The mortality rate is based on publicly available

mortality tables for India. Those mortality tables

tend to change only at interval in response to

demographic changes. Future salary increases

and gratuity increases are based on expected:

or “the Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries

(collectively referred to as “the Group”) is in the

business of manufacturing and selling of aluminium

systems with operations spread across India, Italy,

Germany and Tunisia.

The Company is a public limited company incorporated

and domiciled in India. The address of its registered

office is E-92, M.I.D.C. Industrial Area, Waluj,

Aurangabad – 431136 (Maharashtra), India.”

The financial statements for the year ended 31st March,

2023 were approved for issue in accordance with the

resolution of the Board of Directors on 17th May, 2023.

Significant Accounting Policies

2.01 Statement of Compliance

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have

been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting

Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) notified under the

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015

(as amended from time to time) and the presentation

requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the

Companies Act, 2013 (Ind AS Compliant Schedule III),

as applicable to the consolidated financial statements.

2.02 Basis of preparation and presentation

These consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain

financial instruments which are measured at fair values

at the end of each reporting period, as explained in

the accounting policy 2.26. The consolidated financial

statements are presented in INR and all values are

rounded off to the nearest million (INR 000,000),

except as stated otherwise.

The Group has prepared the consolidated financial

statements on the basis that it will continue to operate

as a going concern.

2.03 Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the

financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries

as at 31 March 2023. Control is achieved when the

Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from

its involvement with the investee and has the ability to

affect those returns through its power over the investee.

Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only

if the Group has:

•

Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give

it the current ability to direct the relevant activities

of the investee)

•

Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its

involvement with the investee, and

•

The ability to use its power over the investee to

affect its returns

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting

rights result in control. To support this presumption and

when the Group has less than a majority of the voting

or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all

relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it

has power over an investee, including:

•

The contractual arrangement with the other vote

holders of the investee

•

Rights arising from other contractual arrangements

•

The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

•

The size of the group’s holding of voting rights

relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings

of the other voting rights holders

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an

investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there

are changes to one or more of the three elements of

control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when

the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and

ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.

Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary

acquired or disposed of during the year are included in

the consolidated financial statements from the date the

Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to

control the subsidiary.

Consolidated financial statements are prepared using

uniform accounting policies for like transactions and

other events in similar circumstances. If a member of

the Group uses accounting policies other than those

adopted in the consolidated financial statements for

like transactions and events in similar circumstances,

appropriate adjustments are made to that Group

member’s financial statements in preparing the

consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity

with the Group’s accounting policies.

The financial statements of all entities used for the

purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same

reporting date as that of the parent company, i.e., year

ended on 31 March. When the end of the reporting

period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiary,

the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes,:
