LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABILITY

Our Company’s senior management, under the: Managing

Letter: Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to present the Integrated Annual

Report of Tata Consumer Products for FY 22-23.

I am pleased to report that your Company has made

steady progress during the year and is on track in its

transformation journey to becoming a leading FMCG

player. Despite the continued challenges in the post-

pandemic world emanating from a highly volatile

macro environment and geopolitical unrest, the

Company has delivered a well-rounded performance

across key metrics with double digit revenue growth

and a strong EPS growth of 28% in FY 22-23.

Importantly, your Company has taken significant

steps towards becoming growth oriented and

building strong organisational capabilities. During

the year, substantial progress has been made in

strengthening the core businesses and expanding the

total addressable market.

In September 2020 your Company had committed to

doubling its numeric reach to 4 million outlets in three

years and it is on track to achieve that. The Company

has continued to invest in the future growth engines

of its portfolio, and this has started delivering results,

with the growth businesses recording 53% growth

and increasing their salience significantly. In parallel,

your Company is driving digital transformation

across its business to streamline operations and

increase efficiency and effectiveness. It has invested

in building a ‘fit for future’ R&D capability and

accelerated the pace of innovation, launching 2X

the number of new products versus last year and

entering several new categories.

There has been continued focus on streamlining

and simplifying the business. My letter last year to

you had outlined the plan to merge Tata Coffee’s

business into Tata Consumer Products to drive

revenue synergies and operational efficiencies, in

addition to simplifying legal structures and driving

cash efficiencies.

As part of this initiative, Tata Consumer has

announced its commitment to sustainability

targets which include achieving net zero

status, water neutrality, promoting a circular

economy of plastics, advancing diversity in

workforce, producing sustainable products, and

implementing sustainable sourcing practices.

Your Company believes that these commitments

will help achieve its long-term goals and create

a more sustainable future for all.

As we move forward, Tata Consumer Products

will remain steadfast in executing against its

strategy with a sharp focus on growth. Your

Company is committed to strengthening its

core businesses, accelerating innovation, and

unlocking efficiencies while exploring new

opportunities both organic and inorganic, and

building for the future.

I am grateful for your unwavering support and

the dedication of our employees, both of which

have been instrumental in the steady progress

the Company has made thus far. We value your

partnership and look forward to reaching new

heights together on this journey.
