Dear Shareholders,

We are delighted to release our second

Integrated Report, which showcases what

we have accomplished in FY23. It has

been a year of recovery and success.

While we continue to rebuild the business

after the pandemic, we have reached an

important milestone in FY23, with our

revenue surpassing pre-COVID levels.

This achievement is a testament to the

hard work and resilience of our team.

CHASING THE HOSPITALITY HORIZON

The Indian travel and tourism sector is experiencing a notable

resurgence, particularly in domestic tourism, as travellers

prioritise leisure and relaxation. Encouragingly, the Ministry of

Tourism reported a steady post-COVID growth rate of 40% in

FY23, signalling a robust recovery in the industry. According

to research conducted by the World Travel & Tourism Council

(WTTC), the travel and tourism sector's contribution to the

Indian economy is projected to surpass pre-pandemic levels

by 2024, with a remarkable YoY growth of 20.7%.

Throughout FY23, the hotel industry has witnessed rapid

recovery, with Average Room Rates (ARRs) and Occupancy

Rates (ORs) exceeding pre-COVID levels. This resurgence

can be attributed to the emergence of new travel trends,

the hosting of significant global events and favourable

demand-supply dynamics. India's G20 presidency has

also played a pivotal role in boosting international arrivals,

positively impacting the hospitality industry across some

locations. Additionally, we have observed a growing trend

of multi-generational and group travel, with guests seeking

exclusive experiences that offer privacy and comfort.

As the hospitality industry began to recover from early FY23,

we also successfully resumed our growth journey and saw an

upward trajectory through the year. We are now strategically

positioned to take advantage of emerging trends, as our

singular focus on catering to the growing needs of India's

middle-class consumer (in the traditionally underserved,

mid-scale market) has set us apart as the leader in this

segment. As we navigate the evolving market dynamics,

we are confident of our ability to continue providing

exceptional service and value to our customers.

A YEAR OF RECORD-BREAKING SUCCESS

In FY23, Lemon Tree Hotels (LTH) experienced exceptional

growth, as our total revenue more than doubled compared to

FY22, reaching B879 Crores. We also maintained an EBITDA

margin* of 51.9% for the full year, reflecting the positive

momentum we garnered and our strong performance across

all metrics.

By focusing on building occupancy in FY23, we achieved a

significant increase of 2,197 basis points (bps) compared

to FY22, and an exceptional 2,827 bps compared to FY21.

Additionally, our ARR increased by 54% compared to FY22,

reaching B5,340. This improvement translated into a revenue

per available room (RevPAR) of B3,636, reflecting a 128%

growth compared to FY22.

The EBITDA margin* stood at 51.9% in FY23, which

increased by 1,635 bps over FY22 and 1,574 bps from FY20.

Our Profit After Tax (PAT) for FY23 was at B140.5 Crores,

which stands in contrast to a negative PAT of B137.4 Crores

and B13 Crores recorded in FY22 and FY20, respectively. Our

cash profit also demonstrated significant growth, reaching

B237.1 Crores, which stands in contrast to a negative cash

profit of B33.0 Crores in FY22 and a positive B74.1 Crores in

FY20. In FY23, the total management fees received by LTH

was B104 Crores, which was 54% higher than in FY20.

With our prudent financial management, our gross debt, as

of 31st March 2023, stood at B1,746 Crores, while the average

cost of borrowings was 9.08%. However, the weighted

average cost of borrowing for the full year was 8.38%.

During this period, we opened 6 new hotels and signed 23

new management/franchise contracts, adding 1,394 rooms to

our pipeline. As of 31st March 2023, our operational inventory

comprised 88 hotels with 8,382 rooms and our pipeline

included 42 hotels with 3,285 rooms.: CHAIRMAN'S NOTE

Breaking Records and Setting Trends

Breaking Records and Setting Trends

ROADMAP 2028

After navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 era, we have

now defined our strategic targets for the coming five years.

This roadmap outlines well-defined and realistic objectives; our

primary focus is on achieving superior financial performance,

streamlining our portfolio, eliminating debt and establishing

ourselves as industry leaders in the areas of digital innovation

and ESG practices.

With a clear vision and target of over 300 hotels and 20,000

rooms by CY28, our strategy is anchored on asset-light growth,

digitisation, increased retail share, customer loyalty, lean

operations, capital optimisation and strategic restructuring. To

achieve this rapid expansion, we intend to extend our network of

managed and franchised rooms to around 15,000, contributing

to approximately 70% of our then room portfolio. In October

2023, we plan to open our largest hotel – Aurika, Mumbai

Skycity, which will add 669 rooms to our total owned inventory.

The pillars of our strategy are:

● Asset Light Growth and Network Effect: spreading

across geographies and deeper within key destinations

● Digital Transformation: we recognise its potential to drive

revenue, operational efficiencies and improved decision-

making across the organisation

● Retail Acceleration: our focus to bring in customers from

across segments through our retail channels

● Loyalty Expansion: relaunching the loyalty programme

and building a bigger, more robust loyal consumer base

● Cost Structure: Maintaining our industry-leading margins

of 50% through a lean operating model

● Capital Recycling: of our owned network by diluting

ownership while retaining majority shareholding and

unlocking capital for future growth

● Simplifying Group Structure: FY23 has laid a robust

foundation for our growth momentum, with a strong

commitment to delivering exceptional guest experiences and

embracing innovation in an evolving hospitality landscape.

The outlook for LTH remains promising, with healthy

occupancy rates and higher ARRs. As the economy revives,

we anticipate a sharp demand rebound and as the largest

branded hotel player in the mid-segment, we are well-

positioned to benefit and gain market share.

IN GRATITUDE

In conclusion, I would like to express my sincere thanks

to all our employees for their determined efforts towards

forging a resilient and agile organisation, and to all our

stakeholders for their unstinting support over the years. I

hope this support continues to lead us to greater heights.

Together, we will continue to build LTH as a leading brand in

the hospitality industry.

incorporated under the provisions of the Companies

Act applicable in India. The registered office of

the Company is located at Asset No. 6, Aerocity

Hospitality District, New Delhi-110037.

Development services.

The consolidated financial statements are approved

for issue by the Board of directors on May 30, 2023.

Basis

of

preparation

of

financial

statements and Significant accounting

policies

2.1 Basis of preparation

These financial statements are prepared in

accordance with Indian Accounting Standard (Ind

AS), and the provisions of the Companies Act,

2013 ('the Act') (to the extent notified) The Ind AS

are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read

with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment

rules issued thereafter.

The consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on a going concern basis using historical

cost convention and on an accrual method of

accounting, except for certain financial assets

and liabilities which are measured at fair value/

amortised cost (refer note 39).

Accounting policies have been consistently applied

except where a newly issued accounting standard is

initially adopted or a revision to an existing account

standard required a change to the accounting policy

hitherto to in use.

The consolidated financial statements are

presented in Indian Rupees (INR) and all values

are rounded off to the nearest lakhs, expect where

otherwise indicated

2.2 Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise

the financial statements of the Company, its

subsidiaries, associates and limited liability

partnership (together referred as “The Group”) as

at March 31, 2023. The Group controls an investee

if and only if the Group has:

− Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that

give it the current ability to direct the relevant

activities of the investee)

− Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its

involvement with the investee, and

− The ability to use its power over the investee to

affect its return

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority

of voting rights result in control. To support this

presumption and when the Group has less than

a majority of the voting or similar rights of an

investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and

circumstances in assessing whether it has power

over an investee, including:

− The contractual arrangement with the other

vote holders of the investee

− Rights arising from other contractual arrangements

− The Group’s voting rights and potential

voting rights

− The size of the group’s holding of voting rights

relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings

of the other voting rights holders

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls

an investee if facts and circumstances indicate

that there are changes to one or more of the three

elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary

begins when the Group obtains control over the

subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control

of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and

expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of

during the year are included in the consolidated

financial statements from the date the Group gains

control until the date the Group ceases to control

the subsidiary.

Consolidated financial statements are prepared

using uniform accounting policies for like

transactions and other events in similar

circumstances. If a member of the Group uses

accounting policies other than those adopted

in the consolidated financial statements for like

transactions and events in similar circumstances,

Key Audit Matter

Auditor’s Response

1

Impairment of Investment in subsidiaries having

hotel properties

(Refer Note 29b to the Standalone Financial

Statements)

At each reporting period, the Company assesses the

carrying amounts of investment in subsidiaries (having

hotel properties) to determine whether there is any

indication that those investments have suffered an

impairment loss. If any indication exists, the Company

estimates the investment’s recoverable amount. Where

the carrying amount of CGU exceeds its recoverable

amount, the investment is considered impaired and is

written down to its recoverable amount.

The Company holds investment in subsidiaries operating

hotels and are located in India amounting to H 89,895.08

Lakhs as at March 31, 2023.

The Company has undertaken an assessment of

indicators of impairment in respect of the investment in

subsidiaries as mentioned in Note 8 of the standalone

ﬁ nancial statements considering the qualitative factors

such as economic situation in recent past and past

performance of hospitality industry.

Principal audit procedures performed:

i. Obtained an understanding and assessed the Company’s

impairment process.

ii. Tested the design and implementation of internal control

established to the estimates and judgments for the

carrying values of investment in subsidiaries.

iii. Assessed the reasonableness of the assumptions used

to determine the fair value of investment in subsidiaries,

including discount rate and long-term growth rate, using

our valuation expertise;

iv. Assessed the reliability of cash ﬂ ow forecasts through a

review of actual past performance;

v. Challenged the assumptions used in the cash ﬂ ow

forecasts, which includes occupancy rate, average room

rate. To consider forecasting risk we also performed

sensitivity analysis over these assumptions.

vi We have tested the arithmetical accuracy of the

impairment model.
