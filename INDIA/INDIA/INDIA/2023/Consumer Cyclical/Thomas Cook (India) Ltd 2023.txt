Dear Shareholders,

The crisis of the pandemic represented

both a challenge and an opportunity

for your Company.

I am sure that all of you have actively

tracked our journey through the pandemic

and our significant recovery emerging out

of the pandemic and for the FY 2022-23.

I am going to take this opportunity to talk

about some parts of the incredible journey

that the team undertook, that brought your

company back from the brink.

We saw results reflecting as early

as Q2 FY23, culminating in a record

performance for the year ended March

31, 2023. This transformed your Company

from zero to hero!

Cost Optimization

• As early as June 2020, with signs that

the pandemic would continue unabated,

we took a difficult but crucial step

to right-size the organization. This

was managed with sensitivity – by

careful analysis of overlapping roles/

redundancies and creating common

resource pools, that reduced bench

strength by approx. 30%. Additionally,

your senior and mid-management took

a sizable pay cut across both the India

businesses & overseas subsidiaries.

During the fiscal year, our Digital First

strategy witnessed sustained momentum.

We reaffirmed our commitment to

becoming more customer-focused and

achieved operational efficiencies.

Madhavan Menon

Executive Chairman, Thomas Cook (India) Limited

• Thomas Cook India delivered the

highest operating profit in a decade:

Operating EBITDA at Rs. 1.2 Bn for

FY23; Operating PBT at Rs. 560 Mn

Vs a loss of Rs. 1.14 Bn in FY22.

• At a Group level, Operating

EBITDA grew significantly to Rs.

2.7 Bn for FY23 against a loss of

Rs. 1.2 Bn in FY22

Highlights of our FY 2022-23 performance:

• The growth drivers were your Foreign

Exchange & Travel Businesses

(Thomas Cook); Hospitality

(Sterling Holidays)

• Sterling Holidays registered its highest

EBITDA & PBT since inception: EBITDA

at Rs 1.1 Bn for FY23; PBT at Rs. 659 Mn

Vs Rs. 436 Mn in FY22

• After years of building infrastructure,

we scaled down our physical network

basis criticality & profitability, reducing

outflows on lease rentals. We relocated

SOTC Travel from its earlier premises to a

separate floor in the Thomas Cook head

office building in Mumbai, significantly

reducing costs. We also terminated

or paused many service agreements

towards controlling cash outflows.

• Your Company’s overall costs saw an

immediate reduction by approx. 50%

starting June-July 2020, which we

sustained through the two-year period

of the pandemic. As we emerged from

the pandemic and scaled up businesses

and resultant costs, our continued

focus on cost optimization delivered

significant annualized savings of Rs.3.71

Bn for FY23 - a 30% reduction in costs

Vs FY20 (pre-pandemic).

Travel Services: To drive economies of

scale by joint contracting and bulk buying,

we integrated the backend of our holiday

business at Thomas Cook and SOTC Travel,

creating a consolidated product-contracting

operations unit. This equipped us with

a unique competitive advantage - of

operating combined group tours, increase

profitability, with improved margins

and efficiencies.

At the front end, we took a strategic

decision to operate as distinct entities

for marketing, sales & distribution. This

created healthy competition between our

brands, while simultaneously enhancing our

visibility, market share and leadership.

We replicated this for our Corporate Travel

units across Thomas Cook India & SOTC:

integrating to form a leaner consolidated

back end, while keeping individual

customer-facing teams intact – ensuring

better contracting and a fungible team able

to serve more customers.

Foreign Exchange: We reimagined our

Foreign Exchange business by setting

up a central team for lead capture

to sale, with a seamless handover to

the closest retail outlets for last-mile

delivery of #Ghar pe Forex - within

2 hours! The ease/convenience for

customers, coupled with the speed and

efficiencies of a consolidated team

continues to give your Company a

compelling advantage.

Re structuring

the Enterprise

Sterling Holidays: also restructured its

business model by pivoting away from

its timeshare business, toward its more

asset-light and profitable hotel & resort

business. Accordingly, the company

merged the vacation ownership team

with their existing network.

To capitalize on the strong and growing

domestic demand, Sterling embarked

on aggressive expansion, adding 184

rooms and 6 new resorts, and is set to

add a resort a month for the second

half of the year!
