DEAR SHAREHOLDERS

1: Dear Shareholders,

The global economy has been facing a lot of challenges lately, thanks to a host of contributing factors like war situations, inflation among others. As

uncertainties plagued the economy, several industries bore the brunt of unexpected setbacks and disruptions. The real estate sector in India has

however been resilient despite the global ups and down. As one of the pioneering real estate firms, we are delighted to inform you that we have

made remarkable progress with persistent efforts.

Upward trend in Indian real estate

The Indian real estate sector flourished during the last year and set new sales records of 68% YoY. Industry reports state that the top 7 prime

residential markets in India recorded the highest sales during the first half of the financial year 2022-23 as compared to the last 10 years. As

demand for residential properties rose, we made further advancements in the real estate sector by collaborating with the best names in the

business to bring to the market thoughtfully designed spaces that cater to the tastes of the modern homebuyer.

Real estate sector in 2023

The residential segment will remain steady while commercial and industrial real estate will witness strong growth in 2023. Sustainability will receive

more attention as the government is focusing on green initiatives to be incorporated into real estate projects. RBI’s borrowing policies will have

an impact on the sector and the increased cost of borrowing may lead to a decline in demand for a short period. The impact however will not be

long-term and the real estate sector will continue its upward journey in 2023.

Our performance & future plans

During FY 2022-23, as you are aware, the Company converted its Convertible Warrants issued to the Promoter and Investors (Non-promoters) in

the previous year into equity shares, and additional capital was infused to the tune of approx. Rs. 355 crores during the year. The said equity was

utilised for the main objective of raising capital i.e. it strengthen its financial position by debt repayment of the Company and to meet its working

capital requirements. Once the entire Convertible warrants are converted into equity, your Company will be placed amongst the top 10 capitalized

Real Estate companies in India with a very minimal debt to equity ratio. The Company continues to carry out work on its project Ten BKC with Adani

GoodHomes Private Limited being appointed to manage and supervise the construction and implementation of the project. The project is expected

to be completed in the next financial year.

The Group remains committed to de-leverage its balance sheet and as a result had repaid and entered Settlements with its lenders during the year.

Further, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company entered into joint venture with Godrej Properties Limited for development of land admeasuring

19,434 sq. mtrs. situated at Byculla, Mumbai /project. The project will be developed by Godrej Residency Private Limited, wherein the wholly

owned subsidiary of the company holds 49.99% and balance 50.01% is held by Godrej Properties Limited.

Further, subsequent to the Financial year 2022-23, the Company / its WOS has executed Agreements for proposed transfer of its entire stake in

Prestige (BKC) Realtors Pvt Ltd., joint venture between the Company and subsidiary of Prestige Group executing “BKC 01” Project at Bandra

Kurla Complex, Mumbai. Post-sale of aforesaid shares, the Company/ its WOS shall cease to hold shares in the said Joint Venture. Under the

agreements, the Company has option to acquire 4.57 lakh sqft carpet area on terms and conditions contained therein.

The Company also has executed agreements for proposed transfer of its entire 50% rights, interest and share in Turf Estate Joint Venture LLP, joint

venture between the Company and subsidiary of Prestige group executing “Liberty Tower Project” at Dr. E. Moses Road, Mahalaxmi, Mumbai. Post

transfer of partnership interest, the Company/ its WOS shall cease to hold stake in the said joint venture. Under the agreements, the Company has

option to acquire 6.70 lakh sqft carpet area on terms and conditions contained therein.

The equity exits are in line with the aim of the Company to de-leverage its balance sheet largely through the monetisation of its assets.

In the makeover business strategy, the Company is keen on unlocking the value of its substantial land holdings spread over more than 600 acres

prime land mostly situated in MMR and materialise pursuing the joint venture/joint development approach for its ongoing and upcoming projects

in the immediate future.

We thank customers, shareholders, employees, and all stakeholders including new investors who have subscribed to the Convertible Warrants for

their continued trust and support and for being an unshakable pillar of strength in our pursuit of relentless commitment to our core values. Together,

let’s take the real estate sector of India to new heights of growth and success

Managing Director

Mr. Vinod Goenka (DIN: 00029033) was re-appointed as an Executive Chairman cum: Managing

Managing Director and Mr. Shahid Balwa, Vice Chairman and: Managing

letter dated 8th March, 2021. The Company, in its response to the invocation of the corporate

guarantee, has made an offer to pay Rs. 25,400 lacs as a part of its obligation as a guarantor which will also be reimbursed

to the Company by such related party.

With regard to point no. a as above, the management based on the market value of the various other primary securities,

corporate guarantee and undertaking by the holding company of the related party entity (for whom guarantee was

provided) is confident of recovering the amount payable (if any) to the lenders from the said related party and its holding

company and accordingly is of the view that provision is not required to be made.

b.

Financial guarantees and securities given by the Company on behalf of certain entities (referred as principal borrowers)

who have defaulted in their principal payment obligations to the lenders aggregating to Rs. 24,547.62 lacs as per SFS

and Rs. 6,811.47 lacs as per CFS (excluding interest, penal interest and other charges). The loans taken by these entities

have also been secured by charge on the underlying assets of the said entities and assets of other related parties.

Valuation report of such primary / underlying assets provided as securities by the borrowing companies has not been

obtained from an independent valuer. Further, out of Rs. 24,547.62 lacs as per SFS as above, during the year, one of

the subsidiary companies (i.e. principal borrower), has entered into one time settlement with lender equivalent to loans of

Rs. 17,736.15 lakhs. The principal borrower has requested for extension of time for the installment due on 31st March,

2023 from the lender which has been in principle agreed by the lender subject to execution of necessary addendum

settlement agreement which is in the process of being executed.

With regard to point no. b, the management is of the view that the value of such primary / underlying assets provided as

securities is greater than the outstanding loans and hence additional liability will not devolve on the Company/ Group

inspite of the guarantee and securities provided by the Company/ Group. In the above amounts, interest and other

charges are not included as the same cannot be quantified as the respective borrower/s had disputed the same and also

since settlement proposal is in discussion by the respective borrowers with their lenders.

c.

Further, financial guarantees and securities given by the Company on behalf of certain entities (related parties) who have

defaulted in their principal payment obligations to the lenders aggregating to Rs. 35,240.50 lacs as per SFS and Rs.

36,280.50 lacs as per CFS (excluding interest, penal interest and other charges). The loans taken by these entities have

also been secured by charge on the underlying assets of the said entities and assets of other related parties. The other

details about one time settlement with lender entered into by the borrower entity subsequent to the year end as well as

the SEBI matter has been mentioned in this point.

With regard to above point no. c, the value of primary / underlying assets provided as securities by the borrowing

companies is greater than the outstanding loans and hence in view of the management no additional liability is expected

to devolve on the Company/Group. In the above amounts, interest and other charges are not included as the same cannot

be quantified as the respective borrower/s had disputed the same and also since settlement proposal is in discussion by

the respective borrowers with their lenders. The other details about one time settlement with lender entered into by the

borrower entity subsequent to the year end as well as the SEBI matter has been mentioned in this qualification point,

which is self-explanatory.

2.

Para 2(2) of the Audit Report on the SFS and Para 2(2) of CFS read with Note No.48 of SFS and 49A(2) of CFS refer to

non-evaluation of impairment provision, towards expected credit losses in respect of the loans and advances / deposits

and towards diminution in the value on the Company’s/ Group’s investments, that were invested in /advanced to certain

subsidiaries and other parties which have incurred significant losses and/or have negative net worth as at 31st March, 2022

and/or have pending legal disputes with respect to the underlying projects/ properties of respective entities. In reply thereto,

as already explained in detail in Note No.48 of SFS and 49A(2) of CFS, your Directors state that the underlying projects

in such entities are in the early stages of real estate development and are expected to achieve adequate profitability on

substantial completion and/ or have current market values of certain properties which are in excess of the carrying values. The

Company considers its investments and loans in such entities as long term and strategic in nature. Accordingly, no provision is

considered necessary towards diminution in the value of the Company’s investments in such entities and for expected credit

losses in respect of loans and advances given to such entities, which are considered good and fully recoverable.:

letter dated

March 8, 2021. The company, in its response to the invocation of the corporate guarantee, has made an offer to pay Rs 25,400 lacs as a part

of its obligation as a guarantor, further we are informed that the said amount would also be reimbursed to the Company by such related party.

The management based on the market value of the various other primary securities, corporate guarantee and undertaking by the holding

company of the related party entity (for whom guarantee was provided) is confident of recovering the amount payable (if any) to the lenders

from the said related party and its holding company and accordingly is of the view that provision is not required to be made.

b.

Financial guarantees and securities given by the Company on behalf of certain entities (referred as principal borrowers) who have defaulted

in their principal payment obligations to the lenders aggregating to Rs 24,547.62 lacs (excluding interest, penal interest and other charges).

The loans taken by these entities have also been secured by charge on the underlying assets of the said entities and assets of other related

parties. Valuation report of such primary / underlying assets provided as securities by the borrowing companies has not been obtained

from an independent valuer. In view of the management, value of such primary / underlying assets provided as securities is greater than

the outstanding loans and hence additional liability will not devolve on the Company. In the above amounts, interest and other charges are

not included as the same cannot be quantified as the respective borrower/s had disputed the same and also since settlement proposal is in

discussion by the respective borrowers with their lenders.

Further, out of Rs. 24,547.62 lacs above, during the year, one of the subsidiary companies (i.e. principal borrower), has entered into one-time

settlement with lender equivalent to loans of Rs. 17,736.15 lakhs. The principal borrower has requested the lender for extension of time for

the installment due on 31st March 2023, which has been in principle agreed by the lender subject to execution of necessary addendum to

settlement agreement, which is in the process of being executed.

c.

Further, financial guarantees and securities given by the Company on behalf of certain entities (related parties) who have defaulted in their

principal payment obligations to the lenders aggregating to Rs. 35,240.50 lacs (excluding interest, penal interest and other charges). The

loans taken by these entities have also been secured by charge on the underlying assets of the said entities and assets of other related

parties. As per valuation reports obtained from independent valuer, the value of primary / underlying assets provided as securities by the

borrowing companies is greater than the outstanding loans and hence in view of the management no additional liability is expected to devolve

on the Company. In the above amounts, interest and other charges are not included as the same cannot be quantified as the respective

borrower/s had disputed the same and also since settlement proposal is in discussion by the respective borrowers with their lenders.

Further, out of Rs. 35,240.50 lacs above, subsequent to the year end, one of the entities (i.e. principal borrower), has entered into a one-time

settlement with lender equivalent to loans of Rs. 32,000 lakhs. Post completion of the settlement obligations by the said principal borrower,

the company’s guarantee obligation / securities would cease to exist.

With reference to above, during the year, Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has issued administrative warning (i.e. impugned order)

to the Independent Directors with respect to accounting and disclosure of financial guarantees based on the investigation carried out by

SEBI. This order was specifically with respect to matters covered in note 43.2D(xiv)(a) of the standalone Ind AS financial statement and it

also extends to other guarantees as well. The said order quantifies the expected credit loss / additional provision with respect to financial

guarantees as mentioned in note 43.2D(xiv)(a) of standalone Ind AS financial statements of Rs. 59,130.18 lakhs to be made by the company

in accordance with Ind AS 109 – Financial Instruments till 31st March 2021. The company has disputed the said order and in its opinion, no:
