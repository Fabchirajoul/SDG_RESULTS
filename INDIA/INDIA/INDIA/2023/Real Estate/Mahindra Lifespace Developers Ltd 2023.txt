Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer

Mr. Amit Kumar Sinha: Managing

Dear Stakeholders,

I am delighted to share the highlights of our

Company's progress during the year 2022-23.

You are all aware that the Indian economy has

shown remarkable resilience in the face of external

challenges such as geopolitical tension, trade

disputes and slowdown in the developed countries.

India’s GDP grew by 7% in 2022-23. Our strong

economic fundamentals, prudent policies, and

structural reforms have enabled India to navigate

through the numerous challenges posed by the

global economic landscape. The general mood in

industry is bullish, and it is likely that ‘animal spirits’

will once again come to the fore.

Before I share our Company’s performance

and achievements, let us remember Mr Keshub

Mahindra, Mahindra Group’s Chairman Emeritus,

who left for his heavenly abode in April 2023. His

leadership exemplified determination, empathy,

respect and integrity, and has been a guiding force

in shaping the Mahindra culture. Mr Mahindra will

forever remain an inspiration and role model for us.

The Company had a change at the leadership

level with retirement of our beloved long serving

Chairman, Mr. Arun Nanda in July 2022. I have

personally admired Mr. Nanda’s business acumen

and strategic guidance. I take pride in taking over

reins from Mr. Nanda. He has been an integral part

of the Mahindra Group for over three decades

leading several businesses and has played a crucial

role in building the foundation for the Group. It

was Mr. Nanda who spearheaded the Group’s foray

into real estate and pioneered the country’s first

SEZ under the PPP model with development of

Mahindra World Cities. It was his dedication and

perseverance that has guided the Company’s

growth since 2001. I thank Mr. Nanda for his

leadership and invaluable contribution. I am glad

to say that Mr. Nanda has agreed to my request to

make himself available whenever needed, for giving

guidance to our Company.

Alluding to changes, let me also highlight changes

at the board level. I welcome Ms. Rucha Nanavati

and Mr. Anuj Puri for joining the Board. Rucha

and Anuj bring with them deep experience and

knowledge in their respective specialisations, which

will be of great help to our company at the board

level. At the end of the year, the Company had a

change at the executive level with appointment

of Mr. Amit Kumar Sinha as the: Managing
