Dear Shareholders,

The Indian economy is growing faster than most major economies and its impressive growth is proof of

its resilience to the ongoing volatility in the international ecosystem.

The real estate market in India continues its growth trajectory that started immediately afer the first

wave of Covid-19. Despite inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions and rising interest rates, the real

estate sector has maintained a cyclical upswing.

I am happy to inform you that your Company has again delivered outstanding perormance across all

its verticals during the financial year. In FY23, we recorded our best annual profitability figure and

highest ever gross booking value, which is indicative of our margins, eficiency, and execution ability

across verticals.

Consolidation amongst reputed brands continues to be a key trend in the segment. The primary drivers

for this consolidation are continued consumer confidence towards these brands due to their track

record, financial capabilities and ability to provide high quality and sustainable ecosystems.

The premium residential segment continues to witness strong demand, well supported by tailwinds of

demand drivers such as an increase in earning potential, a need for a better standard of living and the

growing base of aspirational consumers. With our strategically aligned vision and diverse innovative

oferings, we have emerged more tenacious and robust.

Oberoi Realty has again delivered

outstanding perormance across

all its verticals during the financial

year. In FY23, we recorded our best

annual

profitability

figure

and

highest ever gross booking value,

which is indicative of our margins,

eficiency, and execution ability

across verticals.

The above Cash Flow Statement has been prepared under the Indirect Method, as set out in Ind AS 7 Statement of Cash Flows.

Significant accounting policies

1:

letter of allotment and when control

of the goods or services are transferred to the customer, at an amount that reflects the consideration

(i.e. the transaction price) to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods

or services excluding any amount received on behalf of third party (such as indirect taxes). An asset

created by the Group’s performance does not have an alternate use and as per the terms of the

contract, the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed till date. Hence

the Group transfers control of a good or service over time and, therefore, satisfies a performance

obligation and recognises revenue over time. The Group recognises revenue at the transaction price

(net of transaction costs) which is determined on the basis of agreement or: letter of allotment entered

into with the customer. The Group recognises revenue for performance obligation satisfied over time

only if it can reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance

obligation. The Group would not be able to reasonably measure its progress towards complete

satisfaction of a performance obligation if it lacks reliable information that would be required to apply

an appropriate method of measuring progress. In those circumstances, the Group recognises revenue

only to the extent of cost incurred until it can reasonably measure outcome of the performance

obligation.

The Group uses cost based input method for measuring progress for performance obligation satisfied

over time. Under this method, the Group recognises revenue in proportion to the actual project cost

incurred (excluding land and finance cost) as against the total estimated project cost (excluding land

and finance cost).

Managing Director/Chief Financial Officer evaluates the Group’s performance based on an analysis of various

performance indicators by business segment. Segment revenue and expense include amounts which can be directly

attributable to the segment and allocable on reasonable basis. Segment assets and liabilities are assets/liabilities

which are directly attributable to the segment or can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Income/expenses/

assets/liabilities relating to the enterprise as a whole and not allocable on a reasonable basis to business segments

are reflected as unallocated income/expenses/assets/liabilities.

1.2.19

Employee benefits

(i)

Defined contribution plans

Retirement benefits in the form of contribution to provident fund and pension fund are charged to the

Statement of Profit and Loss.

(ii)

Defined benefit plans

Gratuity is in the nature of a defined benefit plan.

Provision for gratuity is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations carried out at the reporting date and

is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. The actuarial valuation is computed using the projected unit

credit method.

Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts

included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts

included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the financial

statement with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they

occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss in subsequent periods.

(iii)

Other employee benefits

Leave encashment is recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss as and when they

accrue. The Group determines the liability using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations

carried out as at the reporting date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of Other

Comprehensive Income.:

Managing Director/Chief Financial Officer

evaluates the Group’s performance based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segment. Accordingly information has been presented

along these segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statement are consistently applied in individual segment to prepare

segment reporting.
