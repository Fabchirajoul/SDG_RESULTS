Dear Shareholders,

With the blessings of our founder Shri Ashok Sarin, son of Lala

Anant Ram Sarin and Smt. Raj Kumari Sarin, we are delighted to

present our Annual Report for FY 2022-23.

With immense pride and jubilation we write to you about the success

we achieved during the year and the progress we are making towards

a better tomorrow. FY 2022-23 in many ways is the culmination

of the dream and values nurtured by our visionary Founder, as we

crossed the milestone figure of ` 1,000 Crore in revenue for the very

first time in our glorious history. This achievement comes following

two successive years of revenue doubling, and manifests that we are

well past the period of challenges.

The management takes this opportunity to thank all our stakeholders

whose confidence and support have been instrumental. While we

have set an unprecedented benchmark of success, we are inspired

more than ever to push beyond new horizons. We have increased focus

on execution, steadily progressing towards deleveraging and pursuing

avenues to unlock newer opportunities and reach greater heights.

THE MACRO ECONOMY

After a prolonged period of uncertainty, 2022 was expected to see the

beginning of a global economic recovery with the pandemic dissipating

and focus returning to economic growth. However, geopolitical

tensions, energy crisis, and high inflation posed challenges for the

global economy and businesses in general. Central banks across the

world raised policy rates to combat this permacrisis.

Nonetheless,

India

outperformed

and

became

the

world’s

fastest-growing economies even as most developed nations faced

slowing growth. The Indian economy registered an estimated

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 7% in FY 2022-23

as against 9.1% growth attained in the previous fiscal. The

optimistic growth stems from a slew of positive initiatives by the

Government including increasing fiscal investments and implementing

favourable policy regime that synergistically converged to propel the

economy forward. This included a push for infrastructure development

with an allocation of ` 10 Lakh Crore, emphasis on manufacturing

self-reliance and launch of production-linked incentives (PLI)

schemes which helped thrust economic activities. These efforts

have positioned India attractively as a major global manufacturing

destination. The trinity of manufacturing, infrastructure and

digitalisation has potential to propel India’s economic growth and

unlock new business opportunities.

The positive momentum in the Indian economy was also reflected in

the robust office and residential demand, and even complemented by

relatively strong price growth seen during 2022. While the resurgence

in the office market has been a welcome surprise, the residential

market has sustained the momentum seen in the later half of 2021.

Despite the 225 basis points (bps) repo rate hike and high mortgage

rates during the year, the robust performance of the sector signifies

the strength of the underlying demand for real estate properties.

The sector is expected to continue its journey of long-term growth

with continuous rise in GDP per capita, higher disposable incomes,

growing urbanisation, favourable policy reforms, and most of all, a

larger focus on India to emerge as the next big economy.

A YEAR OF OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE

At Anant Raj, we moved with agility to capture the immense

momentum in the residential segment including expediting new

We have increased focus on execution,

steadily progressing towards deleveraging

and pursuing newer avenues to unlock newer

opportunities and reach newer heights.
