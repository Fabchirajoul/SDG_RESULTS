Letter from the: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

The volatile economic environment in the

recent years has provided businesses

across the globe an opportunity to

demonstrate their resilience. Despite the

wide array of challenges that we have

faced, our pragmatic approach coupled

with our strong execution capabilities has

allowed us to chart a remarkable recovery

as we stay poised to transition into our

next leg of growth. As India’s leading

developer and operator of retail-led

mixed-use assets, we aspire to capture

the most promising opportunities in our

country and deliver long-term value to

our shareholders. Building upon our

strong legacy, we have established a

robust business model that enables us to

consistently deliver on our commitments

and conﬁdently move forward towards the

exciting prospects that await us.

Vision Turned into Promises.

In 2018-19, we promised to deliver on

our ambitious vision of doubling of our

retail mall portfolio. As of 2023, we

have a retail portfolio of over 11 msft,

which has expanded by over 5 msft

since 2018-19*. Today, we are on a

pedestal of India’s largest owner and

operator of Grade A retail mall assets

in India with each mall being a leader

and high energy hub in the city where

it is present.

Our focus is on capturing regional

discretionary consumption by building

a dominant consumption center. In

Indore and Lucknow, we saw an

opportunity to cater to the Tier 1

markets of multiple catchments in the

states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar

Pradesh respectively and were able

to build dominant consumption hubs

that cater to multiple cities in the

respective states. We are looking

to capture similar prospective micro

markets that have metropolitan areas,

thriving business centers with sizeable

transient populations, rapidly growing

IT and educational hubs, and more.

Our commitment to delivering

superior consumer experiences

remains at the core of our expansion

strategy. With each step, we strive to

create thriving city centric destinations

that meet the evolving needs of our

customers, while fostering economic

development in the regions we serve.

Promises Turned into Performance.

The resumption of economic activity

to pre-pandemic levels has been very

encouraging, paving the way for us

to resume our rapid growth trajectory

We promised to deliver on our

ambitious vision of doubling of retail

mall portfolio in 2018-19. As of 2023,

we have a retail portfolio of over 11

msft, which has expanded by over 5

msft since 2018-19.

Our destination of the future goes

well beyond the retail mall itself and is

a high energy destination through the

day with modern offices built within

the same development housing best

of businesses in the working hours

followed by leisure, entertainment

and luxury space in the resting hours.

Message from Chairman

24

The Phoenix Mills Limited

from existing portfolio and expand our

operational retail portfolio to over 11

msft by the end of calendar year 2023

despite the pandemic. Moreover, we

have a secured pipeline to take the

operational retail mall portfolio to

beyond 14 msft by end of 2027.

During FY 2023, the consumption

levels across our operational malls

reached an all-time high of ₹ 92,481

mn. With this performance, we

have established CAGR of 13% on

consumption over FY 2013 through

FY 2023 despite two years of

Covid-led disruption. Over this period,

we have proactively studied and

managed the brand and category mix

at each of our retail malls to keep our

customers engaged and excited and

go beyond just staying relevant. We

stand well-placed to sustain the robust

momentum we have achieved during

the current ﬁnancial year. The rise in

occupancy levels and trading density

across our key malls has reﬂected

in our strong retail collections of ₹

21,665 mn, during FY 2023. Presently,

our leadership position in retail-led

mixed-use development is stronger

than ever, and we are evolving with

design and delivery of superior assets,

with a carefully curated and evolving

retailer mix extraordinary architecture,

stunning interiors and captivating

art décor that enable a world class

experience through the ﬁnest of

designs and variety of oferings.

In addition to our admirable

performance on the retail front, we

have gained pace in other verticals

which include our commercial ofces,

residential and hospitality portfolio.

Our ﬂagship hotel, The St. Regis,

Mumbai surpassed life-time highs in

terms of annual revenue with total

operating income reaching ₹ 4,042

mn and EBITDA margin at 45%.

Furthermore, our retail-led mixed-

use ecosystem has led to synergies,

beneﬁtting our commercial ofces

portfolio.

With Grade A ofces gaining traction,

we remain positioned to fulﬁl the gaps

that are present in the commercial

ofces real estate market. Our

residential segment also delivered a

stellar performance with gross sales

value growing over 36% compared to

FY 2022, reaching a total of ₹ 4,657

mn during FY 2023.

One of the major highlights of

the year was the expansion

of our retail presence to two

new cities, Ahmedabad and

Indore through the launch

of Palladium, Ahmedabad

(~0.75 msft) and Phoenix

Citadel, Indore (~1 msft).

Both these assets were acquired in

2018 and were ready for launch within

four years, even with the Covid-19

pandemic impacting construction. This

demonstrates our ability to deliver

superior quality retail-led mixed-

use destinations within the project

timelines and budgeted cost.

Phoenix Citadel Indore was a

brownﬁeld acquisition completed

in June 2018 and commenced

operations in December 2022. Within

six months of launch, in June 2023,

the trading occupancy ramped up to

86% (from 42% in December 2022

and 70% in March 2023). This mall

has a marquee presence in Madhya

Pradesh, with larger-than-life décor,

fountains and interior design inspired

by the streets of Italy. With more than

300 national and international brands,

including over 100 brands making

their debut in Indore, Phoenix Citadel

promises a remarkable shopping

experience for visitors.

Similarly, the greenﬁeld land parcel

for Palladium Ahmedabad was

acquired in July 2018 and commenced

operations in February 2023. The

trading occupancy showed a fast

ramp up from 32% at launch to about

60%, about four months later in June

2023. This is our tallest mall till date,

spread across six ﬂoors, comprising

two ﬂoors of delightful dining options,

a nine-screen multiplex and dedicated

entertainment areas. This development

has reminiscence of luxury akin

to Phoenix Palladium Mumbai and

promises a truly opulent and immersive

experience for visitors. Housing more

than 250 national and international

brands, including over 35 exclusive

luxury brands making their debut in

Ahmedabad, it is set to become a

haven for perspicacious shoppers.

In December 2022, we proudly

announced the acquisition of a 7.22

acre city center land parcel in Surat,

Gujarat. Positioned strategically, this

land holds immense potential to

become a premium retail destination,

with a GLA of approximately 1 mn

square feet, expected to be completed

by 2027. This acquisition was funded

jointly by Graceworks Realty & Leisure

(GRLPL), which is a PML-GIC joint

venture entity, with a stake of 80%

and Safal Construction, the ﬂagship

development arm of Ahmedabad-

based BSafal Group, with a stake of

20%.

Recently, we also completed the

acquisition of a prime land parcel

of 5.5 acres in Alipore, Kolkata for

a consideration of ₹ 4,140 mn (100%

* This total retail mall area includes Phoenix Mall of the Millennium, Wakad Pune, which is set for launch on September 1, 2023 and Phoenix Mall of Asia, Hebbal -

Bangalore which received occupation certiﬁcate in May 2023 and will be open to customers soon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023

1.

CORPORATE INFORMATION:

The Phoenix Mills Limited (hereinafter referred to as the

“Parent”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its

subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) is domiciled

and incorporated in India and its shares are publicly traded

on the National Stock Exchange (‘NSE’) and the Bombay

Stock Exchange (‘BSE’), in India. The registered ofce of

the company is at 462, Senapati Bapat Marg, Lower Parel,

Mumbai – 400013, Maharashtra, India.

Group is engaged in operation and management of mall,

construction of commercial and residential property and

hotel business in India.

These ﬁnancial statements were approved and adopted by

the Board of Directors of the Company in their meeting held

on May 24, 2023.

2.

BASIS

OF

PREPARATION

OF

FINANCIAL

STATEMENT:

The Financial Statements have been prepared to comply

in all material aspects with Indian Accounting Standards

(Ind AS) notiﬁed under the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

The signiﬁcant accounting policies used in preparing

ﬁnancial statements are set out below in Note 3 of the Notes

to Financial Statements. Except for the changes below, the

Group has applied accounting policies consistently to all the

periods presented.

3.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

3.1. Basis of Measurement

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been

prepared on an accrual basis and under the historical

cost convention except following which have been

measured at fair value:

•

Defined benefit plans – plan assets measured at

fair value

•

Certain financial assets and liabilities that are

measured at fair value.

•

Share based payments measured at fair value

The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented

in Indian Rupees (“in lakhs“), which is the Group’s

functional currency and all amounts are rounded to the

nearest rupees in lakhs except otherwise stated.

3.2. Basis of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group

incorporate the ﬁnancial statements of the Parent

Company and its subsidiaries and associates. The

Parent Company has control over the subsidiaries

as it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns

from its involvement with the investee; and has the

ability to afect its returns through its power over the

subsidiaries. Generally, there is a presumption that a

majority of voting rights result in control. To support

this presumption and when the Group has less than a

majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the

Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances

in assessing whether it has power over an investee,

including the contractual arrangement with the other

vote holders of the investee, rights arising from

other contractual arrangements, the Group’s voting

rights and potential voting rights and the size of the

Group’s holding of voting rights relative to the size

and dispersion of the holdings of the other voting

rights holders. The Company re-assesses whether or

not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances

indicate that there are changes to one or more of the

three elements of control.

An associate is an entity over which the Group has

signiﬁcant inﬂuence. Signiﬁcant inﬂuence is the power

to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policy

decisions of the investee, but has no control or joint

control over those policies.

Consolidation Procedure:

a)

Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity,

income, expenses and cash ﬂows of the parent

with those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose,

income and expenses of the subsidiary are

based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities

recognised

in

the

Consolidated

Financial

Statements at the acquisition date.

b)

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when

the Parent Company obtains control over the

subsidiary and ceases when the Parent Company

loses control of the subsidiary. Speciﬁcally,

income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or

disposed of during the year are included in the

consolidated statement of proﬁt or loss and other

comprehensive income from the date the Parent

Company gains control until the date when the

Parent Company ceases to control the subsidiary.

c)

Proﬁt or loss and each component of other

comprehensive income are attributed to the

owners of the Parent Company and to the non-

controlling

interests.

Total

comprehensive

income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners

of the Parent Company and to the non-controlling:
