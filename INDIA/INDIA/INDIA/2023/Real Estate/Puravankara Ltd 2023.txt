However, the economic canvas also

witnessed turbulent strokes, with the

Russia-Ukraine conflict as a primary

catalyst for soaring commodity

prices. As demand outpaced supply,

we faced higher input costs amidst

a tight labour market and disrupted

supply chains. While central banks

worldwide intervened with prudent

monetary policies to mitigate

inflationary pressures, concerns of

an impending global recession in

2023 persisted.

As I reflect upon the current

environment, I am reminded of

what it means to be of service.

The real estate sector and our

business model are built around

a commitment to serving

others. Even in the face of

prevailing economic challenges,

it is humbling that Puravankara

remained an agent of positive

change, determined to make

a difference in the lives of our

customers, employees, and

stakeholders at large.

Amidst this evolving environment,

we continued to execute our

strategic priorities, purposefully

driving our competitive advantage.

I believe this vibrant spirit of value

creation, even during cycles of

economic challenges, is coded

into our organisational DNA. It will

propel us forward as we rise and

Your organisation's

forward-looking stance,

driven by the pursuit of its

vision to create a sustainable

world for people to live their

dreams, recognises that our

canvas is as expansive as

the hopes and aspirations

of our customers.

unlock value through our work in

real estate - a sector that harbours

a stronger, sustainable and more

resilient society.

Your organisation's forward-looking

stance, driven by the pursuit of its

vision to create a sustainable world

for people to live their dreams,

recognises that our canvas is

as expansive as the hopes and

aspirations of our customers.

Our underlying focus behind

diversification is to ensure multiple

revenue channels, recurring income,

faster capital release, and a stronger

balance sheet. Within this realm

of diversification, I would like to

spotlight your company’s EPC

arm - Starworth Infrastructure

and Construction, which is rapidly

gaining recognition as a quality and

tech-oriented player in specialised

infrastructure construction, including

property development. With an

order book brimming with blue-chip

clientele, Starworth is poised for an

exciting growth trajectory.

Puravankara’s focus on Purva

Woodworks has also been

unwavering. This division has

established a state-of-the-art: DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

It gives me immense pleasure to

share with you the remarkable

achievements at Puravankara

during the fiscal year 2022-23.

Against the backdrop of a

changing global landscape, the

year 2022-23 witnessed sharper

focus on economic recovery.

India transitioned into endemicity,

and economic activities returned

to normal, supported by

increased mobility.

As a result, the nation recorded a robust

GDP growth at 7.2% for the year, driven

by a resurgence in domestic demand

and a strong performance from the

manufacturing and services sectors.

PERFORMANCE WITH

CONFORMANCE

Investors hold our governance

and compliance standards in high

regard, and we are rated favourably

in these aspects. This serves as a

valuable asset in our efforts to build

trust and reinforces our investment

proposition. The commitment to

integrity and transparency, set

This approach ensures that every

member of our organisation remains

accountable for their actions.

Our Board of Directors has

approved our code of ethics and

foundation upon which our

organisational culture is constructed.

Nonetheless, the code is dynamic

and continuously evolving as we

strive for even higher standards.

Puravankara remains committed

to upholding and enforcing the

principles articulated in this code,

and we are prepared to reconsider

our engagements with individuals

or entities that do not demonstrate

the same level of commitment to

organisational integrity.

In an era where investors are

recalibrating their expectations

regarding governance, compliance,

and scrutiny, I take pride in

Puravankara's strong standing,

where the alignment of performance

with conformance is a longstanding

practice that comes naturally to us.

ORGANISATIONAL

STATUTORY REPORT

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

MANAGING DIRECTOR

Mr. Ravi Puravankara, a visionary and dynamic leader, is the

Founder & Chairman of Puravankara Limited – one of India’s

most admired and trusted real estate brands. Under his guidance

and decisive leadership, the company has built an impressive

portfolio of completed residential and commercial properties

spanning over approximately 45 million square feet across 9 cities

- Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Coimbatore, Mangaluru, Kochi,

Mumbai, Pune, and Goa.

A visionary at heart, Ravi prioritises business decisions with a

sharp focus on building the company’s trust and credibility among

stakeholders. He was firm in establishing a strong framework of

good corporate governance and not dealing with unaccounted

money from the very beginning. This helped him build the

foundation of the brand Puravankara known for its transparency

and ethical practices.

Under his leadership, Puravankara also secured one of the first

FDI in the Indian real estate sector in 2005, forging a joint venture

with Singapore-based Keppel Land Limited. Mr. Puravankara

has also been instrumental in implementing best practices in

construction by focusing on technology to achieve quality in

execution, sales, and customer relations.

Mr. Ashish R. Puravankara oversees the entire business, primarily

identifying growth opportunities for Puravankara Limited.

He has played a key role in ensuring superior construction

quality by leveraging innovative technologies. Ashish’s strong

entrepreneurial vision led to the launch of Provident Housing, a

leading large-scale community developer. This venture also led to

the eventual launch of Purva Land, a plotted development arm.

Under Ashish’s decisive leadership, Puravankara has completed

several residential and commercial projects across 9 cities in

India. The company’s steady growth is a testament to his strategic

formulation, financial acumen, and enterprise development

expertise. His global exposure and access to a diverse network

have continually enabled him to innovate and redefine success

for the company.

Today, Ashish is widely recognised in the industry for his deep

understanding and knowledge of the real estate sector and his

drive for excellence.

Strategy and

Long-Term Value Creation

Puravankara has an eminent Board

of Directors who bring specialised

experience in real estate and other

diverse fields. This enriches the quality

of Board discussions and enhances the

decision-making process. As custodians

of stakeholder value, the Board prioritises

direction-setting, decision-making,

strategy implementation, performance

delivery, and impact creation.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

The standalone revenues of the Company stood at Rs.

900.74 crores compared to Rs. 941.38 crores in the previous

financial year. Correspondingly, the company has earned

profit (after tax) of Rs.114.24 crores for the year 2022-23 as

against a profit (after tax) of Rs.166.07 crores in the previous

financial year.

Consolidated revenues of your Company stood at Rs.

1,406.99 crores, as compared to Rs. 1,381.65 crores in the

previous financial year, showing an increase of 1.83%.

Total consolidated profit after tax for the year stood at

Rs. 66.52 Crores compared to the profit after tax of Rs.

147.56 Crore in the previous financial year.

Your Company is in the business of real estate development

and sale and follows IND AS 115 for recognition of revenue.

Accordingly, revenue can be recognized only when, apart

from other related conditions, the house/unit is delivered

to the customer. The development and delivery of homes/

units take substantial time – often three to five years and

hence revenue in respect of such projects can be recognized

only upon such completion. Thus, there is a substantial

lag in revenue recognition. Although the sale is confirmed

and customer advance is collected and construction is

substantially completed, revenue cannot be recognized in

line with prevailing regulations. Further, as and when the

Company incurs any sales and marketing expenses, the

same needs to be accounted as a cost for that period.

To ensure successful launch of projects, your Company

incurred a substantial amount of marketing expenses and

in the financial year 2022-23 too, your Company incurred

sales and marketing expenses which have been accounted

for the financial year.

To ensure balance between revenue and cost, your

Company has ensured sufficient spread of its projects

across different timelines in a manner to enable continuous

delivery of projects and cash flows throughout the year

under review. The Company has also started launching

plotted development projects which will have a shorter

completion cycle.
