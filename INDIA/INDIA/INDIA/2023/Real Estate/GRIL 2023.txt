Corporate Information:

Dear Shareholders,

I hope this message finds you in good

health and high spirits. As we reflect upon

the achievements of the previous fiscal

year, it gives me immense pleasure to share

with you the remarkable progress made by

G R Infraprojects Limited. Our commitment

to excellence and relentless pursuit of

growth has enabled us to attain significant

milestones, contributing to advancement

in India’s infrastructure landscape.

We continue to adopt a steadfast

approach to broaden our growth

trajectory with a strong emphasis on

capacity building, efficient resource

allocation and development of backward

integration strategies. Our vision of

excelling in the infrastructure sector is

bolstered by our in-house expertise for

design, development and execution of

specialised projects.

India’s Infrastructure Push

The consistent increase in India’s capital

expenditure as a percentage of GDP, from

1.7% in 2014 to nearly 2.9% in 2022-23,

indicates the nation’s constant emphasis on

infrastructure development. Furthermore,

the allocation of H 10 Lakhs Crores (3.3%

of GDP) for infrastructure development

in the Budget of 2023-24, exemplifies the

nation’s unwavering dedication to propel

infrastructure development.

The Government continues to spearhead

schemes that have expedited the pace of

development. The PM Gati Shakti Scheme,

for instance, has helped to facilitate

integrated planning and implementation

of advanced infrastructure projects. It

has also accelerated on-ground work

and created employment opportunities.

Additionally, the Bharatmala scheme

has played a pivotal role in bridging

infrastructure.

Our Growth Trajectory

We are pleased to announce that

G R Infraprojects Limited has achieved

a commendable financial performance

in the fiscal year 2022-23. Our

company’s standalone total income

8,05,157.74 Lakhs in the previous fiscal

year. Furthermore, Standalone Net Profit

for the Year stood at H 85,176.80 Lakhs

in the current fiscal year, compared to

H 76,081.54 Lakhs in the preceding fiscal.

At G R Infra, our lean debt ratio,

consistent financial performances and

enthusiasm to seize new opportunities

lends stability to our operations. These

notable achievements are a testament

to our relentless pursuit of operational

efficiency, effective cost management,

and the successful execution of projects.

Our ability to ensure timely completion

of complex projects has established

our credibility as a reliable partner in

nation building. It has not only resulted

in healthy financial returns but has also

translated into relentless value creation

for our shareholders. We owe our success

to the dedication of our skilled workforce

and their expertise has been instrumental

in realising our goals and shaping our

way forward.

Since our inception, G R Infra has

continuously expanded its horizons,

both in terms of scale and geography.

Managing Director’s Message

Building Trust Through

Integrity and Excellence: Dear Shareholders,

Indian economy has demonstrated

phenomenal resilience and remains

well on track to regain a positive

trajectory in the days ahead despite

macroeconomic challenges. Amidst

the country’s rise to the fifth largest

economy in the world, a significant

emphasis

on

infrastructure

development has been noticed over

the past few years. Conceptualisation

of new road and railway projects

opens up multiple opportunities for us.

Leveraging our expertise and domain

knowledge, we seek to capitalise on

a growing order book and retain a

leading edge in the industry.

The Government’s ‘Amrit Kaal’ vision

to make India a developed nation by

2047 has resulted in substantial capital

expenditure for infrastructure projects.

The Union Budget for 2023-24 marks

a substantial boost in infrastructure

investment,

particularly

in

the

transportation sector. The Ministry

of Road Transport and Highways has

received a sizable capex allocation of H

2,58,000 Crores, which is 36% more than

the prior capex amount. The budget for

FY 24 demonstrates the Government’s

evident focus on the infrastructure

sector by maintaining the overall capex

at the highest level of 10 Lakhs Crores.

This investment not only bolsters

connectivity and mobility but also holds

assurance for employment generation,

economic growth, and the nation’s

transition to a net-zero economy.

A Growing Order Book

During FY2023, we focused on diversifying

our business operations and secured

an order for the development of a

multi-modal logistic park, valued at

H758 Crores, along with seven

road projects, HAM Projects worth

H6,550 Crores. The Company was

also declared as successful bidder

for two ropeway projects worth

H 3,613 Crores. We have also been

declared as successful bidder for two

tunnel projects worth H 4,135 Crores

and have recieved Letter of Award (LoA)

for one tunnel works project worth H

498 Crores.

We submitted bids worth approximately

H 106,000 Crores during the fiscal year,

encompassing road, ropeway, railway,

metro, tunnel works and transmission

projects. As of March 31, 2023, our order

book value stood at H 26,780 Crores,

with yet to be awarded projects worth

H 7,250 Crores. While 65% of our order

book is focused on the development

of roads and highways, 35% of the

projects encompass different domains

of infrastructure development.

Furthermore, we are excited to share

that we have initiated work on our

Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT)

and have filed the draft offer document

with SEBI for its IPO. After receiving

approvals from SEBI and NHAI, we aim to

launch the IPO before end of September

2023 marking an important milestone in

our journey.

Financial Highlights

For the Financial Year ended March

2023, our standalone revenue from

operations increased by approximately

H 22,841. 30 Lakhs, reaching H 8,14,758.83

Lakhs. On a consolidated basis, our

revenue from operations stood at

H 9,48,151.49 Lakhs, reflecting an

increase of around H 1,02,316.73 Lakhs

in comparison to the previous year.

In the fiscal year 2023, we have undertaken

diversification initiatives within our business

operations, encompassing ropeway systems,

tunnel construction, and the development of

Multi-Modal Logistic Parks.

significant growth, reaching H 9,48,151.49 lakhs during FY

2022-23, compared to H 8,45,834.76 lakhs in FY 2021-22,

and increase in other operating revenue.

Our total expenses increased by 2.58% to H 7,61,647.51 lakhs

in FY 2022-23 from H 7,42,479.26 lakhs in FY 2021-22. This

was due to an increase in Construction expenses, employee

benefits expense, finance costs, and other expenses. This

was partially offset by a reduction in changes in inventories

of finished goods and trading goods, cost of materials

consumed and depreciation and amortisation expense.

The expenses related to employee benefits witnessed a

growth of 10.36% in FY 2022-23, reaching H 64,770.61 lakhs,

as compared to H 58,688.99 lakhs recorded in FY 2021-22. This

increase can be attributed to higher expenditures in areas

such as salaries, wages, contributions to gratuity, provident

fund, other funds, and staff welfare expenses.

Depreciation and amortisation expense stood at H 24,565.16

lakhs in FY 2022-23, a decrease of 12.78%, from H 28,163.01

Finance costs increased by 5.41%, to H 44,301.10 lakhs in

in FY 2022-23 from H 7,91,917.53 lakhs in the FY 2021-22,

recording an increase of 2.88%. This growth was largely

driven by increase in revenue from sale of services and

increase in other operating revenue.

The Company's other income increased to H 18,090.08

lakhs in FY 2022-23 from H 13,240.21 lakhs in FY 2021-22, an
