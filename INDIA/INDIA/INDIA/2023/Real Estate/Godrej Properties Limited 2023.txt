NOTE 1

I. COMPANY OVERVIEW

Godrej Properties Limited (“the Company”) having CIN:

L74120MH1985PLC035308 is engaged primarily in the

business of real estate construction, development and

other related activities. The Company is a public limited

company incorporated and domiciled in India having its

registered office at Godrej One, 5th Floor, Pirojshahnagar,

Eastern Express Highway, Vikhroli, Mumbai - 400079. The

Company’s equity shares are listed on The Bombay Stock

Exchange Limited (BSE) and The National Stock Exchange

of India Limited (NSE).

II. BASIS OF PREPARATION

a. Statement of compliance

The Standalone Financial Statements of the Company

have been prepared in accordance with the Indian

Accounting Standards (IND AS) as per the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 notified under

the Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) and

the relevant provisions and amendments, as applicable.

The Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for

the year ended March 31, 2023 were authorised for issue

by the Board of Directors on May 03, 2023.

b. Functional and presentation currency

These Standalone Financial Statements are presented in

Indian rupees (INR), which is also the functional currency

of the Company. All financial information presented in

Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest crore,

unless otherwise stated.

c. Basis of measurement

These financial statements have been prepared on

historical cost basis except certain financial instruments,

defined benefit plans and share based payments measured

at fair value.

d. Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the Standalone Financial Statements

in conformity with IND AS requires the use of estimates,

judgements and assumptions considered in the reported

amounts of assets and liabilities (including contingent

liabilities) and the reported income and expenses during

the year. Management believes that the estimates made in

the preparation of the standalone financial statements are

prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ from

those estimates. Any revision to accounting estimates is

recognised prospectively in current and future periods.

Information about judgments in applying accounting

policies, as well as estimates and assumptions that have

the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in

the financial statements included in the following notes:

•

Evaluation of satisfaction of performance obligation

for the purpose of revenue recognition

Determination of revenue under the satisfaction of

performance obligation necessarily involves making

estimates, some of which are of a technical nature,

concerning, where relevant, the timing of satisfaction of

performance obligation, costs to completion for the project

or activity and the foreseeable losses to completion.

Estimates of project income, as well as project costs, are

reviewed periodically. The Company recognises revenue

when the Company satisfies its performance obligation.

•

Evaluation of net realisable value of Inventories

Inventories comprising of finished goods and construction-

work-in progress are valued at lower of cost and net

realisable value. Net Realisable value is based upon the

estimates of the management. The effect of changes,

if any, to the estimates is recognised in the Standalone

Financial Statements for the period in which such changes

are determined.

•

Useful life and residual value of property, plant and

equipment, intangible assets and Investment Property

Useful lives of tangible, intangible assets and investment

property are based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the

Act. In cases, where the useful lives are different based from

that prescribed in Schedule II of the Act, they are based on

internal technical evaluation. Assumptions are also made,

when the Company assesses, whether an asset may be

capitalised and which components of the cost of the asset

may be capitalised.

The estimation of residual value of assets is based on

management’s judgment about the condition of such asset

at the point of sale of asset.

•

Recognition and measurement of defined benefit

obligations

The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is

determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key

actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary

escalation and attrition rate. The discount rate is determined

by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting

period on government securities. The period to maturity

of the underlying securities correspond to the probable

maturity of the post-employment benefit obligations.

•

Recognition and measurement of long-term incentive

Accrual for long-term incentive scheme liability requires

estimates and judgements in respect of achievement of

parameters of individual and business performance, as

well as market related parameters. These estimates are

based on past performance, approved budgets and plans
