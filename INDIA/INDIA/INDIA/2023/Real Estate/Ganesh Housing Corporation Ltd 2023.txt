Dear Shareholders

It is my privilege to present our Annual

Report for FY23 to you. I am delighted

to report that the Company has

reported excellent growth in difficult

times.

The macroeconomic volatility and

geo-political factors dominated the

global business environment during

FY23. Global growth is expected to

decelerate due to a slowdown in

markets. In contrast, emerging markets,

led by India, will provide some respite.

India’s growth continues to be resilient,

underpinned by the Government’s

capital outlay and buoyant private

consumption. India should retain its

position as the fastest-growing large

economy for the third consecutive

year, provided circumstances continue

to remain favourable

Aligned with and aware of the contours

of the economic landscape, the real

estate sector witnessed significant

activity and reported splendid growth.

India’s residential real estate market

reported record-breaking sales in FY23,

growing 36% from the previous year.

At Ganesh Housing, we had an

excellent run. It has been a record-

breaking year with many firsts -- the

Company

recorded

the

highest

revenue; we almost reached the best

Net Profit in our three-decade journey;

we registered a record net cash flow.

Most importantly, for the first time in

16 years, we are in a zero-debt position.

In fact, we have a cash surplus of

C320 crore. This is a massive gain ,

giving us a significant runway to sell

our inventory at our own will and

convenience It removes the pressure of

repayments.

During the year, we delivered our

residential project, Malabar County 3,

in just 2.5 years, the fastest ever due

to the astute use of tech and precast

with tech inside every home. We would

be delivering Malabar Exotica, which

started construction in July 2021, in a

similar manner, probably even faster.

Having said that, I must add that we

look forward to an exhilarating journey

for the next 8-9 years. We have started

the largest-ever development on the

ground with Malabar Exotica and

Million Minds SEZ Phase 1 – a total

development of 1.7 million square feet.

With

the

massive

Million

Minds

projects, we have a crystal-clear

blueprint of where we are heading to

in the next seven to eight years, with

upcoming projects comprising almost

28.7 million square feet of development

and clear cash flow visibility.

During Q4/FY23, we acquired the

minority stake in one of our subsidiaries

Gatil Properties Private Limited, from

Monsoon India Infrastructure Direct

II Limited, the Mauritius arm of the

US-based fund. With this strategic

investment, Gatil is now a 100%

subsidiary of Ganesh Housing.

Gatil is developing a township project

on a 450-acre land parcel in the fast-

growing area of Godhavi, Ahmedabad.

The township project will provide a

continuous and definitive cash flow

and profit for the next five to six years. It

has a development potential of around

15.3 million square feet with a saleable

potential of over C5,000 crore. We plan

to launch this project in five different

phases, with the first being launched

in the 4th quarter of FY24. We expect

to complete the project by the second

half of FY29.

In a nutshell, our hands are full. We will

remain focused on the quality of real

estate development and the timely

execution of our projects to ensure we

create value for all our stakeholders.

The timely delivery of our projects will

significantly enhance our liquidity,

allow us to undertake more daunting

projects, and propel the Company into

a new growth orbit.

I am optimistic about the prospects of

the real estate sector. I believe that the

momentum gained will continue for

the next decade. I feel that our future is

particularly riveting.

In closing, I would like to thank all

our stakeholders for believing in our

story, reposing their confidence in our

capability, and extending their support

in our long journey of endurance.

Warm regards,

Dipakkumar G. Patel

Chairman
