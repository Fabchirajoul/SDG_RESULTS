Dear Shareholders,

It is my pleasure to present, on behalf of the Board

of Directors of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.

(ONGC / the Company), the Integrated Report for

the financial year 2022-23 (FY’23), highlighting the

Company’s performance.

Over the past 3-4 years, the global economy

has faced significant challenges. Growth slowed

down last year. Some major financial institutions

collapsed. Intense geopolitical tensions have

disturbed the energy ecosystem.

Despite

these

challenges,

India’s

sustained

economic growth exemplifies its fundamental

resilience. The depth and width of transformation

in India is truly remarkable. IEA Chief Dr. Fatih Birol

recently remarked, “India is at the ‘center of global

energy affairs’ today”. A growing young population

and rapidly developing economy is boosting

demand in the world’s third-largest energy-

consuming nation.

The structure of global energy demand is also

undergoing a rapid change. This is catalyzed by

climate-led challenges and emerging technologies.

This transition is an inevitable evolution that the

energy sector must embrace. India’s climate

adaptation and mitigation ambitions are profoundly

transformative for our nation; it also carries immense:

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors of your Company,

it is my pleasure to present the 30th Annual Report of

Oil And Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC/ the

Company) and its Audited Financial Statements for

the year ended 31 March 2023 (FY’23), together with

the Auditors’ Report and Comments on the Financial

Statements by the Comptroller and Auditor General

(CAG) of India.

After three tumultuous years, the pandemic’s and

geopolitical disruptions’ extensive effects are finally

showing tapering signs coupled with slow recovery

in the world economy. Strong economic growth

has been apparent and inflation appears to have

decreased in a number of nations, largely as a result

of the implementation of strict monetary policies. On

the other hand, the evolving energy challenges are

complex and include not only natural gas but also oil,

coal, electricity, food security, and climate change. It

appears that constant unpredictability and potential

volatility continue to characterize the oil and gas

industry.

Your Company has been working to improve

the value proposition for all stakeholders while

maintaining the pace of capital spending and project

execution, sustaining production, and cost-optimizing

operations. The country’s expanding energy needs

can be met while also generating value for all our

stakeholders if we consolidate from here and continue

to grow sustainably.

Your Company, along with its group companies, has

registered yet another year of robust performance

and made substantial progress on most of the priority

areas.

Your Company’s standalone production during

FY’23 was 40.212 Million Metric Tonnes of oil and oil

equivalent gas (MMTOE) (against FY’22 production

of 40.453 MMTOE).

Highlights of production during FY’23 are as under:

• Crude oil production, including share of JV

production, was 21.485 Million Metric Tonnes

(MMT) during FY’23 against 21.707 MMT during

FY’22.

• Natural gas production, including share of JV

production, was at 21.351 Billion Cubic Metres

(BCM) during FY’23 against 21.680 BCM during

FY’22.

• Value Added Products (VAPs) production during

FY’23 was 2.598 MMT against 3.089 MMT during

FY’22.

Backed by an intensive and continuous exploration

programme, your Company declared eight oil and

gas discoveries (five on-land and three offshore)

during FY’23.

During FY’23, accreted 40.62 MMTOE of 2P reserves

from ONGC operated areas in India. Reserve

Replacement Ratio (RRR) from domestic fields was

1.01 with respect to 2P reserves. Your Company has

maintained Reserve Replacement Ratio (2P) of more

than 1 for the 17th consecutive year.

Your Company has four direct subsidiaries, namely

ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), Mangalore Refinery

and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL), Hindustan

Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) and Petronet

MHB Limited (PMHBL).

Your Company also has nine Associates/ Joint

Ventures, namely ONGC Petro additions Limited

(OPaL), ONGC Tripura Power Company Limited

(OTPC), ONGC TERI Biotech Limited (OTBL), Dahej

SEZ Limited (DSL), Mangalore SEZ Limited (MSEZL),

letter dated May 25, 2017, June 4, 2018 and

January 14, 2019 had asked contractor for re-

casting of accounts of the PMT JV and for remitting

the respective PI share of balance dues including

interest till the date of remittance. As the Company

is not a party to the arbitration, the details of the

proceedings of arbitration and copy of the order of

English Commercial Court (London High Court) are

not available with the company. The Company has

informed that the English Court has delivered its final

verdict on May 2, 2018 following which the Arbitral

Tribunal re-considered some of its earlier findings

from the 2016 FPA (Revised Award). The Government

of India and JV Partners have challenged parts of the

Revised Award before English court. On February 12,

2020, the English Court passed a verdict favouring

the challenges made by BGEPIL and RIL and also

remitted the matter in the Revised Award back to

Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. In January 2021,

the Tribunal issued a verdict favouring BGEPIL/RIL on

the remitted matter, which has been challenged by

the GOI before the English Court. The English Court

had delivered its verdict on June 9, 2022 dismissing

the challenge made by GOI. The GOI filed an appeal

against the English Court verdict of June 9, 2022 that

was rejected by the English courts in August 2022.

Based on the information shared by BGEPIL, the GOI

has also filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble

Delhi High Court seeking enforcement and execution

of the October 12, 2016 FPA. BGEPIL / RIL contend

that GOI’s execution petition is not maintainable and

have opposed the reliefs sought by the GOI under

the said petition. The hearings in the matter before

the Hon’ble Delhi High Court concluded on August 4,

2022 and orders are awaited.

Pending finalization of the decision of the Arbitration

Tribunal, the Company has indicated in their letters

to DGH that the final recasting of the accounts is

premature and the issues raised by DGH may be

kept in abeyance and therefore no provision for the

demand raised by DGH, amounting to USD 1,624.05

Million equivalent to `133,415.71 Million has been

considered necessary and has been treated as

contingent liability.

Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements

is not modified in respect of these matters.

4. Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our

professional judgment, were of most significance in

our audit of these Standalone Financial Statements

of the current period. These matters were addressed

in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial

Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion

Company as licensee and the JO Partners’ share of

Royalty was recoverable through revenue from Sale

of Crude Oil and Gas. Accordingly, an amount of

`15,583.41 Million outstanding from JV Partners has

been included in the revenue up to March 31, 2023.

46.1.8 The primary period of twenty five years of the

Production Sharing Contract (PSC) of the Block RJ-

ON-90/1 expired on May 14, 2020. During the year an

Addendum No. 2 to PSC was executed on October

27, 2022 extending the term of the PSC of the block

for a period of 10 years retrospectively w.e.f. May 15,

2020.

Government of India demanded payment of Additional

Profit Petroleum of USD 654.83 Million (`53,794.28

Million) in respect of the Block RJ-ON-90/1 against the

audit exceptions as per the PSC provisions. The other

Partners in the JO have disputed the demand with a

Notice of Arbitration dated May 14, 2020 against the:

letter dated April 4, 2017 demanded `645.24

Million towards liquidated damages on account of

non-completion of Minimum Work Program within

fixed time frame for Shale Gas & Oil exploration

& exploitation. The Company in its reply to the

demand raised informed that Shale Gas Policy 2013 /

Permission: letter of the Govt. of India for grant of Shale

Gas and Oil exploration/exploitation rights at para V

of section-I stipulates withdrawal from shale gas and

oil operations after G&G studies, without LD, in case

the assessment does not establish shale gas and oil

resources. Based on above, liquidated damages is

not applicable as assessment through G&G studies

in different basins has not established shale gas and

oil resources. The same is further reiterated in the

Policy Framework for Exploration and Exploitation

of Unconventional Hydrocarbons dated August

08, 2018 issued by the Government of India which

states that in nomination blocks given to National

Oil Companies (NOCs), the NOCs will be allowed to

explore and exploit all types of hydrocarbons under

the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act 1948

and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules , 1959 as

per existing fiscal and contractual terms of PEL/PML

granted under nomination acreages. The shale gas

policy of 2013 will be deemed to be modified and /or

extended to that extent.

The matter was discussed and followed up in

various meetings with DGH / MoPNG. The Company

again vide its letter dated August 30, 2022 to DGH

submitted that no LD is applicable in the instant case

and on the basis of this submission, the matter be

considered as closed and no further communication

/ demand has been received from DGH after the said

submissions and accordingly no liability /contingent

liability is recognised / disclosed.

46.1.16 During the financial year 2020-21,

letter dated July 4, 2011, had directed the Company

not to participate in the Arbitration initiated by the JV

Partners (BGEPIL & RIL). MoP&NG has also stated

that the Arbitral Award would be applicable to the

Company also as a constituent of the Contract for

both the PSCs.

Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), vide: letter dated May 25, 2017 had informed the Company

that on October 12, 2016, a Final Partial Award (FPA)

was pronounced by the Tribunal in the said arbitrations.

As informed by BGEPIL that on issues relating to

the aforesaid disputes, additional Audit Award on

January 11, 2018, Agreement Case Award on October

1, 2018 and Jurisdictional Award on March 12, 2019

were pronounced. However, the details of proceedings

of the FPA and other Orders are not available with the

Company. DGH, vide their letters dated May 25, 2017

and June 4, 2018, marked to the Contractors, had

directed the payment of differential Government of

India share of Profit Petroleum and Royalty alleged to

be payable by Contractors pursuant to Government’s

interpretation of the FPA (40% share of the Company

amounting to USD 1,624.05 Million, including interest

up to November 30, 2016) equivalent to `133,415.71

Million (March 31, 2022: `123,021.60 Million). In

response to the letters of DGH, the JV partners (with

a copy marked to all Joint Venture Partners) had

stated that demand of DGH was premature as the

FPA did not make any money award in favour of

Government of India, since quantification of liabilities

were to be determined during the final proceedings

of the arbitration. Further the award had also been

challenged before the English Commercial Court

(London High Court). Based on the above facts,

the Company had also responded to the letters of

DGH stating that pending finality of the order, the

amount due and payable by the Company was not

quantifiable. In view of the Company, if any changes

are approved for increase in the Cost Recovery Limit

(CRL) by the Arbitral Tribunal as per the terms of the

PSCs the liability to Government of India (GOI) would

potentially reduce.

The English Court has delivered its final verdict on

May 2, 2018 following which the Arbitral Tribunal re-

considered some of its earlier findings from the 2016

FPA (Revised Award). The GOI and JV Partners have

challenged parts of the Revised Award before English

Court. On February 12, 2020, the English Court passed

a verdict favouring the challenges made by BGEPIL

and RIL and also remitted the matter in the Revised

Award back to Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration.

BGEPIL has informed that the Tribunal issued a

verdict in January 2021, favouring BGEPIL/RIL on the

remitted matter, which was challenged by the GOI

before the English Court. The English Court delivered

its verdict on June 9, 2022 dismissing the GoI’s

challenges and upholding the Revised Agreements

Award. The GOI filed an appeal against the English

Court verdict of June 9, 2022 that was rejected by the

English courts in August 2022.

Based on the information shared by BGEPIL, GOI

has also filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble

Delhi High Court seeking enforcement and execution

of the October 12, 2016 FPA. In January 2018, the

Company along with the JV partners had filed an

application with MC for increase in CRL in terms of

the PSCs. BGEPIL / RIL contend that GOI’s execution

petition is not maintainable and have opposed the

reliefs sought by the GOI under the said petition. The

hearings in the matter before the Hon’ble Delhi High

Court concluded on August 4, 2022. Final orders on

the reliefs sought by the GOI is awaited.

The application has been rejected by MC. Pursuant

to the rejection, the JV partners have filed a claim with

Arbitral Tribunal. One of the JV partners has further

informed the Company that the hearing before the

Arbitral Tribunal has been partially heard during the

quarter of October – December 2021. Substantial

hearings have taken place since 2021 in respect of

the Cost Recovery Limit increase applications filed by

BGEPIL & RIL and an award is presently expected by

Q4 2023-24 i.e. Jan – March 2024.

DGH vide letter dated January 14, 2019 has advised

to the contractors to re-cast the accounts for Panna-

Mukta and Mid and South Tapti Fields for the year

2017-18. Pending finalization of the decision of the

Arbitral Tribunal, the JV partners and the Company

had indicated in their letters to DGH that the final

recasting of the accounts was premature and thus

the issues raised by DGH may be kept in abeyance.

During the financial year 2010-11, the Oil Marketing

Companies, nominees of the GOI recovered USD

80.18 Million (Share of the Company USD 32.07

Million equivalent to `2,634.55 Million (March 31,

2022: `2,429.30 Million)) as per directives of GoI in

respect of Joint Operation - Panna Mukta and Tapti

Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs). The recovery

is towards certain observations raised by auditors

appointed by DGH under the two PSCs for the period

2002-03 to 2005-06 in respect of cost and profit

petroleum share payable to GOI (refer Note no. 15.1).

Pending finality by Arbitration Tribunal on various

letter dated December, 31, 2014, that

royalty should not be taken as a basis for fixation of

Stamp Duty to the mining leases granted under the

ORD Act read with PNG Rules.

Considering the time taken to resolve the matter,

State Government of Assam has formulated a way

out so that the lease may be signed. The Director,

Directorate of Geology and Mines, had obtained

the approval of the Additional Chief Secretary to the

State Government of Assam vide: letter dated June

10, 2021 to allow for signing the deeds for petroleum

Mining Lease (PML) with companies on the basis of

dead rent as was done earlier with the insertion of

clause in the deed that balance amount of stamp duty

which will accrue after finalization of the method of

calculating stamp duty shall have to be paid by the

respective companies. The Company has been asked

by the

letter dated 25 May 2017, 4 June

2018 and 14 January 2019 had asked contractor for

re-casting of accounts of the PMT JV and for remitting

the respective PI share of balance dues including

interest till the date of remittance. As the Holding

Company is not a party to the arbitration, the details

of the proceedings of arbitration and copy of the order

of English Commercial Court (London High Court) are

not available with the Holding Company. The Holding

Company has informed that the English Court has

delivered its final verdict on 2 May 2018 following

which the Arbitral Tribunal re-considered some of its

earlier findings from the 2016 FPA (Revised Award).

The Government of India and JV Partners have

challenged parts of the Revised Award before English

court. On 12 February 2020, the English Court passed

a verdict favouring the challenges made by BGEPIL

and RIL and also remitted the matter in the Revised

Award back to Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. In

January 2021, the Tribunal issued a verdict favouring

BGEPIL/RIL on the remitted matter, which has been

challenged by the GOI before the English Court. The

English Court had delivered its verdict on 9 June 2022

dismissing the challenge made by GOI. The GOI

filed an appeal against the English Court verdict of 9

June 2022 that was rejected by the English courts in

August 2022.

Based on the information shared by BGEPIL, the GOI

has also filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble

Delhi High Court seeking enforcement and execution

of the October 12, 2016 FPA. BGEPIL / RIL contend

that GOI’s execution petition is not maintainable and

have opposed the reliefs sought by the GOI under

the said petition. The hearings in the matter before

the Hon’ble Delhi High Court concluded on August 4,

2022, and orders are awaited.

Pending finalization of the decision of the Arbitration

Tribunal, the Holding Company has indicated in their

letters to DGH that the final recasting of the accounts

is premature, and the issues raised by DGH may be

kept in abeyance and therefore no provision for the

demand raised by DGH, amounting to USD 1,624.05

Million equivalent to `133,415.71 Million has been

considered necessary and has been treated as

contingent liability.:

letter dated May 31, 2019

assigned the Panna-Mukta fields w.e.f. December

22, 2019 on nomination basis to the Company on

expiry of present PSC without any cost to ensure

continuity of operation. Being a non-monetary grant,

the Company has recorded these assets and grant at

a nominal value.

Subsequent to assignment of Panna-Mukta field to

the Company GoI has directed JV partners of the PMT

(Panna Mukta & Tapti) field to transfer the existing

SRF fund maintained for decommissioning obligation

for Tapti Part A facility and Panna Mukta fields to the

Company along with full financial and physical liability

of site restoration and decommissioning of Panna

Mukta fields and Tapti Part A facilities. Accordingly,

in the year 2019-20 the Company received SRF fund

of $ 33.81 Million (`2,402.18 Million) for Tapti Part-A

facilities and $ 598.24 Million (`42,506.87 Million) for

Panna Mukta fields from JV partners (including the

Company share of 40% in the fields) and acquired

the corresponding decommissioning obligation with

the conditions that Company will maintain separate

dedicated SRF accounts under Site Restoration

Fund scheme, 1999 and extent guidelines of SRF, the

Company will not utilise the fund of dedicated SRF

fund of Panna- Mukta Fields and Tapti Part-A facilities

for any other purpose, other than one defined under

SRF scheme/guidelines. Company shall periodically

carry out the re-estimation of cost of decommissioning

of Panna- Mukta Fields and Tapti Part-A facilities

as per existing Company policy and contribute to

SRF account as per Company policy in nomination

fields. In case, final actual cost of decommissioning

of facilities of Panna-Mukta fields at the time of

physical decommissioning is higher than approved

decommissioning cost plus the accumulated amount,

Company will contribute the additional amount

required for decommissioning. However, in case the

actual cost at the time of decommissioning is less

than the accumulated amount, the balance amount

will be transferred to the Government of India. The

Company is mandated to pay Rupee one per annum

as rental charges to Government of India for use of

Tapti A facilities till its abandonment.

6.3 Union Cabinet, Government of India in its meeting

held on 19 February 2019, on reforms in Exploration

and Licensing Policy for enhancing domestic

exploration and production of oil and gas, directed to

bid out identified marginal nomination fields operated

by National Oil Companies. In pursuance to decision

of Union Cabinet, the Company offered 64 such

marginal fields which are clustered geographically in

17 contract areas for bidding under the supervision of

Directorate General of Hydrocarbons. During the year

2021-22 in the 1st Bid round the Company issued

notice of award (NOA) for 49 marginal fields covering

13 contract areas through the bidding process.

Contracts were signed for production enhancement

for 21 marginal fields and NOA of 28 fields were

cancelled due to non-submission of performance

bank guarantee by the successful bidders.For bid

out of balance 43 marginal nomination fields in 11

letter dated April 4, 2017 demanded `645.24 Million

towards liquidated damages on account of non-completion

of Minimum Work Program within fixed time frame for Shale

Gas & Oil exploration & exploitation. The Company in its

reply to the demand raised informed that Shale Gas Policy

2013 / Permission: letter of the Govt. of India for grant of

Shale Gas and Oil exploration/exploitation rights at para

V of section-I stipulates withdrawal from shale gas and

oil operations after G&G studies, without LD, in case the

assessment does not establish shale gas and oil resources.

Based on above, liquidated damages is not applicable as

assessment through G&G studies in different basins has

not established shale gas and oil resources. The same is

further reiterated in the Policy Framework for Exploration and

Exploitation of Unconventional Hydrocarbons dated August

08, 2018 issued by the Government of India which states

that in nomination blocks given to National Oil Companies

(NOCs), the NOCs will be allowed to explore and exploit all

types of hydrocarbons under the Oilfields (Regulation and

Development) Act 1948 and the Petroleum and Natural Gas

Rules , 1959 as per existing fiscal and contractual terms of

PEL/PML granted under nomination acreages. The shale

gas policy of 2013 will be deemed to be modified and /or

extended to that extent.

The matter was discussed and followed up in various

meetings with DGH / MoPNG. The Company again vide its

letter dated August 30, 2022 to DGH submitted that no LD

letter dated 09th Sep 2021 in

respect of the block KG-OSN-2001/3 and 26th Oct 2021

in respect of the block CB-OS/2 and stated that demand

raised by DGH is not tenable in terms of various provisions

of Production Sharing Contract (PSC) read with statutory

provisions of Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act

1948 (ORD Act) & Petroleum & Natural Gas (PNG Rules)

Rules, 2003 and notifications issued thereunder. As per

the ORD Act royalty is payable at the prescribed rate of the

value obtained at well head. It also provides that the post

wellhead cost/ well head price shall be determined based

on actual post well head expenditure reported in previous

year’s audited accounts. Further as per the provisions of the

Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in respect of the block

KG-OSN-2001/3, Companies (Lessee) shall be required to

pay royalty to the Government (Lessor) at the prescribed

rate of the well-head value of Crude Oil and Natural Gas.

The Petroleum Mining Lease also provides that the lessee is

subject to ORD Act, 1948 (53 of 1948) and the P&NG Rules,

1959. It further provides that the royalty shall be payable

by the lessee as per the terms of any contract entered into

between the lessee and the Government in respect of the

said block/ contract area or at such rates as may be fixed

by the Government of India from time to time.

During the financial year 2022-23, DGH vide its: letter dated

August 5, 2022 has raised a revised demand of `505.37

Million towards unpaid/short payment of Royalty upto

March 31, 2022 and penal interest upto June 30, 2022 for

block KG-OSN-2001/3. DGH has also vide letter dated

letter dated July 4, 2011, had directed the Company

not to participate in the Arbitration initiated by the JV

Partners (BGEPIL & RIL). MoP&NG has also stated that the

Arbitral Award would be applicable to the Company also as

a constituent of the Contract for both the PSCs.

Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), vide: letter dated

May 25, 2017 had informed the Company that on October

12, 2016, a Final Partial Award (FPA) was pronounced by

the Tribunal in the said arbitrations. As informed by BGEPIL

that on issues relating to the aforesaid disputes, additional

Audit Award on January 11, 2018, Agreement Case Award

on October 1, 2018 and Jurisdictional Award on March 12,

2019 were pronounced. However, the details of proceedings

of the FPA and other Orders are not available with the

Company. DGH, vide their letters dated May 25, 2017 and

June 4, 2018, marked to the Contractors, had directed the

payment of differential Government of India share of Profit

Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be payable by Contractors

pursuant to Government’s interpretation of the FPA (40%

share of the Company amounting to USD 1,624.05 Million,

including interest up to November 30, 2016) equivalent to

`133,415.71 Million (March 31, 2022: `123,021.60 Million).

In response to the letters of DGH, the JV partners (with a

copy marked to all Joint Venture Partners) had stated that

demand of DGH was premature as the FPA did not make

any money award in favour of Government of India, since

quantification of liabilities were to be determined during

the final proceedings of the arbitration. Further the award

had also been challenged before the English Commercial

Court (London High Court). Based on the above facts, the

Company had also responded to the letters of DGH stating

that pending finality of the order, the amount due and

payable by the Company was not quantifiable. In view of

the Company, if any changes are approved for increase in

the Cost Recovery Limit (CRL) by the Arbitral Tribunal as per

the terms of the PSCs the liability to Government of India

(GOI) would potentially reduce.

The English Court has delivered its final verdict on May 2,

2018 following which the Arbitral Tribunal re-considered

some of its earlier findings from the 2016 FPA (Revised

Award). The GOI and JV Partners have challenged

parts of the Revised Award before English Court. On

12 February 2020, the English Court passed a verdict

favouring the challenges made by BGEPIL and RIL and

also remitted the matter in the Revised Award back to

Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. BGEPIL has informed

that the Tribunal issued a verdict in January 2021, favouring

BGEPIL/RIL on the remitted matter, which was challenged

by the GOI before the English Court. The English Court

delivered its verdict on 9 June 2022 dismissing the

GoI’s challenges and upholding the Revised Agreements

Award. The GOI filed an appeal against the English Court

verdict of 9 June 2022 that was rejected by the English

courts in August 2022.

Based on the information shared by BGEPIL, GOI has also

filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High

Court seeking enforcement and execution of the October

12, 2016 FPA. In January 2018, the Company along with the

JV partners had filed an application with MC for increase in

CRL in terms of the PSCs. BGEPIL / RIL contend that GOI’s

execution petition is not maintainable and have opposed

the reliefs sought by the GOI under the said petition. The

hearings in the matter before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court

concluded on August 4, 2022. Final orders on the reliefs

sought by the GOI is awaited.

The application has been rejected by MC. Pursuant to the

rejection, the JV partners have filed a claim with Arbitral

Tribunal. One of the JV partners has further informed the

Company that the hearing before the Arbitral Tribunal

has been partially heard during the quarter of October –

December 2021. Substantial hearings have taken place

since 2021 in respect of the Cost Recovery Limit increase

applications filed by BGEPIL & RIL and an award is presently

expected by Q4 2023-24 i.e. Jan – March 2024.

DGH vide letter dated January 14, 2019 has advised to the

contractors to re-cast the accounts for Panna-Mukta and

Mid and South Tapti Fields for the year 2017-18. Pending

finalization of the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, the JV

partners and the Company had indicated in their letters to

DGH that the final recasting of the accounts was premature

and thus the issues raised by DGH may be kept in abeyance.

During the financial year 2010-11, the Oil Marketing

Companies, nominees of the GOI recovered USD 80.18

Million (Share of the Company USD 32.07 Million equivalent

to `2,634.55 Million (March 31, 2022: `2,429.30 Million) as

per directives of GoI in respect of Joint Operation - Panna

Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs). The

recovery is towards certain observations raised by auditors

appointed by DGH under the two PSCs for the period 2002-

03 to 2005-06 in respect of cost and profit petroleum share

payable to GOI.

Pending finality by Arbitration Tribunal on various issues

raised above, re-casting of the financial statements and

final quantification of liabilities, no provision has been

accounted in the financial statements. The demand raised

by DGH, amounting to USD 1,624.05 Million equivalent

to `133,415.71 Million @ `82.15 i.e. closing rate as on

31.03.2023 (March 31, 2022: `123,021.60 Million) has been

considered as contingent liability.

The Company’s share of USD 32.07 Million `2,634.55 Million

@ `82.15 i.e. closing rate as on March 31, 2023 (March

31, 2022: `2,429.30 Million) recovered by Government of

India has been disclosed under Note No.19 in the financial

statements.

58.1.5 The Company is operating various Petroleum Mining

Leases (PML) granted by the State Government (s) after

initial clearance from the Government of India (GoI). The

grant of oil mining lease is regulated and governed by the

provisions of the Oilfields [Regulation and Development]

letter dated December, 31,

2014, that royalty should not be taken as a basis for fixation

of Stamp Duty to the mining leases granted under the ORD

Act read with PNG Rules.

Considering the time taken to resolve the matter, State

Government of Assam has formulated a way out so that the

lease may be signed. The Director, Directorate of Geology

and Mines, had obtained the approval of the Additional

Chief Secretary to the State Government of Assam vide: letter dated June 10, 2021 to allow for signing the deeds for

petroleum Mining Lease (PML) with companies on the basis

of dead rent as was done earlier with the insertion of clause

in the deed that balance amount of stamp duty which will

accrue after finalization of the method of calculating stamp

duty shall have to be paid by the respective companies.

The Company has been asked by the

letter dated 15th October 2013

and imposed liquidated damages of USD 9.143 Million vide: letter dated 6thFeb 2015 as per Article 5.6 of PSC. Company

has kept ABG on notice that it is their responsibility to pay

the entire quantum of liquidated damages, including the

share of Company. If Company is compelled to pay its share

of liquidated damages by the GOI, and if such payment is

made, then company will have to claim this money from

ABG.

Company had invoked arbitration against ABG in the matter

on 10th October 2016. After appointment of arbitrator on

behalf of ABG by Delhi High Court Order dated 22nd

September 2017, three-member tribunal had been
