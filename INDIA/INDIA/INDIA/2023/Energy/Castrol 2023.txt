Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR)

Guided by the overarching vision of bp’s sustainability framework1, we at Castrol embarked on our sustainability journey with

the launch of PATH360, Castrol’s sustainability programme, in 2021. PATH360 focuses on saving waste, reducing carbon, and

improving people’s lives all with the aim of becoming net zero by 2050 or sooner.

At Castrol India (CIL), we challenge the norms, striving to optimize energy consumption and fully integrate renewable energy

alternatives into our operations. Further, we have identified key focus areas across the guiding principles of PATH360 to set

targets and detail initiatives for achieving our aims. These focus areas constitute our ESG (Environment, Social and Governance)

strategy/framework to guide our future actions.

Furthermore, our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) adheres to the National Guidelines on Responsible

Business Conduct (NGRBC) issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in July 2023. This report is compiled as per the amended

Notes to the Financial Statements

for the year ended December 31, 2023

1.

Corporate information

Castrol India Limited (the ‘Company’) is a public limited

Company incorporated in India with its registered office

at Technopolis Knowledge Park, Mahakali Caves Road,

Chakala, Andheri (East), Mumbai–400 093. The equity

shares of the Company are listed on two recognised

stock exchanges in India. The Company is principally

engaged in the business of manufacturing & marketing

of automotive and industrial lubricants and related

services.

2.

Significant accounting policies

2.1. Basis of preparation

The Statement of Compliance with Indian Accounting

Standards (Ind AS): The financial statements have been

prepared in accordance with Ind AS notified under

the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015 as amended and notified under Section 133 of

the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) and other relevant

provisions of the Act and other accounting principles

generally accepted in India.

Basis of measurement

These financial statements have been prepared on

the historical cost basis except for certain financial

instruments that are measured at fair values at the end

of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting

policies below.

Historical Cost: Assets are recorded at the amount of

cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the

other consideration given to acquire them at the time of

their acquisition. Liabilities are recorded at the amount

of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation, or in

some circumstances (for example, income taxes), at the

amounts of cash or cash equivalents expected to be paid

to satisfy the liability in the normal course of business.

2.2. Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements requires

management to make judgments, estimates and

assumptions in the application of accounting policies

that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,

income and expenses. Actual results may differ from

these estimates. Continuous evaluation is done on

the estimation and judgments based on historical

experience and other factors, including expectations

of future events that are believed to be reasonable.

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised

prospectively.

2.3. Critical

accounting

estimates,

judgments

and

assumptions

A.

Useful lives and residual values of property, plant

and equipment

Property, plant and equipment represent a material

portion of the Company’s asset base. The periodic

charge of depreciation is derived after estimating

useful life of an asset and expected residual value

at the end of its useful life. The useful lives and

residual values of assets are estimated by the

management at the time the asset is acquired and

reviewed periodically, including at each financial

year end. The lives are based on various external

and internal factors including historical experience,

relative efficiency and operating costs and change

in technology.

B.

Income taxes

The Company’s tax jurisdiction is India. Significant

judgments are involved in determining the

provision for income taxes including amounts to

be recovered or paid for uncertain tax positions.

Management judgment is required to determine

the amount of deferred tax assets that can be

recognised, based upon the likely timing and the

level of future taxable profits.

C.

Defined benefit obligations

Defined benefit obligations are measured at fair

value for financial reporting purposes. Fair value

determined by actuary is based on actuarial

assumptions. Management judgement is required

to determine such actuarial assumptions. Such

assumptions are reviewed annually using the best

information available with the Management.

D.

Contingencies

In the normal course of business, contingent

liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims

against the Company. Management judgment

is required to determine the potential liabilities

that are possible or remote but not probable of

crystalizing or cannot be measured with sufficient

reliability. Such liabilities are disclosed in the notes

as contingent liabilities, unless the possibility of an

outflow of resources embodying economic benefits

is remote in Management’s judgment.:

Managing Director (Chief Operating Decision Maker) is accountable for leading the growth agenda for an integrated

Automotive and Industrial business.
