Dear Shareholders,

Escalated geopolitical tensions and resultant financial

volatility led to a significant surge in the prices of oil and other

commodities at the end of the previous financial year. The

prices of crude oil continued their rising trend in 2022-23, with

benchmark crude prices averaging US$ 96.2 per barrel, the

highest since 2013-14. The price volatility was substantial, with

crude prices peaking at US$ 123.7 per barrel in June 2022 and

reaching a level of US$ 78.6 per barrel by March 2023. Against

the backdrop of the increased prices and volatility of global

crude prices, India’s petroleum product consumption also hit a

new record in the financial year 2022-23, reaching the highest-

ever level of 222.3 MMT. HPCL continued to meet the nation’s

energy needs even while marketing margins were suppressed

for certain petroleum products.

I am happy to share that while navigating these challenging

environments, Gross sales of your Company registered a

growth of 24.7% in 2022-23, rising from H 3,72,642 Crore

in 2021-22 to H 4,64,684 Crore, reaching a new peak. Your

Company achieved its highest-ever annual sales of 43.45

MMT during the period, with a growth rate of 11% compared
