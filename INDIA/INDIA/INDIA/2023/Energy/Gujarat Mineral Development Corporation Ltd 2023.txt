Moving ahead, we

see revenue visibility

Increase in lignite prices continues to be

a steady contributor to our growing top

and imported coal prices, average sales

realisation has also increased per tonne.

GMDC today

Today, we are proud to be operating

5 lignite mines, located in Kutch, South

Gujarat and Bhavnagar, with estimated

reserves of 95 million tonnes. During the

year, we have worked on newly allotted

6 new lignite blocks with combined

lignite reserves of 360 Million Tonnes.

Today, we cater to nearly 25% of the total

demand of minerals in Gujarat, with a

diversiﬁed customer base comprising

small and medium-sized companies

spread across textiles, steel, cement,

power generation and various other

sectors.

The operationalisation of these 6 new

mines, with total lignite reserves of 360

million tonnes, will add to our capacity in

4-5 years. We will continue beneﬁting

from higher production, supported by

steady demand from manufacturing

industries located in Gujarat. The

increased production from these new

mines will facilitate us in catering to at

least 30-35% of total demand by

FY2025. Also, during the year, we

received permission for land acquisition
