letter dated May 30, 2018, has issued directions

to the CERC and other State regulators (SERCs) to consider

the revised emission standards as Change in Law (CIL) and

devise an appropriate regulatory mechanism to address

the impact on tariff. During financial year 2022, CERC

issued framework for computing tariff recovery to mitigate

impact of Change in Law due to implementation of new

environment norms.

In the present sector context, banks and financial institutions

are not forthcoming to finance the additional capital

expenditure arising from implementation of CAPEX to meet

new environment norms. Certainty in cost recovery on

account of additional capital and operational costs, under

concluded long-term and medium-term PPAs, is critical to

securing financing for timely completion of additional capital

expenditure.

Further, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate

Change (MoEFCC) vide its Gazette Notification dated Mar

31, 2021 categorized all TPPs with reference to its location

and revised the timelines for compliance of new emission

norms. The same has been further extended by 2 years vide

The Company proposed to develop a 7,480 MW gas-based power project to be located at Dadri, District Hapur, Uttar

Pradesh in the year 2003. The Government of Uttar Pradesh (the GoUP) in the year 2004 acquired 2,100 acres of land

land by the GoUP for the project before the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court. The Hon’ble Allahabad High Court quashed

a part of land acquisition proceedings. Subsequently, in the appeals filed by the Company and land owners against the

findings of the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held the land acquisition proceedings as lapsed

but upheld the right of the Company to recover the amount paid in any other proceeding. The Company has represented

to the GoUP seeking compensation towards cost incurred on the land acquisition as well as other incidental expenditure

thereto. Considering the above facts, the Company has classified assets related to the Dadri project under the head ‘Assets:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023:

letter dated September 06, 2011, of its decision not to pursue the project. Based on the Honorable High

Court Order dated February 07, 2013, MEGL has received ` 3,716 lakhs in the financial year ended March 31, 2013,

out of the total advance of ` 4,360 lakhs paid to the GoM for acquisition of land. The balance amount of ` 644 lakhs

receivable from the GoM is in the process of recovery. Shetkari Sangharsh Samitee has filed Special Leave Petition in

the Honorable Supreme Court of India against the Company, requesting for the stay on the Bombay High Court Order,

directing refund of MEGL deposits by the GoM.

Further MEGL had given an advance of ` 596 lakhs to the Land Owners towards direct purchase of land and has issued

legal notice for the refund of the amount paid to them. As there are no operations in MEGL as of now, the project

related asssets and liability shown as have been stated at their net realisable value or cost, whichever is less.

Considering the above facts, the Group has classified assets related to projects under head ‘Assets classified as held for

sale’ and profit/(loss) of MEGL has been classified as profit/(loss) from discontinued operations.

b)

CPPL was setting up a 6x660 MW (3,960 MW) super critical coal-fired thermal power project at Chitrangi Tehsil in

Singrauli District of Madhya Pradesh. It had received all the major clearances and approvals required for implementation

of the project. CPPL proposed to use coal for this project from the surplus coal up to 9 MTPA from the Moher, Moher-

Amlohri Extention and Chatrasal coal Blocks allocated to Sasan Power Limited, allowed by Ministry of Coal (MoC) vide

its Gazette notification No.335 dated February 17, 2010 and balance from other sources.CPPL had participated in bid

for supply of power of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited and Madhya Pradesh Power Management Limited.

Based on Hon’ble Supreme Court order dated August 25, 2014, MoC cancelled its earlier notification dated February

17, 2010 permitting use of surplus coal from Sasan UMPP for this project resulting in frustration of the bids due to non

availability of coal.

Considering the above facts, the Group has classified assets related to projects under head ‘Assets classified as held for

sale’ and profit/ (Loss) of CPPL has been classified as profit/ (Loss) from discontinued operations.

c)

The State of Rajasthan promulgated solar policy in order to promote renewable generation of electricity. RGPPL had

applied in August 2012, under Rajasthan Solar Energy Policy, 2011 – to develop a 150 MW solar PV power plant

in the state with an intention of supplying power to 3rd party/outside state consumers. Accordingly, submitted BG of

` 3,000 lakhs towards Security Deposit. However, Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation (RREC) delayed allotment of

land by almost 2 (two) years (As per policy 2011, land was to be allotted within 60 days from RREC recommendation).

Over the period of such delay in allotment of land, solar power market dynamics changed substantially. Accordingly,

RGPPL has requested Government of Rajasthan for surrender of the project due to Force Majeure events beyond its

control and requested for refund of the charges paid and return of Bank Guarantee. While we are pursuing GoR for

allowing to surrender of the project, we have also filed petition before Rajasthan High Court, Jodhpur for allowing to

surrender the project due to Force Majeure event & obtained stay on encashment of the said BG. Considering the above

facts, the Group has classified assets related to projects under head ‘Assets classified as held for sale’ and profit/ (Loss)

of RGPL has been classified as profit/ (Loss) from discontinued operations.
