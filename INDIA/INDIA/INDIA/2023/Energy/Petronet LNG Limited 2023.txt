Dear Shareholders

On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is our privilege and

honour to present the Twenty-fifth Annual Report along with

Audited Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements

and Independent Auditors’ Report thereon for the financial

year (FY) ended 31st March 2023.

Physical Performance

Terminal Operations

Like the financial year 2021-22, this financial year (2022-23)

was also an extremely challenging year for entire oil and gas

industry. While the economies were still recovering from

the aftermath of COVID-19, a new factor in the form of geo-

political disturbances emerged that caused a severe impact

on Natural Gas and LNG supplies. Besides disruptions in the

supply chain, unprecedented volatility in the prices of Natural

Gas was also witnessed. The prices, however, reflected some

decline along with increased stability in the fourth quarter.

Dahej LNG Terminal

Despite high volatility in the LNG prices and energy supply

related challenges, Dahej LNG Terminal having a name

plate capacity of 17.5 MMTPA, operated at 77.8% capacity,

achieving a throughput of 13.61 MMTPA during the FY 2022-

23, which in terms of energy, is equivalent to 703.4 TBtus.

These numbers are against a throughput of 15.32 MMTPA

(87.5%), equivalent to 792.9 TBtus achieved during the FY

2021-22.

In another significant development, the QA/QC lab of

Dahej terminal received the prestigious NABL (ISO 17025)

accreditation in August 2022, adding another feather in the

decorated cap of the terminal. ISO (17025) certification by

NABL enhances the confidence of the stakeholders in testing/

calibration reports issued by the lab. Also, the accredited labs

receive a form of international recognition, which allows

their data and results to be more readily accepted.

Kochi LNG Terminal

Kochi Terminal having a name plate capacity of 5 MMTPA,

operated at 0.93 MMTPA with a capacity utilisation of 18.6%

during FY 2022-23, as compared to 1.04 MMTPA and 20.72%

in FY 2021-22. In terms of energy, the terminal achieved a

send out of 48.2 TBtus as compared to 54.0 TBtus in FY

2021-22.

In terms of cargo handling, during the FY 2022-23, the

terminal handled 212 LNG Cargoes as compared to 232 LNG

cargoes in the previous financial year.

This year again, Dahej Terminal’s truck loading operations

demonstrated a significant increase with 6987 trucks

dispatched during FY 2022-23 as compared to 4041 trucks

during the previous year exhibiting a growth of around 73%.

The terminal achieved a record of loading 34 LNG trucks on a

single day on 17th March 2023.

Contingent Liabilities

“In the ordinary course of business, the group faces claims and assertions by various parties. The group

assesses such claims and assertions and monitors the legal environment on an ongoing basis with the

assistance of internal legal team. The group records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is

probable and capable of being estimated and discloses such matters in its financial statements, if material.

For potential losses that are considered possible, but not probable, the group provides disclosure in the

financial statements but does not record a liability in its accounts unless the loss becomes probable.

The group believes that none of the contingencies described below in respect of holding Company would have a

material adverse effect on the group’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.”

ii. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial

liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to

ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal

and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability

of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out

market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury maintains flexibility in funding

by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity position (comprising the undrawn borrowing facilities

below) and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. This is generally carried out at local level in

accordance with practice and limits set by the Group. These limits vary by location to take into account the liquidity of

the market in which the entity operates. In addition, the Group’s liquidity management policy involves projecting cash

flows in major currencies, considering the level of liquid assets necessary, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios

against internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining debt financing plans.
