Dear Shareholders,

A few months ago, I heard a new term called Permacrisis. I learnt that the

Collins dictionary had defined it as ‘An extended period of instability and

insecurity’. It also chose it as the Word for the Year 2022. Interestingly, I also

learnt that two other words that were in the running for the top spot were ‘quiet

quitting’, which meant doing the bare minimum duties at work (in rejection of

competitive careerism) and ‘vibe shift’, which meant a significant change in the

prevailing culture. What I find fascinating is that in the post-Covid world, these

words accurately summarize changes that we see happening around us.

Letter of Credit and Inland: Letter of Credit.

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and

financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified as

held for trading if these are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.

Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement

recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest

paid on the financial liability.

Fair Values are determined in the manner designed in note “3 (v)”.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations

are discharged, cancelled or have expired. An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with

substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability

and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a substantial modification of the terms of an

existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and

the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial

liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in the Statement of Profit

and Loss .

Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment

to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a

payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts

are recognised initially as a liability at fair value through profit or loss, adjusted for transaction costs

that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at

the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109

and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement

The Company enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest

rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps,

cross currency swaps, principal only swap and coupon only swap. Derivatives are initially measured

at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes

therein are generally recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as Foreign Exchange (Gain) / Loss

except those relating to borrowings, which are separately classified under Finance Cost as (Gain) /

letter

dated 16th December, 2022

from Senior Deputy Revenue

Officer, Khavda. Execution of

the Lease Agreement is under

process with competent state

level authority and Lease

Agreement execution will be
