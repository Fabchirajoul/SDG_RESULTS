Dear Shareholders,

It is my privilege to present to you the

Integrated Annual Report of your Company for

2022-23. It captures the essence of a year that

reflects the milestones and values that define

IndianOil, and how it has emerged as the

harbinger of India’s energy transition journey.

I feel proud that our dedicated team has

consistently delivered outstanding results to

enhance shareholders’ value. Let me reiterate

that we remain committed to maintaining the

highest standards of corporate governance,

transparency, and accountability, ensuring

that the interests of our stakeholders are

safeguarded at every step.

I am happy to share that your Company’s

performance in 2022-23 was indeed stellar

across all operational fronts. During the year,

your Company registered its highest-ever

Revenue from Operations, at H9,34,953 Crore

(Rupees Nine Lakh Thirty-Four Thousand

Nine Hundred and Fifty-Three Crore). We

also notched up a net profit of H8,242 Crore

(Rupees Eight Thousand Two hundred and

Forty-Two Crore), that underscores the

inherent resilience that empowers us to rise

above global challenges and make a mark.

We also achieved the highest ever sales

volume of 95.714 Million Metric Tonnes of

products, cementing our leadership position

in the business. Honours also rolled in as your

Company made its mark among the ‘Top 10

Strongest Oil and Gas Brands’ worldwide

(Brand Finance Plc 2022 listing) and was

also named as the ‘Most Loved Non-FMCG

Brand’ by Kantar Brandz (2022).

It was also a year of shining milestones

like silver jubilee celebrations of Panipat

Refinery & Petrochemical Complex, and

the Pipelines Division, golden jubilee of

Bongaigaon Refinery and the diamond jubilee

of Guwahati Refinery.

Values that Steer India’s Energy

Vision

I strongly believe that organisational

success endures only when it is backed by

an unwavering commitment to values that

shine above business dimensions. The above

numbers, milestones and accolades were

delivered by our super-motivated energy

soldiers, demonstrating the tenet of ‘Pehle

Indian Phir Oil’ or Nation before business, in: letter and spirit. Beyond our much-celebrated

core values of Care, Innovation, Passion, and

Trust, the spirit of ‘Nation-First’ is infused

in our DNA and has turned your Company

into the force it is today. Thus, in a natural

progression, we have added another core

value, ‘Nation-First,’ to our existing values. To

reiterate and reaffirm our commitment to our

Values, the first Values Day was celebrated

on June 30, 2023. This marks the landmark

day in 1959, when Indian Oil Company Ltd.,

the precursor to Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.,

was incorporated.

The journey of over six decades of energising

India has been deeply fulfilling. We are geared

to catalyse the country’s growth trajectory,

as the energy custodians, and the architects

of a brighter tomorrow. In specific terms

your Company, has a distinct vision to drive

India’s energy destiny. Currently, we have

a 9% share in India’s energy pie, and we

intend to increase our contribution to around

1/8th or 12.5% by 2050. There is a concrete

action plan to get there and establish your

Company as a 360-degree energy company.

The blueprint encompasses leveraging varied

pathways to fulfil the rapidly growing energy

demand of an ascendant India.

Taking on the green mantle

Under India’s G20 Presidency, ‘ensuring

universal energy access and just, affordable,

and inclusive energy transitions’ is a key

priority, that echoes the need for striking a

strategic balance while driving accelerated,

inclusive, and resilient growth in the energy

sector.

Beyond fuelling, we aspire to be the vitalising

force in greening an ascendant nation. India’s

resolve to achieve the Net-Zero Goal by 2070,

defines this ‘New India’, that is ambitious,

socially empathetic, and environmentally

sensitive. Aligning with these national targets,

during the last Annual General Meeting, your

Company committed itself to achieving Net-

Zero operational emissions by 2046, aiming

to mitigate both Scope 1 & 2 emissions.

This declaration is a defining moment in the

history of your Company that demonstrates

its firm resolve of leading India’s energy

transition journey from the front. We already

have a well-crafted blueprint in place with

a multi-pronged approach to gradually take

us towards the Net-Zero destination with

an investment of around USD 30 Billion

till 2046. The various emission mitigation

pathways such as green hydrogen, biofuels,

renewables, carbon offsetting, and Carbon

Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) are

already underway to steer the green journey.

Powering Progress

While steering India’s green agenda, I

must underline, that given India’s progress

trajectory and geopolitical realities, it is

imperative to strengthen our focus on the

traditional business.

The country’s energy demand is all set to go

up as the Indian economy is pacing ahead,

aiming for the USD 5 Trillion mark by 2025

and USD 10 Trillion by 2030. In fact, the

tumultuous geopolitical events that unfolded

in 2022, led to the developed economies

rearranging their energy baskets and lean

towards conventional fuels. Let me assure

you that we are focused on accelerating the

traditional energy avenues, while shaping

the green energy vision. Our physical

performance of 2022-23 demonstrates the

preparedness to cater to the rising demand,

efficiently and sustainably.

IndianOil made its mark among the

‘Top 10 Strongest Oil and Gas Brands’

worldwide (Brand Finance Plc 2022

listing) and was also named as the

‘Most Loved Non-FMCG Brand’ by

Kantar Brandz (2022).

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is my privilege to present

the 64th Annual Report and the 6th Integrated Annual Report of the

Company for the Financial Year ended March 31, 2023, along with

the Audited Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements

and Auditor’s Report thereon.

The year 2022-23 was excellent for the Company as it

demonstrated remarkable resilience to achieve significant

milestones in operational performance, despite various challenges.

Your Company ensured accelerating the progress of the Indian

economy, which was amongst the fastest growing economies

in 2022-23. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine

continues to have significant ramifications, not just for the two

countries involved but also for the global economy. Despite the

global energy sector experiencing waves of volatility, IndianOil

remained committed to fueling the nation with excellence.
