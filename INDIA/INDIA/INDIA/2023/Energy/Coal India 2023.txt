Integrated Annual Report 2022-23:

Dear Stakeholders,

As we enter another year filled with

challenges and opportunities, I am

pleased to share with you our progress,

achievements, and vision for the future.

Over the years, we have played a pivotal

role in fueling the growth of the nation's

economy by ensuring a steady supply of

coal, which is the backbone of our energy

sector. Our commitment to excellence,

sustainability, and innovation has been

instrumental in shaping our journey and

driving positive changes in the industry.

I would like to highlight our key

accomplishments, the steps we have

taken to ensure sustainable growth,

and our dedication to the well-being

of our stakeholders, environment, and

communities.

1. Coal and Coal India Limited

in India’s Energy Canvas

•

India’s

energy

consumption

has more than doubled since

2000

propelled

by

intensified

industrialisation and urbanisation.

The need for energy continues to

expand. It is becoming increasingly

evident that no single source of

energy can shoulder the entire

demand and it has to be a synergy

of all sources. Yet, ‘Coal’ remains

the country’s energy spearhead

meeting more than half of the

primary commercial energy despite

the

renewable

energy

sources

steadily gaining ascendancy. The

dependence on coal is unlikely to

diminish soon and its dominance

will continue for two decades at the

least.

•

From an environmental point of

view increase of renewable energy

sources in the country’s energy

basket is certainly well aspired. But

the big question is whether they will

be able to supplant coal at this point

of time. Solar and wind are big bets

and leading the race. Green and

blue hydrogen are getting a keen

focus from the country’s planners,

but pricing will be a challenge to

their economic viability.

•

The

country’s

total

electricity

generation

during

2022-23,

including renewables was 1624.16

Billion Units (BU) compared to

1491.86 BU generated in 2021-22.

The generation growth of 8.87%

during the year was a 13-year

high, which is a testament to the

country’s swelling energy appetite.

•

Of this total, coal-based generation

accounted for 70.6% or 1145.86

BU, with 10% growth over the

preceding year.

•

Though renewable sources have

grown by a robust 19% in FY 22-23

over FY’22, their contribution in the

overall generation was only 12.5%

at 203.36 BU. In other words,

renewables trail coal by 5.6 times.

This

amplifies

the

importance

of coal’s role and the need for a

balanced energy transition from

coal to renewables.

•

Additionally, coal stokes many

non-power industries as well viz.

steel, cement, fertilisers, sponge

iron, aluminium and a host of other

industries.

•

With

coal

commanding

such

prominence in the Indian energy

sector, Coal India Limited leads

the

country’s

coal

production

contributing to around 79% of

the nation’s entire coal output.

Your Company is committed to

increasing

its

production

and

supplies to the mandated levels to

ensure the country gets power at

reasonable price points.

•

During the last five years, Coal

India’s production grew by 24% to

703.20 MT in FY 22-23 from 567.37

MT in FY 2018.

•

In a country where 70.6% of the

total electricity generation is coal

-based, your Company virtually

empowers

the

nation’s

power

sector. CIL’s supplies to power

sector comprised 84% of its entire

despatch during FY 22-23.

•

Coal based electricity generation,

including

imported

coal,

was

1145.86 BU during 2022-23. The

generation through domestic coal

sources was 1105.25 BU or 96.5%

with the major portion of coal

supplied by your Company.

•

CIL is also one of the largest

contributors to the government ex-

chequer – both Central and State

– and also plays a crucial role in

country’s social fabric touching the

lives of countrymen in more ways

than one under its corporate social

responsibility umbrella.

•

Coal India supplies its coal to

the Indian consumers at highly

competitive costs compared to

international coal prices.

•

Despite the increase in various

input

costs,

especially

diesel

and explosives, your Company

still sustained an all-time record

profitability registering 61% growth

in PBT and 62% growth in PAT

compared to FY 21-22.

2. A Year of record highs

•

Shattering the previous records,

your Company’s vital performance

parameters like production, over

burden removal (OBR), coal off-

take, supplies to the power plants

of the country, Net Sales, PBT and

PAT have peaked to a remarkable

all-time high.

•

In a unified concerted effort, all

subsidiaries of CIL have chipped in

with their best performance to date

by achieving growth in production

and OBR.

•

Officials at all levels of hierarchy

right from CMDs of CIL’s subsidiary

companies down to GMs, Area

Managers have donned leadership

roles in keeping the spirit up

CIL HQ obtained re-certification of ISO 9001:2015, ISO

14001:2015 and ISO 50001:2018 for Quality Management,

Environment Management and Energy Management

System respectively from Bureau of Indian Standards

(BIS) in 2022 with validity upto Oct,2025. As on 31st March

CMPDI HQ and its seven RIs are certified for ISO 9001:2015.

Moreover, CMPDIL HQ, Ranchi has been certified with ISO

37001:2016 (Anti-Bribery Management System).

12.2 Pollution Control Measures and their Efficacy:

CIL is committed to protect environment by practicing

and following sustainable mining practices right from mine

planning stage. Various pollution control measures and

initiatives are being taken up concurrently with mining

operations, for maintaining acceptable / permissible limits

of major physical and chemical attributes of environment

namely air, water, hydrogeology, ground vibrations, noise,

land, etc.

A. Air Pollution and its Control Measures:

To control and reduce dust generation during drilling,

blasting, loading and coal transportation, CIL has taken

up various initiatives enumerated in the MoEF&CC

approved Environmental Management Plan (EMP) of

projects. The EMP is prepared factoring the impact

on existing environment and forest due to coal mining

undertaken after conducting an Environment Impact

Assessment (EIA) study of each project. Mist spraying

systems, mobile water sprinklers and automatic

sprinklers have been provided to mitigate air pollution

& its control measures.

Some of the important initiatives taken by CIL

are as follows:

a)

Implementation of First Mile Connectivity to

reduce transport of coal by road.

b)

Transportation of coal by conveyors, covered

trucks & loading in railway rakes through Silo.

c)

Blacktopping & repairing of coal transportation

roads and strengthening of haul roads.

d)

Development of wind break and vertical greenery

system.

e)

Deployment of additional Surface Miners and

Continuous Miners in opencast & U/G mine

respectively for blasting free coal extra action.

B) Mine Water Management:

Mine Discharge Treatment Plants (MDTP) are installed

in mines for treatment of discharged mine water on

the surface for second phase treatment. Treated mine

water is then used partly for dust suppression, fire-

fighting, plantation, washing etc. As per the need of

the local community, treated mine water is supplied to

the nearby villages for drinking & irrigation purposes.

In order to assess the impact of mining activities on

ground water, monitoring of ground water levels is

being carried out in and around of the mine lease

hold area. For ground water recharge within mine

premises and nearby villages, initiatives like rainwater

harvesting, digging of ponds / development of

lagoons, de-silting of existing ponds / tanks etc. have

been taken. Regular monitoring of mine, workshop

and domestic effluent is carried out as per rule and

desired actions are being taken. Reports of the same

are regularly submitted to SPCBs and MoEF&CC. In

2022-23, 92.45 % discharged mined water utilized

for internal & community use and remaining 7.55 % is

retained for future use and ground water recharging.

C) Noise Pollution Control Measure:

For control of noise pollution, various measures

like proper maintenance of equipment, green belt

development around the mine and residential area,

blasting in day time and use of ear muff / ear plugs at

noisy areas are adopted.

D) Land Reclamation:

•

Reclamation of the mined out areas and external

OB dumps are major environmental mitigatory

activities taken up by CIL. Reclamation of mined

out areas are being done as per the Environmental

Management Plan (EMP) and Mine Closure Plan

(MCP) which are approved by MoEF&CC. Top soil

is preserved, stored and used in plantation areas

in the opencast mines. Concurrent reclamation

and rehabilitation of mined out areas are taken up

for gainful land use. After technical reclamation

is completed, plantation is carried out which is

termed as biological reclamation.

•

Eco-restoration: For effective Bio-reclamation of

disturbed land, scientific studies are carried out to

select suitable species of plants for afforestation
