Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

Integrated Annual Report 2022-23:

MANAGING DIRECTOR: Dear Stakeholders,

I am delighted to present the Integrated Annual Report

of Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited for the financial year

2022-23. It is with great pride and enthusiasm that I share

the remarkable journey of GFL amidst the challenges and

opportunities posed by the current macro-environment.

The global macro-environment in the year 2022-23 was

marked by significant challenges, including geopolitical

tensions and high inflation. Despite these obstacles, the

world witnessed a positive trajectory following the recovery

from the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to inflationary

pressures, central banks raised interest rates, which

inevitably impacted growth prospects. However, amid these

testing circumstances, I am pleased to announce that GFL

showcased exceptional performance. Our profit grew by an

impressive 71% compared to the previous year, a testament

to our resilient spirit and commitment to excellence.

At GFL, we have remained strategically positioned to

navigate the complexities of the macro-environment

successfully. As a leading global manufacturer of

fluoropolymers renowned for reliability and quality, we

have carved a niche in the market. Our unwavering vision to

produce high-quality grades and secure customer approvals

has been the driving force behind our accomplishments.

Furthermore, we have strategically aligned ourselves

with industries experiencing significant growth, such

as Electric Vehicles (EV), Solar, 5G, Semiconductors

and Green Hydrogen. These sunrise sectors heavily rely

on fluoropolymers and GFL’s offerings have become

indispensable components in their advancements.

Additionally, the global shift towards the ‘China+1’ strategy

has presented new opportunities for us to expand and fortify

our growth prospects in various markets especially in our EV

offerings.

The strategic imperative guiding GFL during this period

revolves around targeting opportunities in downstream

industries. Operating across three key verticals —

Fluoropolymers, Fluorochemicals and Bulk Chemicals — we

recognise the immense potential of our fluoropolymers

segment. As such, we have dedicated substantial capital

expenditures to enhance our capacity in this crucial

area. Contributing nearly 50% of our total revenue, our

fluoropolymer portfolio includes essential offerings like PTFE,

PVDF, FKM, PFA and Micropowders, which are irreplaceable in

numerous industries.

The EV industry holds immense growth potential and we

remain committed to meet its specific demands with our

fluoropolymer and battery chemicals offerings. PVDF,

in particular, is becoming integral to the EV sector’s

advancements. Furthermore, the growth of FKM has

been boosted by increased blending of ethanol and

stricter emission regulations in the automotive industry.

We have strategically

aligned ourselves with

industries experiencing

significant growth, such

as Electric Vehicles (EV),

Solar, 5G, Semiconductors

and Green Hydrogen. These

sunrise sectors heavily rely

on fluoropolymers and GFL’s

offerings have become

indispensable components

in their advancements.

prospects, paving the way for further expansion.
