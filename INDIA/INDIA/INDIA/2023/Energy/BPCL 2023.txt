Letter: Dear Shareholders,

I am delighted to present to you the Annual Report of

Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) for

FY 2022-23. Even as we navigate a challenging business

environment, our focus continues to be professionalism

and good governance in all aspects of our business. This

is reflected in the excellent operational performance by all

business units during the year and the sharp turnaround

in the financial results in the latter part of the year, after

being severely impacted by global headwinds in the first

half of FY 2022-23.

The domestic economy’s resilience through the crisis of a

once-in-a-century pandemic followed by the geopolitical

crisis has been remarkable. While most of the major

economies continue to grapple with fiscal challenges,

India has been an oasis of growth and stability. India was

second biggest contributor to world growth in 2022.

Our economy grew at 7.2% in FY 2022-23, and the

domestic consumption of petroleum products grew at

10.6%. You will be pleased to know that your company

recorded the highest-ever market sales of 48.92 MMT

in the year, as against 42.51 MMT in the comparative

period, registering a growth of 15%. With a market share

of 25%, we retained our position as the second-largest

Oil Marketing Company during the year. Our refineries

supported the marketing efforts by recording the highest-

ever throughput of 38.53 MMT in FY 2022-23, at a

capacity utilization of 109%.

Our revenue from operations rose to all-time high of `5.3

trillion as against `4.3 trillion in the previous year, making

us the sixth-largest company across all categories in the

country by turnover. BPCL’s colors shine brightest when it

meets challenges head on. In this challenging year which

was marred by suppressed marketing margins on certain

petroleum products, our robust refineries achieved their

all-time high Gross Refining Margins (GRMs) at $20.24/

bbl, highest amongst the PSU Oil Marketing Companies.

The year’s financial performance was volatile with two-

quarters of losses, but these were put behind with a

record-breaking performance in the fourth quarter, with

standalone profit rising 159% year-on-year and 231%

quarter-on-quarter to `64.78 billion. For the year as

a whole, the company posted a standalone net profit

of `18.70 billion as compared to the restated profit of

`113.63 billion in FY 2021-22.

India is increasingly assuming a leadership role in the

comity of nations. The country’s democratic fabric,

consistent economic growth and focus on sustainability

are receiving acclaim globally. Having become the 5th

largest economy in the world, the country is well on

course to becoming a $10 trillion economy by 2035. As

the industrialization and urbanization in India gathers

Dear shareholders, the current financial year will

be equally challenging, as the external environment

remains dynamic with the reshaping of the world order.

It will be interesting to observe how production cuts by

some OPEC+ members and the expected slowdown in

advanced economies counteract each other. Yet, each

challenge offers an opportunity to innovate and evolve. As

demonstrated in the last financial year, we will continue

to be agile, putting customers and people at the center

of our actions. Ensuring safe and reliable operations will

always remain paramount in all our actions.

I would like to thank the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural

Gas for their unflinching support and guidance in all our

activities. I am thankful to my colleagues on Board of

Directors for providing astute leadership to the organization.

I would like to take the opportunity to thank various State

Governments, our channel partners, customers, vendors,

bankers and our employees for their sustained support

that has been instrumental in BPCL having another very

successful year. To all our shareholders, thank you for the

faith you have placed in BPCL.

I would like to end with a quote “Be the change that you

wish to see in the world”. We have envisioned a much

bigger and much brighter tomorrow and I assure you that

we will be the change catalyst in our collective effort to

realize our aspirations.

Irregular expenditure

Report No. 13

of 2019, Para

6.1

Long Service Award (LSA) was introduced based on DPE

guidelines of 14.02.1983 in terms of which there is no objection

in honouring the employees on completion of meritorious

service milestones. Though, there was a prohibition on CPSEs

for giving away commemorative awards in cash or kind on

company specific milestones, DPE drew a clear distinction

between awarding the long service rendered by the employee

and milestones achieved by the Company. Hence, there is no

contravention of any DPE guidelines.
