Mr. Soi’s outstanding contribution towards Company’s growth

over the past 3 financial years. With his strategic guidance the

Company achieved its highest-ever growth in terms of both

revenue and profitability. Mr. Soi’s commitment and strategic

acumen have spearheaded a remarkable transformation in the

significant growth in market capitalization.

In a brief span of just three years, Mr. Soi’s strategic guidance

has turned the Company and its extensive network of managed

class operating and financial metrics. Notably, even during the

turbulent times of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Max Healthcare

Network demonstrated resilience and financial strength. This

transformation has been underpinned by several key factors:

i)

Strong

Revenue

Growth:

Max

Healthcare

Network

demonstrated

a

substantial revenue growth trajectory,

achieving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of

13% over the past three years. This translated into the

gross revenue increasing from H 4,356 Crore in FY20 to H

6,236 Crore in FY23.

ii)

Earnings Excellence: Earnings before interest, taxes,

depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) outpaced revenue

growth, boasting a CAGR of 41% over the last three years.

This resulted in EBITDA figures and margins expanding from

H 590 Crore and 14.7% in FY20 to H 1,636 Crore and 27.7%,

respectively in FY23. Notably, the EBITDA translated into

free cash flows of H 1,281 Crore in FY23. Moreover, Profit

After Tax (PAT) witnessed a tenfold growth from H 129 Crore

in FY20 to H 1,328 Crore in FY23.

Occupied Bed (ARPOB).

iv)

Robust Return on Capital: The pre-tax Return on Capital

Employed (ROCE) considerably improved from 11.1% in FY20

to 33.1% in FY23, illustrating the Company's judicious capital

allocation and resource management under Mr. Soi's leadership.

Managing Director’s Message

It is with pleasure and a measure of pride

that we present to you the annual report

showcasing our journey over the year.

This year, we focused on exceptional

value creation through new expansion

projects, going digital through a newly

created innovative app and driving

clinical excellence through significant

investments in cutting-edge medical

technology. We continued to deliver

the highest levels of care and improve

clinical outcomes through numerous

new initiatives. We also made significant

progress in forging stronger relationships

with the local communities around us

and in implementing our ESG agenda

designed for sustainable growth.

We commissioned a new onco-tower in

Shalimar Bagh in North-West Delhi in Q-4

FY23. Construction commenced in our

expansion project in Gurgaon, Mumbai

and in Mohali. As I write this, our new

hospital in Dwarka, South West Delhi, is

approaching completion and will start

operations in the next few months.

In the areas of clinical excellence, we

continued to showcase our commitment

to enhancing patient safety as well

as driving positive health outcomes.

Our multidisciplinary teams of highly

skilled and compassionate clinicians

worked tirelessly to deliver the highest

standards of care. With the adoption of

advanced medical technologies, our

teams made cutting-edge healthcare

a reality for thousands of our patients.

A new genomics and molecular lab

became functional, adding greatly to our

abilities to conduct molecular testing.

We also managed to digitise our clinical

processes to improve medical services,

reduce wait times and enhance the

overall patient experience.

All this was driven keeping in mind one

simple goal that the patient should

remain at the very centre of everything

we do. Every project, every change and

every investment is made to enhance

patient outcomes, convenience and

experience at all our touch points.

Dear Members,

All through the year, we also maintained

a focus on improving our environmental

footprint and to build a stronger

foundation for healthier communities.

To ensure sustainable growth, we

adopted an eco-conscious approach,

making our business practices greener

and environment-friendly. We remain

irrevocably committed to this path, which

will lead to a brighter future for our future

generations.

Sustainable growth

It is imperative that we drive growth

that is environmentally sustainable. As

a responsible healthcare organisation,

we continue to limit our environmental

footprint and contribute towards

the betterment of society. We have

been working towards achieving the

environmental goals that we had set for

ourselves last year. We are proactively

working towards reducing our water

consumption and also attaining

water neutrality by the end of FY25,

significantly increasing the use of

renewable energy, managing emissions

from our facilities and minimising waste

generation.

With our commitment to facilitate a

smoother transition to green energy,

we have achieved a 33.3% renewable

energy share in the total energy mix in

FY23, and we plan to increase it to 60%

by FY25. We also recycled 39% of the

total water consumed during the fiscal

year. In order to fulfil our sustainability

goal of being water-neutral in FY25,

we have put together a roadmap for

recharging and developing water

bodies in rural communities around our

hospitals. This year, we rejuvenated a

pond in a village in Ghaziabad district

by implementing an integrated natural

wastewater treatment system that has

made water available for agriculture

to the local community, mitigated

waterlogging and also recharged

groundwater.

This year, we

introduced ‘Max

My Health’, an app

designed to offer our

services to patients

from the convenience

of their mobile

phones.

All through the year,

we also maintained

a focus on improving

our environmental

footprint and to build

a stronger foundation

for healthier

communities.

Abhay Soi,

Chairman and: Managing

Managing Director

Through a mixture

of brownfield

and greenfield

expansion, we intend

to add over 2,800

beds. In addition,

we are exploring

opportunities for

expansion in different

parts of the country

through M&A and

built-to-suit asset light

model.

in the long run. Investing and leveraging

the world’s leading medical technologies

will remain a cornerstone of our business

strategy.

Clinical research and

academics

In addition to patient care, we remain

at the forefront of medical research

and innovation. Our dedicated

research centres have actively pursued

breakthrough studies in areas such

as metabolic diseases, oncology,

cardiology, neurology, public health

and more. Over the last seven years,

we have produced approximately 2,000

research papers, published in reputed

medical journals across the globe. Our

Land Acquisition

Pursuant to approval of the Board accorded on October 4, 2021,

the Company purchased two parcels of land admeasuring

~ 5.26 acres and ~ 6.11 acres, located in Gurugram at Sector 56

and 53 respectively, which were offered to the Company for

allotment on freehold basis for setting up two hospitals, following

acceptance of its bids made under e-auction of institutional

properties arranged by Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran

(“HSVP”). Subsequently, vacant physical possession of land was

given to the Company on February 23, 2022.

Thereafter, the allotment ~ 6.11 acres of land at sector 53 was

unilaterally cancelled by HSVP, on the grounds that a part of

the land (measuring 2.58 acre) could not be transferred by the

previous developer/ land owner (“party”) to HSVP as stipulated

in the license granted by HSVP to such party earlier. The above

cancellation of the allotment of the land by HSVP was followed

by a refund towards cost of land earlier paid by the Company

and interest accrued thereon upto the date of cancellation.

The Company has challenged the unilateral and arbitrary

cancellation of allotment of the land by HSVP in the Hon’ble

Punjab and Haryana High Court since it is in violation of

allotment letter. The Hon’ble High Court has admitted the

petition and directed all parties to maintain status quo. The

Company is seeking appropriate legal recourse for revocation

of cancellation notice and restoration of the allotment of said

land by HSVP.

their individual growth and the growth of the organization.

This comprehensive program is built upon a robust framework,

characterized by its scientific approach, alignment with our

current values, goals, competency requirements, readiness

for the future, effectiveness, scalability and a commitment to

transparency & objectivity. It is structured across three distinct

phases:

Company Overview:

Managing Director is the

Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”).

The Company’s business activity primarily falls within a

single reportable business segment and geographical

segment namely ‘Medical and Healthcare Services’

and ‘India’ respectively.

x.

Current / non-current classification

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current

or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating

cycle and other criteria set-out in the Act. An asset is

treated as current when it is:

(i)

Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or

consumed in normal operating cycle

(ii) Held primarily for the purpose of trading

(iii) Expected to be realized within twelve months after

the reporting period, or

(iv) Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from

being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at

least twelve months after the financial year

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

(i) It is expected to be settled in normal operating

cycle

(ii) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

(iii) It is due to settled within twelve months after the

reporting period, or

(iv) There is no unconditional right to defer the

settlement of the liability for at least twelve months

after the financial year

All other liability are classified as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-

current assets and non-current liabilities, as the case

may be.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition

of assets for processing and their realization in cash

and cash equivalents. The Company’s operating cycle

consists of twelve months.

3.2 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and

assumptions

The preparation of the standalone financial statements

requires management to make judgements, estimates and

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues,

expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying

disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could

result in outcomes that require a adjustment to the carrying

amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.

Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key

sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that

have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to

the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the

next financial year, are described below. The Company

based its assumptions and estimates on parameters

available when the financial statements are prepared.

Existing circumstances and assumptions about future

developments, however, may change due to market

changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the

Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions

when they occur.

Judgements

In the process of applying the Company’s accounting

policies, management has made the following judgements,

which have the most significant effect on the amounts

recognised in the financial statements.

(a) Impairment

(i)

Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible

assets

Goodwill and intangible assets (such as trademarks),

that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to

amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or

more frequently if events or changes in circumstances

indicate that they might be impaired. Other intangible

assets (including operation and management rights

and service agreement which are depreciated over

the life) are tested for impairment whenever events or

changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying

Annual Report 2022-23

Managing Director is the Group’s

Chief Operating Decision Maker (“”CODM””).

The Group has identified only one reportable business segment as it deals mainly in provision of healthcare

services.”

v.

Current / non-current classification

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle and

other criteria set-out in the Act. An asset is treated as current when it is:

(i) Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle

(ii) Held primarily for the purpose of trading

(iii) Expected to be realized within twelve months after the financial year, or

(iv) Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months

after the financial year

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

(i) It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle

(ii) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

(iii) It is due to settled within twelve months after the financial year, or

(iv) There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the financial year

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and non-current liabilities, as the case may be.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash

equivalents. The Group’s operating cycle consists of twelve months.

3.3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires group to make judgements, estimates and assumptions

that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the

disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require

a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.

Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have

a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial

year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated

financial statements are prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may

change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the

assumptions when they occur.

Judgements

In the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, group has made the following judgements, which have the most

significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

a. Impairment

(i) Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets

Goodwill and intangible assets (such as trademarks), that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation

and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they

might be impaired. Other intangible assets (including operation and management rights and service agreement)

are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not

be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its

recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost of disposal and value in

use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately

identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets

(cash-generating units). During the year the Group carried out an impairment assessment of goodwill and other

intangibles (including those appearing in the subsidiaries) and have concluded that there is no impairment in value

of goodwill and other intangibles assets as appearing in the consolidated financial statements.

(ii) Impairment testing of non-Financial assets

The Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication

of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Determining whether

the asset is impaired requires to assess the recoverable amount of the asset or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) which is

compared to the carrying amount of the asset or CGU, as applicable. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value

less costs of disposal and value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds the recoverable

amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

(iii) Impairment testing of Financial assets

The impairment provisions of financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates.

The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs for the impairment calculation
