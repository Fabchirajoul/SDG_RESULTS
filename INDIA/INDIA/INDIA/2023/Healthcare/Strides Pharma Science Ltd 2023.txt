f)

Company

received

Establishment

Inspection

Reports from USFDA confirming successful

conclusion of inspections at four of our five USFDA

approved manufacturing sites, i.e., Bengaluru,

Puducherry, Singapore and Chestnut Ridge (US).

Evaluation of Performance and Recommendation of

Variable Pay

NRC at its meeting held on May 25, 2023, evaluated

Arun’s performance for FY 2022-23.

Committee acknowledged Arun’s commitment to

advance Company’s interest and opted out of fixed

remuneration during FY 2022-23. He fostered a culture of

leadership with trust and under his leadership Company

has made a significant headway to achieve the stated

plan to return to growth, enhance profitability and

reduce debt. Company’s consolidated EBITDA turned-

around from H42 million in FY 2021-22 to H4,460 million

in FY 2022-23. Company has delivered a sustainable

Profitability, Efficiency and Growth during the year and

has laid a strong foundation for FY 2023-24.

In acceptance of Arun’s exemplary leadership and

exceptional efforts during the year, NRC recommended

payment of performance linked variable pay of

H6 crores to Arun for FY 2022-23. Board at its meeting

held on May 25, 2023 considered the recommendation

of NRC and approved the proposal.

In

recommending

the

variable

payout

to

Mr. Arun Kumar, NRC and the Board considered the

reasonableness and sufficiency of the payout for the

role played by Mr. Arun Kumar in turning around

Company’s performance, including responding to the

challenges faced by the Company.

However, the Company has inadequate profit to

pay the said remuneration. Further, Shareholders’

approval of July 6, 2022 does not enable payment of

such remuneration, if the Company has no profit or its

profits are inadequate during the financial year.

Accordingly, approval of Shareholders of the Company

is being sought for payment of performance linked

variable pay of H6 crores for FY 2022-23 to Mr. Arun

Kumar by way of Special Resolution as per Item 6 of

this Notice.

III. Other Information

Reasons of loss or inadequate profits and steps taken or proposed to be taken for improvement and

expected increase in productivity and profits in measurable terms

Strides confronted significant headwinds during FY 2021-22. Company’s performance was severely

affected by unusual price erosion and volume drops in the United States, a significant increase in

freight costs, under-utilised capacities resulting in higher cost per unit and a prolonged cash-to-cash

cycle leading to negative operating cash flow. Consequently, the Company reported loss in FY 2021-22.

During FY 2022-23, improvement in product-level costs, development of alternative vendors for active

pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and packaging material, improved efficiency of production processes

and reduction of yield loss, have contributed to an increase in gross margins. In addition, reduction

in manufacturing site operating expenses, shipping and administrative expenses contributed to

the increase in overall profitability for the year. Company continues to focus on its portfolio, price

discipline, margins and cost structures. These improvements have begun to exhibit as the Company

delivered a solid rebound in FY 2022-23.

Managing Director’s message

Prudent decisions, persistent growth: Dear Shareholders,

Last year, I returned to

Strides in an executive role

to manage our Company’s

state of affairs. After a

difficult FY 2021-22, our

Company entered the new

fiscal year necessitating

significant attention and

a strategic reset to ensure

a robust rebound, return

to growth and profitability,

and recommence cash

flow generation.

FY 2022-23 demonstrated our

Company’s strength, and the DNA

that establishes our foundation

is robust and can withstand the

test of time. We had to make

several challenging decisions and

implement many course-correction

measures to make up for lost

opportunities and regain business

momentum. Our primary objective

was to re-establish our Company’s

core tenet: to embark on a product

strategy with cost leadership and

well-established manufacturing

and quality compliance led by our

core ICE (Integrity, Collaboration,

Efficiency) Values.

I’m happy to report that our efforts

have been bearing fruit, with

positive results across the board

and a particularly encouraging

uptick in our financial results. We

have also implemented cost controls

and other forms of executional

discipline to guarantee the timely,

complete, and efficient delivery

of high-quality pharmaceutical

products. Our simpler corporate

structure, targeted initiatives,

and increased overall efficiency

contributed to a strong performance

and paved the way for even more

successful outcomes in the future.

Robust performance

We achieved a new record revenue

of H37,042 Million in FY 2022-23,

representing a significant 20%

year-over-year increase.

The growth was driven by our

strategic initiatives across key

markets, particularly the US and the

regulated markets of Europe.

Our robust performance across

multiple markets reflects our

sustained growth momentum and

effective market strategies. We

achieved record-breaking annual

sales of US$232 Million in the

United States, a staggering 58%*

increase from US$157 Million in

FY 2021-22, attributed to sustained

market share momentum in key

products and successful new

product introductions.

The Other Regulated Markets

have also seen significant sales

growth, with the UK and the

recently established B2B platform

under synergICE leading the way.

I am delighted to report record-

breaking sales of US$157 Million

in these markets during the

year. The UK and other front-end

markets have returned to their

previous growth and profitability

levels, demonstrating superior

performance. Moreover, our

B2B platform, synergICE, has

experienced significant growth and

is beginning to meet its objectives.

Regulatory clearance

The U.S. Food and Drug

Administration (USFDA) inspections

of our facilities throughout the year

confirmed a clear compliance status

for all our sites. Our Puducherry

plant, which had been issued a

warning notice by the USFDA

in 2019, has been reclassified.

This demonstrates that we are

committed to upholding stringent

quality controls and ensuring full

conformity to regulatory standards.

Building resilience at Stelis

Stelis, the Biotech division of our

Group, faced a challenging year

due to various circumstances,

including the geopolitical situation

between Russia and Ukraine. Due

to sanctions against Russia and

the Russian Direct Investment

Fund (RDIF), we had to write off

our COVID-19 vaccine inventory,

leading to a significant one-time

loss. Nevertheless, we responded to

the changing landscape with strong

resilience and agility.

From a business standpoint,

Stelis received an encouraging

regulatory outcome from the

European Medicines Agency (EMA)

and USFDA, propelling its business

development efforts forward.

While significant order wins

have been concluded, the CDMO

business’s onboarding process

takes longer. The new business

would generate operating cash

flow; however, revenue recognition

will follow operational milestones

and become consistent only after

commercial supplies pick up.

Consequently, in 12 to 18 months,

Stelis anticipates a positive

operating margin and sufficient

cash flow to meet its obligations

from CSA-driven revenue growth.

Focus areas for sustainable

growth

As we eagerly anticipate FY 2023-24

opportunities, our strategic priorities

remain centred on sustainable

growth and value creation across

our key markets. In regulated

markets, we leverage our expertise

in product introductions and forging

strategic B2B partnerships to sustain

our growth momentum. We will

channel our R&D efforts towards

launching new products from our

pool of approved ANDAs, ensuring

a diverse and competitive product

portfolio. One of the key strategic

initiatives is that we are aiming

to scale up our US business by

capitalising on improved volumes in

base products and successful launch

of new products. We will continue

to maintain market leadership

and mitigate pricing pressures by

strategically positioning ourselves in

niche therapies.

In the emerging markets, we

have prioritised expanding our

branded portfolio in Africa. By

enhancing the productivity of

our field force, we aim to drive

growth and improve EBITDA flow-

through. Our market penetration

efforts will be accelerated in new

regions, enabling us to broaden

our portfolio and gain traction. We

remain committed to maintaining

our market share with donor-

funded ARV and Malaria agencies

in our access market business.

To enhance our competitiveness,

we will continue prioritising

cost-improvement programmes

through alternative API vendors,

effectively reducing COGS and

strengthening our position in

the market. Furthermore, our

commitment to cost savings and

efficiency has yielded tangible

benefits. Through initiatives such

as R&D cost optimisation, Alternate

Vendor Development (AVD), Cost

Improvement Programs (CIPs),

and streamlined supply chain

execution, we have improved gross

margins and achieved greater

operational efficiency.

Making a lasting impact

We reaffirm our commitment to

integrating sustainability efforts

into our fundamental strategy and

decision-making, taking on the

challenge of climate change. Our

goal is to create long-lasting value

for our stakeholders well into the

future, and we plan to achieve this

by prioritising sustainability across

our entire value chain. While there

is still more work to be done, we are

confident in our abilities to expand

our sustainability efforts and make

a meaningful and lasting impact on

the world.

As part of our commitment

to sustainability, we have

implemented various initiatives

to minimise our environmental

footprint, promote employee

well-being, and engage with

local communities. Our CSR

initiatives are focused on

healthcare, education, and

employability. In healthcare, we

operate Arogyadhama, a multi-

speciality health centre, to provide

quality healthcare to over 11,940

individuals in rural Bengaluru.

We promote education through

programmes like LeAPS to motivate

and empower students to achieve

their goals. In addition, we invest in

school infrastructure improvements

and construct anganwadi centres.

To promote employability,

we empower underprivileged

individuals to acquire vocational

skills and find meaningful

employment opportunities through

NGO collaboration. Through these

initiatives, we aim to make a

positive difference in the lives of the

communities we serve.

Way ahead

We remain focused on our strategic

priorities, including scaling business

in the US, reducing debt, optimising

operational costs, driving product

launches, and expanding our

presence in emerging markets.

Through network optimisation,

market expansion, improved cash

flow generation, and enhanced

capital management, we anticipate

a strong performance in FY 2023-24.

In closing, I want to express my

gratitude to the hard-working

employees, our respected board of

directors, and all our stakeholders.

We will keep pushing for expansion,

delivering value, and moulding a

stronger and brighter future.

Dear Shareholders,

FY 2022-23 has been one

of the busiest years for our

Company in recent times.

Coming from the most

difficult year (FY 2021-22),

our Company had to

work very hard to bring

confidence back across all

stakeholders. As a CFO,

the most difficult thing

was to address the past,

present and future issues

at the same time. We had

to fund the losses of the

past, address the current

by carefully planning the

operations and fund the

growth for future. The

focus for the entire year

was to execute seamlessly

on the priorities laid out in

last year’s Annual Report

and I am very pleased to

report the following:

• Daily governance and review

cadence across our Company

enabled us to focus on

metrics which are relevant

for the future and to avoid

surprises. The cross-functional

collaboration enabled us to

achieve the metrics.

• We improved all the critical

processes of our Company with

strong controls. This enabled

us to reduce our cash-to-cash

cycles in the front end and fix

all leakages in a sustainable

manner. This contributed

significantly to our bottom line.

• Cost Management: The

governance was increased

on every line item of costs

through careful planning and

inculcating cost management

mindset across people. The

overall Manpower costs and

operating costs have been reset

to much lower levels resulting

in EBITDA margins of 16%

in Q4.

• We reset all the low-margin

businesses that did not

add to the bottom line. We

deconsolidated Universal

• From an external standpoint,

we are one of the few

pharmaceutical companies to

have been selected in the first

tranche for availing the benefits

of the Production Linked

Incentive (PLI) scheme of the

Government.

• With ever-changing

regulations, our Company

strengthened the compliance

processes across the globe.

To summarise, FY 2022-23 was

an eventful year with many

lessons learnt. As we approach

FY 2023-24, the key priorities for

our Company are as follows:

1. Focus on Profitability,

Efficiency, and Growth across

all markets. We will continue

our cost management efforts to

stay competitive.

2. EPS accretion with Stelis

aiming to achieve break even

at EBITDA level in FY 2023-24.

With increase in operating cash

flows, we can see the interests

cost coming down by the end

of the year. We aim to achieve

Debt/EBITDA ratio of around 3

in Q4.

3. Balance sheet strength:

We will continue to focus on

the various line items of the

balance sheet to improve the

return on capital employed.

4. Strengthen compliance:

We will continue to keep

bulls-eye focus on compliance

considering that regulations

are changing on a regular basis

across the world.

5. ESG Compliance: While our

Company has worked on many

parts of ESG compliance, the

focus will be to become the

best-in-class in practice on ESG

in the next two years.

I believe that all these above are

achievable with relentless focus

and execution.

I thank all the stakeholders for

reposing confidence and standing

by us in the most difficult year

which went. I look forward to

your continued support and

guidance as we take the Strides

to great heights.

Warm regards,

Badree

Corporation Limited, Kenya

(UCL) during the year. The

growth returned to PLs which

were dragging the overall

performance. The turnaround

is visible.

• The challenges of liquidity had

been addressed very efficiently.

We were able to meet all the

commitments on time. Due to

the focus on liquidity, growth

has returned to all the markets

we operate. The debt was

maintained within a narrow

range while there is an increase

in the reported debt due to

the depreciation of Rupee. Our

Company took control over

operations of Chestnut Ridge

and had to fund the entire

working capital. The working

capital cycle improved by 18

days led by superior collection

in the US, and liquidation of

inventories in other markets.

• We improved all the metrics

of Profitability, Efficiency, and

Growth. In FY 2022-23, the

gross margin increased by 463

basis points and operating

costs reduced by 749 basis

points, resulting in an EBITDA

margin of ~12% (Q4YF23 - 16%).

We believe that we have laid a

strong platform for sustainable

performance. The growth

was achieved through timely

launches which acquired the

leading market share within a

few quarters of launch.

• We engaged actively with

all stakeholders including

employees, bankers, vendors,

customers and investors.

Confidence is returning on our

Company with the focus on

consistency and sustainability.

We improved all the

critical processes of

our Company with

strong controls. This

enabled us to reduce

our cash-to-cash cycles

in the front end and fix

all leakages in a

sustainable manner.

Million in FY 2022-23. Gross margins in Q4

FY 2022-23 stood at 59.50%, inched very close to

the Company’s historical peaks.

Steps taken to improve product-level costs,

alternative vendor development for APIs and

packaging material, improved efficiency in the

production processes and yield loss minimisation

Further, reduction in operating expenses at

manufacturing sites, cost of shipping, and

overheads also contributed to the rise in EBITDA

Statutory Reports:

Managing Director of

the Company is responsible for allocating resources

and assessing performance of the operating segments

and accordingly is identified as the Chief Operating

Decision Maker (CODM). All operating segments’

operating results are reviewed regularly by the CODM

to make decisions about resources to be allocated to

the segments and assess their performance.

3.23 Recent accounting developments

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new

standard or amendments to the existing standards

under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules as issued from time to time. On 31 March, 2023,

MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules,

2023, applicable from 1 April, 2023, as below:

Ind AS 1 – Reference to Conceptual Framework

The amendments require companies to disclose

their material accounting policies rather than their

significant accounting policies. Accounting policy

information, together with other information, is

material when it can reasonably be expected to

influence decisions of primary users of general-

purpose financial statements. The Group does not

expect this amendment to have any significant impact

in its standalone financial statements.

Ind AS 12 – Income taxes

The amendments clarify how companies account

for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and

decommissioning

obligations.

The

amendments

narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption

in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition

exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions

that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable

and deductible temporary differences. The Group

is evaluating the impact, if any, in its standalone

financial statements.

Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting

Estimates and Errors

The amendments will help entities to distinguish

between

accounting

policies

and

accounting

estimates. The definition of a change in accounting

estimates has been replaced with a definition of

accounting estimates. Under the new definition,

accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in

financial statements that are subject to measurement

uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting estimates

if accounting policies require items in financial

statements to be measured in a way that involves

measurement uncertainty. The Group does not expect

this amendment to have any significant impact in its

standalone financial statements.

Group has also estimated the costs of such recall

and have provided for all inventory of Losartan

with the Azide impurity(s) as of 31 March 2023,

amounting to H Nil (31 March 2022: H 353.47 Million).

(c)

On August 4, 2021, the Group through its

wholly

owned

subsidiaries

entered

into

definitive agreements with subsidiaries of Endo

International Plc to acquire a portfolio of generic

products along with the US manufacturing

site at Chestnut Ridge, New York. Pursuant to

such acquisition, the management decided to

consolidate its existing operations with the

acquired facility at Chestnut Ridge, New York

to optimise future operating costs. Accordingly,

during the previous year, the Group divested the

Florida facility. Consequently, the Group recorded

an impairment loss (including associated costs)

amounting to 1,727.16 Million as at March 31, 2022.

Additionally,

the

Group

as

part

of

cost

improvement measures globally and capacity

optimisation at various manufacturing locations,

resulting

in

one

time

severance

expense

aggregating to H 255.03 Million (March 31, 2022:

H 207 Million), which has been disclosed under

exceptional items.

(d) One of the associates of the group, Stelis

Biopharma limited, raised equity investments

during the current year and earlier years. As a

result, the Group’s shareholding has reduced.

Further, the Group to enable its associate,

Consumer Healthcare (CHC) Business, to raise

additional capital from other investors to fund

its growth, decided to dilute its equity holding.

Consequently, in accordance with the revised

agreement with other investors the Group

reduced its equity holding to 19%. Pursuant to

the such amended agreement the Group has no

longer any representation on the board of CHC.

These changes required the Group to re-evaluate

its accounting for investment in CHC. Pursuant

to these amendments, the Group concluded that

the Group no longer has any significant influence

over the CHC business and will only retain its

investment as a passive shareholder. Accordingly,

the Group discontinued its equity method

associate accounting for CHC and will hereafter

only account for its investments at fair value

through other comprehensive income.

Consequently, as per Ind AS 28 ‘Investment in

associates and Joint ventures’, the Group recorded

gain on account of above mentioned dilution in

shareholdings of H 656.07 Million and H 529.26

Million during the year ended 31 March 2023 and

31 March 2022 respectively.

“The Company is eligible for various tax incentives / exemptions with respect to taxability of income received

in India including repatriation of any profits as dividends from subsidiaries and associates, which may result

in possible tax litigations/assessments. Assessing the applicability of tax for such repatriations involve

complexities with respect to various tax positions on availability of tax incentives / exemptions resulting

in possible tax litigations/assessments. Judgment is required in assessing the availability of tax incentives /

exemptions. These judgments could change over time as each of the matter progresses with the relevant tax

authorities and accordingly may impact the accounting treatment followed by the Company. The Company

based on its assessments believes that appropriate accruals have been recorded for all these matters, to the

extent necessary.
