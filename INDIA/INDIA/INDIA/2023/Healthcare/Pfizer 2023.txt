Annual Report 2022-23:

Dear Shareholders,

I am humbled and excited to have joined Pfizer Limited at this pivotal time.

On my journey to accepting this role of tremendous trust and responsibility,

I came to admire several aspects of our Company. Starting with our unwavering

commitment to our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients’

lives and its ability to unify us in ways that go beyond our work. Followed by our

core values of Courage, Excellence, Equity and Joy, that guide us in the pursuit of

our breakthroughs and define who we are and how we work. And third and one

of the most important in the context of FY 2023, our ability to be resilient in the

face of overwhelming challenges.

The year under review saw a number of developments

that challenged our ability to deliver and succeed -

Revision of the National List of Essential Medicines

(NLEM-2022) and consequent expansion of drugs under

price controls including many of our products, Loss

of Exclusivity (LoE) for our two key brands, Eliquis and

Zavicefta, and transition to a new Go-To-Market model

and settling into the new ways of working. Our journey in

FY 2023 is testament to our resilience, to the capabilities

of our people and to the power of our brands. We have

remained buoyant amidst turbulence and set the stage

for a new phase of growth and opportunities in FY 2023.

A Year of Resilience

The India Pharmaceutical Market (IPM) grew by a modest

7.9% (MAT MAR 23) as compared to a robust growth of

18.2% in the previous year which had benefitted from the

high volume off-take of COVID-19 and related medications

such as vitamins, anti-infectives, gastrointestinal and

respiratory drugs.

FY 2023 was a year of transformation for us. While the

Company delivered strong performances in some of

its key therapies, the overall revenue saw a decline of

7.6%. The sales for the year under review are strictly

not comparable with that of the previous year on
