Managing Director’s Perspective: Dear Shareholders,

The industry has been rapidly evolving with rising demand

for affordable products, changing healthcare policies,

technological advancements, the need for innovative

solutions, and the emergence of newer therapies.

The past year was marked with global inflation, geopolitical

uncertainty, energy crisis, and supply chain disruptions in

various parts of the world. It is worth noting that despite

a challenging global scenario and fast-changing industry

landscape, Divi’s continued to be a reliable partner by

fulfilling customer requirements through prudent supply

chain management and operational excellence. We have

Pursuing Responsible

Growth

In addition, we faced some headwinds due to pricing

pressures on APIs and an increase in raw material costs,

which impacted our profitability. However, some of the

cost increases were mitigated due to the long-term supplier

contracts and our existing backward integration initiatives.

Nonetheless, we remain optimistic about our Generic

API product portfolio along with new Custom Synthesis

opportunities that lie ahead.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

As we strive to maintain our leadership position in our

core products and expand our portfolio with new product

offerings, we are focused on unlocking growth potential

through our six-point strategic approach. With the expiry

of new molecules, we see possibilities for new product

launches over the next three years. Towards this, we have

filed drug master files that we expect will contribute to our

growth in the upcoming years.

We have expanded our Sartan portfolio further by

leveraging our backward integration and innovative

technology to manufacture starting materials and

hold ambitious aspirations of becoming a leader in

Sartan manufacturing.

With the increasing global demand for Contrast Media,

we aim to secure a substantial share of the world market.

By providing reliable and high-quality products, and

expanding to newer categories, particularly MRI contrast

media, we intent to broaden our business presence in this

growing market.

WELL-POSITIONED FOR THE NEXT

On the CAPEX front, I am pleased to update you on our

Unit III project. With all the necessary clearances in

place, we have secured 500 acres of land and started

construction activities. We have outlaid an initial investment

of approximately H1,200 Cr to H1,500 Cr for Phase 1 with a

further scope for expansion in future.

This state-of-the-art facility will manufacture starting

materials, advanced intermediates, and APIs that require

complex chemistry, providing us with a competitive edge in

the market. We expect the Unit III project to contribute to

our growth beyond FY 2025. I am confident that with this

project, we are well-positioned to further strengthen our

leadership position in the industry.

been closely monitoring global developments to proactively

manage risks and capitalise on opportunities ahead.

A YEAR OF RESILIENCE

During the past year, we had the unique opportunity to

serve the demand for COVID products, which contributed

significantly to our growth in FY 2022 and in the first half

of FY 2023. As the pandemic situation stabilised and the

demand for Anti-COVID drugs decreased, our revenue and

profitabilities have started to level off.

Over the past year, we have

navigated through diverse global

scenarios and hereby present

our 33rd annual report that

demonstrates our commitment

to responsible growth through

shared value creation for all our

stakeholders.

CARING FOR THE SOCIETY

As a responsible pharmaceutical company, we believe in

giving back to the communities around us. During the year,

we undertook several CSR initiatives to address the pressing

issues faced by our neighbouring communities. Our efforts

include providing safe drinking water, empowering women,

developing infrastructure, promoting healthcare and child

education for the rural communities.

One of our notable initiatives during the year was Project

Jalaprasadam, which is driven by our purpose of providing

safe drinking water by installing state-of-the-art water

purification RO plants at various temples in both the states

we operate.

A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE AHEAD

I am pleased to see how Divi's has demonstrated resilience

in a challenging global environment and evolving industry

landscape. Moving forward, our commitment to responsible

growth through sustainability in chemistry and shared value

creation for our stakeholders remains steadfast.

By leveraging our three-decades of expertise in chemistry,

execution excellence, and resources, we are focused on

strengthening our industry leadership while contributing to

the betterment of society.

Finally, I extend my deepest gratitude to all our stakeholders

for their continued trust and support, which has been

instrumental to our success over the past 33 years. Your

confidence in Divi’s drives us to strive for excellence and

continue to be a sustainable and reliable partner for the

global pharmaceutical industry.

Company are measured using the currency of

the primary economic environment in which the

entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The

financial statements are presented in Indian rupee

(`), which is Divi’s (the Company’s) functional and

presentation currency.

(ii) Transactions and Balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the

functional currency using the exchange rates at the

dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains

and losses resulting from the settlement of such

transactions and from the translation of monetary

assets and liabilities denominated in foreign

currencies at year end exchange rates are generally

recognised in statement of profit and loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair

value in a foreign currency are translated using the

exchange rates at the date when the fair value was

determined. Translation differences on assets and

liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of

the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on

non-monetary assets and liabilities such as equity

instruments held at fair value through profit or

loss are recognised in statement of profit and loss

Revenue is measured at the transaction price determined

customers. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of

returns, trade allowances, rebates, Goods & Service Tax

Revenue from Sale of Goods:

Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when the

customer obtains control of the Company’s product,

typically in the range of 60 to 180 days after invoicing

depending on product and geographic region. Taxes

collected from customers relating to product sales

and remitted to government authorities are excluded

from revenues.

The Company does not expect to have any contracts

where the period between the transfer of the

promised goods or services to the customer and

payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a

consequence, the company does not adjust any of

the transaction prices for the time value of money.

For contracts with multiple performance obligations,

the Company allocates the transaction price to

each performance obligation based on the relative

standalone selling price.

(ii) Revenue from Sale of Services:

Revenue from Sale of services is recognised as per

the terms of the contracts with customers when

the related services are performed, or the agreed

milestones are achieved.

right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme

is established in respect of the exports entitled for

this benefit made and where there is no significant

uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the

relevant export proceeds.

MEIS scrips are freely transferable and can be utilised

for the payment of customs duty. MEIS scrips are

recognised either on transfer/sale of such scrips or

when it is reasonably certain that such scrips can be

utilised against import duties.

(iv) Dividend Income:

Dividends are received from financial assets at fair

value through profit or loss. Dividends are recognised
