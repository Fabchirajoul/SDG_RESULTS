NOTICE

To view our Annual Report 2022-2023 online,

log on to sunpharma.com/investors-annual-reports-presentations/:

Dear Shareholders,

I am happy to report that we had a good year with strong

performance across multiple parameters.

Our global consolidated revenues grew by 12.6% to

₹ 433 Billion while EBITDA grew by 12% to ₹ 116 Billion.

Adjusted net profit was up by about 12.8% to ₹ 86 Billion.

Our return ratios have also continued their improving

trend this year.

The contribution of our Global Specialty business has

more than doubled from 7% of consolidated revenues in

FY18 to 16.2% in FY23. It is among the larger businesses

for Sun already, yet offers even more exciting growth

avenues from here.

Since inception, Sun has been deploying its resources

to build new pharma businesses in a selective manner.

Typically, it takes us several years to achieve initial scale

in new businesses. This initial period consumes significant

effort and resources, usually with no return in sight. Our

investment in building specialty business over the past

decade showcases our ability to nurture businesses with

patient capital.

Global Pharmaceutical industry remains quite dynamic, and

always buzzing with new avenues for capital deployment.

Pursuing any one of these options can place considerable

pressure on our balance sheet. Our existing businesses also

require significant capital and attention. We are acutely

aware that our own resources are finite, placing a limit on

the number of opportunities we can pursue simultaneously.

Success is not guaranteed, and it is important for us

that we remain thoughtful and selective in deciding

which options to pursue. However, we will not shy away

from making disproportionate investments to grow our

businesses, should an opportunity present itself.

Our endeavour at all times is to find the best role for Sun

in a value chain to keep ourselves from spreading thin. In

Specialty business, we have built commercial infrastructure

in certain large pharma markets and we believe this makes

Sun a partner of choice for innovation-led companies. We

are in the process of strengthening the internal R&D engine

with an aim to create and fortify our future product pipeline.

Operational Performance

For FY23, India formulation sales were at ₹ 136 Billion, up

by 6.6% and accounted for about 32% of overall revenues.

Excluding the contribution of COVID-19 products in the

previous year, the underlying business performed well,

with about 10.2% growth Y-o-Y.

Our India business was in line with the average industry

growth, driven by our leading presence in chronic segments

and our strong brand equity with doctors. As per AIOCD

AWACS March 2023 data, our market share remained flat at

8.3% on MAT basis vs the previous year.

As per SMSRC data for February 2023, Sun Pharma ranks

No. 1 by prescriptions with 12 different classes of doctors.

We continued our momentum with 105 new product

introductions in India.

Managing Director’s Message:

letter

to the Company’s Mohali facility. The agency has directed

the Company to take certain corrective actions at the

Mohali facility before releasing further batches into the US.

Adherence to global cGMP standards is a key priority for

us, and we have an unwavering focus on 24x7 compliance

to ensure continuity of supplies to our customers and

patients worldwide.

Efficiency improvement

Our focus has always been on sustainable cost reduction

via technology interventions and process enhancements.

We are also directing our efforts to reduce working capital

deployment across our businesses. Sustained efforts

are being made to further improve our manufacturing

efficiencies, optimise our manufacturing footprint and

reduce overall fixed costs.

Net Cash and deployment opportunities

At year-end, Sun Pharma had a strong net cash position

of approximately US$1.5 Billion. Our strong cash position

enables us to explore inorganic opportunities, including but

not limited to strengthening our global specialty portfolio.

Dear Stakeholders,

I am extremely pleased to present our Business

Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for

FY 2022-23, which highlights our steadfast commitment

to delivering sustainable value for all our stakeholders.

Our commitment to excellence extends beyond the

traditional bounds of business to encompass environmental,

social, and governance (ESG) parameters. We have

incorporated sustainability principles in our business from

the outset and have built a strong foundation for creating

a sustainable future.

As part of our commitment to sustainable development,

we recognise the importance of transparency in our

communication with stakeholders. We believe that the

BRSR is one of the essential tools to provide an accurate and

detailed account of our corporate responsibility initiatives,

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited:

letter observations

issued in May 2014. The Company does not intend to use the Karkhadi facility for drug product manufacturing for the

U.S. market. The contribution of this facility to Company’s revenues was negligible.

4.

The US FDA, on January 23, 2014, had prohibited using API manufactured at Toansa facility for manufacture of

finished drug products intended for distribution in the U.S. market. Consequentially, the Toansa manufacturing facility

was subject to certain provisions of the consent decree of permanent injunction entered in January 2012 by erstwhile

Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (which was merged with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. in March 2015). In addition, the

United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey (US DOJ) had also issued an administrative subpoena,

dated March 13, 2014, seeking information. The Company has fully cooperated and provided the requisite information

to the US DOJ. All the Drug Master Files (DMF) from Toansa Facility for the U.S. market have been withdrawn, and the

Company does not intend to use the facility for the U.S. market.

5.

The Halol facility was placed under import alert in December 2022. US FDA has exempted 14 products from import

alert, subject to certain conditions. Previously, the facility was inspected by US FDA in May 2022 and the inspection

was classified as Official Action Indicated (OAI) in August 2022. The Company is in communication with the US FDA to

resolve the outstanding issues underlying OAI status and import alert.

6.

In September 2013, the US FDA had put the Mohali facility under import alert, and it was also subjected to certain

provisions of the consent decree of permanent injunction entered in January 2012 by erstwhile Ranbaxy Laboratories

Ltd. (which was merged with Parent Company in March 2015). In March 2017, the US FDA lifted the import alert

and indicated that the facility was in compliance with the requirements of cGMP provisions mentioned in the

consent decree. The Mohali facility completed the five-year, post-certification provisions as required by the consent

decree. The August 2022 US FDA inspection of Mohali facility was classified as Official Action Indicated (OAI) and

subsequently, in April 2023, the US FDA issued a Non-Compliance: letter to the Mohali facility. As a result, US FDA has

directed the Company to take certain corrective actions at the Mohali facility before releasing further final product

batches into the US. These actions include, among others, retaining an independent cGMP expert to conduct batch

certifications of drugs manufactured at the Mohali facility and for shipment to the U.S. market.

7.

In accordance with Ind AS 108 “Operating Segments”, segment information has been given in the consolidated Ind

NOTE: 63

On March 01, 2023, the parent company disclosed an information security incident that impacted some of the Group’s IT

assets. The Group promptly took steps to contain and remediate the impact of the information security incident, including

employing appropriate containment protocols to mitigate the threat, employing enhanced security measures and utilizing

global cyber security experts to ensure the integrity of the Group’s IT systems’ infrastructure and data. As part of the

containment measures, the Group proactively isolated its network and initiated recovery procedures. As a result of these

measures, certain business operations were also impacted.

Based on the Group’s investigation, the Group currently believes that the incident’s effects on its IT system include a breach

of certain file systems and the theft of Group data and personal data. A ransomware group has claimed responsibility for

this incident.

The Group has since strengthened its cybersecurity infrastructure and is in the process of implementing improvements to

its cyber and data security systems to safeguard against such risks in the future. The Group is also implementing certain

long-term measures to augment its security controls systems across the organization. The Group worked with legal counsel

across relevant jurisdictions to notify applicable regulatory and data protection authorities, where considered required, and

the Group believes there is no material legal non-compliance by the Group on account of the information security incident.

The Group believes that all known impacts on its consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 on

account of this incident have been considered.

NOTE: 64

The date of implementation of the Code on Wages 2019 and the Code on Social Security, 2020 is yet to be notified by the

Government. The Company will assess the impact of these Codes and give effect in the consolidated financial statement

letter of appointment of Mr. Rolf Hoffmann setting

Notes to this Notice.

Brief profile and other particulars required as per Regulation

36 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)

Regulations, 2015 (“Listing Regulations”) and Secretarial

Standards on General Meetings issued by the Institute of

Company Secretaries of India, are provided under the head

“Profile of Directors” forming part of this Notice.

In terms of Section 161(1) of the Act, Mr. Rolf Hoffmann

has been appointed as an Additional Independent Director,

holding office upto this Annual General Meeting. Also,

appointment of a director is required to be approved by the

members within a time period of three months from the

appointment or at the next general meeting, whichever is

earlier, pursuant to Regulation 17(1C) of Listing Regulations.

Annual Report 2022-23

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited:

Managing Director and nephew of Mr. Sudhir Valia,

Non-Executive Director of the Company.

None of the Directors or Key Managerial Personnel of the

Company, other than Mr. Dilip Shanghvi, Mr. Sudhir Valia

and their relatives and Mr. Aalok Shanghvi and his relatives,

to whom this resolution pertains, are in any way concerned

or interested in the resolution as set out at Item No. 7 of

this Notice.

Please click here for the resolution.

Item No. 8: Approval for material related party transactions

between Taro Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc and Taro

Pharmaceuticals Inc, Canada for FY 2023-24.

Pursuant to Regulation 23(4) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations

and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“Listing

Regulations”) every Material Related Party Transaction

(‘Material RPT’) requires prior approval of the shareholders.

Related parties transactions includes the transactions

of a listed entity or any of its subsidiaries on one hand

and a related party of the listed entity or any of its

subsidiaries on the other hand. Further, Material RPT means

transaction(s) entered into individually or taken together

with previous transactions during a financial year, exceeds

₹ 10,000 Million, i.e., ₹ 1,000 crores or ten per cent of

the annual consolidated turnover as per the last audited

financial statements of the listed entity, whichever is lower.

Accordingly, the transaction between Taro Pharmaceuticals

Inc., Canada (“Taro Canada”) and Taro Pharmaceuticals USA,

Inc. (“Taro USA”), indirect non wholly-owned subsidiaries

of the Company, was identified as Material RPT, requiring

approval of the shareholders. Taro USA acts as a distributor

for Taro Canada in the US markets and the transaction is

in the interest of the Company as it brings about greater

efficiency and manages the supply chain effectively.

Approval of the shareholders was obtained at the 30th

Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) held on August 29, 2022

for transactions between Taro Canada and Taro USA for an

amount upto ₹ 20,000 Million each year, for two financial

years i.e. FY2022-23 and FY2023-24. Considering this

approval, the Corporate Governance and Ethics Committee

and the Audit Committee have approved omnibus limits

for this transaction for FY2023-24 within the approval of

the shareholders.

While providing clarifications with respect to requirement

of shareholders’ approval, SEBI has made a reference to

‘omnibus’ approval (i.e. approval for one year) in its circular

dated April 8, 2022. Omnibus approval is referred to in

Regulation 23(3) of Listing Regulations and is understood

to be an approval valid for a period of one year. What is

envisaged in Regulation 23(3) of Listing Regulations can

be construed to be relevant for approval of the Audit

Committee and not for the approval of the shareholders.

However, on a conservative basis, it is proposed that the

approval of the shareholders should also be obtained

necessarily for a period of one year and hence we are again

seeking approval for FY2023-24 from the shareholders

though the same was approved at the previous AGM.

Considering the above, the Corporate Governance

and Ethics Committee and the Audit Committee has

approved the transaction. Accordingly, approval of the

shareholders is sought for the Material RPT exceeding

a value equivalent to ₹ 10,000 Million, being the

materiality threshold, but not exceeding an aggregate

value equivalent to ₹ 20,000 Million, as set out in the

resolution at Item No. 8 as an Ordinary Resolution.
