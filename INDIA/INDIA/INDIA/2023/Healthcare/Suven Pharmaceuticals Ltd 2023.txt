Managing director has been identified as being the

Chief Operating Decision Maker and he is responsible

for allocating the resources, assess the financial

performance and position of the Company and makes

strategic decisions Refer note 30 for the segment

information presented.

d) Foreign currency translation

(i)

Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements are

measured using the currency of the primary

economic environment in which the entity

operates (‘the functional currency’). The financial

statements are presented in Indian rupee (INR),

which is Company’s functional and presentation

currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into

the functional currency using the exchange rates

at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange

gains and losses resulting from the settlement

of such transactions and from the translation

of monetary assets and liabilities denominated

in foreign currencies at year end exchange

rates are generally recognised in profit or loss.

They are deferred in equity if they relate to

qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net

investment hedges or are attributable to part

of the net investment in a foreign operation.

A monetary item for which settlement is neither

planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable

future is considered as a part of the entity’s net

investment in that foreign operation.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair

value in a foreign currency are translated using

the exchange rates at the date when the fair value

was determined. Translation differences on assets

and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as

part of the fair value gain or loss. For example,

translation differences on non- monetary assets

and liabilities such as equity instruments held at

fair value through profit or loss are recognised in

profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss

and translation differences on non-monetary

assets such as equity investments classified as

FVOCI are recognised in other comprehensive

income.

e) Fair value measurement

The Company measures financial instruments, such as,

derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell

an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly

transaction between market participants at the

measurement date. The fair value measurement is

based on the presumption that the transaction to sell

the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

•

In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

•

In the absence of a principal market, in the most

advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must

be accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured

using the assumptions that market participants would

use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that

market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes

into account a market participant’s ability to generate

economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and

best use or by selling it to another market participant

that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are

appropriate in the circumstances and for which

sufficient data are available to measure fair value,

maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and

minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured

or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised

within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows,

based on the lowest level input that is significant to

the fair value measurement as a whole::

letter to all suppliers seeking their status. Response from few

suppliers has been received and is still awaited from other suppliers. In view of this, the liability of interest calculated and

the required disclosures made, in the below table, to the extent of information available with the Company.

Managing director has been

identified as being the Chief Operating Decision

Maker. Refer note 30 for the segment information

presented.

d) Foreign currency translation

(i) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements

are measured using the currency of

the primary economic environment in

which the entity operates (‘the functional

currency’). The financial statements are

presented in Indian rupee (INR), which

is Group’s functional and presentation

currency.

(ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated

into the functional currency using

the exchange rates at the dates of the

transactions. Foreign exchange gains and

losses resulting from the settlement of such

transactions and from the translation of

monetary assets and liabilities denominated

in foreign currencies at year end exchange

rates are generally recognised in profit or

loss. They are deferred in equity if they

relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and

qualifying net investment hedges or are

attributable to part of the net investment

in a foreign operation. A monetary item

for which settlement is neither planned

nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future

is considered as a part of the entity’s net

investment in that foreign operation.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair

value in a foreign currency are translated using

the exchange rates at the date when the fair value

was determined. Translation differences on assets

and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as

part of the fair value gain or loss. For example,

translation differences on non- monetary assets

and liabilities such as equity instruments held at

fair value through profit or loss are recognised in

profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss

and translation differences on non-monetary

assets such as equity investments classified as

FVOCI are recognised in other comprehensive

income.

e) Fair value measurement

The Group measures financial instruments, such

as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet

date.

Fair value is the price that would be received to

sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an

orderly transaction between market participants

at the measurement date. The fair value

measurement is based on the presumption that

the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the

liability takes place either:

•

In the principal market for the asset or

liability, or

•

In the absence of a principal market, in the

most advantageous market for the asset or

liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market

must be accessible by the Group.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured

using the assumptions that market participants

would use when pricing the asset or liability,

assuming that market participants act in their

economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial

asset takes into account a market participant’s

ability to generate economic benefits by using

the asset in its highest and best use or by selling:

letter to all suppliers seeking their status. Response from few

suppliers has been received and is still awaited from other suppliers. In view of this, the liability of interest calculated and

the required disclosures made, in the below table, to the extent of information available with the Company.:
