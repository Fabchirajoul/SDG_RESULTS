177 Notice:

Dear Shareholders,

I am happy that your Company has achieved a growth of

8.9% in revenue and 18.9% in profit over the prior year.

We have been consistently growing faster than the market

and have continued to outperform the industry. Your Board

has recommended a dividend of H 325 per share, including a

special dividend of H 145 for FY 2022-23.

Our experienced leadership team has helped in delivering

consistent growth and enhancing shareholder value.

Our extensive product portfolio and a strong foothold in

various therapeutic segments in the market and geographies

provide us with an advantage and enable us to continue

serving the people of India.

In FY 2022-23, your Company has strengthened its

leadership in different therapies through innovation and

differentiated marketing initiatives. Some of our products

are amongst the top 50 products in the industry, with many

moving up the ranks during the year.

The pandemic has impacted the way the healthcare industry

works and at Abbott, we have led the transformation through

a sustained focus on leveraging digital health solutions

and data-led insights. Your Company has also been at the

forefront of driving patient support programs and has

continued its focus on improving the accessibility of quality

medicines across India. We have also adopted a multi-

channel communication plan to provide e-learning resources

and scientific knowledge transfer.

Prioritizing Innovation

Innovation continues to remain key for us.

Our patient-centric approach helps us to plan and deliver

a unique product mix to address growing healthcare

requirements. During the year, we launched 10 new products

in different therapeutic areas, with 4 of them being first-to-

market launches.

The right strategy and approach to investments in new

products, digital solutions, and care models have ensured

that we remain relevant to shape a sustainable future.

Post-pandemic, India witnessed a shift in consumer behavior

towards healthcare. This has resulted in an increase in

digitization of processes, e-pharmacies, and an overall

nurturing of a human-centric approach to health. We foresee

new opportunities and challenges for the industry, which

we are sufficiently prepared to address. At Abbott, we have

continued to efficiently tap into these opportunities and new

channels to reach our consumers more effectively.

The government’s Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission

(ABDM) has the potential to revolutionize the way India

approaches healthcare and improve health outcomes. We

continue to observe this trend and its overall impact on the

future of health data and management.

Annual Report 2022-23:

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE

LEADING FROM FRONT: Dear Shareholders,

This has been another remarkable year for Abbott India.

We emerged stronger and more relevant. I am pleased to

share that this year our revenue grew by 8.9%, and profits

grew by 18.9%. This was made possible because of the

continued efforts of my colleagues, the trust of our investors,

and support from all stakeholders.

We remain committed to enhancing the health of the

millions of people we serve, and we keep the needs of our

patients at the forefront of all that we do. We have designed,

developed, and provided people with what truly matters - a

healthier quality of life - whether it is through our medicines

or beyond-the-pill services.

The Multi-Specialty division launched differentiated public

initiatives such as ‘D Strong Active Life 2.0’, and ‘Sleep Well

Wake-Up Fresh’. These campaigns were supported by experts

who raised awareness about Vitamin D deficiency and sleep

health. To further strengthen the pain portfolio, Brufen P

(Ibuprofen + Paracetamol) was launched this year.

The vaccines category witnessed a slowdown during the year

due to low patient footfalls, but we continued our patient

education initiatives to increase influenza awareness among

children, pregnant women, and high-risk patients with co-

morbidities.

The Company continues to focus on digital health solutions,

data, and analytics to remain relevant and continuously

improve health outcomes. We transformed our business by

implementing various digital solutions to make our offerings

more personalized and engage better with our doctors and

patients. In order to meet increased expectations in the

marketplace, we are concentrating on overall therapy growth

across the care continuum through awareness, diagnostics,

treatment, and compliance. Our broad portfolio of market-

leading products aligns with the long-term healthcare trends

in India.

People First

A strong and dedicated sales force is vital for the effective

execution of our strategies and our continued success. Their

health and well-being are our top priority. We have provided

innovative training, coaching resources, and programs such

as the ‘Transform’ first-line manager orientation program,

the ‘BM Academy’ upskilling program for future business

leaders, and ‘Nurture’ an automated coaching platform on

our internal platform, Abbworld.

To build on our inclusive culture, various Employee Resource

Groups (ERG) were launched within our organization.

We have shaped our policies and strategies to achieve our

long-term objective of building a diverse and innovative

workforce of tomorrow. We give our employees the tools

and ecosystem they need to reach their greatest potential by

enabling them to take charge of their overall health and well-

being. We also have an Employee Assistance Program (EAP)

that offers customized counseling and resource services to

support employees and even their families.

Building a Healthier Tomorrow

Our business is about helping people live healthier and better.

To do that, we strive each day to ensure we are building

sustainable health solutions. Our commitment to sustainable

business starts at the top of our organization and is integrated

across the Company. We have a global 2030 sustainability

plan focused on designing access and affordability into our

life-changing technologies and products. We continue to find

new solutions for chronic health conditions and infectious

diseases. With consistent efforts of our Environment, Health

and Safety (EHS), sustainability, commercial, HR and other

colleagues, we remain committed to our Environmental,

Social and Governance (ESG) goals.

Our customers trust our products, and it is crucial for us that

we uphold the highest standards of quality at every stage

of the process. Further, we strongly believe that driving a

culture of zero non-compliance is critical for us and our

business success. We are proud to have launched an internal

campaign across various functions to further strengthen our

compliance culture through tangible and concrete steps.

Safeguarding the environment is another area of priority

for us. Evolving our operations to reduce our environmental

footprint will also help us build a more resilient business

for the long term. Reduced water usage, CO2 emissions, and

responsible waste management are focus areas where we

have taken the right steps to ensure a positive change. We

have installed solar panels at our Goa plant to harness clean

energy, thus reducing the carbon footprint of this site. We

have been able to consistently maintain zero waste to landfill,

and this helps us achieve and promote our sustainability

goals.

Ensuring Sustainable Growth

Working and winning together has been fundamental to our

collective success, and in the next fiscal year, we reaffirm our

dedication to delivering outstanding value to our shareholders

and customers. We will continue to work side-by-side with the

people and communities we serve, partners, government, and

other stakeholders to address health disparities, expand access

and remove barriers that prevent people from living healthy

lives wherever they are.

With your support, we will remain steadfast in our

transformational journey toward a brighter and more successful

future. Once again, I express gratitude to our partners,

customers, and shareholders for the trust they have placed in us.

Conservation of Energy, Technology Absorption and Foreign Exchange Earnings and Outgo

[In compliance with the provisions of Section 134(3)(m) of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 8 of the Companies

(Accounts) Rules, 2014]

A. Conservation of Energy

Following energy and water conservation measures were

undertaken during the year :

i.

Energy conservation measures :

•

Installation of solar PV panel to harness green

energy. Following were the benefits derived

from the project :

•

System is capable to generate approx.

314 MWH/annum;

•

Carbon emission is reduced to approx.

228 MT/annum;

•

Guaranteed generation for 20 years.

•

Project was undertaken at the Goa plant

for reducing energy consumption under A3

Program. Brainstorming was done for a week

and implemented these ideas generated to

reduce daily energy consumption by 1% i.e.,

180 KWH/day without CAPEX investments.

ii.

Water conservation measures :

Reduction in tanker water consumption :

•

The site is supported by three sources of

water i.e., tanker, raw water and treated

wastewater. The tanker water is used only

for

de-mineralized

plant/purified

water

system water generation. Raw water and

treated wastewater are used for all other

purposes in the plant. Earlier, there was more

dependence on the expensive tanker water,

which has now reduced by approximately two

tankers everyday leading to a cost saving of

` 0.04 Crores/annum.

•

The reject water from the Reverse Osmosis

(RO) is utilized back in utilities and washroom.

With this 16,425 KL of water will be saved

annually.

iii. The steps taken by the Company for utilizing

alternate sources of energy – Harnessed solar

power by installing Solar Photovoltaic (PV) cells.

iv. The Capital Investment on Energy Conservation

Equipment – ` 1.5 Crores for installing solar

Photovoltaic (PV) panels.

B.

Technology Absorption

i.

Efforts made towards Technology Absorption

and

the

benefits

derived

like

product

improvement,

cost

reduction,

product

development or import substitution :

Following pioneering and innovative changes were

initiated during the year in solid manufacturing

process :

•

Increase in Digene batch size due to Overall

Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) improvement

by in granulation, compression and packaging.

This resulted in reduction in changeover time,

line clearance time, documentation and testing

by 25%.

•

Implemented a method of reformulating

Brufen using pre-gelatinized starch. The

process of preparing starch paste and adding

into the granulation process was eliminated.

The pre gelatinized starch in powder form was

directly added in rapid mixer granulator during

granulation. This resulted in eliminating the

risk of contact to hot surface/material and fall

of paste container from height.

The above initiatives led to overall reduction in

manpower.
