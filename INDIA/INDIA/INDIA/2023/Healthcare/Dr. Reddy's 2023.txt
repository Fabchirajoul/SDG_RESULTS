Integrated Annual Report 2022-23:

Managing Director

One of the most

satisfying indicators

of progress for us is

employee participation

in our sustainability

agenda. ‘Good Health

Can’t Wait’ is a

movement and call to

action for all of us.

Recognitions

Some of our efforts resulted in high

honours for us in FY2023 – we

received an award from the President

of India on the International Day of

Persons with Disabilities in December

2022 for our work in providing

placement through Dr. Reddy’s

Foundation. For the sixth year in

a row, we were the only India-

headquartered pharma Company

in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality

Index for 2023. We were recognised

by the prestigious Science Magazine

in 2022 as being among the top 20

employers in pharma/biotech globally,

scoring well in ‘treats employees with

respect’, ‘is socially responsible’ and

‘provides employees with autonomy’.

Beyond the social realm, recently, the

Financial Times and Statista named

us as an Asia-Pacific Climate Leader

in their 2023 list. Each one of these

recognitions is a humbling reminder of

the years of effort it takes to achieve

excellence and of the long road ahead.

We are grateful to all our shareholders,

patients, the healthcare community,

partners, customers, suppliers,

regulators and our employees for

their trust in us. We hope you find this

Integrated Report a valuable source of

information. We count on your support

as we move towards the 40th year of

our Company next year.

Dear Member,

Your Directors are pleased to present the

39th Annual Report of the Company for

the year ended March 31, 2023.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS AND

COMPANY AFFAIRS

Table 1 gives the consolidated and

standalone financial highlights of the

Company based on Indian Accounting

Standards (Ind AS) for FY2023 (i.e.

from April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023)

compared to the previous financial year.

The Company’s consolidated total

income for the year was C257.3 billion,

which was up by 17% over the previous

year. Profit before tax (PBT) was C60.5

billion, representing an increase of 98%

over the previous year.

The Company’s standalone total income

for the year was C175.5 billion, which was

up by 18% over the previous year. PBT

was C38.7 billion, which was higher by

74% over the previous year.

Revenues from lines of business and

geographies given below are from

the Company’s IFRS results.

was growth across businesses of North

America Generics, Europe and India.

Revenues from North America stood at

C101.7 billion, registering a strong year

on year growth of 36%. This was largely

new products launched, increase in

volumes for some of our base products

partly offset by high price erosions in

some of our products. During the year,

the Company filed 12 Abbreviated New

Drug Applications (ANDAs) in the USA.

As of March 31, 2023, there were 86

generic filings awaiting approval with

STEPS TAKEN BY THE COMPANY

FOR UTILIZING ALTERNATE

SOURCES OF ENERGY

• Roof top solar power plants of

690 KW got commissioned in

FTO-11& APSL plants.1.8 MW

hydel power supply started to

FTO-7,9 &11 plants.3.4 MW solar

power supply started to FTO-3

plant, 4 MW solar power supply

started to APSL plant.

• With the above renewable

capacity additions, the total roof

top capacity has become 6 MW,

59 MW third party PPA’s (solar &

hydel), 7.7 MW Cogen plant on

biomass fuel and 15 MW solar

plants through JVC.

• With above renewable power

additions, we have reduced

~17,954 tons of Scope-2 CO2

emissions during FY 23.

• We have converted 7.7 MW Co-

generation plant from coal to

biomass fuel in CTO-6 and which

will result in avoiding around ~

1,77,737 tons of Scope-1 CO2

emissions per year.

• We have also commissioned two

new 5 TPH biomass fired boilers

at FTO-11 and FTO PU-1 plants

respectively.

(III) THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT

ON ENERGY CONSERVATION

EQUIPMENT’S & PROJECTS:

• During the year, the Company

has implemented energy

conservation projects across

its various business units and

accrued savings of approximately

C386 million against an

investment of C440 million.

• With the above energy saving

projects implementation, we

have reduced ~40,000 tons of

CO2 emissions during the year.

• Additional C518.2 million is

being spent for the energy

conservation and emission

reduction projects including 13.6

MW renewable power through a

hybrid project of wind and solar

through ISTS, 3 MW hydel project

to become captive consumer and

TERM OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP

Based on recommendations of

the Nomination, Governance and

Compensation Committee (“NGCC”), the

Board considers the appointment and

re-appointment of Directors.

Section 149(10) of the Act, provides

that an independent director shall hold

office up to five consecutive years on

the Board of a company from the date

of appointment and shall be eligible

for re-appointment for a second term

of up to five consecutive years on

passing of a special resolution by the

members. Moreover, independent

directors cannot retire by rotation.

Further, Regulation 25(2A) of the

SEBI Listing Regulations, provides

that appointment, re-appointment or

removal of an independent director of

a listed entity, shall be subject to the

approval of shareholders by way of a

special resolution.

During FY2023, the members of the

Company approved the appointment of

Mr. Arun M Kumar (DIN: 09665138) as an

Independent Director of the Company

in terms of Section 149 of the Act and

applicable provisions of the SEBI Listing

Regulations through Postal Ballot

process, with effect from August 1, 2022.

Section 152 of the Act, states that one-

third of the Board members, other than

independent directors, who are subject

to retire by rotation, shall retire at every

Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) and be

eligible for re-appointment, if approved

by the members. During FY2023,

Mr. K Satish Reddy (DIN: 00129701), who

retired by rotation, was re-appointed

at the 38th AGM under Section 152 of

the Act. Mr. K Satish Reddy was also

of five years with effect from October

1, 2022.

Mr. G V Prasad (DIN: 00057433) retires

being eligible, seeks re-appointment.

Therefore, at the forthcoming AGM,

approval of members is being sought for

re-appointment of Mr. G V Prasad, who

retires by rotation and, being eligible,

offers himself for re-appointment, as

Director, designated as Co-Chairman and: Managing Director of the Company.

BOARD PROCEDURE

SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF

NEW DIRECTORS

Recommending any new member on the

Board is the responsibility of the NGCC

of the Board, which consists entirely

of Independent Directors. Given the

existing composition of the Board, the

years left of the existing members to

serve on the Board, and the need for new

domain expertise the NGCC evaluates

the balance of skills, knowledge and

experience on the Board as well as

description of the role and capabilities

required of a Director on the Board.

When such a need becomes apparent,

the NGCC reviews potential candidates

in terms of their expertise, attributes,

personal and professional backgrounds

and their ability to attend meetings.

It then places its recommendation

of the shortlisted candidate(s) to the

Board for its consideration. If the Board

approves, the person is appointed as

an Additional Director. Thereafter, the

approval of members is sought in terms

of the provisions of the Act and the SEBI

Listing Regulations.

INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

The Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations,

inter alia, define an ‘independent

director’ as a person who, including his/

her relatives, is or was not a promoter or

employee or key managerial personnel

of the company or its subsidiaries.

Further, the person and his/ her relatives

should not have a material pecuniary

relationship or transactions with the

Company or its subsidiaries, during the

three immediate preceding financial

years or during the current financial

year, apart from receiving remuneration

as an independent director. There are

various other conditions prescribed

for independent directors under the

provisions of the Act and the SEBI

Listing Regulations.

We abide by these definitions of

Independent Director, in addition to the

definition of an Independent Director

as laid down in the New York Stock

Exchange (“NYSE”) Listed Company

Manual and other provisions by virtue of

our listing on the NYSE in the US.

Based on the disclosures received from

all Independent Directors, the Board has

formed an opinion that the Independent

Directors fulfill the conditions specified

in the Act and the SEBI Listing

Regulations, and are independent of

the Management.

As on March 31, 2023, the Company has

7 Non-Executive Independent Directors

(including 3 Women Directors) which

comprise 78% of the total strength of

the Board of Directors. The maximum

tenure of the Independent Directors is

in accordance with the Act and the SEBI

Listing Regulations. The NGCC identifies

candidates based on certain criteria laid

down and takes into consideration the

need for diversity of the Board which,

inter alia, includes skills, knowledge,

gender and experience and accordingly

makes its recommendations to the Board.

MEETINGS OF INDEPENDENT

DIRECTORS

Schedule IV of the Act and Regulation 25

of the SEBI Listing Regulations mandate

that the independent directors of the

Company shall hold at least one meeting

in a year, without the attendance of non-

independent directors and members

of the management. To exercise free

and fair judgment in all matters related

to the functioning of the Company as

well as the Board, it is important for

the Independent Directors to have

meetings without the presence of the

executive management.

During FY2023, our Independent

Directors met four times in sessions

without the presence of Executive

Directors and other members of the

Management. The Company is ready

to facilitate more such sessions as and

when required by the Independent

Directors. During these meetings, the

Independent Directors reviewed the

performance of the Company and of the

Managing Director

and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) are

permanent invitees to all STOC meetings.

Officials heading IPDO, GMO, quality,

PSAI and biologics are also invited to the

meetings. The Head of IPDO acts as the

Secretary of the STOC.

The STOC met four times during the

year. Table 8 gives the composition and

attendance record of the STOC, and

objectives appropriate to the working of

can attract, retain and encourage

critical talent to meet important

organisational goals and strategies.

The compensation will be the

mix of fixed pay, variable pay,

performance based incentive plans

or stock options. The executive

total compensation program will

be flexible to differentiate pay to

recognise an individual incumbents’

critical skills, contributions, and

future potential to impact the

organisation’s success;

4)

Other employees – The

compensation program for

employees is designed to help

drive performance culture and

align employees for the creation

of sustainable value through

behaviors like execution excellence,

innovation and leadership. In line

with the organisation principles

of managing the long-term

and meritocracy, there are four

principles of pay which have

been enumerated – ability to pay,

position-linked pay, person-specific

pay and performance-linked pay.

The Company may periodically

review the compensation and

benefits at all levels to ensure that

the Company remains competitive

and is able to attract and retain

desirable talent.

The Committee may review the

overall compensation approach for

employees and on any changes

done for the entire organisation.

1.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

a)

Statement of compliance

These financial statements as of and for the year ended

31 March 2023 comply in all material aspects with

the Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) notified

under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules, 2015, and presentation requirements of

Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013,

and as amended from time to time together with the

comparative period data as at and for the year ended

31 March 2022.

These financial statements have been prepared by the

Company as a going concern on the basis of relevant

Ind AS that are effective or elected for early adoption at

the Company’s annual reporting date, 31 March 2023.

These financial statements were authorised for issuance

by the Company’s Board of Directors on 10 May 2023.

b)

Basis of measurement

These financial statements have been prepared

on the historical cost convention and on an accrual

basis, except for the following material items in the

balance sheet:

• derivative financial instruments are measured at

fair value;

• financial assets are measured either at fair value or

at amortised cost depending on the classification;

• employee defined benefit assets/(liabilities) are

recognised as the net total of the fair value of plan

assets, adjusted for actuarial gains/(losses) and the

present value of the defined benefit obligation;

• long-term borrowings are measured at amortised

cost using the effective interest rate method;

• share-based payments are measured at fair value;

• assets held for sale are measured at fair value;

• assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of

business combinations are measured at fair value;

• Contingent consideration arising out of business

combination are measured at fair value; and

present value of lease payments that are not paid

at that date. This amount is adjusted for any lease

payments made at or before the commencement

date, lease incentives received and initial direct

costs, incurred, if any.

c)

Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity

with Ind AS requires management to make judgements,

estimates and assumptions that affect the application

of accounting policies and the reported amounts of

assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results

may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on

an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates

are recognised in the period in which the estimates are

revised and in any future periods affected. In particular,

information about significant areas of estimation

uncertainty and critical judgements in applying

accounting policies that have the most significant effect

on the amounts recognised in the financial statements

is included in the following notes:

• Note 1.3 (b) — Assessment of functional currency;

• Note 1.3 (c) — Financial instruments;

• Note 1.3 (d) — Business combinations and goodwill;

• Notes 1.3 (e) and 1.3 (f) — Useful lives of property,

plant and equipment and intangible assets;

• Notes 1.3(g) – Determination of cost for right-of-use

assets and lease term;

letter from Chairman and Co-Chairman included in the Annual report, which is expected to be made available

to us after that date. The other information does not include the Standalone financial statements, Consolidated financial statements

and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we

do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing

so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge

obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that

there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Key audit matters

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

• We inspected relevant communication with tax authorities.

• We involved tax experts in assessing the nature and amount of

material tax positions and assessed the technical merits based on the

correspondence and assessments from the relevant tax authorities.

• We also evaluated the disclosures made in the consolidated financial

statements.

Rebates, discounts, chargebacks, and other deductions in Revenue (as described in note 1.3(n) of the significant accounting policies of

consolidated financial statements and note 2.14 of the consolidated financial statements)

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for chargeback,

rebates, sales returns and discounts, etc. The estimates

relating to these accruals are important given the

significance of revenue and also considering the

distinctive terms of arrangement with customers.

These estimates are complex and requires significant

judgement and estimation by the Company for

establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy of

revenues may deviate on account of change in

judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has

been considered as a key audit matter.

• We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the

operating effectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction

processes.

• We also tested management’s controls over the methods for making

estimates, data and assumptions of the estimates used to calculate

the sales deductions.

• We tested management’s estimated sales deductions and obtained

management’s calculations for the respective estimates. We tested

management’s estimates over the determination of sales deductions

accruals by comparing the rates used in management’s estimate to

rates in the underlying contracts and historical sales deductions data.

• We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical

rebates, discounts, allowances and returns, as applicable to current

payment trends.

• We also considered the historical accuracy of the management’s

estimates in prior years and assessed the estimated amounts, we

evaluated trends in actual sales and discount accrual balances.

• We also tested the underlying data used in management’s

calculations for accuracy and completeness and verified source data

supporting the inventory levels, rebate claims paid subsequent to

period end, the historical sales and sales return levels and volume

discounts settled during the period.

• We tested recording of revenue in appropriate period which

included the following procedures:

• Performed trend analysis over sales levels as compared to previous

periods;

• Tested management’s monitoring process over distributors’

stocking levels;

• Verified sample sales transactions near period-end.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial

statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated

financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in

equity of the Group and joint venture in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian

Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and joint ventures are responsible

for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of

the Group and of its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of

appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation

and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness

of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and

fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation

of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its

joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its joint ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing,

as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends

to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Charged with Governance are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of its

joint ventures.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high

level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement

when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could

reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the

audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design

and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a

basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,

as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate

in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the

Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating

effectiveness of such controls.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related

disclosures made by management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence

obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of

the Group and joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to

draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are

inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.

However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and

whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair

presentation.

• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within

the Group of which we are the independent auditors and whose financial information we have audited, to express an opinion

on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of

the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent

auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors,

such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We

remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated

financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the

audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

letter dated

30 April 2014 that the Company had violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the “CPSA”) and the Poison Prevention Packaging

Act (the “PPPA”) and that the CPSC intended to seek civil penalties. Specifically, the CPSC asserted, among other things, that from

or about 14 August 2008 through 1 June 2012, the Company sold prescription drugs having unit dose packaging that failed to

comply with the CPSC’s special child resistant packaging regulations under the PPPA and failed to issue general certificates of

conformance. In addition, the CPSC asserted that the Company violated the CPSA by failing to immediately advise the CPSC of the

alleged violations. The Company disagrees with the CPSC’s allegations.

Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) began to investigate a sealed complaint which was filed in the United

States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (“Court”) under the Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) related to these

same issues (the “FCA Complaint”). The Company cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation. The DOJ and all States involved in

the investigation filed a notice of declination stating each would not intervene in the FCA Complaint. On 10 November 2015, the

FCA Complaint was unsealed and the plaintiff whistleblowers, who are two former employees of the Company, proceeded without

the DOJ’s and applicable States’ involvement. The unsealed FCA Complaint relates to the 6 blister pack products originally subject

to the investigation and also 38 of the Company’s generic prescription products sold in the U.S. in various bottle and cap packaging.

The Company filed its response to the plaintiff’s FCA Complaint on 23 February 2016 in the form of a motion to dismiss for failure to

state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On 26 March 2017, the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss, dismissing

the FCA Complaint and allowing the plaintiffs one more chance to refile this complaint in an attempt to plead sustainable allegations.

The total goodwill of `260 consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from the acquired business, together

with the value of the workforce acquired. This goodwill has been assigned to the Company’s Global Generics segment.

The amount of revenue and loss pertaining to the acquired business was not material for the year ended 31 March 2023.

2.39

Impact of military conflict between Russia and Ukraine

The Company considered the uncertainty relating to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine in assessing the recoverability of

receivables, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets. The outcome of the war is difficult to predict, and it could have an

adverse impact on the macroeconomic environment. Management has considered all potential impacts of the war including adherence

of global sanctions and other restrictive measures against Russia and any retaliatory actions taken by Russia. For this purpose, the

Company considered internal and external sources of information up to the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s supply chain has been impacted primarily in Russia and Ukraine, both in terms of higher freight costs and increase in

the lead time by suppliers to deliver products. However, the Company has been able to service its customers without any significant

shortages or disruptions. The Company based on its judgments, estimates and assumptions including sensitivity analysis, expects

to fully recover the carrying amount of receivables, inventory, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets. Accordingly,

during the year ended 31 March 2023, the impact of this conflict on the Company’s operations and financial condition was not material.

The Company will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.
