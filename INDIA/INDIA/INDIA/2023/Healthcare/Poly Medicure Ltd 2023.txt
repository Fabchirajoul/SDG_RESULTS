177:

Dear Shareholders,

It is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I present to you our

Annual Report 2022-23, highlighting our achievements, progress, and

promising prospects. Despite encountering various challenges, such as

the global recession, high inflation impacting EU nations, and COVID-

related obstacles in China, I am proud to announce that our Company

successfully navigated through these dynamic situations, leading to a

commendable financial performance.

I’d like to provide you with a concise overview of the turnover and

profitability data for the year under review. At the consolidated level,

Your Company recorded significant accomplishments during the year,

achieving net sales of ` 1,115.23 Crores, EBITDA of ` 303.50 Crores,

and a profit after tax of ` 179.28 Crores. This marks notable growth

compared to the previous year’s figures, which stood at net sales of

` 923.06 Crores, EBITDA of ` 253.45 Crores, and a profit after tax of

` 146.51 Crores.

At our Company, we have faced various challenges, including market

changes, government regulations, health situations, rising costs, and

higher customer expectations. However, we view these challenges

as opportunities rather than risks. Our approach involves using

our strategy, values, and vision to tackle these obstacles head-on,

turning them into chances to showcase our best results and continue

progressing, regardless of the circumstances.

Your Company is dedicated to fostering inclusive growth and cultivating

long-term relationships with all stakeholders, emphasizing mutual trust

and respect. As part of this commitment, the company has actively

undertaken various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.

In the year under review, your Company continued the tradition and

allocated ` 315.34 lacs towards various initiatives. These initiatives

were primarily focused on promotion of education, welfare of disabled

persons, along with social welfare.

I’m excited to share that your Company has been working hard to

become more sustainable. We’ve been making efforts to use less water,

reduce waste, and save energy in the past few years. We plan to keep

investing in new ideas to make our carbon footprint in the future.

Our expertise in research and development, dedication to innovation, and

focus on quality have enabled us to produce top-of-the-line products

that are of high quality and cost-effective. These products have found

success in both the domestic and export markets. As we move forward,

POLYMED will remain committed to being the most trusted and reliable

supplier of medical devices for both the Indian and International market.

The Management of Polymed is wholeheartedly committed to creating

a supportive, nurturing, and rewarding work environment, which has

been instrumental in achieving the success we have today. I would

like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to all of you, our esteemed and

valued shareholders, for your unwavering support and confidence in

the Company. On behalf of the Board, I also express my gratitude to

our stakeholders, partners, customers, bankers, and employees. Your

continued support has been instrumental in building POLYMED into a

world-class organization. Thank you for being an essential part of our

journey and contributing to our success.

With regards,

D.r. Mehta
