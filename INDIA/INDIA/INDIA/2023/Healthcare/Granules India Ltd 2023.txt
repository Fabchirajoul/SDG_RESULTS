Message from the Chairman

&: Managing

Dear Stakeholders,

I hope you will find the Annual

Report 2022-23 to be engaging

and informative, as it provides a

comprehensive overview of how

Granules is managing its business in

an increasingly integrated manner to

reflect our new purpose of ‘Healing

lives responsibly through pioneering

green science’.

A Year of Growth

I am pleased to report that our

Company's performance has shown

significant improvement over

the past year. In FY 2022-23, we

experienced a 20% surge in revenue,

accompanied by impressive growth

rates of 27% in EBITDA and 25%

in PAT.

In terms of operating cash flow,

FY 2022-23 was an outstanding year.

Thanks to our strategic initiatives,

we successfully generated a robust

operational cash flow of

₹ 7,387 million. Despite incurring

buyback expenses of ₹ 3,110

million and unanticipated capital

expenditures of ₹ 919 million for

our green technology initiatives,

our net debt increased by a modest

₹ 705 million compared to the

previous year.

Our revenue growth is particularly

noteworthy considering the ongoing

price erosion in the US market

and the distribution challenges we

encountered with our previous

third-party logistics provider. This

growth can be attributed to the

significant increase in sales of API

and FD products, particularly in key

markets such as the US and EU.

During the year, we have

successfully filed seven ANDAs with

USFDA, two dossiers in the EU, and

two ANDAs in CA. Additionally, we

have submitted seven US DMFs and

five CEPs. Furthermore, it gives me

immense pleasure to announce that

we have received approvals for five

ANDAs from the USFDA during the

same period.

Our capital expenditures for the

year amounted to ₹ 4,106 millions

underscoring our commitment

to investing in our future growth.

We have made substantial

enhancements to our paracetamol

API capacity and anticipate a

surge in MUPS block utilization

for the upcoming financial year.

Furthermore, we are actively

expanding our footprint in the

EU through strategic business

partnerships and the sale of dossiers

for our FD products.

Notably, the construction of the

new formulation facility at Genome

Valley is progressing at a good pace,

and we anticipate the completion of

Phase 1 by October 2023 and Phase

2 by May 2024. Upon completion,

this plant will augment our current

capacity of 24 billion units of

Finished Dosages (FDs) by an

additional eight billion units.

Additionally, we successfully

launched our new greenfield

packaging facility in Virginia,

USA, and obtained FDA approval.

The integration of this facility will

significantly bolster our operations

in both the OTC and Rx segments

of our portfolio. It will also enable

us to optimize our supply chain

efficiency in the US, resulting in cost

reductions and an improved working

capital cycle.

Investing in Innovation and R&D

During FY 2022-23, our primary

focus was on fortifying our R&D and

product development capabilities

through innovation and advanced

technology platforms. By allocating

a significantly higher budget

for R&D expenditure, we aim to

establish Granules as a research and

development-driven organization.

These strategic initiatives are

geared towards expanding our

capabilities, improving the quality

of our portfolio, and increasing the

number of regulatory filings.

Granules' Commitment to

Combatting Climate Change

Climate change represents one

of humanity’s most pressing

challenges. Its impact extends

beyond borders, posing profound

challenges to the stability of nations,

economies, and ecosystems.

Consequently, our planet and

society face significant obstacles.

The economic consequences of

climate change are extensive,

affecting industries, supply chains,

and financial systems on

a large scale.

Building a successful business

involves identifying and addressing

the problems society faces. In

the face of the climate crisis,

corporations have a crucial

responsibility to pioneer innovative

solutions and drive positive change.

Customers are increasingly seeking

sustainable products and services,

and businesses that can meet this

demand will be well-positioned

to succeed in the years to come.

By aligning purpose and profit,

businesses can reshape the world

for the better, leaving a lasting

legacy for future generations.

Sustainability Initiatives at

Granules

Granules has taken a deliberate

approach to embedding

sustainability within its business

operations and decision-making

process. Driven by a strong sense

of environmental responsibility,

Granules is dedicated to achieving

Net Zero by 2050, further

affirming its commitment to a

sustainable future.

During the year, we completed the

baselining process, benchmarked

sustainability practices, and

conducted a materiality assessment.

Moving forward, Granules intends

to establish and communicate

comprehensive goals to all

stakeholders, across the identified

material areas. Our ambition is to

become an industry leader and a

global frontrunner in sustainability,

driving positive change at scale.

Transforming for the

Greater Good

Amidst an ever-changing business

landscape, we embrace the potential

of innovation and adaptability. Our

transformation journey rests on a

Transforming Healthcare through Innovation

and Sustainability

As a reflection of our commitment to combat climate change, we

have entered a partnership with Greenko to establish the integrated

green pharmaceutical zone in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh. To support

this endeavor, we have established Granules CZRO, a wholly-owned

subsidiary of Granules India Limited. This subsidiary is dedicated to

manufacturing products with a near-zero carbon footprint. We have

made substantial advancements in developing various technologies

for this purpose and have also formed partnerships with esteemed

academic institutions and companies to drive innovation in this domain.

steadfast dedication to creating a

future-ready organization, capable

of thriving in the face of evolving

challenges and seizing emerging

opportunities. We aim to develop

the necessary capabilities and

competencies that propel us toward

enduring success in today's fiercely

competitive environment.

As we embark on this ongoing

journey, with careful deliberation,

we have revitalized our purpose,

vision, and values, ensuring

they embody our commitment to

transformation. As you read through

the report, I hope you gain an

overview of what we mean.

In Gratitude

Let me conclude by expressing my

heartfelt gratitude to the Board

of Directors for their continued

guidance. My deepest appreciation

goes to our employees for their

dedication and pursuit of excellence.

Finally, I would also like to extend

my gratitude to all our stakeholders

for their continued faith and

of which 8 are approved and 3 are under review. In Canada, we

filed 7 applications (2 in FY 22-23) of which 5 are approved and

2 are under review. Total of 7 applications were filed in other

markets (South Africa, Belarus, Israel) which are under review.

Granules received 05 ANDA approvals from USFDA in the

financial year (2022-2023). These on-time approvals exemplify

the quality of our ANDA filings. We also received approval for

06 marketing authorization applications in the European region

and 02 applications in Canada.

We aim to continue this momentum by executing products

of different complexity in each dosage form viz. immediate

release, extended-release, delayed-release, MUPS, and

powders for suspensions.

Way Forward

We will continue to leverage our knowledge and experience

in our core products to expand them into new markets and

dosage forms. This would not only help us to bring economies

of scale, but also, mitigate market-concentrated risk. Steps have

been taken in this direction during this financial year, and as an

outcome, we filed three dossiers in the European market and

working to file additional markets in the coming year.

We will continue to identify and develop complex products

with limited competition and bring process efficiencies for

our existing products to have a competitive advantage in the

market. Looking forward to bringing considerable progress

in our technical capabilities to achieve a higher number of

regulatory filings. Thus, bringing focus on our R&D activities

will enhance our product registrations and filings across a

diversified product portfolio for the key markets, as well as

strengthen our global presence.

Managing Director

Managing Director

Joint: Managing

Managing Director of the Company

is responsible for allocating resources and assessing

performance of the operating segments and accordingly

is identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker

(CODM). All operating segments’ operating results are

reviewed regularly by the CODM to make decisions about

resources to be allocated to the segments and assess

their performance.

The Company operates in one reportable business

segment i.e. “Pharmaceuticals”.

m. Revenue

i.

Sale of goods

Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when

a promise in a customer contract(performance

obligation) has been satisfied by transferring control

over the promised goods to the customer. Control is

usually transferred upon shipment, delivery to, upon

receipt of goods by the customer, in accordance

with the delivery and acceptance terms agreed

with the customers. The amount of revenue to be

recognized is based on the consideration expected

to be received in exchange for goods, excluding

applicable discounts, sales returns and any taxes or

duties collected on behalf of the government which

are levied on sales such as GST where applicable.

Any additional amounts based on terms of agreement

entered into with customers, is recognized in the

period when the collectability becomes probable and

a reliable measure of the same is available.

ii.

Sales return allowances

The Company accounts for sales return by recording

an allowance for sales return concurrent with the

recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale.

The allowance is based on Company’s estimate

of expected sales returns. The estimate of sales

return is determined primarily by the Company’s

historical experience in the markets in which the

Company operates.

iii. Export incentives

Export incentives are recognized as income when the

right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme

is established in respect of the exports made and

where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the

ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

iv. Interest income or expense

Interest income or expense is recognized using the

effective interest method on time proportion method.

v.

Dividend income

Dividend income is recognized when the Company’s

right to receive dividend is established, which is

generally when shareholders approve the dividend.

n.

Contract Balances

i.

Contract assets

A contract asset is the right to consideration in

exchange for goods or services transferred to the

customer. If the Company performs by transferring

goods or services to a customer before the

customer pays consideration or before payment is

due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned

consideration that is conditional.

ii.

Trade receivable

A receivable is recognized if an amount of

consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the

passage of time is required before payment of the

consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of

financial assets in section (a) Financial instruments –

initial recognition and subsequent measurement.

iii.

Contract liabilities

A contract liability is the obligation to transfer

goods or services to a customer for which the

Company has received consideration (or an amount

of consideration is due) from the customer. If a

customer pays consideration before the Company

transfers goods or services to the customer, a

contract liability is recognized when the payment is

made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier).

Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when

the Company performs under the contract.

o.

Leases

At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether

a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains,

a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use

of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange

for consideration.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to

control the use of an identified asset, the Company

assesses whether

⊲ The contract involves use of an identified asset, whether

specified explicitly or implicitly;

⊲ The Company has the right to obtain substantially all of

the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout

the period of use;

⊲ The Company has right to direct the use of the asset by

either having right to operate the asset or the Company

having designed the asset in a way that predetermines

how and for what purpose it will be used.

(i)

As lessee

The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist

of leases for buildings and plant and machinery. The

Company, at the inception of a contract, assesses

whether the contract is a lease or not. A contract is,

or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right

to control the use of an identified asset for a time in

exchange for a consideration.

The Company elected to use the following practical

expedients on initial application

⊲ Applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of

leases with similar characteristics

⊲ Applied the exemption not to recognise right-

of-use assets and liabilities for leases with less

than 12 months of lease term on the date of initial

application

⊲ Excluded the initial direct costs from the

measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date

of initial application.

At inception of a contract, the Company assesses

whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract

is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right

to control the use of an identified asset for a period

of time in exchange for consideration. To assess

whether a contract conveys the right to control the

use of an identified asset, the Company uses the

definition of a lease in Ind AS 116. At inception or

on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease

component, the Company allocates the consideration

in the contract to each lease component on the basis

of their relative stand-alone prices. However, for the

leases of buildings in which it is a lessee, the Company

has elected not to separate non-lease components

and account for the lease and non-lease components

as a single lease component.

The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and

a lease liability at the lease commencement date.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost,

which comprises the initial amount of the lease

liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or

before the commencement date, plus any initial direct

costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle

amount pertaining to the Key Management Personnel and their relatives is not ascertainable and, therefore, not included above.

ii) *Foreign currency balances included above have been shown at restated values arrived by using the closing exchage rates

iii) The Company has established a comprehensive system of maintenance of information and documents as required by the

transfer pricing regulations under Sections 92-92F of the Income-Tax Act, 1961. Since the law requires existence of such information

and documentation to be contemporaneous in nature, the Company continuously updates its documents for the international

transactions entered into with the associated enterprises during the financial year. The management is of the opinion that its

international transactions are at arm’s length so that the aforesaid legislation will not have any impact on the standalone financial

statements, particularly on the amount of tax expense for the year and that of provision for taxation.

iv) There were no loans or advances in the nature of loans granted by the Company to promoters, Directors, Key managerial

persons and the related parties (as defined under Companies Act, 2013), either severally or jointly with any other person, that

were repayable on demand or without specifying any terms or period of repayment.

32. Fair Values

The management assessed that loans, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, current borrowings, trade payables and

other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a

current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
