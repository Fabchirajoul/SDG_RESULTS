Dear Shareholders,

The evolution of new technologies

and medical discoveries as well as

innovative combinations of existing

ones are fundamentally changing

how we prevent, diagnose and cure

diseases. At Cipla, we are immersed

in building solutions across the care

continuum backed by data-driven

insights, scientific advancements

and technological innovations. We are

scripting an aggressive growth story to

build the Cipla of the future – Pioneering,

Innovative and Firmly rooted in Care.

Companies with purpose, thrive

In a world that is increasingly getting

complex, purpose is a great anchor. We

have embedded it into our business

blueprint to help us deliver on our vision

to be a global healthcare organisation,

underpinned by innovation and digital

transformation.

Built on the cornerstone of care, a

humanitarian approach towards

healthcare is deeply ingrained in our DNA.

It makes us who we are. It’s this passion

and purpose that inspires me and 25,000+

Ciplaites to come to work each day and

give meaning to ‘Caring for Life’. Our people

are the biggest enablers of our vision to

build a future-fit Cipla and is imperative

to foster a culture of care, inclusion and

empathy within the organisation. Our rich

legacy of 87 years has a treasure trove

that inspires us to be a Force For Good.

Some emanating from our deep empathy

towards patients, some addressing the

need gap in the market and some simply

about our passion and purpose to help

make a difference in the lives of patients.

In FY 2022-23 we have earned

recognitions and accolades across

the Cipla universe. Our culture of care

bagged us the Great Place To Work® title

for the fifth year in a row. Our Executive

Vice-Chairperson, Samina Hamied was

conferred with 'EY’s Entrepreneur of

the Year’ 2022 India award in the Life

sciences and Healthcare category.

We emerged as ESG champions at

KPMG ESG Conclave and Awards.

Our consumer health brands, patient

awareness campaigns, supply chain

initiatives and several other digital and

marketing engagements had an award-

winning streak at prestigious forums.

Doing well by doing good

If you love something, you handle it

with care. This has been beautifully

encapsulated in our ESG approach

'CARE' - Championing Climate Positivity|

Accelerating Community Well-being

| Raising the bar on Governance |

Enhancing Access & Affordability.

Building a sustainable world is no

longer an option—it’s something we

owe our future generations. We remain

steadfast in our commitment to

enrich lives, foster sustainability, and

propel positive change. We are making

significant strides towards our goals

on carbon neutrality, water neutrality,

and zero waste to landfill for our

manufacturing operations in India. We

continue to invest in renewable energy

sources, progressively increasing

their share in our energy mix. To our

people, our commitment to fostering

a safe, healthy, diverse and inclusive

work environment remains resolute.

Together, we encourage a culture of

empathy, respect and collaboration.

In line with our commitment to giving

back to society, we continue to

programmes through our Cipla

Foundation. Underpinning all our

initiatives is a strong governance

framework, guided by responsibility,

transparency and accountability.

A year of resilience, agility and

responsible for discharging their roles and responsibilities as per

their charter.

Chairman: The Chairman acts as the leader of the Board and

presides over the meetings of the Board and the shareholders,

while ensuring that the Company’s strategies are based on

our underlying principle of ‘Caring for Life’ and reflect our core

values. The Chairman is supported by the Executive Vice-

Chairperson, who takes a lead role in managing Board meetings

and interactions, determining the Board’s composition and

facilitating effective communication among the directors.
