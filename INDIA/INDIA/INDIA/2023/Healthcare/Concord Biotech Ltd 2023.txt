MANAGING DIRECTOR

IT’S A PLEASURE TO REPORT

THAT YOUR COMPANY MADE

COMMENDABLE PROGRESS

IN A YEAR THAT WITNESSED

CONSIDERABLE HEADWINDS.

OUR PROGRESS IS SHOWCASED

IN OUR IMPROVED FINANCIAL

NUMBERS. OUR HOLISTIC

GROWTH IS OWING TO THE

UNTIRING EFFORTS OF THE

ENTIRE TEAM. THEIR DISCIPLINED

DETERMINATION AGAINST

PREVAILING ODDS MADE IT

POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE OUR

OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL

GOALS.: DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

OUR DEFINING EDGE

In recent times, the industry has

witnessed significant consolidation

of manufacturing activities. Several

companies have encountered

challenges related to growth owing

to skill shortage, lack of scalability

and a limited product portfolio.

This has presented us with ample

opportunities to expand our presence

in various markets and geographical

regions, ultimately contributing to our

revenues and market share growth.

We have effectively capitalised on the

opportunity. While we added about 50

new customers in FY21 and FY22, we

have added close to 63 customers in

FY23. This has de-risked our revenue

basket. Our revenue contribution

from the top 10 customers, which was

at about 60% in FY20, now stands at

approximately 45% in FY23, even as

overall revenue increased by close to

18% CAGR during the same period.

This is a testimony to our customer

acquisition strategy, customer

retention, and wallet share-enhancing

capability. Even as our topline growth

has been robust, we have maintained

the quality of our business - our

EBITDA margin has hovered between

the 35-40% ranges for nearly a decade.

THE POSITIVE LANDSCAPE

I am very excited about the

opportunities over the horizon. And

there are significant prospects in the

domestic and global markets.

1) The rising prevalence of chronic

diseases, India’s largest population

and diverse demographics have led

to a broad spectrum of diseases,

including chronic conditions. This

ongoing trend will continue to drive

the demand for APIs and formulations

within the domestic market.

2) Drug genericisation will increase

over the coming years. According to

credible reports, numerous drugs are

set to lose their patents between 2022

and 2026. This presents a significant

opportunity for increased product

volume and growth, creating a higher

demand for the corresponding APIs.

3) India has strongly affirmed its

position as the ‘Pharmacy of the

World’. Indian pharmaceutical

companies consistently secure 30%

to 35% of ANDA approvals annually,

establishing themselves as reliable

exporters of generic drug formulations

to regulated markets.

4) As Indian firms continue to invest

in augmenting their capacities, the

demand for relevant APIs will also

see an upswing. Further, with the

adoption of the China plus One and

Europe plus One strategy, countries

worldwide are actively diversifying

their sourcing options, which are more

reliable and can consistently provide

them with these kinds of products,

reducing dependency on single

suppliers.

This dynamic opens up substantial

opportunities for Indian

pharmaceutical companies to emerge

as alternative suppliers for regulated

and unregulated markets, leveraging

their high capabilities and focus on

innovation. Supportive government

initiatives and PLI schemes,

concurrently favourable government

schemes and the production-linked

incentives program have significantly

boosted the Indian pharmaceutical

manufacturing sector.

With a significant runway for growth

and an improving market scenario,

especially for Indian pharma

companies, we remain highly

optimistic about the future of our

Company and are confident in our

ability to elevate Concord to greater

heights.

OUR FOCUS AREAS

a) We will work towards expanding

our API portfolio across therapeutic

areas, especially in oncology, where

we currently have 6 APIs for global

markets, and anti-infectives and

antifungals, where we currently

have seven products. For this, we

will increase our investments in

our R&D efforts to accelerate the

development of our robust pipeline

of products across diverse therapeutic

areas, which have an addressable

market size of US$ 2.5 billion at the

formulation level.

b) API will be the core focus of the

business, and we will continue to

increase our wallet share among

existing customers by selling them

existing and new products across

therapies. Also, investments in our

new manufacturing capacity have

enhanced our capabilities to grow our

wallet share from existing customers.

c) We will add new customers

across geographies, leveraging our

established product portfolio and

with the commercialisation of new

products.

d) We will increase our formulations

business and add new formulations

and delivery platforms (our injectable

facility should be operational in FY25),

widening our geographical reach and

expanding the therapeutic coverage.

e) We will focus on growing our CDMO

piece. With the capacity expansion

at our Limbasi facility, the China plus

One strategy and our expertise in the

fermentation area, we see this as an

important growth opportunity.

The increase in demand for our

products will help us to shore asset

utilisation of existing and new

facilities, allowing us to improve

profitability and unlock value for all

stakeholders.

IN CLOSING

Concord is poised for healthy

growth over the coming years. Our

established track record, presence

across the complex fermentation value

chain, manufacturing capabilities and

technical expertise, global regulatory

approvals and global leadership in

our select portfolio should help us

accelerate our growth momentum,

translating into even better financial

outcomes and stakeholder value.

SOLID CUSTOMER RELATIONS

Our commitment to building enduring

relationships is evident from the fact

that we have maintained an average

customer relationship span of eight

years with our ten largest customers by

revenue.

QUALITY CERTIFIED

I am happy to mention that USFDA

authorities inspected our Limbasi

facility in June 2023. The inspection

was successfully concluded with zero

483 observations. We now have an EIR

report for the same.

Our best starts now!

POISED FOR

GROWTH

MANAGING DIRECTOR

It is a pleasure to

communicate with

you through the

Annual Report.

I welcome the

new shareholders

to the Concord

family and thank

the investor

community for

believing in our

growth story.

O

UR Initial Public Offering

received splendid response,

being oversubscribed 25 times.

This statistic indicates the relevance of

our business model and belief in our

prospects. Your trust in us reinforces

our confidence and motivates us to

work harder to pursue a higher growth

trajectory.

PERFORMANCE IN FY23

I am happy to state that your

Company made considerable progress

in an eventful year.

FY 2023 brought various challenges

stemming from macroeconomic

headwinds in our operating

landscape. Inflation reached multi-

decadal highs, which prompted

several developed and developing

economies to implement aggressive

monetary tightening policies. Despite

the hurdles, I am delighted that

we have delivered a noteworthy

performance. It is passion backed by

perseverance that has enabled our

teams to prevail.

Our revenue from operations scaled

from H713 crore in FY22 to H853 crore

in FY23. It underscores the growing

acceptance of our products by global

and domestic formulators. EBITDA

increased by 28.04% over the previous

fiscal, and we reported a Profit after

Tax of H240 crore in FY23 against

H175 crore in FY22- a significant jump

despite considerable volatility.

Our API business continued to gain

momentum as we registered robust

growth in all the markets of our

presence. Our formulation business

maintained a stable run rate. With

the commissioning of our injectable

facility during FY24, we look forward

to a substantial uptick in this vertical

over the medium term.

IN THE FUTURE

Global market: The pharmaceutical

space has experienced a significant

transformation with new technologies

and cost-effective and more efficient

manufacturing approaches - green

processes are increasingly becoming

preferred over legacy practices.

While the pandemic hit the world over

the last three years, the broader trends

in medicine use remain unchanged.

The global medicine market (in value

terms) is expected to grow at 3-6%

CAGR through 2027, reaching about

US$1.9 trillion in total market size.

India’s role in the world: The

world is looking up to India as a

pharmaceutical manufacturing and

sourcing hub. On the one hand, it

amplifies the opportunity landscape

for the Indian pharmaceutical sector.

On the other, it places considerable

responsibility on pharmaceutical

companies to embed sustainability

into the enterprise’s core.

Hence, reinventing and innovating

will be the two essential drivers for the

Indian pharma industry in the coming

years to graduate from volume to

value leadership amid emerging

global challenges of inflation and

pricing pressures in the global

markets.

BIO-PHARMACEUTICAL

FERMENTATION

The Bio-pharma fermentation is

poised to grow at a healthy uptick in

the current decade.

This demand for fermentation-based

pharma products should continue to

grow over the coming years. Products

developed using the fermentation

process are preferred.

Increasing demand for Bio-tech-

based drugs and rising research and

development activities to produce

novel biological drugs will propel

market growth over the coming years.

Credible estimates suggest that the

Bio-pharmaceutical Fermentation

Market size is expected to grow from

US$ 25.22 billion in 2023 to US$ 40.31

billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 9.83%

during the forecast period (2023-

2028).

OUR PLANS

Looking ahead, I firmly believe we are

perfectly poised for significant growth.

Having established a strong base in

our business space, our focus will be

on fueling innovation - strengthening

our API and formulation product

basket and growing our CDMO

operations - aligning us more closely

to our customers.

Our ongoing investments, robust

product pipeline and strong and

growing customer relations further

underpin our ability to deliver long-

term value.

On behalf of the Board, I extend my

gratitude to our customers, bankers,

vendors and shareholders for their

solid support. I express my sincere

appreciation to our employees for

their unwavering passion.

At Concord, we

remain steadfast in

our commitment

to produce

high-quality

pharmaceuticals

and make a

difference in human

health.

Together, we will

continue on our

journey towards

excellence.

Warm regards...

OUR KEY THERAPEUTIC SEGMENTS

The global API market can be broadly segmented into therapeutic areas such as anti-infective, oncology,

immunosuppressants, and others. Of these immunosuppressants accounted for 7% of the market and is expected to grow by

approximately 9.7% and oncology market which accounted for 19% is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.7%.
