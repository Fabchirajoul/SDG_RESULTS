Letter From the: Managing

dear Shareholders,

Following a steady recovery from the pandemic and geo-

political tensions, the macro-economic condition seems

to be poised for gradual growth. India continues to be

among the fastest growing economies recording 7.2%

growth despite the global turmoil.

over the past couple of years, the country’s healthcare

ecosystem including diagnostics has made significant

advancements. There is also a marked improvement

in the technological capabilities of the diagnostics

space. India has a substantial pool of skilled healthcare

professionals, including doctors, nurses, and technicians.

Despite this, there are several challenges to overcome in

the healthcare space especially those that have emerged

after the pandemic. The need of the hour is a systematic

approach to resolving these challenges and strengthening

the healthcare sector through advanced technology,

infrastructure, and scientific capabilities.

this is where we are

India’s healthcare service providers play a significant

role in addressing the existing gaps. As one of the

leading players in the industry, our vision is to position

Metropolis as a future-ready chain of diagnostic labs. We

aim to continue offering world-class diagnostic testing

services, contributing to improving healthcare standards

throughout the country. our specialized services i.e.,

advanced diagnostic tests with less turnaround time,

help our customers to take their medical decisions after

consulting with their doctors. The pandemic has led to a

shift in customer preference due to its impact on health.

There is an increasing preference for wellness packages

as they help detect problems early thereby preventing the

onset of chronic diseases. There has also been a notable

rise in the adoption of home diagnostics. In response to

this evolving business landscape, we have introduced

affordable wellness packages that offer customers

a comprehensive understanding of their health. This

empowers them to make informed decisions and leads

them towards a happier and healthier lifestyle.

At Metropolis, we aim to strategically expand our network

and strengthen our domestic presence. We are planning

to diversify our reach across the country and go deeper to

deliver healthcare services in the untapped cities through

various patient service networks. our synergies work in

tandem, continuously striving towards the shared vision

Our vision is to position

Metropolis as a future-ready

chain of diagnostic labs.

We aim to continue offering

world-class diagnostic testing

services, contributing to

improving healthcare standards

throughout the country.

12:

Dear Shareholders,

I hope that all of you with your families are safe and

keeping well. It gives me immense pleasure to present to

you our Annual Report for the financial year 2022-23.

During 2022-23, the geopolitical crisis triggered by the

war in ukraine impacted the global supply chain and

subsequently led to a rise in inflation. Although persistent

inflation had a negative impact on the global growth

prospects, India’s economy demonstrated relative

resilience. This is primarily due to the country’s prudent

fiscal and monetary policies, proactive vaccination efforts,

and consistent government capital expenditure. Despite

facing global challenges, India continues to be one of the

world’s fastest-growing economies.

growth amidst intense competition

The financial year 2022-23 was perceived to be the most

disruptive period for the diagnostic sector in the last two

decades. Covid brought with it certain consumer changes

like increasing health awareness among people and

the adoption of digital technologies. At the same time,

many new competitors entered the industry backed with

large capital believing that industry dynamics were ripe

for change. Some of these competitors have developed

digital apps and positioned themselves as asset light

players capable of providing home services for wellness

health checks as an alternative to the traditional brick

and mortar industry primarily focused on illness. By

deploying low prices and big marketing budgets to acquire

customers, the assumption was that once consumers

are acquired for wellness testing, they would get so

hooked to the experience, that they would then migrate

for illness testing services as well. With volumes, would

come economies of scale. They also positioned that the

next wave of healthcare would be an integrated platform

for e-pharmacy, e-diagnostics and tele consultation, and

consumers would then be totally captive primarily taking

market share from traditional hospitals, diagnostic centers,

and retail pharmacies. While a few of these companies

have survived and have acquired some consumers for

wellness testing services, we have neither seen them be

able to build significant scale in wellness, neither have

they been able to convert consumers from wellness to

illness testing as they don’t enjoy the trust of doctors

and the integrated platform has not been successful

for any firm so far as the engagement with consumers

is primarily transactional and the conversions between

e-pharmacy to e- diagnostics etc., have been quite low.

The digital channel has primarily become an additional

channel that brands can use to provide a different

engagement preferred by some customers. However, this

has not proven to be a large channel for new consumer

acquisition. The business built by the digital competitors

and new brick and mortar competitors have largely been in

the tail of healthcare where brand and service matter less

We have successfully retained and

expanded our talented workforce,

significantly grown our network,

explored newer geographies,

and developed substantial new

capabilities that will contribute to

our future success.
