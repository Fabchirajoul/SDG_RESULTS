Dear Shareholders,

to share information, rapidly innovate, and

build software that is so intuitive, even

children can download an app the first

time they pick up a phone.

Unfortunately, the healthcare industry

does not benefit from a platform that

allows multiple programs to interact

with one another. We are rigidly isolated

from progress made in the consumer

technology industry due to the complexity

of the existing systems. Contrary to popular

perception, hospitals are not the safest

places for patients. Despite having world

class hospitals and intense regulation,

it’s estimated that if 200 patients spend

just one night in an American Hospital,

1 of them will die due to medical error.

Medical error is widely acknowledged to

be the 3rd commonest cause of death in

hospitals, after heart disease and cancer.

According to the Joint Commission of

the USA, medical error usually happens

due to a “communication failure”. The

foundation of patient care is built on the

ability of doctors, nurses and paramedics

to communicate with each other in real

time and take critical decisions. However,

existing electronic medical record systems

don’t do a good job of addressing the

communication gap in healthcare. Despite

costing tens of millions of dollars, the

dominant EMR systems in the west don’t

have happy end users and is cited as

one of the most common reasons for the

physician burnout in the US. There needs

to be a new platform that allows multiple

sources of information, and multiple

methods of communicating patient data

among doctors, nurses, and technicians.

As a senior doctor, I believe that

technology will make healthcare safer,

more affordable and restore the joy of

taking care of patients. However, I also

believe that if a technology company

builds software far away from the patient’s

As a senior

doctor, I believe

that technology

will make

healthcare safer,

more affordable

and restore the

joy of taking

care of patients.

a provision for the above advance amounting to H 54.44 million. The Company continues to engage with JDA for resolution of the above.

EXPANSION IN INDIA’S MEDICAL

CAPABILITIES

We aim to be a

pioneer and

trusted partner in

the healthcare

industry

underpinned by a

sustainable,

robust & quality

healthcare

delivery model.

During the COVID -19 pandemic, when

countries across the world were strug-

gling with controlling the virus, India was

one of the leading countries that man-

aged COVID-19 better than any other

developed country and this was possible

because of the phenomenal increase in

the number of doctors in the country.

In the last 6 - 7 years, there has been a

substantive increase in the number of

medical seats at both undergraduate and

postgraduate levels, from 82,000 seats in

the year 2014 to 1.48 lakhs in 2022. This

increase in the strength of doctors and

medical professionals was one of the

greatest supporting pillars of the Indian

healthcare system which helped us fight

the pandemic.

In a country like India, with a vast popula-

tion of more than 1.4 billion, it is very

crucial that medical specialists are

deployed in every corner of the country,

especially in rural areas, to ensure that

the healthcare requirements of all citizens

are met equally. To this end, two years

ago, The National Board of Examination

(NBE) launched a two-year diploma in

medical courses like paediatrics, anaes-

thesia, gynaecology, and other basic

specialties. This was a remarkable step

that ensured that any hospital could

become a medical academic institution

and nurture qualified medical specialists.

Another remarkable healthcare initiative

implemented by the government in the

past couple of years, is the establishment

of National Medical Commission that has

proved to be pivotal in selecting the right

medical talent, which in turn ensures

effective implementation of policies in the

long run.

Throughout my professional life as a

heart surgeon, I have made constant

efforts to make healthcare affordable

and accessible to all. I have also

believed in a realistic dream that India

will be the first country to dissociate

healthcare from affluence and prove

to the world that the wealth of a nation

has nothing to do with the quality of

healthcare its citizens can enjoy.

I am optimistic that this dream will be

achieved in the next 5 - 10 years. The

instrumental initiatives taken by the

government in the past few years,

especially during the unprecedented

COVID crisis, reaffirm my hope for a

healthier future.
