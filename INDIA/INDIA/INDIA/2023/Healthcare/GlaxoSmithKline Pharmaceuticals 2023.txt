Build Grow Protect Culture:

Dear shareholders,

I am pleased to present your company’s

annual report for the financial year (FY)

2022-23.

The Indian economy remained resilient

during the year, despite challenges

emanating from inflation, and advanced

economies of the world demonstrating

signs of a slowdown, with spill-over

impact across developing economies.

The domestic pharmaceutical industry

saw encouraging performance and

vaccine uptake continued to stabilise as

most of your company’s focus brands in

general medicines and vaccines gained

market share and the specialty portfolio

continued to develop as a growth lever.

2022 marked the most significant

corporate transformation for GSK plc,

your company’s global, parent entity, as

it metamorphosed into a fully focused

biopharma company with a purpose to

get ahead of disease together and drive a

step-change in growth and performance.

As part of this change, GSK plc will

prioritise R&D and commercial investment

in vaccines, specialty and general

medicines, positively impacting your

company’s prospects to launch products

from the global pipeline.

Performance with purpose

Over 3,500 people work in our corporate

and regional offices, our manufacturing

facility in Nashik and 22 contract

manufacturing organisations (CMOs),

to positively impact the lives of over

200 million patients and protect people

from disease with more than 6 million

immunisation sessions during the year.

Your company is the no. 2 pharmaceutical

multinational corporation in India and

ranks among the top 5 in volumes

within the industry. We continue to find

innovative solutions and mitigate price

control impact to improve access to our

medicines and vaccines.

How we are

#AmbitiousForPatients

Over the short to medium term, we will

continue to strengthen our business by

investing in focus brands to increase

competitiveness, protect market share

and deliver exceptional launches starting

with Shingrix which heralds the creation

of a new adult vaccine category in India.

The mainstay of our portfolio continues

to be General Medicines and paediatric

vaccines which continue to protect millions

of patients.

Making a difference

Through your company’s corporate social

responsibility (CSR) efforts, we continue

to make a positive impact through our

interventions. I am happy to report that we

felicitated over 143 students in our flagship

GSK Scholars programme, an initiative

which began in FY 2021-22 to support

financially constrained but meritorious

students studying MBBS. We have been

contributing albendazole tablets used

during mass drug administration (MDA)

to the World Health Organization. During

the year, we provided 29 million tablets as

part of this programme thereby continuing

our efforts towards eliminating lymphatic

filariasis (LF) in India. Your company is also

pleased to initiate the smart class project,

transforming the way students learn as we

help convert classrooms in 25 government-

run schools based in Nashik, Maharashtra,

into smart-classes.

Recognition

Your company’s time-honoured legacy has

been built by uniting science, technology

and talent to positively impact patients’ lives.

Several accolades have recognised

your company’s commitment to foster

an inclusive workplace where talent can

thrive, one of which was GSK India being

certified as a ‘Great Place to Work®’.

Your company’s efforts have also been

lauded in other domains as Augmentin -

the #1 brand in the Indian pharmaceutical

market (IPM) - was conferred the 1st

runner-up award in the Brand of the Year

category (Acute, above H 2,000 crore) at

the AWACS Marketing Excellence Awards

2022. Your company also won the CNBC-

TV18 India Risk Management Award in the

pharma sector.

Leading the next with our

ambition for patients

Our confidence and capabilities are

backed by nearly 100 years of stakeholder

trust.

As your company continues its journey to

#LeadTheNextTogether, our priority is to

build on our core capabilities, strengthen

stakeholder trust, further enrich the culture

that we all own which drives the delivery

of our strategy and help make GSK India

a place where people can thrive and

continue to do the right thing.

Before I conclude, I would like to

thank your company’s people for their

contribution and express my gratitude

towards all our stakeholders for their

unwavering faith in our vision and purpose

as we #LeadTheNextTogether towards the

centenary year of our legacy in India in

2024, and beyond.

Annual Report 2022-23:

Managing Director

Our ambition

in the next few

years will be to

deliver double-

digit top line

growth and

to positively

impact the lives

of millions of

Indians.

Bhushan Akshikar: Managing

Dear shareholders,

Our strategic focus

Your company plans to deliver exceptional

launches with continued emphasis on

focus brands and develop responsive go-

to-market initiatives to adapt to evolving

patient needs.

Your company’s culture will continue to

evolve where our people - who bring our

strategies to life - develop, thrive and do

the right thing to fulfill our ambition for

patients.

Our portfolio, performance

and how we will

#LeadTheNextTogether

Your company’s ambition for patients can

be traced back to how we have been

serving patients for decades with quality

products. Our focus brands are growing

ahead of the market with an evolution

index (EI) greater than 100.

Augmentin is ranked the no. 1 brand and

Calpol is the most prescribed brand in

the IPM. Four of your company’s brands

– Augmentin, Calpol, T-Bact and Ceftum -

rank among the top 50 brands in the IPM.

The paediatric vaccines self-pay market

is gaining momentum and we continue to

maintain leadership in the self-pay market

in India. Five of your company’s vaccines

featured among the top 15 vaccines in the

self-pay market.

During the year, some of your company’s

brands were added to the National

List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). We

have put in place plans to mitigate the

impact through a robust volume and cost

optimisation strategy.

#LeadTheNextTogether

We are committed to create a new adult

vaccines category in India with the launch

of Shingrix, our Shingles vaccine. This is the

first non-live vaccine for the Herpes Zoster

virus in India and the first in its category.

As per clinical trials, it has shown an

efficacy of 97% in patients aged 50 years

and above and is approved in India for

the prevention of Herpes Zoster (HZ) and

post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in adults

of 50 years and older. Shingrix has been

a resounding success in other countries

where GSK operates and has helped

protect many patients against this

painful disease.

Our ambition in the next few years will be

to deliver double-digit top line growth and

to positively impact the lives of millions of

Indians. We aim to deliver new launches

to drive growth, continue competitive

performance with profitable growth in the

base business and evolve a culture where

our people develop, thrive and continue to

always do the right thing.

100 years of GSK’s legacy in

India

As GSK enters the centenary year of

its legacy in 2024, we are ever more

committed to deliver on our purpose to

positively impact patients’ lives, continue

to build trust established over nearly

100 years and deliver value with the

support of all our stakeholders as we

letter dated May 4, 2011 called upon the Company to discharge the

entire liability, including upto date interest calculated at 15% p.a., and had vide: letter dated October 10, 2011, raised a demand on

the Company for the interest amount amounting to `247,44.00 lakhs. Without prejudice to the position that interest is not payable,

the Company had recognized a provision of `247,44.00 lakhs in respect of the Government’s claim for interest in 2011. The Company

had filed a writ petition at Delhi High Court against the above demand which had been admitted. The Company also filed stay

applications which were dismissed and the Company had filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Supreme Court for stay

of the interest demand until final determination of the writ petition filed in the Delhi High Court. The Supreme Court on hearing the

above SLP, passed an order on April 3, 2012. The said order stayed the Demand Notice dated October 10, 2011 during the pendency

of the writ petition at the Delhi High Court subject to the Company depositing `136,82.00 lakhs in three equal installments within

Managing Director and three whole time Directors amounting to ` 10.93 lakhs for the year ended

August 31, 1986, which was in accordance with the minimum remuneration provided in the agreements entered into with them prior

to erstwhile BWIL becoming public, which required such Government of India's sanction. The approval is still awaited.

been included under non-current provisions and Income tax paid thereon aggregating `64.77 lakhs has been included under other

(ii) Refund of surtax `96.81 lakhs, and interest thereon amounting to `48.52 lakhs, received during 1994, have not been adjusted against

the provision for tax in the books of accounts and recognised as income respectively, since the Income tax department had filed a

reference application against the income tax tribunal's order which was pending before the High Court of Karnataka. The Company

has received an order dated April 18, 2007 from the High Court of Karnataka which is partially in the Company's favour. On the basis

of the aforesaid order, Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Bangalore will pass an order giving directions. On receipt of the ITAT

order, the Company will take appropriate steps in the matter.:

letter dated 20th/24th August, 1998

from the Central Government demanding an amount of

` 4,40,79,918 comprising ` 1,42,74,110 in respect of prices relating

to Salbutamol formulations during the period April, 1979 to

December, 1983 with interest thereon amounting to ` 2,98,05,808

upto 31st July, 1998. The Company had been legally advised that

the demand of ` 1,42,74,110 is not sustainable and it, therefore

follows that the interest demand also cannot be sustained. The

total demand has been challenged by the Company in a Writ

Petition filed in the Bombay High Court. The Bombay High

Court has granted an interim stay of the demand, subject to the

Company depositing 50% of the principal amount. Accordingly,

the Company has deposited an amount of ` 71,50,000 with the

Government on 3rd May, 1999. This is a normal interim order

passed by the High court in such matters and does not in any

way reflect upon the merits or otherwise of the case. The amount

will be refunded if the Company succeeds at the final hearing of

the matter. The Government's application in the Supreme Court

praying that this writ petition be transferred to the Supreme Court

from the Bombay High Court was not allowed and the Company's

writ petition will now be heard by the Bombay High Court.:
