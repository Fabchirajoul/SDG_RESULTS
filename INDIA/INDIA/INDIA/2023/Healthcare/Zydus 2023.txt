Dedicated To Life:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to present our

annual report for the fiscal year 2022-23.

We continue to evolve as an innovation-driven

lifesciences company to bridge the unmet

healthcare needs of patients in India and other

global markets. When a Company transforms

at a rapid pace, the intrinsic culture of the

organisation must serve as an anchor. Our

culture at Zydus is inclusive and fosters empathy

and dynamism. Our revamped logo reflects this

approach with emphasis on ‘US’, which comprises

employees, patients, caregivers, partners,

customers, suppliers, investors and all other

stakeholders.

We believe that while the business realities and

our strategic responses may vary over time,

our vision continues to be that of transforming

lives through groundbreaking discoveries. Our

objective is to improve health outcomes for

patients who are in need of therapies to treat the

unmet healthcare needs.

Over the years, our endeavour has always been

to grow the business profitably. I am happy to

inform you that the Company’s revenues have

grown at 11% CAGR over the last decade with

improved profitability. EBITDA margins have

expanded from 17.1% in FY2013 to 22.4% in

FY2023.

Both our key markets viz. India and US have

delivered a robust compounded annual growth of

10% and 17% respectively over the last decade.

Our balance sheet and cash flows have continued

to get stronger, and we are a cash surplus

company now.

We remain committed to investing in our future

to drive sustainable and profitable growth by

building a diversified portfolio of differentiated

products in generics, complex generics, biologics

and NCEs. Innovation is an integral part of who

we are as a lifesciences company. Our R&D

capabilities enabled us to maintain a steady

pipeline of novel molecules and biosimilars that

helped us with new launches during the fiscal

year, both in India and overseas markets. We

Innovation is an integral

part of who we are as a

lifesciences company. Our

objective is to improve health

outcomes for patients who are in

need of therapies to treat the unmet

healthcare needs.

ESG

We have established a CSR and

sustainability matters, ensuring that

ESG principles align with our long-

Letter at

Moraiya site was a notable success

from regulatory standpoint for the

Company and this also resulted in

strong uptick in the number of ANDA

approvals. In FY2023, the Company

received 63 new product approvals

(incl. 9 tentative approvals) which

is one of the highest number of

approvals received in a single financial

year. This included receipt of final

approval for 3 transdermal products

from the Moraiya site. These approvals

marked the onset of transdermal

ANDA filings and approvals summary:

Presence of a large number of players

in the US generics space leads to

continued price erosion and in turn,

restricts margin improvement. To

offset the impact of price erosion, the

Company is focused on launching new

products and expanding presence in

complex generics as well as products

sold through specialty channels. The

Company keeps on evaluating various

business development and licensing

opportunities that will supplement its

in-house portfolio and thereby offer a

wider set of healthcare solutions for

patients in the US. These opportunities

will allow the Company to diversify

its offerings in new dosage forms and

therapy areas. Overall, the Company

expects to continue its growth

trajectory going forward on the back

of several key launches lined up in

coming years as well as continued

momentum in recent launches

including Lenalidomide Capsules.

During the year, the Company’s formulations business in the US posted

revenues of ` 74,451 mn, with a strong growth of 28%.
