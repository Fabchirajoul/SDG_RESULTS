Managing Director’s

Statement

At AstraZeneca, we

are transforming the

future of healthcare by

unlocking the power of

what science can do.

events. At the core of our mission is a

steadfast commitment to improving health

outcomes. We have developed an access

to healthcare strategy that encompasses

several pillars. We strive to make our

medicines widely available and affordable,

ensuring that patients can benefit from

the latest advancements in medical

science. Additionally, we actively support

the development of sustainable health

systems and infrastructure, recognising

the importance of a robust healthcare

ecosystem in delivering quality care to

individuals and communities. Moreover,

we are committed to raising disease

awareness and promoting preventive

measures, empowering individuals to take

control of their health and well-being.

Therapy Area Progress

Throughout the year, the impact of our

pioneering science has been evident

across all therapy areas. We have obtained

significant regulatory approvals that have

enabled us to serve patients who would

otherwise face limited or no treatment

options. Following the global acquisition

of Alexion in 2021, we have expanded our

portfolio to bring innovative therapies for

rare diseases to the Indian market. As a

result of this strategic acquisition, India

stands among the first few countries in

Asia to offer rare disease therapies from

the esteemed Alexion portfolio. One such

groundbreaking therapy is Selumetinib,

which aims to address the unmet medical

needs of patients with rare disease NF1,

eventually improving their quality of life.

This expansion of our portfolio reflects

our unwavering commitment to bringing

transformative medicines to patients,

particularly those with limited treatment

options. Additionally, we are dedicated

to emphasising the importance of early

diagnosis and holistic care. With this, we

strive to enhance patient outcomes and

ensure that individuals receive the utmost

care throughout their healthcare journey.

Addressing Healthcare Challenges

with Advanced Technology

We understand the significance of early

diagnosis in facilitating precise treatment.

To transform this vision into reality, we

have dedicated considerable time and

effort in partnerships and initiatives. One

of our key endeavors is the A.Catalyst

Network’s India Health Innovation Hub,

which operates in collaboration with

the Indo-Sweden Healthcare Innovation

Centre (ISHIC). Together, we are diligently

working towards making healthcare

affordable and accessible to everyone.

Notably, our projects such as HeartBeat,

SEARCH, SAHAYOG, and several others

play a crucial role in disseminating accurate

awareness pertaining to various disease

areas. Furthermore, these initiatives

actively contribute to early detection,

ultimately leading to better health outcomes

for individuals.

A Great Place to Work

Innovation flourishes within a diverse

workplace that fosters a sense of safety

and empowerment and encourages

collaboration while challenging

conventional thinking. The innovative

breakthroughs we have achieved in

the past year can be attributed to our

exceptional and collaborative workforce.

I extend my gratitude to all my colleagues

at AstraZeneca for their unwavering

dedication and commitment in delivering

outstanding performance and ensuring that

our medicines reach patients across the

country. Our steadfast commitment lies in

nurturing inclusivity and diversity, creating

an environment where individuals can

unleash their potential and continuously

grow and evolve.

Commitment to Society

and the Planet

Driven by our core value of ‘Doing the

right thing’, we are dedicated to making

meaningful contributions to society and the

planet. We recognise the interdependence

of a healthy planet and healthy people

and are taking bold actions to expand

healthcare access while reducing our

impact on the climate.

One of our impactful initiatives is the

Ganga Godavari Screening Program, which

continues to identify cancer incidence in

women through preventative screening

camps. It has benefited over 8,500 women

in underserved communities over the past

few years. In addition, the Young Health

Program focuses on empowering young

people to make informed health choices

through health information centers in New

Delhi and Karnataka, we have reached over

500,000 individuals, equipping them with

valuable knowledge for a healthier future.

Furthermore, we have implemented

Ambition Zero Carbon strategy,

demonstrating our commitment to

combating climate change. As part

of our global AZ Forest Program, we

have planted over 10.5 million trees

worldwide since 2020, including dedicated

efforts in India. We actively engage

with the local community to ensure

the sustainability of the sites where we

initiated the plantation, fostering long-term

environmental stewardship.

Looking Ahead

These are undeniably exhilarating times

as we make remarkable progress in our

community programs and persistently

tackle healthcare challenges. We are

dedicated to taking every possible measure

to build a better future for healthcare. I

am confident that we will demonstrate the

transformational power of science.

As we consistently push the boundaries of

science, we remain steadfast in upholding

our values in all our interactions and taking

decisive action.

Sustainability Report (BRSR) report, which outlines our ongoing

commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. At

AstraZeneca, we recognise the importance of balancing economic,

social, and environmental considerations in all that we do. As such,

we remain committed to drive positive change through our business

practices and operations.

Over the past year, we have made significant strides in advancing

our sustainability initiatives and data management. As we navigate

current socio-economic and environmental challenges, we must

prioritise building sustainable, resilient, and equitable health systems

that protect current and future generations.

In addition, we have prioritised social responsibility by investing in

our employees, supporting our local communities, and fostering

diversity and inclusion throughout our organisation. We believe that

a strong commitment to social responsibility is essential to building a

sustainable business that creates value for all stakeholders.

While we are proud of our progress, we recognise that there is

still much work to be done. We remain committed to continuous

improvement and will continue to push ourselves to raise the bar on

sustainability performance. We believe that by working together with

our stakeholders, we can create a brighter, more sustainable future

for all.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies

used in the preparation of these financial statements. These

policies have been consistently applied to all the years

presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1. Basis of preparation

(a) Compliance with Ind AS

The financial statements comply in all material aspects

with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified

under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’)

[Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015]

and other relevant provisions of the Act.

The financial statements for the year ended

March 31, 2023 have been approved for issue by the

Board of Directors of the Company in their meeting held

on May 30, 2023.

(b) Historical cost convention

The financial statements have been prepared on a

historical cost basis, except for the following -

•

certain financial assets and liabilities measured at

fair value;

•

defined benefit plans- plan assets measured at fair

value; and

•

share-based payments- measured at fair value.

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current

or non-current as per the Company’s operating cycle

and other criteria set out in the Schedule III (Division

II) to the Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature of

products and the time between the acquisition of assets/

inputs for processing and their realisation of cash and

cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its

operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current/

non-current classification of assets and liabilities.

Amounts included in the financial statements are

reported in millions of Indian rupees except share and

per share data, as per the requirement of Schedule III,

unless otherwise stated. The sign ‘0.0’ in the financial

statements indicates that the amounts involved are below

` one lac and the sign ‘-’ indicates that amounts are nil.

(c) New and amended standards adopted

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has vide notification

dated March 23, 2022 notified Companies (Indian

Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022 which

amends certain accounting standards, and are effective

April 1, 2022. These amendments did not have any

impact on the prior and current year and are not expected

to have a material impact on the Company in future

reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

(d) Standard issued but not yet effective

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has vide notification

dated March 31, 2023 notified Companies (Indian

Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 (the

‘Rules’) which amends certain accounting standards, and

are effective April 1, 2023.

The Rules predominantly amend Ind AS 12, Income taxes,

and Ind AS 1, Presentation of financial statements. The

other amendments to Ind AS notified by these rules are

primarily in the nature of clarifications.

These amendments are not expected to have a material

impact on the financial statements of the Company in the

current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable

future transactions. Specifically, no changes would be

necessary as a consequence of amendments made to

Ind AS 12 as the Company’s accounting policy already

complies with the now mandatory treatment.

2.2. Critical judgements and estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with

Ind AS requires that the management make estimates and

assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies

and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and

expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on

an ongoing basis. Any revision to accounting estimates is

recognised prospectively in current and future years. In

particular, information about areas of significant estimation

uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting

policies that have a significant effect on the amounts

recognised in the financial statements are included below:

a)

Expected credit losses on financial assets: The

impairment provisions on financial assets are based on

assumptions about risk of default and expected timing

of collection. The Company uses judgment in making

these assumptions and selecting inputs to be used in the

impairment calculation, based on the Company’s past

history, customers’ creditworthiness, existing market

conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end

of each reporting period. Refer note 38.

45. Provident Fund - Supreme Court Judgement

The Company has evaluated the impact of Supreme Court (“SC”) judgement dated February 28, 2019 in the case of Regional Provident Fund

Commissioner (II) West Bengal v/s Vivekananda Vidyamandir and Others, in relation to exclusion of certain allowances from the definition

of “basic wages” of the relevant employees for the purposes of determining contribution to Provident Fund (“PF”) under the Employees’

Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. There are interpretation issues relating to the said SC judgement. Based on such

evaluation, management has concluded that affect of the aforesaid judgement on the Company is not material and accordingly, no provision

has been made in the financial statements.

46

The Board of Directors, at its meeting dated May 30, 2023, have recommended a dividend of `16 (2022: `8) per equity share

aggregating to ` 400 (2022: ` 200) which is subject to approval of shareholders at the ensuing Annual General Meeting.
