the Resolution at Item No.7 of the Notice.

It is submitted that payment of commission to Non-Executive Directors and Independent Directors aggregating to a sum not exceeding

one percent of the net profits per annum is a common accepted market practice for companies in India. The Company has been so

far paying well below the specified limit of one percent of the net profits per annum to its Non-Executive Directors and Independent

Directors.

For instance, for the financial year ended March, 31 2023, the total commission paid to the Non-Executive Directors and Independent

Directors was only ` 15 million, being ` 2.50 million per person which constituted only 0.12% of the net profits of the Company.

Managing Director and the Whole-time Directors of the Company may be deemed to be concerned or interested

(Rupees Five Thousand Million Only). This would be within the overall approved borrowing limit of `38,500 million (Rupees Thirty Eight

Thousand Five Hundred Million Only).

Rule 14 of the Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014 prescribed inter alia under Section 42 of the Companies

Act, 2013 (“the Act”) deals with private placement of securities by a Company. Sub-rule (2) of the said Rule 14 states that in case

of an offer or invitation to subscribe for non-convertible debentures on a private placement basis, the Company shall obtain the prior

approval of its shareholders by means of a special resolution only once in a year for all the offers or invitations for such issuance of

non-convertible debentures during the year. Rule 18 of the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 deals with issue of

secured debentures.

The Board will decide appropriately whether to issue debentures on a secured or unsecured basis.

Accordingly, consent of the members is being sought for passing a Special Resolution as set out at Item No. 8 of the Notice. This would

enable the Board of the Company to offer or invite subscription for unsecured/ secured non-convertible debentures, as may be required

by the Company, from time to time, for a period of one year from the date of passing this resolution.

The Board recommends the special resolution set out under Item No.8 of the Notice for approval by the members.

Message FRoM the ChaiRMan

Dear Members,

I am happy to present the Annual Report in this,

the 40th year of our inception. 1983-2023: Four

decades since our steadfast commitment to our

mission - to provide healthcare of international

standards to every individual.

It was an incredible journey, filled with struggles

and challenges – from raising finances to

obtaining regulatory approvals, from building a

world-class hospital and equipping it with the

best medical equipment, to bringing on board the

finest clinical talent. Our efforts culminated on

18 September 1983, when India’s first corporate

hospital, Apollo Hospitals in Madras, came into

being.

By remaining steadily focused on our purpose,

we are, 40 years later, the largest integrated

healthcare eco-system in this part of the world,

with 70 hospitals, 5541 pharmacies, 530 clinics,

1750 diagnostic centres and day surgery and

birthing centres around the country. We have

made world-class medical care accessible and

affordable to all, with patients now coming to us

from 150 countries.

It is most gratifying that as the first corporate

healthcare provider, our purpose and structure

led to the genesis of India’s private health sector,

which caters to more than seventy percent of

the country’s medical needs. The quality of

healthcare being delivered in the country has

been lifted, and this has made the country proud.

The Board has a healthy blend of executive and non-executive directors, and consequently ensures the desired level of independence

in functioning and decision-making. Moreover, all the non-executive directors are eminent professionals, and bring the wealth of their

professional expertise and experience to the management of the Company.

On May 25, 2022, the Board announced that it had appointed Shri. MBN Rao as the Lead Independent Director (the “LID”). The LID has

the below responsibilities:

Provide objective feedback of the Independent Directors to the Board on various matters, including suggesting agenda items and

other matters relating to the Company;

Ensure engagement with stakeholders, including shareholders, of the Company on various matters;

Performance Evaluation of the Board and the Directors

Pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 17 of the Listing Regulations, the Board’s Annual

Performance Evaluation was conducted for all Board Members as well as the working of the Board and its Committees.

This evaluation was led by the Chairman of the N&R Committee with specific focus on the performance and effective functioning

of the Board. The Board evaluation framework has been designed in compliance with the requirements under the Companies Act,

2013 and the Listing Regulations, and in consonance with the Guidance Note on Board Evaluation issued by SEBI. The Board

evaluation was conducted through a questionnaire having qualitative parameters and feedback based on ratings.

Evaluation of the Board was based on criteria such as composition and role of the Board, Board communication and relationships,

functioning of Board Committees, review of performance and remuneration payable to Executive Directors, succession planning,

strategic planning, etc.

Evaluation of Directors was based on criteria such as participation and contribution in Board and Committee meetings,

representation of shareholder interests and enhancing shareholder value, experience and expertise to provide feedback and

guidance to top management on business strategy, governance and risk, understanding of the organization’s strategy, risk and

environment, etc.

The performance evaluation of the Chairman and the Executive Directors was carried out by the Independent Directors led by the

Chairman of the Nomination & Remuneration Committee. The performance evaluation of the Independent Directors was carried

out by the entire Board.

It was observed that the Board, as a whole, is performing as a highly effective and cohesive body. It was also observed that the

Board’s Committees are functioning effectively in accordance with their defined charters/ terms of reference.

The evaluation process also confirmed the high governance standards being set by the Board and the constructive relationship

between the Board and the Management. The Board was also appreciative of management’s efforts in gaining market share in

the Centres of Excellence through various initiatives despite a very challenging environment as well as taking concrete steps in

sustainability initiatives..

In order to further strengthen the effectiveness of the Board and its key Committees, it was agreed that the focus should be more

on familiarising the Board members on emerging and future trends in healthcare & sustainability initiatives and accordingly orient

the relevant presentations, trainings and orientations. The Board’s suggestions to further augment its effectiveness have been

noted and taken up for implementation.

Progress on the recommendations from last year’s evaluation was also discussed and reviewed. During the period under review,

as a result of the previous evaluation’s results, it was noted that the Board engaged more with the Company’s leadership team

and received more frequent updates/discussions on the emerging business landscape.
