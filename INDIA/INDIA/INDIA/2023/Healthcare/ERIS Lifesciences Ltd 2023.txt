LETTER

Amit Bakshi

Chairman and: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to note that we have

entered our 16th

year of operations. Our growth

strategy has signiﬁcantly evolved with the addition of

several new growth engines in FY23. While we

clocked our “First 1,000 crore” of revenue in 13 years,

we are close to adding the “Next 1,000 crore” of

revenue in just 4 years by deploying our consistent

cashﬂows along with external funding to accelerate

our growth trajectory.

We invested Rs. 1,265 crore in consummating 3

Dermatology acquisitions in FY23. This has been our

largest single-year investment, and that too in a

single therapy. Notwithstanding that Dermatology is

a large and attractive therapy, I need to acknowledge

that this investment was not an easy decision, and it

took a lot of heart and conviction on our part. This

conviction came from three aspects of our business

understanding. Firstly, based on our expertise in

chronic therapies built over the last 16 years, we carry

strong conviction on the stickiness of “old gold”

brands and the afﬁnity that doctors and patients

have for them. Secondly, we have developed a strong

understanding of the psyche of super-specialists in

our country and the science-led engagement model

that is required to forge lasting relationships with

them. And lastly, we saw that the deals provided an

arbitrage opportunity in the sense that these were

fundamentally good businesses which had been sub-

optimally managed. These three aspects formed the

cornerstones of our deal evaluation strategy.

Post the acquisition of Oaknet, we approached the

business with an “owner manager” mindset and with

a complete willingness to roll up our sleeves and do

the hard work to create value. We undertook a slew of

value creation initiatives focused on product range

expansion, driving sales and marketing excellence

and expansion of specialist coverage. Within 6

months of the acquisition, we could start seeing early

impact in terms of an acceleration in organic growth

and margin expansion and we started getting the

conviction that we have a strong base there which we

can build on. Hence when we got the opportunity to

bring in complementary products through the

Glenmark and DRL bolt-on deals in Q4 FY23, we had

the conﬁdence to go ahead. I am happy to note that

our thesis has delivered tangible results in Oaknet’s

very ﬁrst year with us, with the business clocking a

22% organic growth in FY23 after a spell of 3 ﬂat

years during FY20-FY22. The EBIDTA margin has

expanded from 10% in FY22 to 24% in FY23 and we

are conﬁdent of a signiﬁcant expansion in FY24.

FY23 also represented the ﬁrst full year of operations

of our Insulin business through Eris MJ Biopharm. By

curating a winning basket of Product, Technology

and Service, we have created tangible impact in this

market in our very ﬁrst year with ~ 60,000 patients on

our therapy. We have two commercialized products

at present – Human Insulin and Glargine – with an

exciting pipeline consisting of Liraglutide and other

insulin analogs. We expect this business to scale up

rapidly in the years to come.

We continue to look forward to an exciting era of

growth driven by our core as well as emerging

therapies. On behalf of the Board of Directors, I

extend my gratitude to all stakeholders for their

continuing trust and support.

With Warm Regards,

Amit Bakshi
