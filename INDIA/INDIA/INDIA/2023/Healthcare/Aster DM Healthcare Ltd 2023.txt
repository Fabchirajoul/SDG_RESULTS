Managing Director

Our commitment to the Indian

market remains strong, as we

continued to expand our

footprint with the addition of

126 pharmacies, 91 diagnostic

centers, and patient experience

centers.

Aster DM Healthcare Limited

06:

Dear Shareholders,

It is my pleasure to address you

today, as we emerge from the

shadows of the global pandemic

that put our collective strength and

resilience to the test. At this critical

juncture, I am delighted to share with

you our vision and commitment in

navigating the evolving landscape

of healthcare in our regions of

presence.

An urgent need to bridge the gap

With a current healthcare

expenditure of less than 3% of India’s

GDP, it is imperative to increase this

investment to at least 5 to 6 percent

of the GDP. By doing so, we can

enhance the infrastructure, expand

capacity, and ensure access to

quality healthcare services for all.

To bring about this transformative

change, we must undertake

several crucial measures. Firstly,

it is important to bolster our

healthcare infrastructure, proactively

anticipating future challenges by

investing in essential resources

– healthcare professionals and

infrastructure alike. Secondly,

augmenting healthcare spending

will enable us to effectively address

the growing demands of our

population and bring us in line with

global standards. Public-private

partnerships can play a crucial role

in bridging gaps in infrastructure,

technology, and specialized care.

Lastly, fostering innovation and

research in the healthcare sector will

drive advancements in treatment

and position India as a leader in

healthcare excellence.

Another pressing challenge within

India’s healthcare sector revolves

around the shortage of skilled

healthcare professionals. The

scarcity of trained doctors and

nurses poses a significant hurdle,

further exacerbated by the high

attrition rate among nurses, reaching

as high as 35 to 40 percent. To tackle

this challenge, we have adopted a

strategic approach, taking a step

back. We have enhanced training

programs and create a robust

pipeline of healthcare professionals

to meet the rising demand. Efforts

are being made to attract and

retain talent by offering competitive

remuneration packages and

adequate opportunities for career

growth. Additionally, we are actively

collaborating with educational

institutions and engaging in

international exchange programs to

help bridge the skills gap and foster

knowledge-sharing.

Committed to delivering healthcare

excellence

In response to the prevailing gaps

in the Indian healthcare sector and

as part of our expansion strategy,

we have made significant strides in

establishing our presence in various

cities across Southern India in recent

years. We envision the development

of a comprehensive healthcare

ecosystem encompassing hospitals,

pharmacies, and laboratories

within the next three years in

Southern India. While our labs and

pharmacies are already operational,

the construction of many of the

greenfield hospitals is expected to be

completed within a timeline of two

to three years where as brown-field

expansion of some of the existing

hospitals shall be done in 1 year.

Together this is likely to add around

1,625 beds to our existing capacity

of 4,317 beds.

In addition to our dedicated regional

focus, we are actively venturing

into new geographies, including

previously untapped regions and

states within India, to uncover

potential avenues for growth.

It is important to highlight that

our approach has evolved from

primarily pursuing greenfield

projects to brownfield project

expansions of our existing hospitals

and now embracing Operations &

Management of hospitals in Tier 2

and Tier 3 cities in the country. The

later enables us to leverage their

existing infrastructure and resources

while expanding our expertise, brand

and create a holistic ecosystem of

healthcare services.

Through these strategic initiatives,

we are committed to broadening our

footprint, enhancing accessibility to

quality healthcare to more people.

By embracing both organic growth

and strategic collaborations, we are

poised to strengthen our position

as a leading healthcare provider and

create a positive impact on the lives

of individuals across the region.

Performance review

In the financial year 2023, we

achieved a consolidated revenue

of INR 11,933 crores, marking a

significant 16% increase compared

to the previous year. Our EBITDA

stood at INR 1,565 crores, reflecting

a 6% growth. Despite the challenges

faced due to losses incurred from

the operations of new hospitals, our

overall EBITDA showed a satisfactory

improvement. Adjusting for these

losses, our EBITDA stood at INR

1,655 crores, marking a noteworthy

growth of 11% compared to the

previous period. This demonstrates

healthcare but also highlights our

commitment to addressing the

pressing healthcare needs of the

underserved communities. The

prestigious Guinness World Records

have recognized this exceptional

achievement, solidifying our position

as a leader in delivering impactful

healthcare services. In addition,

we successfully concluded the first

edition of Aster Guardians Global

Nursing Award which saw Kenyan

nurse Anna Qabale Duba win the

award worth USD 250,000 which

is being utilised by her to uplift

the rural community in her remote

village of Turbi in Africa, by building

a school. Aster Guardians Global

Nursing Award has now emerged

as a renowned and sought-after

recognition in the nursing and

healthcare World which is not

only putting a spotlight on all the

hard work that nurses do but also

inspiring people to keep their faith

in nursing as a profession which is

essential to address the growing

global shortage.

We also remain dedicated to

advancing our ESG commitments,

ensuring the resilience and

sustainability of our business

while making a positive impact on

the world around us. With every

milestone achieved, we reaffirm

our pledge to serve as a responsible

healthcare provider and a catalyst for

positive change.

Outlook

In conclusion, I am delighted to

share that our business is thriving

During the year, we have started expanding

our reach to suburban areas of India by

adopting an O&M asset-light model, adding a

total of 390 beds.

Integrated Annual Report FY 2022-2023

CORPORATE OVERVIEW:

Managing Director: Dear Shareholders,

The fiscal 2022-23 has been a year of

growth investments for us at Aster. This

has been the first year we have opened

up five new hospitals in a single year, a

feat that showcases our strong efforts

towards catering to a larger patient base

and meeting their diverse needs. This was

also a year where we were able to reach

key milestones in our digital initiatives.

The launch of our app ‘myAster’ on iOS,

Android as well as the web platforms was

met with great enthusiasm, as evidenced

by the targeted downloads we achieved. It

is the region’s first integrated healthcare

platform to be launched in UAE and has

successfully combined our services across

businesses under one app. Moreover,

we experienced a substantial ramp-up

in Aster pharmacy orders, indicating a

growing acceptance and reliance on our

digital platforms. All of this enabled us to

continue to position our organization for

growth and success in the future.

In India, we have recorded excellent

growth as some of our hospitals have

reached almost full capacity. We are also

looking forward to adding new beds in

such areas.

I am also excited to inform

that three of our hospitals

have been recognized and

noted by the prestigious

US Newsweek global list.

We were in the top 5,

top 20, as well as in the

global 150 list with our

Aster Hospitals.

Integrated Annual Report FY 2022-2023

CORPORATE OVERVIEW:

Dear Shareholders,

I hope this message finds you in good

health and high spirits.

Globally Fiscal year 2023 was a

year of significant recovery from the

challenging times of the last few years

and investment for future. GCC as a

geography navigated these challenges

posed with strong resilience and

has emerged as a preferred global

destination for business and healthcare

support. The impact of effective

pandemic management is tangible

and is seen in the influx of expatriate

population in the UAE, including

individuals migrating from Ukraine and

Russia. This influx has not only helped

restore the population loss experienced

during the peak of the pandemic but has

also reaffirmed our position as a trusted

location.

Aster being the leading healthcare

provider in the region has mirrored this

in its growth strategies, revenue trends

where Covid Revenues were replaced by

Core Revenue across Hospitals, Clinics

and Pharmacies and Capital Allocation

Plans to harness the geographical

advantage.

Expanding horizons with

substantial investment

Throughout the GCC region, our

core businesses comprising of

hospitals, pharmacies, and clinics

have demonstrated steady growth.

We have witnessed increased non

covid footfall across our hospitals,

pharmacies, and clinics. Notably, our

digital initiatives have played a pivotal

role in driving revenue and underscoring

the immense potential of technology

in transforming healthcare delivery.

We have seen significant growth in

revenues from e-Pharmacy and Home

Delivery. Nevertheless, it is important

to acknowledge that our EBITDA

was adversely affected by the losses

incurred by the new hospitals we

launched during the year. However, we

anticipate that the strategic initiative

to add 101, 34 and 179 beds at Aster

Sharjah Hospital, Aster Sonapur

Hospital and Aster Royal Hospital

Muscat respectively, will contribute to

our revenue and EBITDA performance

in the forthcoming quarters as their

utilization improves.

Financial overview

Over the course of FY 2023, our

revenue experienced a significant

growth reaching INR 8,950 crores from

INR 7,870 crores in the previous fiscal

year’, representing a substantial 14%

increase. It is worth noting that the

high-margin revenue generated from

COVID testing in FY 2022, totalling

INR 869 crores, has been replaced

by core healthcare revenue, which

exhibited an impressive 26% year-

on-year growth without considering

the Covid related revenues. While our

EBITDA from the GCC region reached

INR 1,112 crores, slightly lower than

the INR 1,130 crores recorded in FY

2022, it is pertinent to exclude the

losses incurred by the new hospitals

amounting to INR 77 crores. Upon doing

so, our EBITDA showcased 4% growth,

reaching INR 1,189 crores.

Performance across businesses

In the GCC region, our hospitals

achieved a remarkable revenue of INR

4,012 crores, representing a significant

14% year-on-year increase. This growth

is a testament to our commitment

to delivering exceptional healthcare

services. While the EBITDA for our

hospitals stood at INR 584 crores,

marginally lower than the

Amitabh Johri, Joint Chief Financial Officer

Aster DM Healthcare Limited

12:

Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to share with you

the latest updates and financial

highlights of our operations in India.

Despite the prevailing external

challenges, India’s economy is

expected to remain resilient, having

achieved the growth rate of 7.2% in

2023 and projected growth of 6.5% in

2024, making it the fastest growing

major economy globally. Leveraging

this favourable economic scenario

and our strategic initiatives, our India

business has achieved excellent

revenue and profitability growth.

On the healthcare front, per capita

healthcare expenditure has risen

at a fast pace. This is due to rising

income, easier access to high-quality

healthcare facilities and greater

awareness of personal health and

hygiene. Greater penetration of

health insurance aided the rise

in healthcare spending, a trend

likely to intensify in the coming

decade. India’s public expenditure

on healthcare stood at 2.1% of

GDP in 2021-22 against 1.8% in

2020-21 and 1.3% in 2019-20. The

Government is planning to increase

public health spending to 2.5% of

the country’s GDP by 2025. Per

capita GDP of India is expected to

reach US$ 3,277.28 in 2024 from

US$ 2,320.40 in 2022. Moreover,

changing demographics will also

contribute to greater healthcare

spending. This is likely to continue as

the size of elderly population is set to

rise from the current 98.9 million to

about 168 million by 2026.

Medical tourism has been a new

growth factor for India’s healthcare

sector. Presence of world-class

hospitals and skilled medical

professionals has strengthened

India’s position as a preferred

destination for medical tourism.

To promote medical tourism in the

country, the government of India is

extending the e-medical visa facility

to the citizens of 156 countries.

Indian medical tourism market was

valued at US$ 2.89 billion in 2020

and is expected to reach US$ 13.42

billion by 2026.

Scaling up our presence

As we expand our footprint, we have

witnessed remarkable growth in

our India business, which is poised

to continue its upward trajectory

in the coming years. Our hospitals

have been operating at near full

capacity, prompting us to proactively

expand our bed capacity to meet

the escalating demand. Moreover,

we are strategically establishing

new hospitals in areas where the

Aster brand is already recognized,

emphasizing our promise of “We will

treat you well”.

To accelerate our growth trajectory,

we have embarked on an array of

expansion plans. Notably, we are

augmenting the capacity of both

Aster MIMS Hospital Kannur and

Aster Medcity Kochi by adding 100

beds to each facility. Additionally,

we have initiated the construction

of a new 200-bed project at Aster

Hospital Kasargod, while Phase 1

of Aster Hospital in Trivandrum,

comprising 350 beds, is well

underway. The development of the

Phase 2 of Aster Whitefield Hospital

in Bengaluru, comprising 275 beds,

is nearing its completion, and it is

expected to become operational in

Q2 of FY 2023-24.

Key financial achievements

Our financial performance is

a testament to our success in

navigating these opportunities.

In the fiscal year 2023, our

revenue from operations reached

an impressive INR 2,983 crores,

marking a remarkable growth of

Mega Medical Screening

Camps

Aster Volunteers organized around 150

mega health camps to provide healthcare

services to underprivileged communities

across geographies. These camps aim to

address the healthcare needs of individuals

who lack access to quality medical facilities.

A wide range of healthcare services are

provided to the attendees, including

ophthalmology, cardiology, pediatrics,

and general medicine. Free medical

check-ups, consultations, and diagnostic

tests to identify and address various

health concerns are carried out by medical

professionals and Aster Volunteers.

Additionally, awareness sessions on topics

like basic life support, hygiene practices,

and disease prevention were conducted

to educate the participants and empower

them to take charge of their well-being.

The mega health camps witnessed a

significant turnout, with around 10,000

individuals. Through the collective efforts

of Aster Volunteers and the support of

partner organizations, these camps have

played a crucial role in improving the health

outcomes of underserved communities.

Note 1 :

The Company has received income tax assessment orders for AY 2014-15 & 2015-16 wherein the assessing officer has raised net

demand of INR 20.08 crores (net of taxes paid amounting to INR 4.28 crores) on account of disallowance of Foreign Tax Credit claimed

as per provisions of Section 90/90A of Income Tax Act 1961 and the disallowance under section 14A. The Company had provision in

the books pertaining to the AY 2014-15 & 2015-16, amounting to INR 2.48 . The Company has also received income tax demand order

of INR 0.18 crore for AY 2012-13 where in assessing officer denied legal and professional fee and business promotion expenses. The

Company also received income tax demand order of INR 2.28 crore for AY 16-17 where assessing officer contended TDS dedcuted

from doctors are subject to section 192 rather than section 194J of income tax act 1961 based on the terms of arrangements with

the doctors . The Company had also recieved income tax demand order of INR 0.20 crore for AY 17-18 wherein assessing officer made

disallowances on account of delayed payment of provident fund deducted from employees. In all above cases, the Management

believes that the position taken by it on the matter is tenable and hence, no adjustment has been made on the financial statements.

The Company has filed an appeal against the demand received.

Note 2 :

The Company has obtained duty free / concessional duty licenses for import of capital goods by undertaking export obligations under

the EPCG scheme. As at 31 March 2023, the export obligations remaining to be fulfilled amounts to INR 16.00 crores (31 March 2022:

INR 12.80 crores). In the event that export obligations are not fulfilled, the Company would be liable to pay the levies.

Note 3 :

On 23 April 2018, the Government of Kerala issued an order revising the minimum wages of medical and nursing staff. The

order mentions that the changes would be effective retrospectively from 1 October 2017. Since the legislation was issued in

April 2018, Management has started paying the revised salary with effect from 1 April 2018. The Company filed an appeal

against the retrospective application of this order with the High Court of Kerala which has issued an interim stay order on 26

July 2018. The Writ Petition WP (c) No. 25109/2018 challenging the retrospective effect of minimum wage order passed by

the Government of Kerala is pending before the Hon’ble High Court of Kerala in hearing list. Based on the stay order and legal

advise, Management believes that their position will be upheld and therefore has not provided for the incremental cost for the

period October 2017 to March 2018.

Note 4 :

On 28 February 2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has delivered a judgment clarifying the principles that need to be applied in

determining the components of salaries and wages on which Provident Fund (PF) contributions need to be made by establishments.

Basis this judgment, the Company has re-computed its liability towards PF from the month of March 2019 and has paid PF as per

Supreme Court judgement. In respect of the earlier periods/years, the Company has been legally advised that there are numerous

interpretative challenges on the application of the judgment retrospectively. Based on such legal advice, the Management believes

that it is impracticable at this stage to reliably measure the provision required, if any, and accordingly, no provision has been made

towards the same. Necessary adjustments, if any, will be made to the books as more clarity emerges on this subject.

Note 5 :

The Company has included claims of INR 32.06 crores under “Claims against the company not acknowledged as debt”. The

cases are compensation demanded by the patient/ their relatives and are pending with various Consumer Disputes Redressal

Commission. The management believes that the Company has good chance of success in these cases and has adequate

insurance coverage against all these claims.

Note 6 :

The Company has reviewed all its pending litigations and proceedings and has adequately provided for where provisions are

required and disclosed as contingent liability where applicable, in its standalone financial statements. The Company does not

expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially adverse effect on its financial position. The Company does not

expect any reimbursement in respect of the above contingent liabilities.

Note 7 :

The Company has given bank guarantee in respect of certain contingent liabilities listed above.:
