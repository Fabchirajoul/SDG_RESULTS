Notice of Annual General Meeting:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to

share with you again at the conclusion

of a productive year. Before I begin I

hope all of you are in great health and

high spirits.

At Dr. Lal PathLabs, we have been

very tactfully increasing our presence

across the country, which is otherwise

fragmented and dominated by

unorganised players. We are the

leader amongst three lakhs odd

clinical laboratories in India. This

is because of our unwavering

commitment to provide our

patients and customers with high-

quality diagnostics at competitive

prices, while providing them with

a superior testing experience via

an omnichannel approach. This

is precisely in accordance with

our internal strategy to reach

more consumers in various Indian

cities. Today, we have substantially

strengthened our presence in the

best-in-class quality of services

provided across the entire spectrum

of tests. In addition to establishing

an excellent lab network, we have

invested heavily in the brand to leave

a lasting impression on consumers.

We were the first to recognize that

India requires quality diagnostics

that are accessible to the masses

everywhere in India. In line with

this, over the years, we have tracked

the gradual evolution of modern

medicine in the management of our

patients. Since, seventy percent of

all medical decisions are based on

laboratory tests, accurate diagnostics

contribute in a big way towards

the management of disease. This

includes the entire treatment process

which consists of disease detection,

prognosis, diagnosis, treatment

planning and post-treatment

monitoring. To this end, we are

continuing to invest in creating an

efficient technology-backed network

that can align with the growth in

sample volumes.

Reflecting on the year gone by,

I am delighted to share that we

have achieved 15.5% growth in the

non-COVID revenue in FY 2022-23.

We have proudly served about 26.9

million patients in FY 2022-23. This

has come on the back of a sharp

focus on core operations across the

country including Tier-2 and Tier-3

cities and investments in digital

infrastructure.

It is worthwhile to note that, since the

fiscal marked the first year following

two consecutive years dominated by

the pandemic, our march towards

reaching normalcy was the fastest

in the industry. Owing to this, during

the fiscal, we were successful in

redeployment of the investments we

had made for Covid.

We continued to make progress

across our three strategic pillars that

include geographical expansion,

creating a unique fresh-size portfolio

and augmenting the technology

infrastructure for the future.

Managing Director’s message: Dear Shareholders,

In a dynamic health services

ecosystem, Dr. Lal PathLabs has

resiliently evolved and adapted

to rapid changes, especially since

the beginning of the Covid-19

pandemic. It has not only presented

unforeseen challenges but, has also

unveiled opportunities for growth

and innovation. Keeping a steady

focus on delivering quality services,

we have prioritised the convenience

of patients. It has earned us the trust

of people and have empowered us

to play an integral role in laying the

foundation of a healthier future.

The demand for diagnostic services

is experiencing a significant surge,

driven by growing awareness about

health and wellness, growth of

lifestyle disorders and an aging

population. Identifying the specific

needs of people, we have taken

strides to bring diagnostic services

to patients’ doorsteps. Our sample

collection services from home have

allowed us to significantly improve

the standards of our service. Besides,

we have adopted new technologies

to enhance the accuracy and

efficiency of our diagnostic

services. We are also expanding our

network to reach more people and

consistently fulfil the demand for

superior quality services.

The demand for

diagnostic services

is experiencing a

significant surge,

driven by growing

awareness about

health and wellness,

growth of lifestyle

disorders and an aging

population. Identifying

the specific needs

of people, we have

taken strides to bring

diagnostic services to

patients’ doorsteps.

Performance overview

During the financial year, we have

registered 26.9 million patient visits

and reported total revenue of

H 2,017 crore. Our non-COVID

revenue for FY23 soared to H 1,954

crore, reflecting a substantial

growth of 15.5% compared to the

previous year. Although the total

revenue for FY23 slightly decreased

to H 2,017 crore, we remain focused

on delivering exceptional diagnostic

services to our valued patrons.

Our Swasthfit portfolio generated

an impressive revenue of H 370 crore

in FY23. It highlights the growing

demand for preventive healthcare

packages, underscoring our

commitment to encourage people

to opt for comprehensive health

screening for ensuring healthcare

and wellness.

Technology adoption

We have made significant

investments in technology,

particularly in patient-facing

applications and the adoption

of digital platforms. Our focus

has been on improving access to

diagnostic services and catering

to patient convenience. It has also

led to the development of a user-

Moving forward, we

aim to deepen our

presence in Tier-2 and

Tier-3 cities, to explore

a vast opportunity

landscape in these

areas. By strengthening

our network and

expanding our services,

we aspire to cater to

rising healthcare needs

in underserved areas.

Managing Director

Dr. Lal Pathlabs has, as an organisation, established a

niche for itself in the field of medical diagnostics and

preventive healthcare. However, we believe that we are

not solely defined by our business success; our identity is

shaped by who we are to the communities we operate in,

and how we have included them in our own growth, and

reduced the gaps in healthcare in the country.

Towards this end, we continued to develop and

implement programs with the goal of bringing about

healthcare equanimity and share our success with the

marginalised communities in our society. We targeted

areas that have been hitherto unaddressed, and over the

years, we have been able to reach out to the masses that

truly need our interventions.
