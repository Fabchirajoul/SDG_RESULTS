Vice Chairman & 
Managing Directorâ€™s review
 In the face of adverse factors such as 
a challenging macro environment and 
intense competition within the industry, 
our company achieved favourable 
f
 inancial performance. In FY23, our total 
revenue from operations grew by 6% 
y-o-y , reaching H24,855 crore. Despite 
experiencing price erosion in our key 
US generics business and grappling 
with high input price inflation that 
compressed margins, we implemented 
multiple initiatives to enhance 
efficiency and offset margin pressures. 
Notwithstanding the challenging 
business environment, we remained 
committed to investments in R&D and 
capex projects, essential for our 
long-term sustainable growth strategy.
 FY23 proved to be a significant and 
eventful year for Aurobindo, as it marked 
our first complete year of business 
after the pandemic. Despite global 
uncertainties and the potential threat of 
a recession in major economies, India's 
strong fundamentals and supportive 
policies enabled us to showcase 
resilience and achieve widespread 
economic growth. The strength of our 
diversified product portfolio and global 
market presence mitigated the negative 
impact, highlighting the robustness 
of our business model and strategies. 
Leveraging our diverse portfolio and 
global presence, we will continue 
to drive growth and deliver value to 
stakeholders in the years ahead.
 EXPANDING LEADERSHIP AND 
EMPOWERING OUR LEADERS
 Our commitment to expanding 
leadership and empowering our leaders 
has been a cornerstone of our progress.

 We have successfully transitioned to a 
more decentralised structure, appointing 
a dedicated CEO and Board for each 
vertical within our Company. This 
transformation marks a pivotal moment 
for us, fostering increased accountability 
and ensuring the development of strong 
leaders for the future. By moving away 
from a centralised approach, we cultivate 
a culture of innovation, agility, and 
adaptability that will propel us forward 
into new realms of success. 
Our efforts to expand leadership reflect 
our unwavering commitment to building 
a robust foundation that will support 
our continued growth and enable us to 
navigate the evolving landscape of the 
pharmaceutical industry with confidence.
 PIONEERING CHANGE FOR 
A BETTER FUTURE
 In today's world, the profound impact 
of climate change and irresponsible 
consumption leading to resource 
scarcity cannot be ignored. It is a 
crucial time to act responsibly and 
integrate sustainability into our business 
practices. Aligned with our purpose, 
we have remained unwavering in our 
commitment to enhance the well-being 
of the communities we engage with 
and nurture life on our planet through 
active environmental stewardship. 
We have set ambitious Environment, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) goals, 
including reducing carbon emissions, 
transitioning from traditional fuel 
sources to renewable energy, and 
implementing responsible water and 
waste management practices. Given 
we prioritise the well-being of our 
employees and partners, we have 
already made substantial progress in 
these areas.

PRESERVING OUR PLANET
 Our dedication to sustainability is 
evident in the steady increase in the 
adoption of sustainable packaging 
techniques and practices throughout 
the year. Furthermore, our efforts to 
promote sustainability within our supply 
chain continue to thrive. Through our 
dedication and investment, we have 
successfully established solar power 
generation capabilities, resulting 
in the generation and consumption 
of 43,000 MWh of solar energy in 
FY23. This achievement represents a 
significant step towards reducing our 
environmental impact and promoting 
cleaner energy sources. Additionally, 
our commitment to combat beyond-the
fence water pollution and alleviate the 
burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) 
has led us to implement wastewater 
treatment measures at our API 
manufacturing and formulation facilities. 
Our ultimate objective is to treat and 
reuse wastewater, ensuring responsible 
resource management and contributing 
to a healthier environment.

and a sustainable planet. With a focus on
