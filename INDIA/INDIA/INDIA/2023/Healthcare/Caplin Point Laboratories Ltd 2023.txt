Dear Shareholders,

It is my pleasure to share the key developments of the Company

for FY23 and way forward.

FY23, has been another great milestone and a rather momentous

one, in our journey of stakeholder value creation without

compromising on basic values. We have not only grown our

revenues, operational profits, net profits and cash reserves, but

we went ahead to create the avenues for a much greater and

sustainable growth in the coming years.

During FY23, we clocked our highest ever financial performance

numbers. Our total revenues crossed `1500 Crores mark to reach

`1,523 Crores in FY23 from `1,308 Crores in FY22, registering 16.4%

growth. Our Net Profits grew from `308 Crores in FY22 to `377 Crores

in FY23 registering even higher growth of 22.4%. Our Cash & Cash

Equivalents touches `772 Crores as at March 31, 2023.

From MD’s Desk

At Caplin, we believe in

investing in people, nurturing

talent, build human relations

for organizational success and

grow mutually since together

we all grow. In line with our core

ideology of growing along with

our people, we continued to

invest in our strategic HR initiative

of rewarding employees

through ESOP schemes.

Managing Director

Dr. Sridhar Ganesan has over 3 decades of varied global leadership experience in the

Pharmaceutical Industry, including but not limited to, Profit center Management, Global Marketing,

Middle East and African engagement, international collaborative and cooperative relationship-

building, new pharmaceutical project planning & implementation, production, new product

development, Quality Assurance and Factory Management. Currently: Managing

Managing Director of the Company. In addition, the

Company’s senior leadership team undertakes various

risk governance measures at the operational level as per

the requirements. While every company, as part of its risk

management strategy, tries to put in place mitigation

measures to the extent possible, risks cannot be wished

away. We have listed a summarised account of some

of our key risks and mitigation measures drawn from

management reviews and deliberations of RMC.

SOME OF THE IDENTIFIED RISkS AND ITS MITIGATION

STRATEGY

Geographical risk

Dependence of the Company on a specific geography

can affect balanced growth.

Mitigation strategy

The Company has a strong presence in Latin America.

On the one hand, the Company is enlarging its presence

in Latin America and on the other hand the Company

has been gradually stepping up its presence in the

US and other regulatory markets, which will reduce its

dependency in Latin America in future.

Currency fluctuation and receivables risk

The Company is exposed to currency fluctuations due to

its international presence

Mitigation strategy

Rising costs due to currency fluctuations are absorbed

through natural hedging. The Company receivables are

at 97 days in 2022-23 as compared to 92 days in 2021-22.

During the last few years, the increase in the cycle was

on account of entering into the tender-based segment,

marked by secure large sales to government agencies

carrying a longer receivables cycle.

The major

risks identified

by the management

are regulatory,

competition, supply

chain disruption, cyber

& data security along

with economic and

political risks.
