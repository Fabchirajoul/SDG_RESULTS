Dear Shareholders,

India stands at a pivotal point in its

growth journey, poised to become a

US$5 trillion economy within the next

few years on the back of ambitious

reforms and a robust digital foundation.

Reiterating India’s economic momentum

is the projection that its gross domestic

product (GDP) will exceed 7.2% in

2023-24, marking the third consecutive

year of over 7% growth. This resilience

is particularly compelling at a time

when global growth continues to

face challenges. Moreover, the Indian

government has strongly emphasized

balanced and sustainable growth by

driving financial inclusion, improving

public healthcare systems and bridging

rural-urban divide.

India’s vision of universal healthcare

accessibility is led by Ayushman Bharat,

a national public health initiative,

complemented by the Ayushman Bharat

Digital Mission (ABDM) facilitating

seamless health data transfer among

stakeholders. These initiatives have

made significant strides, benefiting

millions through comprehensive primary

healthcare services and screenings for

non-communicable diseases, among

other facilities. Additionally, the interim

budget for 2024-25 announced an

It gives me great pleasure to introduce the

second integrated annual report of Sanofi

India. Your Company’s robust fundamentals

have contributed to another year of shared

value creation, all the while staying firmly

rooted to the core purpose of improving lives.

Integrated Annual Report 2023

Sanofi India Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

Reflecting on the year 2023, I am pleased

to report that Sanofi India has achieved

significant progress against its priorities.

Guided by our singular purpose, ‘chase the

miracles of science to improve people’s

lives,’ and propelled by our ‘India for India’

strategy, we adeptly navigated a dynamic

environment, supported patients and

consumers with innovative healthcare

solutions and delivered strong results for

the year.

Towards the close of 2022, we had

unveiled our strategic roadmap aimed

at accelerating our business in India,

concentrating on four growth pillars:

Diabetes, Consumer Healthcare,

Innovation and Go-to-Market. Thanks to

the dedication of our team, I am proud to

say we are succeeding. The performance

throughout 2023 has been encouraging

and consistent. Moreover, our strategic

approach has positioned us to capture

exciting growth opportunities in India’s

healthcare landscape and also contributed

to a more streamlined and efficient

operation. I am happy to share with you

an update on the key achievements within

the growth pillars of our ‘India for India’

strategy and our plans to leverage these

successes in reaching our full potential.

M A N A G I N G D I R E C T O R ’ S M E S S A G E

PROPELLED BY OUR

‘INDIA FOR INDIA’

STRATEGY

We are well-positioned to address India’s

expanding healthcare needs through our ‘India

for India’ strategy. Our innovation pipeline

boasts promising products, instilling optimism

about addressing unmet needs and advancing

our growth trajectory.

Within the Diabetes domain, a pivotal development was

the marketing approval for our drug Soliqua™ in India. Set

to launch in 2024, Soliqua™, available as a pre-filled pen, is

a significant launch which expands our portfolio and marks

our entry in the Glucagon-Like Peptide (GLP) segment

which is a highly exciting place to be in. As a Fixed Ratio

Combination (FRC) of basal insulin and Glucagon-Like

Peptide 1 agonist (GLP 1 agonist), Soliqua™ ensures

effective control over fasting and postprandial glucose

levels. This breakthrough solution, administered once

daily with a significantly low risk of hypoglycemia,

empowers healthcare professionals (HCPs) to simplify

the complexities of diabetes management, opening up

substantial opportunities within our insulin portfolio.

During the year, the Board approved the demerger of the

consumer healthcare business into a distinct entity, Sanofi

Consumer Healthcare India Limited (SCHIL), granting it

full independent management. SCHIL will seamlessly align

with our parent company’s consumer healthcare strategy,

enhancing its role in the Indian consumer healthcare

landscape. The proposed entity will also be equipped

with a comprehensive portfolio, specific global skills

and best-in-class digital and e-commerce capabilities,

driving its evolution as a fast-moving consumer healthcare

organization. SCHIL is expected to be fully operational by

the second half of 2024 subject to necessary approvals,

paving the way for maximizing its growth potential and

unlocking enhanced shareholder value.

Under the pillar of Innovation, we introduced multiple

high-impact products: Frisium® suspension (Neurology),

Sanoxaban® (Cardiology) and Carmada® (Cardiology).

Furthermore, our innovation pipeline boasts promising

products, instilling optimism about addressing unmet

needs and advancing our growth trajectory. As part of the

overarching ‘India for India’ initiative, we have initiated

the localization of certain insulin assets. Insutage, our

domestically sourced Insuman, will soon be available in

India. The India team remains committed to collaborating

with external and internal stakeholders to leverage Sanofi

global assets, ensuring their localization for the benefit of

Indian patients.

The fourth pillar of Go-to-Market witnessed several

developments, notably the ramping up of our deployed

trade organization which has improved our ability to

engage with partners and foster customer centricity.

To unlock mutual growth opportunities, we strategically

realigned our portfolio, shifting from a brand-wise

approach to engaging with partners across the entire

portfolio. Currently, four digital marketing pilots are

underway. These are anticipated to yield positive impact,

thus improving our agility and market reach.

Under the ‘Go-to-Market’ pillar, we are also exploring

partnership opportunities to extend our product reach.

In early FY 2024, notable progress includes an exclusive

partnership with Cipla Limited to distribute our CNS

portfolio across India. Leveraging Cipla’s extensive

network, we aim to deliver our six CNS brands, including

the leading anti-epileptic medication Frisium®, to

healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients nationwide.

Additionally, we have formed an exclusive alliance with

Emcure Pharmaceuticals to expand the distribution

of our cardiovascular brands, including established

names like Cardace®, Clexane®, Targocid®, Lasix®, and

Lasilactone®, benefiting both HCPs and patients.

Another positive indicator of our strategy’s success is the

consistent performance witnessed throughout 2023.

Each quarter has seen growth in our operating profits

compared to the previous year, both in absolute value and as

percentage of sales. This achievement stems from prudent

resource allocation and the pursuit of operating efficiencies,

achieved through cost optimization across sales, marketing,

structural, general and administrative areas.

At Sanofi India, we eagerly pursue our responsibility to

provide long-term benefit to society as we fulfill our

corporate purpose. We consider our Environmental, Social

and Governance (ESG) metrics integral to evaluating

our success. ESG is formally embedded into our Board’s

Governance principles to steer our organization towards

growth while safeguarding stakeholder interests.

One of our sustainability commitments is to ensure an

empowering work environment that sets our standards

as a world-class employer. At the beginning of 2024, for

the sixth consecutive year secured the ‘Top Employer’s

Award’ in recognition for outstanding people and culture

practices amongst companies across the world.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) have become focal

points across our Company, with various departments

setting targets to drive progress in this area. We have

made significant strides towards engaging with diverse

communities, ensuring better diversity in our clinical trial

candidates and partnering with diverse MSME vendors.

Internally, we are increasing inclusivity by implementing

gender-neutral restrooms and improving accessibility

for individuals with disabilities. Currently, women

comprise 14% of our workforce, and form 33% of our

senior leadership. Additionally, we are actively promoting

awareness and understanding of LGBTQI+ and disability

inclusion.

Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to address India’s

expanding healthcare needs through our ‘India for India’

strategy. Simultaneously, our commitment to maintaining

a strong focus on shareholder value remains unwavering.

By ensuring that both our general medicines business

and our proposed new company dedicated to consumer

healthcare are well-prepared to carve out promising

independent futures, we aim to open new avenues for

our overall India business, benefiting millions with our

healthcare offerings.

On behalf of the Board, I express our gratitude

for your continued support and trust. I also extend my

sincere appreciation to all our employees for their valuable

contributions during the past year. As we, at Sanofi India,

advance on our journey, we remain steadfast in working

with utmost sincerity and integrity towards our goal of

building a healthier India.

A. Conservation of Energy

Aligned with Sanofi’s commitment to combat climate

change and limit global warming to 1.5°C, we strive for

carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero greenhouse

gas emissions by 2045 across all scopes, anchoring

effective energy management as a core element of our

operations.

Recognising energy consumption’s significant

role in greenhouse gas emissions and operational

costs, we prioritise enhancing energy efficiency.

We continuously refine energy management

systems, emphasising optimal asset utilisation, best

practices adoption, and energy-efficient technology

integration.

Our energy consumption spans operations, buildings,

and offices. In CY 2023, renewable energy constituted

49.1% of our consumption, a 9% improvement from

the previous year, sourced from solar power, biomass,

and green energy purchases. Fossil fuel reliance

decreased by approximately 17% compared to 2022,

with a further 8% reduction in non-renewable grid

electricity purchases.

Of our total energy procurement, 44% is from non-

renewable sources, 11% from purchased green energy,

and 4% from onsite solar generation. Biomass meets

34% of our needs, while 7% comes from fossil fuels.

Energy Conservation measures undertaken

in 2023:

Goa factory

In 2022, the HVAC energy optimization project

for Production Building 2 was successfully

completed. Work is currently underway for

Production Building 1, scheduled for completion

by 2024, promising significant savings upon

project fruition.

In the same year, a 1.8 MW solar power system was

installed under an OPEX model, which generated

8970 GJ of electricity in CY 2023. Onsite solar

generation has resulted in ` 6 million in savings,

projected to continue for 15 years.

Also in 2022, we initiated a multi-site ISO 50001

certification process, affirming the effectiveness

of our energy management systems.

To reduce reliance on fossil fuels, we have

implemented the use of biomass for steam

generation.

Our solid oral line facilities have been upgraded

with state-of-the-art technology.

Technical areas have been equipped with white

color sheets to minimize heating.

Robust automation and digital tools have been

implemented to collect equipment-specific

efficiency data, promoting efficient equipment

usage and waste reduction. Blister packaging

line 10 has been completed, with ongoing work

for other lines.

Management Discussion and Analysis Report

Economic Overview

Amid a challenging global economic landscape and

deteriorating geopolitical conditions, India continues

to shine as a bright spot. It is the fifth-largest economy

in the world and is poised to retain its position as the

world’s fastest-growing major economy. Its GDP growth

remained buoyant at 7.3% in FY 2023-24 as against 7.2%

in FY 2022- 23, supported by robust domestic demand,

moderate inflation, a stable interest rate environment,

and strong foreign exchange reserves. Furthermore, an

accelerated pace of economic reforms and increased capital

expenditure paved the way for construction activities and

large-scale employment opportunities in the country. The

International Monetary Fund (IMF) commended India’s

economic resilience, robust growth, and notable progress

in formalization and digital infrastructure.

India had successfully harnessed inflation in FY 2023-24

which is still plaguing major advanced economies. India’s

Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate decreased to

5.69% (provisional) in December 2023 against 5.72% in

December 2022. The RBI, in its efforts to control inflation

and boost economic growth, decided to keep the policy

repo rate unchanged at 6.50%. Furthermore, India’s per

capita Net National Income (NNI) at constant (2011-12)

prices increased by 6.08% from ` 98,374 in FY 2022-23

to ` 1,04,550 in FY 2023-24. Due to increasing disposable

income levels, there is a surge in household consumption

in both urban and rural regions, boosting the demand

across sectors.

India’s economic outlook is optimistic as it reaps

the benefits of demographic dividend, physical and

digital infrastructure enhancements, increased capital

expenditure and the government’s proactive policy

measures such as Production Linked Incentive (PLI)

Schemes. According to the IMF, the Indian economy is

expected to expand steadily at 6.5% in 2024.

Industry Overview

Indian Pharmaceutical Industry

India is the world’s third-largest pharmaceutical

manufacturer by volume and the largest provider of

generic medicines, occupying a 20% share of global supply

by volume and contributing to around 60% of the global

vaccines. The Indian pharmaceutical industry experienced

steady growth over the last few years with a focus on

generic medicines. The rapid expansion of generic drug

manufacturing is a significant trend, solidifying India’s

position as a global pharmaceutical hub. The Indian

pharmaceutical industry offers 60,000 generic brands

across 60 therapeutic categories and manufactures 500+

different Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs).

The Indian pharmaceutical market recorded a 10% growth

in 2023, aligning with the 5-year CAGR. The growth was

primarily driven by price increases, followed by volume

and new introductions. In terms of growth drivers of the

market, the predominant factor is price-led growth of

4%. It is closely followed by 3% volume growth, showing

improvement compared to the previous year. The loss of

patent for several chronic molecules and a surge in new

launches contributed to 3% NI led growth.

Most chronic therapies have recorded slower growth in

2023 compared to the 5-year CAGR. There was loss of

patent in few Cardiology and Diabetes molecules leading to

lowering of the average price. Anti-Infectives demonstrated

a growth rate higher than the average CAGR in 2023.

This is mainly due to higher growth in Amoxy Clav and in

antibiotics like Ceftriaxone and combinations, Meropenem,

etc. Oncology and Vaccine therapies also recorded higher

growth in 2023.

Indian drugs are exported to more than 200 countries

in the world, with the US being the key market.

Pharmaceutical exports are likely to touch US $28 billion

in FY 2023-24, registering 10.2% growth, primarily due

to drug shortages in the US and Europe and a revival in

demand in Africa. According to IQVIA’s report ‘The Global

Use of Medicines 2024 – Outlook through 2028,’ global

spending for medicines is expected to reach US$ 2.3

trillion by 2028. The volume use of medicines globally is

expected to grow at an average 2.3% rate through 2028,

driven by China, India and other Asian markets all growing

faster than 3%. This will create huge opportunities for

Indian pharmaceutical companies.

Various government schemes such as the production-

linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the Strengthening of

Pharmaceutical Industry (SPI) scheme have propelled the

growth of the pharmaceutical sector. The flagship scheme,

Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP)

has achieved the target of opening 10,000 retail outlets

to provide quality generic medicines at affordable prices.

Additionally, 206 medicines have been added to the product

basket in 2023. Furthermore, the Indian pharmaceutical

sector attracted a foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow of

` 4,456 crore from April 2023 to September 2023.

The growth momentum of the Indian pharmaceutical

industry is expected to continue in the coming years on

the back of favorable government policies, increasing

10.2% growth

Pharmaceutical exports are likely to touch

US $28 billion in FY 2023-24:

Committees/Directors:

The Company follows a structured assessment process

for evaluation of performance of the Board, Committees

of the Board and individual performance of each Director

including the Chairman based on the criteria approved

by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.

The Chairman of the Board leads the exercise of the

Performance Evaluation with the Company Secretary,

assisting him.

The evaluation is based on parameters like level of

participation of the Directors, understanding of the

roles and responsibilities of Directors, understanding of

the business and competitive environment in which the

Company operates, understanding of the strategic issues

and challenges for the Company, etc. The performance

of the Independent Directors is also evaluated taking

into account the time devoted, strategic guidance to the

Company, advice given for determining important policies,

external expertise provided and independent judgment

that contributes objectively to the Board’s deliberation.

The performance evaluation of the Board is carried

out taking into account the various parameters like

composition of Board, process of appointment to the

Board, common understanding amongst Directors of their

role and responsibilities, timelines and content of Board

papers, strategic directions, advice and decision making,

etc. The Board also notes the actions undertaken, pursuant

to the outcome of previous evaluation exercises. Each

Committee’s self-assessment is carried out based on the

degree of fulfillment of the key responsibilities as outlined

by its terms of reference.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, evaluation forms

were circulated to the Board Members. Each Director

completes the evaluation form and shares feedback.

The feedback scores as well as qualitative comments

are then shared with the Nomination and Remuneration

Committee and presented by the Chairman to the Board.

The feedback on Committee Evaluation is shared by the

Committee Chairperson with the Committee Members.

discuss the outcome of performance evaluation exercise.

The Chairman of the Board and the Chairperson of the

Nomination and Remuneration Committee briefs the Board

on the overall outcome.

The evaluation of individual Directors is on parameters such

as attendance, contribution and independent judgement.

by the Company internally which included the evaluation

of the Board as a whole, Board Committees and Peer

evaluation of the Directors. The outcome and action points

(hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”)

according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid

required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in

the manner so required and give a true and fair view

Independent Auditor’s Report

total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and

other comprehensive income), consolidated changes

in equity and its consolidated cash flows for the year

then ended.

Basis for Opinion

3.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards

on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of

the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are

further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for

the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements”

section of our report. We are independent of the Group

in accordance with the ethical requirements that are

relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial

statements in India in terms of the Code of Ethics issued

by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and

the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled

our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with

these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence

we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide

a basis of our opinion.

Key Audit Matters

4.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional

judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the

consolidated financial statements of the current period.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit

of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and

in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a

separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Tax litigations and contingencies.

(Refer Notes 8(a), 8(b), 21, 36(a), 36(b) and 41 to the consolidated

financial statements)

As at December 31, 2023, several litigations under direct and

indirect tax laws are pending for decision at various authority

levels, in respect of which, the Group has disclosed contingent

liabilities of ` 2,909 million.

The management’s assessment with regard to the tax matters is

supported by views from independent consultants.

We considered this as a key audit matter, as evaluation of

these matters requires significant management judgement

and estimation, interpretation of laws and regulations and

application of relevant judicial precedents to determine the

probability of outflow of economic resources for recognising

provisions and making related disclosures in the consolidated

financial statements. The application of accounting principles

as given under Ind AS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and

Contingent Assets, in order to determine the amount to be

recognised as a provision, or to be disclosed as a contingent

liability, needs careful evaluation and judgement to be applied

by the management.

Our audit procedures included the following:

Understanding and evaluation of the design and testing

the operating effectiveness of key controls in respect of

assessment of tax litigations and contingencies, its accounting

and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements;

Obtaining a complete list of litigation matters and reading

the underlying orders and other communications received

from tax authorities and management’s responses thereto,

to assess the status of the litigations;

Evaluating the independence, objectivity and competence

of management’s experts involved;

Reading the management’s experts’ views, as applicable;

Evaluating the management’s assessment on the probability of

outcome and the magnitude of potential outflow of economic

resources in respect of tax matters including involvement of

our tax specialists for assessing complex tax matters, based on

recent rulings and latest developments in case laws;

Evaluating appropriateness of the Company’s disclosures in

the consolidated financial statements.

Based on the audit procedures performed, we did not identify

any significant exceptions relating to the provisions recognised

and disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements in

respect of the tax matters.:
