Dear shareholders,

I extend a warm welcome to the Annual

Report of Laurus Labs Limited – a

Company committed towards ensuring a

healthier future for the world.

I am glad that, like every year, this year

too, the Company has endeavoured

to work with perseverance, patience

and passion. Drawing out a strategic

roadmap, with three long-term strategic

objectives as pillars for the key operational

strategies, Laurus Labs has ensured that its

capabilities are optimally utilised.

The Indian pharma industry

has set itself on a vision of

establishing India’s global

leadership in life sciences by 2030,

while driving deeper domestic

access and affordability. In

addition to this, the Ayushman

Bharat Yojana launched in 2018 is

the biggest healthcare initiative in

the world, which has been a boost

to the pharma sector, granting

tremendous opportunities to grow.

India and pharma – a deep bond

The pharma industry in India has

been fundamentally responsible for

manoeuvring the way public health

outcomes are seen due to its high quality,

affordable drugs. At the same time, the

industry is amongst the top five sectors

impacting foreign exchange earnings

and has been contributing close to 2% to

India’s economic growth story. The fusion

of both these elements is making the

industry poised for high growth.

I am glad that,

like every year,

this year too, the

Company has

endeavoured to work

with perseverance,

patience and passion.
