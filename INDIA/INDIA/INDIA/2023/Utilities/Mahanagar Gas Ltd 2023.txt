Dear Shareholders,

At Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL), we are

dedicated to enabling a better tomorrow

for all, responsibly and sustainably. Our

commitment goes beyond providing

CNG and PNG to our customers; it

extends to creating a positive impact

on the environment, communities and

the economy. Through our reliable and

efficient energy solutions, innovative

initiatives and responsible practices, we

strive to make a meaningful difference in

people’s lives, while paving the way for a

brighter and greener tomorrow.

Your Company plays a critical role to ensure

uninterrupted gas supply to its valued

customers across all segments of the City

Gas Distribution (CGD) sector, despite

volatility in the global energy landscape.

Global energy prices continued to be

volatile in FY 2023, owing to geopolitical

conflicts in Europe and its wide ramifications

for the rest of the world.

As one of the world’s fastest growing

major economy with a huge aspirational

population demanding a better quality of

life, India’s energy consumption is likely to

increase significantly. Despite having a per

capita energy consumption that is only one-

third of the global average, the long-term

potential for increased energy demand in

India is evident. Recognizing the importance

of environmentally clean fuels, the country

is expected to rely heavily on natural gas,

which is projected to play a dominant role

in India’s economic growth.

MGL marches ahead

MGL stands tall as one of the largest

CNG and PNG distribution companies

in India. MGL continues to create CGD

infrastructure across its business segments

in the licensed area, and over the years we

have established connectivity for nearly 2.17

million households.

We have also laid 314 km of steel and

PE pipelines during FY 2023, taking the

aggregate length of pipelines to +6,500

km. In addition, we continue to add CNG

stations, totalling 313 CNG stations as

on 31st March 2023. I am also happy to

apprise you that we are continuously adding

industrial and commercial customers (I&C)

and by end of FY 2023 we had over 4,500

I&C customers.

For well over two decades, we have

consistently grown, serving as the sole

authorized distributor of CNG and PNG in

Mumbai, Urban Thane, its adjoining areas,

and Raigad. With GAIL (India) Ltd., being one

Well over two decades, we have

consistently grown, serving as

the sole authorized distributor

of CNG and PNG in Mumbai,

Urban Thane, its adjoining

areas, and Raigad. With GAIL

(India) Ltd., being one of the

esteemed shareholder together

with the Government of

Maharashtra ensuring stability

and support, MGL stands on

strong foundation.

Annual Report 2022-23

Mahanagar Gas Limited:

Managing Director’s

message: Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to outline the

financial and operational performance of

MGL for FY2022-23. Over the years, MGL

has established itself as a responsible

energy provider, enhancing the quality

of life of consumers. Our unwavering

commitment to excellence has resulted

in consistent growth of our business for

over two decades.

With our focus on providing reliable

and affordable CNG and PNG to our

customers, we aim to contribute to a cleaner

environment and improved quality of life.

Performing notwithstanding

challenges

Throughout the fiscal year 2022-23,

domestic gas prices and gas allocations

have posed as significant challenges.

However, there have been positive

developments. The implementation of a

new domestic gas pricing policy has brought

much-needed relief to the CGD sector. Also,

the Government’s notification regarding

High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT)

Gas allocation priority to CGD is another

positive for D-PNG and CNG segment.

This notification emphasizes the priority

allocation of HPHT gas to the City Gas

Distribution (CGD) sector.

If we look at the volume growth since FY

2018-19 till FY2022-23, despite volatility

and rise in gas prices, we have clocked a

CAGR of approximately 5%. With the new

pricing formula declared by Government

of India resulting in APM price operating in

narrow band and declining prices, CNG and

PNG volumes are likely to pick up pace. We

have also increased our I&C customer base.

Notwithstanding challenges, our financial

performance for the year continued

to remain robust, with a revenue CAGR

of ~23% from FY2019 to FY2023 and a

Return on Net Worth of ~20% in FY2023.

We maintain a total cash balance of around

INR 1.18 billion and a net worth of ~INR 41

billion. We have achieved the highest-ever

net sales revenue of INR 6,921 crore and

the highest-ever EBITDA of INR 1,184 crore.

Additionally, our domestic PNG connectivity

and conversions for current year touched

a record level of 305,000+ and 138,000,

respectively. We have also issued 51 Letters

of Intent (LoIs) for CNG stations, a record

so far.

The majority of our sales are from CNG

and domestic PNG, which form our priority

segments. We also prioritise the allocation

of APM gas and HPHT gas for CGD purposes

for priority sector. For the industrial and

We actively seek growth

opportunities by focusing on

market excellence, digitization,

and expanding through

inorganic City Gas Distribution

(CGD) initiatives.

letter and true spirit. The recent changes in

the APM gas pricing formula have further

improved the allocation framework as well

as reduced price volatility. We purchase

gas through various modes including spot

contracts and imported RLNG under term

contracts indexed to Crude oil or Henry Hub.

Safety and reliability take precedence at

MGL as we strive to maintain the highest

standards in health and safety. To achieve

this, we have established robust safety

management systems that ensures

accident-free continuous supply of gas. Our

unwavering dedication to these principles

is reflected in our extensive customer base,

with CNG being supplied to approximately

0.92 million vehicles and PNG connectivity

provided to nearly 2.17 million households.

These numbers serve as a testament to our

commitment to ensuring the well-being of

our customers.

Project Lakshya

The Company over the last few years

has witnessed higher pace of customer

acquisition and infrastructure expansion

and has set new performance benchmarks

surpassing its own past achievements.

However, to tide over the risks associated

with its current business portfolio and to be

a future ready organization, it is nonetheless

important for MGL to look beyond its current

ways of doing business, which may at

present appear to be satisfactory, but would

certainly require further improvements

and overhaul to meet its future growth

aspirations.

To accelerate the implementation of various

strategic initiatives “Project Lakshya” was

rolled out by MGL. The objective of the

initiative is to help the organization carve

out a sustainable growth path for the

future and simultaneously help acquire

specific competencies and adopt best-

in-class practices with focus on customer

convenience and customer delight.

During the first phase of Project Lakshya,

we have been consistently focusing on

promoting clean energy, and emphasizing

MGL as Mumbai’s green mobility supplier,

we now want to expand our visibility across

a spectrum of clean mobility solutions. In

order to unlock the next stage of growth

for the company and contribute to the

sustainability agenda of the nation, we

are considering various possibilities in clean

mobility solutions.

In the sphere of digitalisation, we have

revamped our MGL Connect App to

enhance customer experience. The app

now includes features such as a station

locator, information on empanelled hydro

testers and retrofitters, and a WhatsApp

chatbot for the convenience of our CNG

customers. Similarly, for PNG customers,

the app provides a streamlined process

for applying for new connections, updating

details, submitting meter readings, and

making payments.

The results of the phase 1 have been

path-breaking and has forged the path

towards the bold Lakshya ambition. For

the phase 2, we aim to scale up ongoing

initiatives and undertake new endeavours.

Our unwavering focus now would be on

operational excellence, maximising the

use of technology and data, building new

businesses and developing a future-ready

organisation.

letter dated November

01, 2021 had issued guidelines pertaining to revised Trade

discounts and subsequently citing MoP&NG guideline, OMCs

had raised their demand to the Company.

However, the demand raised by OMCs is not as per the

guidelines issued by the MoP&NG and hence the Company has

contested the demand raised by OMCs. Further, the Company

has raised the matter to the MoP&NG vide its: letter dated

December 30, 2021, requesting their intervention and advise

the OMCs to adhere to the guidance provided by the MoP&NG.

The Company has recognised provision for trade discount

based on management’s estimate. As at the balance sheet

date, the matter is yet awaiting final settlement with OMCs.

Pending such settlement and considering the management’s

judgement and assessment of the outcome of the matter, the

measurement of provision involves significant estimates and

thereby the matter has been considered as a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures among others included the following:

•

We evaluated the design and tested the operating

effectiveness of controls in respect of the identification

and evaluation of claims, proceedings and investigations

at different levels, and the recording and continuous

re-assessment of the related contingent liabilities and

disclosures.

•

We performed inquiries with the in-house legal counsel

and management on the legal evaluation of the claims

disputed.

•

We read the copies of communication exchanged between

OMCs, MoP & NG and the Company during the year.

•

For management’s estimate of discounts recorded,

we evaluated the details of assumptions used by the

management to arrive at such estimate.

•

We evaluated the disclosures in the financial statements

and have compared the communications of the Company

with the OMC and MoP&NG with the appropriateness of the

disclosure in the financial statements.

The Company maintains exposure in security deposits, reinstatement charges receivable, cash and cash equivalents and

term deposits with banks and corporates.

In case of security deposits and reinstatement charges, majority of which are given to Municipal authorities (which are

government controlled entities) towards pipeline laying activity, the credit risk is low. However, historically the company has

experienced a delay/ non receipt of these amounts and hence allowances have been taken into account for the expected

credit losses of these security deposits and reinstatement charges.

In case of bank /corporate fixed deposits regular quotations for interest rate are invited and based on best offered rate the

bank deposits are placed with banks/corporates having reasonably high net worth. Exposures of deposit placed are restricted

to limits per bank/corporate as per policy and limits are actively monitored by the Company. We understand that the credit

risk is very low to moderate for such deposits.
