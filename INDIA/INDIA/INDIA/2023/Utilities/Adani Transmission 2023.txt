Dear Shareholders,

A few months ago, I heard a new term called Permacrisis. I learnt that the Collins

dictionary had defined it as ‘An extended period of instability and insecurity’. It also chose

it as the Word for the Year 2022. Interestingly, I also learnt that two other words that were

in the running for the top spot were ‘quiet quitting’, which meant doing the bare minimum

duties at work (in rejection of competitive careerism) and ‘vibe shift’, which meant a

significant change in the prevailing culture. What I find fascinating is that in the post-

Covid world, these words accurately summarise changes that we see happening around us.

Managing Director,

explains the metamorphosis of ATL into a

The principal communication is that

the management is proposing to

change the name of Adani Transmission

to Adani Energy Solutions Limited.

The renaming of the Company was

warranted by the Company’s entry

into the power distribution space

following the acquisition of the power

distribution business of Reliance

Infrastructure Limited, subsequent

expansion, acquisition of MUL and

the application of a parallel license

Conduct and by displaying the

policy on the Company’s employee

portal. Further, to ensure

compliance, all employees were

trained on the Anti-Corruption

and Anti-Bribery policy as well as

the Code of Conduct at the time

of their induction and annually

thereafter. ATL’s annual online

mandatory training on the zero-

tolerance policy ensured that

employees were able to recognise,

avoid and raise concerns and

report any potential instances

of bribery or corruption. The

managers at all levels were

responsible for training employees

in the Anti-Corruption and Bribery

Policy.

To ensure that business partners

practiced the same ethical

standards as ATL, the Anti-

Corruption and Anti-Bribery

Policy was communicated to

contractors, suppliers and other

third parties through ATL’s supplier

Code of Conduct and vendor

agreements. According to the

Supplier Code of Conduct, all

ATL’s suppliers were expected

to refrain from offering or

accepting any undue payment

or other considerations directly

or indirectly. This consideration

was also a key element of ATL’s

Supplier Risk Assessment, which

checked their policies on Bribery,

Corruption and Whistle Blowing

prior to business agreement.

To ensure a comprehensive

compliance with Anti-

Corruption and Bribery Policy

and regulations, ATL made

zero political contributions in

the reporting period. As per

the policy of the Company, all

political contributions needed to

go through the approval of the

Board and as per the applicable

regulation, the Company disclosed

the information as per Companies

Act 2013 if any political

contribution was made.

ATL did not make any

by the Chairman of the Board

or the Chairman of the Audit

Committee ensuring the Board’s

supervision on Code of Conduct

with ethical issues.

To review compliance with the

Code of Conduct, members of the

Board and senior management

affirmed the compliance with the

code annually, based on which

an annual compliance report was

prepared and evaluated by the

Company Secretary to review the

effectiveness of ATL’s Code of

Conduct.

The Company adopted a Whistle

Blower Policy and established the

necessary vigil mechanism for

employees and Directors to report

concerns on unethical behaviour

in accordance with the provisions

of the Companies Act, 2013 and

SEBI Listing Regulations. The

policy enabled the employees

to report potentially illegal or

unacceptable practices without

the fear of victimisation and

reprisal. It aimed to guide good

governance practices and ensured

that concerns were properly

raised and addressed. The

Vigilance and Ethics Officer was

responsible for monitoring the

effectiveness of the policy and

dealing with concerns raised and

reports filed.

Employees can lodge a Protected

Disclosure to the Chairman’s

Office by sending an email to

address the concerns of external

stakeholders and public, email IDs

of senior management were made
