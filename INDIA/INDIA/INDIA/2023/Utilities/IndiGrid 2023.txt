Credit risk from balances deposited/invested with

banks and financial institutions as well as investments

made in mutual funds, is managed by the Group’s

treasury department in accordance with the Group’s

policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with

approved counterparties and within limits assigned to

each counterparty. Counterparty limits are reviewed by

the top management on an annual basis, and may be

updated throughout the year subject to approval of the

Board of Directors. The limits are set to minimise the

concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial

payments. Based on this policy, the Group does not

foresee any risk on account of credit losses, either in the

bank deposits which are made with AAA rated banks

and also in regard to mutual funds which is primarily
