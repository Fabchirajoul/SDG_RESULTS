Managing Director’s Statement On ESG

Greetings shareholders, it is an honor for me to write to you and share Gujarat Gas Limited's (GGL) performance in FY 2022-23.

During the last few years the world witnessed unpredictable complexities which required special & continuous attention, this includes

combating climate change, preserving natural resources, fighting COVID-19 & reducing carbon emissions.

While adjusting to the new reality brought about by these difficulties, which continue to raise larger questions about world peace and

prosperity for all, today’s actions could very well shape the fate of the planet, its people and for the generations to come. The rapidly

changing environment urges businesses to respond to the aspects discussed above. Business needs to be conducted in the best

ethical & moral standards along with compliance with laws & regulations.

The Company strives to play its part in helping communities to achieve the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals

(SDGs). GGL aims to incorporate this commitment to sustainability into its strategy, operational procedures, and decision-making.

GGL aims to deliver affordable, reliable and cleaner energy by operating responsibly and performing with excellence while considering

the Environmental, Social & Governance factors. GGL continues to strengthen these pillars while implementing changes throughout

its value chain to meet the most pressing challenges including carbon emissions, climate change, environment protection &

preservation and human rights.

India is one of the fastest-growing economies worldwide and has pledged to achieve “Net Zero” by 2070. The share of Natural Gas in

India’s total energy mix is around 6.3 % and the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas has set a target to raise the share of natural gas in

the energy mix to 15% in 2030. To align with the strategy of the Government of India, the Company intends to expand its scale of

operations to promote the use of natural gas as a “Clean & Green Fuel.”

GGL continues to hold the position among the largest CGD Company in Country. Your company supplies natural gas to more than

19.28 lakh residential consumers, over 14,390 commercial customer and has erected / commissioned 808 CNG stations for

vehicular consumers and provides clean energy solutions to over 4,360 industrial units through its wide spread operations with more

than 35,650 kilometres of Natural Gas pipeline network.

GGL’s primary objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon emissions, and increase in shareholder’s value. Climate change is one

of the greatest challenges that society is facing and the energy sector has a key role to play in helping the world transition to net zero.

The loss of natural environment and climate change are interconnected and need to be tackled together, the Company is constantly

transforming to mitigate this issue and may achieve the sustainable development objectives by rooting sustainability in thoughts,

values, vision and business.

GGL is ready to undertake adjustments required to align with the SDGs. GGL has stepped up its efforts to create a cleaner future by

blending hydrogen gas with Natural gas which results in less carbon emissions as it reduces the intensity of carbon emitted due to the

combustion of natural gas. Reducing carbon emissions requires partnership and collaboration, because no one company, industry or

nation – acting alone – can meet the world’s energy and climate goals. GGL assesses its value chain partners to ensure compliance

with environmental considerations.

GGL considers its social commitments towards all employees, customers, suppliers, contractors, and community as ethical duties.

GGL’s journey toward developing a safety culture has been tremendously exciting, as it now extends the commitment of safety to

external stakeholders, including business partners, contractors and suppliers, in addition to employees and other internal stakeholders

through sustainable development policy.

Despite GGL’s huge scale of operations, it tries to mitigate all the concerns coming from the above stakeholders in the best and

earliest possible manner. GGL drives the business with utmost safety measures and in adherence with the Health Safety and

Environment policy. Customers are kept at the center of business operations; every necessary step is taken to ensure that customers

get the best services without any disruptions. GGL remains committed to give back to the society through its various CSR activities

which are carried out during the year in order to serve the community.

GGL has policies in place to promote the ethical & transparent work culture and following the guidelines helps to meet all the

obligations specified by the laws & regulations. GGL has a robust governance framework that ensures that all business practices are

carried out in a responsible manner.

Presently, the matter is pending before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.

(ii)

One of the gas suppliers of the Company has submitted claims of ` 212.14 Crores (P. Y. ` 189.59 Crores), for use of allocated

gas for other than specified purpose, related to FY 2013-14 to FY 2021-22 and no claim received from supplier for

FY 2022-23. The company has refuted this erroneous claim and also there is no contractual provisions of the agreement

executed with GGL that allow such claim. The management is of the firm view that the company is not liable to pay any such

claim. The company has already taken up the matter with concerned party to withdraw the claim.

(iii)

The company has initiated an arbitration proceeding against one of the franchisees claiming compensation for loss of revenue.

While replying to the claim, the said franchisee has also filed a counter claim of ` 177.14 Crores (P.Y. ` 177.14 Crores) against

the company claiming compensation for various losses. The company has filed necessary rejoinder to the counter claim

strongly refuting the same mainly on the grounds that the counter claims are wrong and without merits and as are not flowing

from the same agreement under which the arbitral tribunal has been constituted. Currently arbitral proceedings of this matter is

pending before the sole arbitrator.

This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes.

(Refer note 45)

1.

Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions.

2.

Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy.

3.

Investment in unquoted equity shares.

4.

Financial instruments (including those carried at amortised cost).

(l)

Inventories

Inventory of Gas (including inventory in pipeline and CNG cascades) is valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is

determined on weighted average cost method.

Stores, spares and consumables are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on moving weighted

average basis.

Inventories of Project materials (capital Inventory) are valued at cost on moving weighted average basis.

(m) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operation

Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction

rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying

amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits,

financial assets and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is

recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative

impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset

(or disposal group) is recognised at the date of de-recognition.

Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as

held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet.

spirit of regulations defining tariff zone but also tantamount to rewriting of contract.

UPL has preferred an appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the order of APTEL dated 10.03.2021.

Presently, the matter is pending before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.

(ii)

One of the gas suppliers of the Company has submitted claims of ` 212.14 Crores (P. Y. ` 189.59 Crores), for use of allocated

gas for other than specified purpose, related to FY 2013-14 to FY 2021-22 and no claim received from supplier for FY 2022-

23. The company has refuted this erroneous claim and also there is no contractual provisions of the agreement executed with

GGL that allow such claim. The management is of the firm view that the company is not liable to pay any such claim. The

company has already taken up the matter with concerned party to withdraw the claim.

(iii) The company has initiated an arbitration proceeding against one of the franchisees claiming compensation for loss of revenue.

While replying to the claim, the said franchisee has also filed a counter claim of ` 177.14 Crores (P.Y. ` 177.14 Crores) against

the company claiming compensation for various losses. The company has filed necessary rejoinder to the counter claim strongly

refuting the same mainly on the grounds that the counter claims are wrong and without merits and as are not flowing from the

same agreement under which the arbitral tribunal has been constituted. Currently arbitral proceedings of this matter is pending

before the sole arbitrator.

Note 43.3 The following demands / Litigations / matters are not included in above

(i)

Erstwhile Gujarat Gas Company Limited and Erstwhile GSPC Gas Company Limited (Now collectively known as Gujarat Gas

Limited “GGL”) had signed Gas supply agreement with Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPCL) for purchase of

Re-gasified liquified natural gas (RLNG). As per the provision of said agreement, GGL has to pay interconnectivity charges to

GSPCL for the supply and purchase of RLNG at Delivery point which is charged to GSPCL by their supplier i.e. PLL Off takers

(GAIL India, BPCL, IOCL).

PGNRB had vide its order dated 13.09.2011 and the majority members of PNGRB (three member panel of Board) had vide its

order dated 10.10.2011 held that GAIL had adopted Restrictive Trade Practices by blocking off direct connectivity to GSPCL and

further, directed Respondents (PLL Off takers -GAIL India, BPCL, IOCL) to immediately give direct connectivity to GSPCL at

Dahej Terminal.

The PLL Offtakers (GAIL) filed appeals against the said PNGRB orders before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). On

23.02.2012 APTEL had issued an interim order for shifting the Delivery Point from GAIL-GSPL Delivery Point to GSPL-PLL

Delivery Point. On 18.12.2013 APTEL issued its judgment and required GSPCL to pay the amount of the difference between

` 8.74/MMBTU (exclusive of Service Tax) – earlier connectivity charges and ` 19.83/MMBTU (Exclusive of Service Tax) –

HVJ/DVPL Zone-1 tariff to GAIL for the period from 20th November 2008 to 29th February 2012.

GSPCL had filed an appeal against the APTEL’s above referred judgment before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (GSPCL vs. GAIL

& Others, Civil Appeal No. 2473-2476 of 2014) and the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India had passed the Interim Order on 28th

February 2014. The Court has stated that the ends of justice would be met if as a matter of interim arrangement, the appellant is

directed to pay interconnectivity charges at the rate of ` 12.00 per MMBTU (exclusive of Taxes). The Company has already

provided and paid interconnectivity charges at the rate of ` 12.00 per MMBTU (exclusive of Taxes).

GGL has not received any bill / demand note for the amount over and above ` 12.00 per MMBTU from supplier till date. As the

final liability would only be determined post the final order of the court, quantification of any amount as contingent liability in the

interim is inappropriate due to the uncertainty involved and hence the same is not mentioned / disclosed in the financial statement.
