MESSagE froM thE ChairMan

scriPting a year of

SUSTAINABLE PROGRESS

Dear Members,

After what the world, India and companies

everywhere went through from the last quarter

of 2019-20 right up to 2021-22, there was a

universal need for normalcy. When the pandemic

became a thing of the past; when people got

back to their usual work, travel and home

lives; and when companies reverted to normal

business unhindered by the strains of a global

epidemic such as we had with Covid-19.

Thankfully, 2022-23 has been such a year. India

has reported a stellar real GDP growth of 7% for

2022-23, which is not only significantly greater

than the expectation of most economic pundits,

but also is the highest growth posted among all

major economies, including China.

In this milieu, I am happy to report that your

Company has done satisfactorily. Let me first

touch upon the key financials before sharing

some other information.

Despite electricity tariffs remaining unchanged

during the year, your Company’s total income on

a standalone basis (revenue from operations plus

other income) increased by 9% to ` 8,153 crore

in 2022-23. Operating costs increased during

the year, largely on account of high fuel costs.

Consequently, Profit before tax (PBT) grew by

1% over the previous year, and stood at ` 1,060

crore. Profit after tax (PAT) increased by a bit

under 2% to ` 830 crore.

On a consolidated basis your Company’s total

income increased by 13.5% in 2022-23 to `

14,555 crore. Unfortunately, significantly higher

input costs reduced consolidated PBT by 9% to

` 1,739 crore. PAT reduced marginally to ` 1,397

crore.

•

If unresolved, the Line Manager solicits intervention of the Unit IR

official and jointly deals with the issue for resolution.

•

If the issue is major and collective in nature, the same is intervened by

the Unit Head, functionally looking after administration who deals with

the issue jointly with unit IR official and Line Manager of the department.

Tier 2

•

If the same still remains unresolved at unit level, it is referred to divisional

headquarter for intervention.

Tier 3

•

In case of issue remaining still unresolved, it is referred to Central/

Corporate IR, where the issue is discussed /negotiated with the

central leadership of the sole bargaining union to arrive at an amicable

resolution/settlement.

Upon following all the three tiers as mentioned above, if the issue is still

pending resolution, it follows the usual dispute settling route of Conciliation,

if required, followed by Adjudication.

Issues related to sexual harassment are resolved through a separate Internal

Complaints Committee (ICC), which is headed by a female Executive

Director and comprises of seven members from various facets of the
