Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Contd.)

of RattanIndia Power Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023

(All amount in ` Lakhs, unless otherwise stated):

letter dated

29 January 2013 had raised a demand of ` 23,218 lakhs on the Company for payment of irrigation restoration charges

(IRC) at the rate of ` 1 lakh per hectare as per Government Resolution (GR) dated 6 March 2009, which was contrary to

the Water Resources Department, Government of Maharashtra’s circular dated 21 February 2004 that stated the rate

to be ` 0.50 lakh per hectare. The Company had paid ` 11,657 lakh (calculated at ` 0.50 lakh per hectare) and had filed

a Writ Petition before the Hon’ble Bombay High Court on 13 February 2013, challenging the validity of demand so

raised by WRD. The Mumbai bench of Hon’ble Bombay High Court vide its order dated 3 August 2015 transferred the

matter to Nagpur Bench. The Nagpur Bench vide its order dated 5 May 2016 had partly allowed the petition and held

that demand at revised rate i.e. as per GR dated 6 March 2009 was illegal and unsustainable. As per Nagpur Bench

order, the rate prescribed in the GR dated 6 March 2009 was applicable prospectively from 1 April 2009 and was not

applicable in Company’s case since the water allocation had already been finalized on 12 December 2007.

Pursuant to above order, Maharashtra State Government had filed a Special Leave Petition (“SLP”) before the Hon’ble

Supreme Court of India (SC). The Hon’ble SC vide its order dated 13 January 2023 held that the agreement executed

between the Company and WRD stipulating irrigation restoration charge at the rate of ` One lakh per hectare was

erroneously given credence over the erstwhile Government circular dated 21 February 2004 that prescribed the rate

of ` 0.50 lakh per hectare for use of water for industrial purposes, which was otherwise reserved for irrigation of

agricultural land. In the said order, the SC also erroneously held that the Company had protested for first time in 2011

which was contrary to the fact that the Company had been protesting the proposed IRC levy at the rate of ` One lakh

per hectare since 2008 and further, erroneously relied on 2009 Notification, wherein IRC was notified at ` One lakh per

hectare for the very first time. Aggrieved of the SC order, the Company has filed a Review petition before the SC bench

on 12 February 2023, that is currently pending disposal.

The management basis inputs from internal and external legal experts believes that the Company has strong chances

of favourable order in the pending Review Petition, on merits as there are errors on face of the record in the SC

Judgment as narrated above and further, has assessed that likelihood of any liability devolving upon the Company in

respect of the said matter is not probable and accordingly, no adjustment is currently required in these consolidated

financial statements.

During the previous year, the Company had filed writ petition before Hon’ble Delhi High Court (‘Delhi HC’) and had

sought relief and direction to Ministry of Power and Ministry of Coal as well as Western Coalfields Limited (‘WCL’) and

Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (‘MCL’), the subsidiaries of Coal India Limited, for returning of Bank Guarantees issued

pursuant to: Letter of Assurance (LoA) , as the Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) against this LoA was not materialized and

Company has not utilized this for any coal supply to the plant. Subsequently during the quarter ended 30 June 2022,

Company had received letters from WCL & MCL informing cancellation of LOA and invocation of bank guarantee

amounting to ` 5,496.14 lakhs. The Company had filed an application of stay before Delhi HC and in response thereto,

the Delhi HC had directed WCL & MCL not to take any coercive action pursuant to their letters. The Company based

upon inputs from legal experts believes that it has a strong case and accordingly, no provision is considered necessary

in these consolidated financial statements at this stage.

During the year ended 2010-11, the Company entered into a contract with Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (‘BHEL’) for

erection and supply of certain material for phase II of its power project at Amravati. Subsequent to this contract, BHEL

the Company with BHEL to take out such materials from the site. Against this, BHEL initiated arbitration proceeding

against the Company, alleging the payment outstanding against the Company in respect of the materials so supplied by

them. The Hon’ble High Court also disposed off the petition upon the instruction to the parties that petition before

Hon’ble High Court be treated as an application under Section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before

the Arbitral Tribunal. Subsequent to this, BHEL filed the following applications on 14 April 2016 with Arbitral Tribunal:

a.

Application under Section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking an interim prayer of release of

bank guarantees.

letter dated 1 December 2011 gave approval to

MSEDCL for procurement of such additional power and directed MSEDCL to obtain Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory

Commission (MERC) approval for the same. MERC vide its order dated 27 December 2012 approved the levelised tariff

of ` 3.42 per kwh for procurement of additional 1090 MW power by MSEDCL from the company and APML. WPCL filed

an appeal before APTEL on 7 March 2013 against the aforesaid order of MERC on the ground that WPCL was not given

an opportunity to participate in the process. APTEL vide its order dated 10 February 2015 partly allowed the appeal by

WPCL and directed MSEDCL to approach WPCL and Company to seek new offer with respect to quantum to be offered

while matching the tariff of APML, the Company filed a review petition against the order of APTEL dated 10 February

2015 for allowing the appeal by WPCL against the order of MERC which approved the procurement of additional

quantum of 650 MW power from the Company. The review petition was dismissed by APTEL vide order dated 18 May

2015. The Company filed appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against the orders dated 10 February 2015 as well

Pursuant to this order, APTEL’s order dated 10 February 2015 comes into force and hence, the Company and WPCL will

be making offers for power supply to MSEDCL in terms of the said order of APTEL.

Further, MERC order dated 19 January 2019 in Case No. 53 of 2012 whereby the Ld. MERC has allocated the quantum

of 1090 MW of power on pro rata basis between Adani Power Maharashtra Limited, the Company and Sai Wardha

Power Company Limited. On 30 April 2019, MSEDCL had issued: letter of intent (‘LOI’) to the Company for execution of

PPA of 507 MW (net capacity). In order to execute the PPA, Company was required to furnish Contract Performance

Guarantee (CPG) to MSEDCL in 3 months. Lenders of the Company showed interest in starting the operations and in

granting sanctions for required fund based working capital and non-fund based facilities so as to execute aforementioned

PPA with MSEDCL. However, due to COVID 19, Lenders of the Company could not reach to any conclusion on sanctioning

of required fund based working capital and non-fund based facilities and, thus the Company was not able to furnish

the requested CPG resulting in MSEDCL terminating the aforesaid LOI. Thereafter the Company had filed a petition

before Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) seeking directions to MSEDCL to withdraw its termination

notice; and secondly to execute the PPA with the Company as per the agreed terms and conditions, pursuant to the

long term Competitive Bidding. However, the petition was withdrawn pursuant to the observation of MERC that the

Company may re-approach MERC after securing firm and unconditional commitment from Lenders for providing working

capital/ bank guarantees required for executing the PPA.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements (Contd.)

of RattanIndia Power Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023

(All amount in ` Lakhs, unless otherwise stated):

letter dated

29 January 2013 had raised a demand of ` 23,218 lakhs on the Company for payment of irrigation restoration charges

(IRC) at the rate of ` 1 lakh per hectare as per Government Resolution (GR) dated 6 March 2009, which was contrary to

the Water Resources Department, Government of Maharashtra’s circular dated 21 February 2004 that stated the rate

to be ` 0.50 lakh per hectare. The Company had paid ` 11,657 lakh (calculated at ` 0.50 lakh per hectare) and had filed

a Writ Petition before the Hon’ble Bombay High Court on 13 February 2013, challenging the validity of demand so

raised by WRD. The Mumbai bench of Hon’ble Bombay High Court vide its order dated 3 August 2015 transferred the

matter to Nagpur Bench. The Nagpur Bench vide its order dated 5 May 2016 had partly allowed the petition and held

that demand at revised rate i.e. as per GR dated 6 March 2009 was illegal and unsustainable. As per Nagpur Bench

order, the rate prescribed in the GR dated 6 March 2009 was applicable prospectively from 1 April 2009 and was not

applicable in Company’s case since the water allocation had already been finalized on 12 December 2007.

Pursuant to above order, Maharashtra State Government had filed a Special Leave Petition (“SLP”) before the Hon’ble

Supreme Court of India (SC). The Hon’ble SC vide its order dated 13 January 2023 held that the agreement executed

between the Company and WRD stipulating irrigation restoration charge at the rate of ` One lakh per hectare was

erroneously given credence over the erstwhile Government circular dated 21 February 2004 that prescribed the rate

of ` 0.50 lakh per hectare for use of water for industrial purposes, which was otherwise reserved for irrigation of

agricultural land. In the said order, the SC also erroneously held that the Company had protested for first time in 2011

which was contrary to the fact that the Company had been protesting the proposed IRC levy at the rate of ` One lakh

per hectare since 2008 and further, erroneously relied on 2009 Notification, wherein IRC was notified at ` One lakh per

hectare for the very first time. Aggrieved of the SC order, the Company has filed a Review petition before the SC bench

on 12 February 2023, that is currently pending disposal.

The management basis inputs from internal and external legal experts believes that the Company has strong chances

of favourable order in the pending Review Petition, on merits as there are errors on face of the record in the SC

Judgment as narrated above and further, has assessed that likelihood of any liability devolving upon the Company in

respect of the said matter is not probable and accordingly, no adjustment is currently required in these standalone

financial statements.

During the previous year, the Company had filed writ petition before Hon’ble Delhi High Court (‘Delhi HC’) and had

sought relief and direction to Ministry of Power and Ministry of Coal as well as Western Coalfields Limited (‘WCL’) and

Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (‘MCL’), the subsidiaries of Coal India Limited, for returning of Bank Guarantees issued

pursuant to: Letter of Assurance (LoA) , as the Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) against this LoA was not materialized and

Company has not utilized this for any coal supply to the plant. Subsequently during the quarter ended 30 June 2022,

Company had received letters from WCL & MCL informing cancellation of LOA and invocation of bank guarantee

amounting to ` 54.96 crore. The Company had filed an application of stay before Delhi HC and in response thereto, the

Delhi HC had directed WCL & MCL not to take any coercive action pursuant to their letters. The Company based upon

inputs from legal experts believes that it has a strong case and accordingly, no provision is considered necessary in

these standalone financial statements at this stage.

During the year ended 2010-11, the Company entered into a contract with Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (‘BHEL’) for

erection and supply of certain material for phase II of its power project at Amravati. Subsequent to this contract, BHEL

supplied certain materials which were not warranted at that time and there were various communications made by

the Company with BHEL to take out such materials from the site. Against this, BHEL initiated arbitration proceeding

against the Company, alleging the payment outstanding against the Company in respect of the materials so supplied by

them. The Hon’ble High Court also disposed off the petition upon the instruction to the parties that petition before

Hon’ble High Court be treated as an application under Section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before

the Arbitral Tribunal. Subsequent to this, BHEL filed the following applications on 14 April 2016 with Arbitral Tribunal:

a.

Application under Section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking an interim prayer of release of

bank guarantees.

b.

Application seeking amendment of the Claim petition.

basis of admissions.
