Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues:

The Human Rights Policy elaborates on the grievance mechanism. The policy is available at the Company's website at: - https://www.

tatapower.com/pdf/sustainability/human-rights-policy.pdf

The Company has adopted TCoC which categorically states that 'We do not employ children at our workplaces, We do not use forced

labour in any form, We do not confiscate personal documents of our employees, or force them to make any payment to us or to

anyone else in order to secure employment with us, or to work with us.' There are various channels available to raise concerns and

for redressal of the same. Also, concerns can be raised through our Whistle Blower Policy. An independent third party ethics helpline

maintained by Deloitte, has also been provided for raising concerns. The details for raising grievances are as follows: Toll-free Number

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases:

The TCoC underscores that any form of retaliation against individuals reporting legitimate concerns will not be tolerated. Those who

engage in targeting such individuals will be subject to disciplinary action. If a complainant suspects that they or someone they know

has been subjected to retaliation for raising a concern or reporting a case, the Company strongly encourages them to contact the line

manager, the company’s Ethics Counsellor, the Human Resources department, the MD/CEO or the office of the group’s Chief Ethics

Officer without delay.

The Company has zero tolerance for sexual harassment at the workplace and has adopted a comprehensive policy on preventing,

prohibiting and redressing sexual harassment of women in the workplace. We have established an Internal Committee (IC) in

compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. Members of the IC

are responsible for conducting inquiries related to such complaints. Throughout the process, the IC will safeguard the identities of all

parties involved, as well as the contents of complaints and inquiry proceedings.

Please refer TCoC at https://www.tatapower.com/pdf/aboutus/Tata-Code-of-Conduct.pdf

8.

Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)

Yes, Human Rights forms part of the business agreements:

1.

Onboarding/ selection - Applicable certificates, Labour Laws compliance including statutory requirements such as child labour,

forced and compulsory labour are asked during on-boarding of suppliers

2.

TCoC is accepted by the vendors and signed as a part of the contract

(ii)

The carrying amount of trade receivable does not include receivables of ₹ 1,682.73 crore (March 31, 2022: ₹ 1,150.64 crore)

which are subject to a factoring arrangement. Under this arrangement, the Group has transferred the relevant receivables

to the factor in exchange for cash on non recourse basis. The Group, therefore, has derecognised the said receivables under

the said arrangement. Amount received from such customers not transferred to factoring agent is disclosed as financial

liability (Refer Note 27).

9.1 Trade Receivables

The Group has used a practical expedient for computing the Expected Credit Loss ('ECL') allowance for trade receivables based on

a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience of Holding Company and respective

subsidiaries and adjusted for forward looking information. The ECL allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables and has

been calculated and applied at the respective entity level of the Group.

In case of Odisha Discoms, the management believes that collection data related to pre-acquisition period is not relevant to assess

ECL allowance on receivables in the post-acquisition period. In absence of availability of adequate and relevant data related to

payment behaviours, the Group has recognised Expected Credit Loss (ECL) allowance on trade receivables using its best estimate

29. Provisions

Accounting Policy

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable

that the Group will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The

amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of

the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured

using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when

the effect of the time value of money is material).

Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions with charge to consolidated

Statement of Profit and Loss. An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable

costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract.

Restructuring provisions are recognised only when the Group has a constructive obligation, which is when:

(i)

a detailed formal plan identifies the business or part of the business concerned, the location and number of employees

affected, a detailed estimate of the associated costs, and the timeline; and

(ii)

the employees affected have been notified of the plan’s main features.

Defined contribution plans

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service
