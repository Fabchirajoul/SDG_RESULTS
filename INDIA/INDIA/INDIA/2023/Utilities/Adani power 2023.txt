Dear Shareholders,

A few months ago, I heard a new term called Permacrisis. I learnt that the

Collins dictionary had defined it as ‘An extended period of instability and

insecurity’. It also chose it as the Word for the Year 2022. Interestingly, I also

learnt that two other words that were in the running for the top spot were ‘quiet

quitting’, which meant doing the bare minimum duties at work (in rejection of

competitive careerism) and ‘vibe shift’, which meant a significant change in the

prevailing culture. What I find fascinating is that in the post-Covid world, these

words accurately summarise changes that we see happening around us.

letter of credit in

favour of the coal suppliers.

ii) The fair value of trade payables are approximately the carrying value presented (Also refer note 54).

iii) Details of due to micro and small enterprises :

On the basis of the information and records available with management, details of dues to micro and small

enterprises as defined under the MSMED Act, 2006 are as below:

26 Current Borrowings (Contd.):

letter dated 8th September,

2011 had granted Provisional Mega Power Status Certificate under the Mega Power Policy for

construction of its 1,370 MW Thermal based Power Plant. In terms of the same, the Company has

availed exemptions of duty of customs and excise duty upon submission of bank guarantees worth

H960.01 Crores and pledge of margin money deposits of H59.67 Crores. The grant of final Mega

power status of Raipur TPP is dependent upon plant achieving tie up for supply of power for 70% of

its installed capacity through long term Power Purchase Agreements by way of competitive bidding

and the balance through regulated market within stipulated time. The time period to achieve tie up

for supply of power as prescribed in Mega Power Policy has been further extended to 156 months

from the date of Import, till 12th September, 2024, by the Ministry of Power, Government of India

vide amendment dated 7th April, 2022. The Management expects to comply the conditions and

hence no adjustments are made.:

letter dated 17th September,

2021, accepted the surrender petition by the Company and ordered for invocation of bank guarantee along

with obligation to fulfil antecedent liability. On 29th September 2021, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in

response to petition filed by the Company, has stayed the invocation of the said performance bank guarantee

and restrained the Nominated Authority from taking any coercive steps in the matter. Further the Hon’ble

Delhi High Court vide its order dated 3rd March, 2022, instructed the Nominated authority that the said

performance bank guarantee shall be returned within one week from the date of execution of “: Letter of

Intent of Coal Mines Production and Development Agreement” with a new bidder. The Nominated Authority

has concluded the fresh e-auction of Jitpur Coal Block on 13th September, 2022 and allotted mine to new

bidder on 13th September, 2022.

Earlier, the Company has submitted the details of costs / expenditure incurred towards development of

mine with Nominated Authority, however based on allotment of mine to a new bidder, the Company expects

a favourable resolution relating to cost realisation of Jitpur mine with Nominated Authority. The Company

has also obtained legal opinion basis which it is reasonably confident to get compensation realised of the

entire costs incurred towards the development of the coal mine in the subsequent period.

45 The Company through erstwhile subsidiary, Raipur Energen Limited (“REL”) has incurred cost of H55.57 Crores

and H30.75 Crores towards development of Talabira Coal mine and Ganeshpura Coal mine, respectively in

the earlier years.

In the above matter, earlier the Company had filed two writ petitions with Hon’ble Delhi High Court requesting

surrender of the said mines in view of Union of India’s (“UoI”) notification dated 16th April, 2015 stating

capping of the fixed / capacity charges and also requested to refund the costs incurred along with the

release of bid security. The Hon’ble Delhi High Court vide its single order dated 15th April, 2019 dismissed

the petitions on the ground of delay in filling of writ petitions. Consequently, the Company filed petitions

before Hon’ble Supreme Court to set aside the order of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court. Pending adjudication

of the petitions, Hon’ble Supreme Court directed UoI and others vide its order dated 30th May, 2019 that no

coercive action to be taken in these matters.

The management expects favourable resolution of these matters and is reasonably confident to realise the

entire cost spent towards these coal mines as compensation in the subsequent periods.

46 The National Green Tribunal ("NGT") in a matter relating to non-compliance of environmental norms relating

to Udupi TPP directed the Company vide its order dated 14th March, 2019, to make payment of H5.00

Crores as an interim environmental compensation to Central Pollution Control Board ("CPCB"), which was

deposited by the Company with CPCB under protest, in April 2019 and expensed the same in the books.

NGT vide its order dated 31st May, 2022 settled the matter and directed the Company to deposit an additional

amount of H47.02 Crores with CPCB within 3 months from the date of order. The Company has recognised

expense provision in the books of H47.02 Crores on conservative basis. The Company has filed petition with

the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated 26th August, 2022 against the above referred NGT order. The Udupi TPP

continues to operate in compliance with all the conditions under Environment Clearance as at reporting

date.

47 (a) In respect of Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA / SPPA”) for Bid 2 with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited

(“GUVNL”), for supply of 1,234 MW power through Mundra TPP (as amended), the Hon’ble Supreme Court,

vide its order dated 2nd July, 2019, had allowed appeal filed by the Company, for termination of long

term PPA / SPPA with retrospective effect from the date of PPA i.e. 2nd February, 2007 and allowed the

Company to claim compensatory tariff. Till reporting period ended 31st December, 2021, GUVNL was in

appeal in the matter with Hon’ble Supreme Court and had filed the curative petition.

letter dated 21st May, 2021 has raised certain claims on the Company for excess energy

injected during the period 1st April, 2017 to 31st October, 2020 from the 40 MW solar power plant at Bitta

in terms of the power purchase agreement and has withheld H72.10 Crores against power supply dues in

the previous year. GERC vide its order dated 3rd November, 2022 in the matter accepting the petition of

the Company in the said matter and directed GUVNL to make payment of the amount withheld within three

months from the date of order along with late payment surcharge as per PPA. However, GUVNL has filed an

appeal with APTEL against the said order of GERC and the matter is pending adjudication. The management,

based on GERC order, expects favourable outcome in the matter. As per interim order of APTEL, the Company

has already received H51.75 Crores being 75% of the withheld amount subject to outcome of appeal with

APTEL. The Management expects favourable resolution of this matter and is reasonably confident to realise

the outstanding dues.

50 The Company has taken various derivatives to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations

on items including principal loan amount and interest thereof along with interest rate changes. The

25 Current Borrowings (Contd.)

letter dated 8th September, 2011

had granted Provisional Mega Power Status Certificate under the Mega Power Policy for construction

of its 1,370 MW Thermal based Power Plant. In terms of the same, the Company has availed exemptions

of duty of customs and excise duty upon submission of bank guarantees worth H960.01 Crores and

pledge of margin money deposits of H59.67 Crores. The grant of final Mega power status of Raipur

TPP is dependent upon plant achieving tie up for supply of power for 70% of its installed capacity

through long term Power Purchase Agreements by way of competitive bidding and the balance through

regulated market within stipulated time. The time period to achieve tie up for supply of power as

prescribed in Mega Power Policy has been further extended to 156 months from the date of Import, till

12th September, 2024, by the Ministry of Power, Government of India vide amendment dated 7th April,

2022. The Management expects to comply the conditions and hence no adjustments are made.

(b) In case of Raipur TPP, the Company had entered into a bulk power transmission agreement (‘BPTA’)

with Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (‘PGCIL’) dated 31st March, 2010 as per which the Company

was granted Long term Access (‘LTA’) of 816 MW. However, owing to non-availability of PPA, which as

per management is beyond the control of the Company, Raipur TPP was not in a position to utilise the

LTA and has accordingly sought for surrender of the LTA, for which PGCIL has raised demand of H154.50

Crores towards relinquishment charges on the Company. However, the said claim will be subject to the

outcome of the petition dated 7th September, 2020 filed by the Company before the APTEL.

2) For the Company’s Udupi TPP and Tiroda TPP, matter on Custom Duty relating to March 2012 to February

2013 is contested at Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (“CESTAT”).

3) In case of Raigarh TPP, Chief Electrical Inspector, Government of Chhattisgarh (‘CEIG’), has raised demand

for electricity duty on auxiliary power consumption @15% of tariff instead of @ 10% as per the circular dated

12th August, 2016 from January 2015 to December 2021 along with interest. During the current year, the

Company has received favourable order from Chief Electrical Inspector, Raipur Office in the matter dated 1st

June, 2022.

4) For company’s Tiroda TPP, Joint Commissioner of State Tax (Adm), Nagpur Division, has raised demand of

Value added tax relating to FY 13-14 along with interest.

5) In case of APJL, Water resource department (“WRD”), Jharkhand has charged penalty on the amount of

penalty on water charges which has not been accepted by APJL as per the terms of agreement and the

matter is under discussion with WRD to reconsider the demand.

6) In case of MEL, MEL relinquished the long-term transmission agreement for supply of power through

Mahan – Sipat transmission line in April 2017, which was accepted by Central Transmission Utility

Ltd (“CTUIL”). In this regard, CERC vide its tariff determination order dated 14th March, 2022 imposed:

letter dated 17th September,

2021, accepted the surrender petition by the Company and ordered for invocation of bank guarantee along

with obligation to fulfil antecedent liability. On 29th September 2021, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in

response to petition filed by the Company, has stayed the invocation of the said performance bank guarantee

and restrained the Nominated Authority from taking any coercive steps in the matter. Further the Hon’ble

Delhi High Court vide its order dated 3rd March, 2022, instructed the Nominated authority that the said

performance bank guarantee shall be returned within one week from the date of execution of “: Letter of

Intent of Coal Mines Production and Development Agreement” with a new bidder. The Nominated Authority

has concluded the fresh e-auction of Jitpur Coal Block on 13th September, 2022 and allotted mine to new

bidder on 13th September, 2022.

Earlier, the Company has submitted the details of costs / expenditure incurred towards development of

mine with Nominated Authority, however based on allotment of mine to a new bidder, the Company expects

a favourable resolution relating to cost realisation of Jitpur mine with Nominated Authority. The Company

has also obtained legal opinion basis which it is reasonably confident to get compensation realised of the

entire costs incurred towards the development of the coal mine in the subsequent period.

48 The Company through erstwhile subsidiary, Raipur Energen Limited (“REL”) has incurred cost of H55.57 Crores

and H30.75 Crores towards development of Talabira Coal mine and Ganeshpura Coal mine, respectively in

the earlier years.

In the above matter, earlier the Company had filed two writ petitions with Hon’ble Delhi High Court requesting

surrender of the said mines in view of Union of India’s (“UoI”) notification dated 16th April, 2015 stating

capping of the fixed / capacity charges and also requested to refund the costs incurred along with the

release of bid security. The Hon’ble Delhi High Court vide its single order dated 15th April, 2019 dismissed

the petitions on the ground of delay in filling of writ petitions. Consequently, the Company filed petitions

before Hon’ble Supreme Court to set aside the order of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court. Pending adjudication

of the petitions, Hon’ble Supreme Court directed UoI and others vide its order dated 30th May, 2019 that no

coercive action to be taken in these matters.

The management expects favourable resolution of these matters and is reasonably confident to realise the

entire cost spent towards these coal mines as compensation in the subsequent periods.

49 The Government of India conducted bidding for allocation of coal blocks, under the coal block auction

process whereby MEL acquired the rights of Tokisud Coal Block (in the state of Jharkhand) on 18th March,

2015. Subsequently, in the month of April 2015, by way of a notification, Ministry of Power put cap on the

fixed/capacity charges due to which MEL had filed a writ petition in the High Court of Delhi for impugning

the above referred notification and also offered to return the said coal block to the Government of India

against return of the performance security in the form of Bank Guarantee of H261.76 Crores provided by MEL

and moneys paid, without any penalty.

However, Hon’ble High Court vide its judgement dated 15th April 2019 dismissed the petition of MEL.

Subsequently, MEL has filed Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against the

order of the Hon’ble High Court. Meanwhile, the bank guarantee of H261.76 Crores had been invoked by the

Nominated Authority.

The Union Ministry of Coal has re-allocated the said coal block to National Mineral Development Corporation

(NMDC) for commercial mining. MEL had incurred a total of H491.62 Crores towards development of tokisud

coal mine. Nominated authority vide order dated 16th March, 2022 determined H163.23 crores being the

total compensation payable by successful allottee (NMDC) to MEL. The said amount has been received

during the year. During the pendency of the matter in Supreme Court, MEL has fully provided for the balance

receivable of H328.41 crores during the previous year.

letter dated 21st May, 2021 has raised certain claims on the Company for excess energy

injected during the period 1st April, 2017 to 31st October, 2020 from the 40 MW solar power plant at Bitta

in terms of the power purchase agreement and has withheld H72.10 Crores against power supply dues in

the previous year. GERC vide its order dated 3rd November, 2022 in the matter accepting the petition of

the Company in the said matter and directed GUVNL to make payment of the amount withheld within

three months from the date of order along with late payment surcharge as per PPA. However, GUVNL

has filed an appeal with APTEL against the said order of GERC and the matter is pending adjudication.

The management, based on GERC order, expects favourable outcome in the matter. As per interim order

of APTEL, the Company has already received H51.75 Crores being 75% of the withheld amount subject

to outcome of appeal with APTEL. The Management expects favourable resolution of this matter and is
