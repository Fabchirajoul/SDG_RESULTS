Managing Director’s Message

on Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG): Dear Stakeholders,

I hope you and your family is well and in good health.

e past two years have been a time of unprecedented change and disruption, but it has also opened up new possibilities and

opportunities, which includes addressing the issues of climate change, preserving natural resources, ëghting COVID-19 and reducing

carbon emissions.

roughout our 25-year journey, Gujarat State Petronet Limited (GSPL) has demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability in the

face of changing circumstances. Over the years, we have gained the expertise and conëdence to manage complex projects and execute

them eﬃciently, ensuring the highest levels of quality and safety which is testament to our resilience. And we continue to focus on

responsible growth, collaborative expansion, and sustainable development, underpinned by a commitment to adaptability and

consistency in the face of challenges.

Our goal is to build a better future by creating the necessary infrastructure for energy transportation, linking LNG terminals and other

natural gas supply sources to serve larger markets, and expanding our pipeline network in Gujarat to reach demand centers in a

responsible manner. At GSPL, our dedication to sustainable development goes beyond conventional business operations. We strive to

expand knowledge and enhance lives, leveraging our position to create value for all stakeholders.

Building Greener Future:

We are committed to driving positive Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) outcomes through our initiatives. We understand

the challenges the world is facing due to climate change and carbon emissions, and we're consistently expanding our operations to

provide cleaner and greener fuel to our clients. We're also implementing measures to minimize carbon emissions in our direct and

indirect activities because we realize the relevance of ESG for our sustainable growth.

Energy has always been a key driver of growth and development for societies. Currently, India is one of the largest energy consumers in

the world, and we're proud to be playing our part in promoting clean and green energy. To this end, we've made investments by setting

up wind power projects. We are aligned with the Government of Gujarat's plan to aid the setting up of Gas Distribution projects across

all districts, promoting the use of clean, green, and eﬃcient fuel for small and medium enterprises, as well as for the commercial,

household, and automobile sectors.

Looking ahead, we plan to expand our pipeline network outside the state of Gujarat by participating in Natural Gas Pipeline bidding

carried out by PNGRB. We believe that by embracing new technologies and working collaboratively with stakeholders, we can help

drive positive change and create a brighter, more sustainable future for all.

Putting People and Partnerships First:

As one of India's top natural gas transmission companies, we are committed to looking after our employees and workers with robust

policies and diverse training initiatives. eir safety is of utmost importance to us, and we're proud to have a robust Quality of Health,

Safety & Environment policy in place to ensure it. As we truly believe that a happy and healthy workforce is essential to our success, we

strive to maintain an eﬃcient communication channel between the people and management to address any grievances.

To ensure that we conduct our business responsibly, we have taken a proactive approach to integrating ESG norms into our value chain.

We strongly believe in responsible business practices, and therefore, we have incorporated our responsible business policy and tender

documents to ensure that our value chain partners comply with ESG norms. We have also implemented a robust evaluation process to

assess our suppliers' and contractors' compliance with all the requirements. By doing so, we ensure that our entire value chain is aligned

with our ESG values and principles, and we strive to maintain this standard in all our business dealings.

Customers are at the center of our focus, and their satisfaction is of utmost importance to us. We ensure that the services we provide are

the best in the industry and meet their expectations.

As a responsible corporate citizen, we understand our role in responding proactively to the changing structure and demand of a dynamic

society in a developing and progressive economy. Our initiatives are founded on the belief that the beneëts should be shared by the

communities at large. To that end, we have initiated signiëcant participatory and non-participatory roles in the areas of Health,

Environment, and Safety. Our objective is to support institutions that provide speciëc health-related services.

As I conclude, I want to express my conëdence in our ability to navigate through challenges and tap into the available opportunities.

Our company has always been known for its resilience, and we remain committed to reducing our environmental impact, promoting

social responsibility, and maintaining strong governance practices. We are conëdent that by prioritizing sustainability and ESG

initiatives, we will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders while contributing to a more sustainable and equitable future

for all. Together, we will emerge stronger, more resilient, and more sustainable than ever before.

e United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) encourage us to move towards management of resources, operations,

and business practices in a manner towards sustainable development. On behalf of GSPL, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to

all our stakeholders for their unwavering trust and conëdence in our business. And with this optimism, we will continue to fulëll our

role as a responsible corporate citizen by incorporating sustainability and ESG principles into our business practices.

that for these matters no provision is required in the books of accounts as on 31 March 2023.

e following demands / Litigations / matters are not included in above:

(i) Erstwhile Gujarat Gas Company Limited and Erstwhile GSPC Gas Company Limited (Now collectively known as Gujarat Gas

Limited “GGL”) had signed Gas Supply Agreement with Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPCL) for purchase of

Re-gasiëed liquiëed natural gas (RLNG). As per the provision of said agreement, GGL has to pay interconnectivity charges to

GSPCL for the supply and purchase of RLNG at Delivery point which is charged to GSPCL by their supplier i.e. PLL Oﬀ takers

(GAIL India, BPCL, IOCL).

PGNRB had vide its order dated 13Ǹ September, 2011 and the majority members of PNGRB (three member panel of Board)

had vide its order dated 10Ǹ October, 2011 held that GAIL had adopted Restrictive Trade Practices by blocking oﬀ direct

connectivity to GSPCL and further, directed Respondents (PLL Oﬀ takers -GAIL India, BPCL, IOCL) to immediately give

direct connectivity to GSPCL at Dahej Terminal.

e PLL Oﬀtakers (GAIL) ëled appeals against the said PNGRB orders before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL).

On 23 February, 2012 APTEL had issued an interim order for shifting the Delivery Point from GAIL-GSPL Delivery Point to

GSPL-PLL Delivery Point. On 18Ǹ December, 2013 APTEL issued its judgment and required GSPCL to pay the amount of the

diﬀerence between ` 8.74/MMBTU (exclusive of Service Tax) – earlier connectivity charges and ` 19.83/MMBTU (Exclusive of

Service Tax) – HVJ/DVPL Zone-1 tariﬀ to GAIL for the period from 20Ǹ November, 2008 to 29Ǹ February, 2012.

GSPCL had ëled an appeal against the APTEL’s above referred judgment before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (GSPCL vs.

GAIL & Others, Civil Appeal No. 2473-2476 of 2014) and the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India had passed the Interim Order

on 28Ǹ February, 2014. e Court has stated that the ends of justice would be met if as a matter of interim arrangement, the

appellant is directed to pay interconnectivity charges at the rate of ` 12.00 per MMBTU (exclusive of Taxes). e Company has

already provided and paid interconnectivity charges at the rate of ` 12.00 per MMBTU (exclusive of Taxes).

GGL has not received any bill / demand note for the amount over and above ` 12.00 per MMBTU from supplier till date. As the

ënal liability would only be determined post the ënal order of the court, quantiëcation of any amount as contingent liability in the

interim is inappropriate due to the uncertainty involved and hence the same is not mentioned / disclosed in the ënancial statement.
