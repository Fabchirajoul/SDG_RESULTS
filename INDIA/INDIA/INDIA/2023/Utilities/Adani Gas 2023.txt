Dear Shareholders,

A few months back I heard a new term, Permacrisis. I learnt that the Collins dictionary

had defined it as "an extended period of instability and insecurity”. They also chose it as

the word for the year 2022. Interestingly, I also learnt that two other words that were in

the running for the top spot were “quiet quitting” which meant doing the bare minimum

duties at work (in rejection of competitive careerism) and “vibe shift” which meant a

significant change in the prevailing culture. What I find fascinating is that, in the post

Covid world, these words accurately summarize changes we see happening all around us.
