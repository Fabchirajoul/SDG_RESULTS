and: Managing

Letter from the Chairman

and: Managing Director

As we reflect on the past fiscal

year, it is evident that the world

encountered a myriad of challenges,

including the Russia-Ukraine war and

soaring interest rates. Amid these

uncertainties, the global energy

transition towards renewable sources

gained significant momentum.

Several countries recognised the

necessity of energy self-reliance and

the crucial role renewable energy

plays in achieving this goal. In this

backdrop marked by several global

headwinds, I am pleased to share

that KPI Green Energy has not only

boldly weathered the storm, but

also achieved remarkable success.

This resilient performance also bears

strong testament to our commitment

to a sustainable and green future.

Aligning with India’s renewable

energy vision

India’s aspiration of becoming the

world’s third-largest economy by

the next few years and a developed

nation by 2047 necessitates a

balanced energy transition– one

that will curb carbon emissions while

ensuring uninterrupted power supply.

To realise this vision, the government

is accelerating the shift towards non-

fossil fuel-based electricity, setting

ambitious targets for increasing

renewable energy capacity and

promoting electric vehicles.

The need for a reliable and sustainable

power supply has never been more

crucial as industries expand and

the nation advances its net-zero

ambitions. Recognising this, we, at KPI

Green Energy, are poised to face this

challenge head-on by expanding our

capacities and leveraging renewable

sources such as wind and solar

power. Led by a competent team of

scientists and experts, we are uniquely

positioned contribute and to support

the country’s ambitious renewable

energy targets.

Achieving financial milestones

On the financial front, our

performance has been

commendable, reflecting a strong

and healthy growth trajectory. Our

balance sheet, assets and operating

cash flows have shown remarkable

strength, surpassing previous

records. With consolidated revenue

reaching an impressive Rs. 64,703.47

lakh during FY23, marking a

substantial 180% increase compared

to the previous year, we have set

new records. This achievement

represents our highest-ever revenue

reported on a consolidated basis.

Further, our EBITDA for the same

period stood at Rs. 21,173.77 lakh,

showcasing a significant 91% growth.

Equally noteworthy is the three-digit

increase in our profit after tax (PAT)

for FY23, reaching Rs. 10,962.79 lakh,

a remarkable 154% rise compared to

FY22.

These figures have translated into

an impressive Earnings Per Share

(EPS) of Rs. 30.33, projecting a

healthy Return On Equity (ROE) of

42.51%; and denoting our robust

financial health and focus on value

creation for all shareholders. We also

distributed an interim dividend of Rs.

2.85 (28.50%) per equity share during

the year, rewarding our shareholders

for their trust and support. Our

equity shares are listed and actively

traded on the NSE and BSE main

boards for four years. To promote

small investor participation, enhance

liquidity, expand the shareholder

base, and acknowledge shareholder

support, we have allocated bonus

equity shares at a 1:1 ratio, each with

a face value of Rs. 10/-, to existing

shareholders.

Operational landmarks

On the operational front, we

remained consistent in our pursuit

of expanding our renewable energy

capacity. I am delighted to share

that we have successfully added a

consolidated capacity of 165 MW

during the year, reaching a milestone

of 300+ MW in cumulative capacity.

Notably, the commissioning of

our first-ever wind-solar hybrid

power project, comprising our own

power-generating asset portfolio,

underscores our commitment to

innovation and sustainability.

Moreover, embracing a new identity

as ‘KPI Green Energy Limited,’

transitioning from ‘K.P.I. Global

Infrastructure Limited, signifies our

vision of fostering a greener and

more reliable energy landscape

in the country. We have earned a

place among the top 1000 listed

companies based on market

capitalisation data of the Exchanges

on both March 31, 2022, and March

31, 2023, showcasing our consistent

and remarkable performance. Our

efforts were acknowledged by the

credit rating agency ICRA, which

upgraded our credit rating from

[ICRA] BBB+ to [ICRA] A- (Stable)/

[ICRA]A2+ and revised the outlook

on the long-term rating to stable

from positive. This recognition

further reaffirms our financial

strength and credibility.

Paving our way forward

Looking ahead, our ambitions are

intertwined with India’s target to

reduce the carbon intensity of the

nation’s economy by less than

45% by the end of the decade. We

are determined to play a pivotal

role in contributing to the nation’s

renewable energy targets. To ensure

our sustained growth in a dynamic

energy landscape, we recognise

the importance of attracting and

retaining top talent within our

organisation.

To this end, we have devised a

strategic plan to introduce an

(ESOP) for every team member. This

forward-thinking approach aims

to not only reward our dedicated

workforce, but also foster a sense

of ownership and belonging among

them. By empowering our people to

achieve personal and professional

growth, we are endeavouring to drive

higher productivity and accelerate

our growth trajectory.

Enabling synergistic growth

At KPI Green Energy, we firmly

believe that success is not solely

measured in financial terms. Our

corporate social responsibility (CSR)

initiatives form an integral part of

our identity and ethos. Throughout

the year under review, our focused

interventions have positively

impacted the lives of countless

individuals, communities and

organisations.

On this note, I extend my heartfelt

gratitude to all our stakeholders-

our business partners, investors,

clients and the local communities

we serve. Your faith in our vision

and capabilities has been pivotal

in our journey towards creating

holistic value for all. The relationships

Vote of thanks
