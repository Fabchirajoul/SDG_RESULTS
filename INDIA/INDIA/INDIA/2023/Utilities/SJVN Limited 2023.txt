CHAIRMAN'S LETTER TO

THE SHAREHOLDERS:

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS: Dear Shareholders,

I consider it my privilege and honor to address our valued

shareholders and present the Annual Report of the Company

for the financial year 2022-23.

As I look back and recollect the achievements of the Company

ever since I was entrusted with the task of leading this

esteemed organization, I am filled with overwhelming feelings

of pride and joy with the progress, performance, and position

of the Company over the last few years. I also find myself

optimistic and energized by the golden future that lies ahead.

Cruising ahead towards our cherished Shared Vision for

achieving 5,000 MW by 2023-24, 25,000 MW by 2030 and

50,000 MW by 2040, your Company continues to expand,

On completion of yet another exemplary year, the Audited

Financial Statements of the company along with the Reports of

the Auditors and

Dear Shareholders,

Displaying remarkable perseverance, the progress of

our under-construction projects is on track despite some

geographical and climatic challenges & surprises. The detailed

status and progress of the Power Stations and Projects have

been amply covered in the Directors' Report. Hence, I am

only highlighting some noteworthy accomplishments.

In 2022-23, we were given the mammoth CAPEX target of ₹

8000 crores which was the third highest amongst all the

power CPSEs. However, it is a matter of great pride that your

Company has not just attained but surpassed the assigned

target with flying colors and has achieved Record CAPEX

of ₹8,240 crores during the year.

75 MW Parasan SPP was commissioned on 22.11.2022

and is under commercial operation. The installed capacity of

Integrated River Basis Development for optimum utilization of

resources has found widespread acceptance and support not

of hydro development policies of many State Governments &

Government of India as well as Government of Nepal. In this

benchmark by completing the projects within scheduled

timelines. We are cruising ahead and demonstrating our

MACRO ECONOMIC SCENARIO AND GOVERNMENT

INITIATIVES

India’s growth continues to be resilient as it was rated as

the fastest-growing major economy during FY 2022-23. The

country’s GDP has reached $3.75 trillion in 2023, from around

$2 trillion in 2014; moving from 10th largest to 5th largest

economy in the world. India is now being called a Bright Spot

in the global economy. Indian economy in FY23 has nearly

“recouped” what was lost, “renewed” what had paused, and

“re-energized” what had slowed during the pandemic and

since the conflict in Europe.

A range of pragmatic and transformational policies of the

government, which continued through the pandemic helped

catalyze a sharp economic recovery. The growth that India is

witnessing, apart from the CAPEX push by the government,

is coming from healthy balance sheets of the corporates and

a well-capitalized financial system.

Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters)

Rules, 2022 gave relief to the DISCOMs, as well as electricity

consumers and at the same time generating companies are

also benefiting from assured monthly payments, which will

help the whole power sector to become financially viable.

For removing the barriers in availability and utilization of

renewable energy and to address the issues that have

hindered the growth of open access for a long time, Green

Open Access Rules, 2022 have been issued. The Rules

reduces the Open Access limit from 1 MW to 100 kW, which

paved the way for small consumers to purchase renewable

energy and there is no limit for captive consumers.

Revised scheme for flexibility in generation and scheduling

of Thermal/Hydro Power Station through bundling with

renewable energy and storage power is showing its positive

impact.

Dispute Avoidance Mechanism for avoidance/ resolution of

contractual disputes at initial stage by engagement of an

Independent Engineer and Dispute Resolution Mechanism

for resolution of disputes through Conciliation Committees

have been devised by Ministry of Power.

These transformative reforms and initiatives in recent years

have propelled forward the nation on its journey to achieve

Dear Shareholders,

As my present tenure as CMD of this esteemed Company

nears completion, it gives me tremendous satisfaction to

report to our shareholders that all key parameters of the

Company be it Project Portfolio, Networth, CAPEX, Share

Price, Market Capitalization, Revenue, Book Value, etc.

have scaled their All-Time Highs during recent months.

Nothing is more gratifying than to see the Company scale

the lofty peaks of success and accomplishments each day. I

consider myself fortunate to have witnessed and participated

first-hand in the dawn of this Golden Era of the Company.

On this occasion, I would like to remember the contribution

and express my deep gratitude for all the founding fathers and

architects who conceived and built this Company and laid a

strong foundation of which we are reaping the benefits today.

I would also like to place on record my deepest appreciation

for my colleagues on the Board – past & present. My fellow

Board Members have always stood by me and extended their

unfaltering trust and co-operation.

A tree’s beauty lies in its branches but its strength lies in its

roots. Similarly, the strength of SJVN lies in its employees.

Our grit combined with our attitude has brought us where we

are today – Strong and Proud with a 55814 MW Portfolio.

I feel highly privileged to be leading the Company that is

breaking barriers and conquering new frontiers.

I take this opportunity to place on record my sincere gratitude

for the guidance and cooperation extended by Ministry of

Power, Government of India. Your support has motivated us

to exceed the expectations and to set our sight high on bigger

goals.

I also express my thanks to various Ministries / Departments

of Government of India - Ministry of New & Renewable

Energy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of External Affairs,

Ministry of Environment & Forest, Central Electricity

Authority, Central Water Commission, Geological Survey of

India; State Governments of Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan,

Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Gujarat, Uttarakhand,

Bihar, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam,

and Mizoram; Government of Nepal; other Governmental

and Non-Governmental agencies; Statutory, Cost, Secretarial

and Internal Auditors; our Customers; Business associates;

various Financial Institutions & Bankers and Regulatory

authorities.

Above all, I thank all our Shareholders & Investors for placing

faith in the Company. I look forward to your continued support,

trust and cooperation.

I look forward to further raising the bar and setting standards

even higher for ourselves. I expect my team to commit their

untiring efforts and unflinching commitment to achieve the

goals we have aspired for ourselves. I believe our well-poised

strategy, combined with our relentless execution, will continue

to create long-term sustained value for our shareholders and

i)

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial

loss. The company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities including

deposits with banks and financial institutions.

ii)

Liquidity risk.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations without incurring

unacceptable losses.

iii)

Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.

Market prices comprise three types of risk: currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other price risks. Financial instruments affected by market

risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial

instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a

financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held

as at 31st March, 2023 and 31st March, 2022.

The company operates mainly in regulated environment. Tariff hydro power stations of the company is fixed by the Central Electricity

Regulatory Commission (CERC) through Annual Fixed Charges (AFC) comprising the following five components: 1. Return on Equity (RoE), 2.

Depreciation, 3. Interest on Loans, 4. Operation & Maintenance Expenses and 5. Interest on Working Capital Loans. In addition to the above,

Foreign Currency Exchange Variation and Taxes are also recoverable from Beneficiaries in terms of the Tariff Regulations. Hence variation in

interest rate, currency exchange rate variations and other price risk variations are recoverable from tariff and do not impact the profitability of

the company.

The company’s risk management is carried out as per policies approved by Board of Directors from time to time.

(A)

Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including

deposits with banks and other financial instruments.

a)

Trade Receivables

The Company extends credit to customers in normal course of business. The Company monitors the payment track record of the customers.

Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables

as low, as its customers are mainly state government authorities and operate in largely independent markets.

CERC tariff regulations 2019-24 allows the Company to raise bills on beneficiaries for late-payment surcharge which adequately compensates

the Company for time value of money arising due to delay in payment. Further, the fact that beneficiaries are primarily State Governments/

State Discoms and considering the historical credit loss experience for trade receivables, the Company does not envisage either impairment in

the value of receivables from beneficiaries or loss due to time value of money due to delay in realization of trade receivables.

b)

Financial assets at amortised cost

Employee Loans: The Company has given loans to employees at concessional rates as per the Company’s policy which have been measured

at amortised cost at Balance Sheet date. The recovery of the loan is on fixed instalment basis from the monthly salary of the employees.

Management has assessed the past data and does not envisage any probability of default on these loans.

c)

Financial instruments and cash deposits

The Company considers factors such as track record, size/networth of the institution/bank, market reputation and service standards and limits

and policies as approved by the board of directors to select the banks with which balances and deposits are maintained. The Company invests

surplus cash in short term deposits with scheduled Banks.

B)

Liquidity Risk

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an

adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due.:
