Managing Director

MESSAGE FROM CMD:

Dear Shareholders,

My heartiest greetings to you all on my behalf and on behalf of the

GAIL Parivar.

The year 2022 witnessed extreme volatility and geopolitical dynamics

in the world’s energy system and it tested the resilience, strength and

perseverance of your Company. GAIL has put in strenuous efforts

to overcome the challenges while leveraging every opportunity and

remaining steadfast in all its endeavors. I am happy to share with

you, your Company’s achievements in the year gone by, against the

backdrop of this black swan event of the global energy crisis.

Your Company has recorded sustained performance in key physical

and financial parameters during the financial year. For FY 2023, GAIL

achieved the highest-ever Gross turnover of ` 1,43,976 crore, an

increase of 57% over the previous year. I am glad to share that this

is the first time that the turnover of your Company has surpassed

the ` One lakh crore mark in its history. Revenue from operations

from Natural Gas Transmission segment in FY 2022-23 increased to

` 6,661 crore as against ` 6,392 crore in FY 2021-22. Revenue from

operations from Natural Gas Marketing in FY 2022-23 increased to

` 1,35,290 crore as against ` 77,326 crore in FY 2021-22.

The geopolitical crisis had a direct impact on your Company’s

operations leading to the disruption in gas supply under one of its

long-term contracts, coupled with very high volatility in the price of

Spot LNG in the international market. These events made it extremely

difficult for GAIL to service its customers as well as its own processing

plants and petrochemical unit. This in turn resulted in supply

regulations and sourcing of costly LNG from spot market for keeping

contractual commitments. The situation was monitored closely so as

to ensure the continuity of business operations of priority sectors like

fertilizers/CGDs and to minimize the adverse impact on the company.

GAIL has been supporting the Government's priorities to ensure

energy security, making natural gas available at affordable prices

to every corner of the country and helping transition towards lower

carbon energy options. Your Company has commissioned 1,074 km

of pipeline and achieved 1,330 km of pipeline lowering during last

FY. Hon'ble Prime Minister dedicated the Bokaro-Angul Pipeline

(533 km) to the nation and also laid the foundation stone for

Srikakulam-Angul Pipeline (744 km). Your Company commissioned

Dhamra-Angul Mainline with spur lines to Jamshedpur, Ranchi,

Cuttack & Bhubaneshwar which enabled RLNG supply from Dhamra

LNG terminal. Further, GAIL also completed Sultanpur-Jhajjar-

Hisar and Haridwar-Rishikesh-Dehradun Pipeline. In addition, GAIL

also connected 30 nos. of CGDs Connectivity for gas supply. With

~15,600 km of pipelines under operation and 4,200 km of pipelines

under construction, your company will complete around 20,000 km

of National Gas grid.

I am happy to share that based on enabling regulations and GAIL's

submission, PNGRB has determined the levelized Integrated Tariff for

GAIL's Integrated Natural Gas Pipeline which shall lead to an increase

in natural gas transmission revenue for your Company. Further, the

implementation of Unified Tariff will significantly boost capacity

utilization in the eastern/northeastern regions and among customers

located far from source.

With a vision towards enabling clean energy access to the nation,

your Company provided more than 10 lakh domestic PNG connections

and added more than 350 new CNG Stations during the year along

with its Subsidiaries and JV companies. GAIL Group of companies

received PNGRB authorization for 2 Geographical Areas (GAs) during

the last year, and with this we now have 67 GAs. Additionally, GAIL

is developing an LNG supply value chain to develop new markets and

increase the consumption of natural gas in the country. The present

focus is on developing a retail LNG network through trucks and the

installation of LNG infrastructure inclusive of LNG dispensing stations,

small-scale LNG skids, etc. to increase its reach to newer customer

segments.

New business initiatives remain at the core of your Company’s

strategic outlook for enhancing the company’s profitability and

market reach. I am thrilled to share that your Company has

acquired 1.25 MMTPA PTA plant JBF Petrochemical Ltd. (renamed

as GAIL Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd.) and has made it a part of

GAIL’s umbrella. Your Company is also implementing 560 KTA of

Polypropylene (PP) plant at Usar and Pata. Your Company is also

implementing its first specialty chemical plant of 50 KTA Iso-Propyl

alcohol at Usar. With these additions, your company’s portfolio of

petrochemicals/ chemicals would become 2.95 MMTPA.

Your Company has always been at the forefront of innovation and

technology. Your Company's future growth is propelled by sustainable

growth strategies focused on its core areas while leveraging and

incorporating changes in the technology space, marketplace,

regulatory practices and also of macro-policy direction. GAIL is actively

involved in the LNG trading business in the international market and

to mitigate Commodity Price Risk of LPG production, your Company

has commenced first-of-its-kind exotic derivatives trading of Saudi CP

Propane and Butane prices and has taken derivatives for requisite

quantity of LPG. For the first time, it would begin direct marketing

of Crude Oil from its E&P assets. Keeping pace with the digital era

and adopting state-of-the-art technologies, an in-house designed web

portal for LNG sale/swap/sourcing transactions has been successfully

launched. Implementation of QR Code-based Inventory Management

Application across GAIL has also been introduced. It has launched

Sarathi Centre and Sparsh portal for Vendor Invoice Management.

During the FY 2022-23, your Company has signed investment

agreement with 1 start-up in the Fintech sector whose vision is to

effectively deploy credit products for underserve segment with

inclusive end use with financial commitment of ` 1.5 crore. So far,

GAIL has supported 34 numbers of start-ups with a total investment

commitment of ` 69.69 crore.

Your Company considers its shareholders as a valuable and integral

part of the organization. GAIL has been gratifying its shareholders

with regular dividends, successful buyback of the share at premium

and bonus issue of the share. During the FY 2022-23, Company

paid Interim Dividend @40% on equity shares of ` 10 each (` 4.00/-

per equity share each) amounting to ` 2,630.04 crore in March,

2023; in addition to Final Dividend @10% on equity shares of

` 10 each (` 1.00/- per equity share each) for FY 2021-22 amounting

to ` 438.34 crore in September, 2022. Your Company completed

buyback of ~5.70 crore fully paid-up equity shares of face value of

` 10 each (representing 1.28 % of the total number of fully paid-

up equity shares) at a price of ` 190 (Rupees One Hundred Ninety

only) per equity share. In addition, your Company issued and allotted

Bonus Shares to the shareholders in ratio of one equity share of ` 10

each for every two equity shares of ` 10 each held.:

in recent years, adding to Natural Gas demand. Liquefaction

facilities can help transfer gas from some fields that haven't

been commercially exploited as they are too small to support

an evacuation pipeline.

Your Company plans to set up small liquefaction facilities

to cater to Natural Gas demand in areas not connected to

pipelines and to help transport gas from isolated fields.

Your Company has placed orders for two small-scale

liquefaction skids capable of producing Liquefied Natural Gas

(LNG) on a pilot basis. Liquefaction will be achieved through

proprietary technology-based mobile liquefaction skids.

These plants will help in distribution of Natural Gas through

liquefaction in new city gas distribution areas, liquefaction of

gas at isolated fields and will support setting-up of LNG fueling

stations and in bunkering. It will be first of its kind in the

country to introduce portable and scalable liquefaction units.

Your Company is also discussing the possibility of

manufacturing liquefaction skids in India.

PNGRB Regulatory Framework

The Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) was

established by the Government of India on 1st October, 2007 for

carrying out the various provisions of the PNGRB Act, 2006. The

PNGRB Act provides a legal framework for regulating the refining,

processing, storage, transportation, distribution, marketing and

sale of petroleum, petroleum products and Natural Gas but

excluding the activities of production of crude oil and Natural

Gas, to protect the interests of consumers and entities engaged

in these activities. The main functions of PNGRB include, inter-

alia, (a) granting authorizations for laying, building, operating,

or expanding new pipelines as common carriers or contract

carriers and for laying, building, operating, or expanding new:

letter of intent of authorization of Gurdaspur-Jammu natural

gas Pipeline.

During the FY 2022-23, your Company has also been granted

authorization for developing a Tie-In Connectivity pipeline in

Jambusar region in Gujarat which shall bring in more gas from

new domestic sources. In this period, affiliates of your Company

have also been granted authorization for developing City Gas

Distribution Network in Geographical Area located in the state

of Chhattisgarh under the 11A Round of CGD Bidding.

PNGRB has also issued various orders and decisions in relevant

matters. The details of the said regulations, amendments,

authorizations, orders and decisions are available on the official

website of PNGRB (www.pngrb.gov.in) and have varying

implications on business. These regulations, amendments,

authorizations, orders, decisions of PNGRB are appealable

before the PNGRB Bench, Appellate Tribunal, and Courts and

accordingly, some of them pertaining to your Company are

also under various stages of appeals. The timing and content

of any final changes in regulations made by PNGRB is not in

your Company's control. However, regular interactions with

PNGRB on sectoral issues, participation in public consultation

exercises conducted by the Regulatory Board and making

logical submissions to the Regulator in writing helps your

Company to anticipate or to minimize risks associated with

any sudden or unforeseen changes in regulations.

Natural Gas Prices

Your Company currently markets Natural Gas purchased from

domestic and international sources.

The Government of India, vide its order dated 25th October,

2014, had notified the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing

Guidelines, 2014. As per the notification w.e.f. 1st November,

2014, the gas price is determined bi-annually as per a specific

formula, which in essence, is a twelve-month average price

(minus transportation and treatment charges) of Natural

Gas traded in the major hubs worldwide. The New Domestic

Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 are applied uniformly to

all nominated fields to ONGC & OIL, New Exploration Licensing

Policy (NELP) blocks, and Pre-NELP blocks that require

Government Approval as per PSC, whereas the same are not

applicable in case of small and isolated fields of nominated

blocks that are covered under the pricing guidelines of 2013.

Government of India formed Dr. Kirit Parikh Committee in

Sept-22 to review the pricing formula for gas produced in

the country as global energy prices soared. The Committee

recommended the domestic gas prices to be linked to Indian

Crude Oil Basket. The decision on recommendations of Dr.

Kirit Parikh Committee has been finalized by the Government

of India.

Accordingly, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas notified

amendment to New Domestic Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014

on 7th April 2023. As per the amendment, Domestic Natural

Gas Price (APM price) shall be 10% of the Indian Crude Basket

Price as defined by Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell

(PPAC) from time to time. The APM prices would be declared

on monthly basis by PPAC. For the gas produced by ONGC

and OIL from their nomination fields, the APM price shall be

subject to a floor and a ceiling. The initial floor and ceiling

price shall be $ 4/MMBTU and $6.5/MMBTU respectively.

The ceiling would be maintained for the next two years

(FY 2023-24 and 2024-25) and then increased by

$0.25/MMBTU each year. Gas produced from new well or well

intervention in the nomination fields of ONGC and OIL, where

APM prices are subject to floor and ceiling, would be allowed

a premium of 20% on these APM prices.

Further, the Government of India, vide its order dated

21st March, 2016, has notified guidelines on marketing including

pricing freedom for the gas produced from discoveries in deep

water, ultra-deepwater, and high pressure-high temperature

areas. As per the guidelines, the Government has decided to

ensure freedom of pricing for gas produced in these fields

up to a ceiling price level calculated by taking a lower of the

twelve-month average of landed price of imported fuel oil,

substitute fuels, and LNG.

Your Company earns the marketing margin on the sale of

domestic Natural Gas. Further, the Government of India, in

its notification dated 24th December, 2015, applicable from

18th November, 2015, has put a ceiling on the marketing

margin for the supply of domestic gas to fertilizer (Urea) and

LPG producers to ` 200 per 1000 SCM.:

Innovation, Research and Development

Technology & Innovation is one of the core values of your

company. In this aspect, innovation through R&D at GAIL plays

a key role in addressing the dual challenges of developing

affordable energy transition pathways and reducing the

environmental carbon foot print. This includes deployment of

decarbonizing technological interventions such as solar power,

wind power and bio-fuels and development of new sustainable

energy value chains, such as hydrogen, waste valorization and

CO2 utilization. In this year, R&D efforts mainly focused on

leveraging these energy transition and resource conservation

and augmentation opportunities for advancing breakthrough

energy research works for providing a wider, more sustainable

mix of energy sources for the country’s economic growth.

Solving the emerging complex energy transition challenges

of oil and gas industries requires collaboration between

countless teams of scientists and engineers from academics

and professionals from industries. In this direction, the

Company continuously emphasis on open innovation through

collaborative R&D works. This innovative paradigm is a powerful

tool for enhancing the capability for innovation as it multiplies

the R&D resources and also provide more choices for solving

scientific and technical problems with reduced risks.

Your company is continuously forging new research

partnerships with various academic and research institutes

across India, to work together to advance energy research

works from concept to scale. The collaborative research projects

are defined by commitment to green energy while sustaining

the growth strategy. Accordingly, in this year, your company

is pursuing research works in the following research themes

focusing on Waste valorization & Waste water recycling, CO2

separation, pipeline integrity management Indigenous catalyst

development and Hydrogen Initiatives etc.

R&D programmes under waste valorization & waste water

recycling signifies effort on waste minimization. Under this

initiative, your company is collaborating with IIT-Roorkee

for developing a co-gasification hydro thermal process for

simultaneous valorization of lignocellulosic biomass with

effluent water from petrochemical plant for production of

hydrogen rich methane and nanometal- impregnated carbon

hydrides as a byproduct. These byproducts can be used in

fuel cell, battery applications as electrocatalyst. The successful

outcome of this project may provide a sustainable solution for

treatment of industrial waste water while extracting valuables.

Towards the realization of Zero Liquid Discharge, your company

in association with IIT-Madras has developed a lab scale “hydrate

forming” process for purification of effluent water for its reuse/

recycle in the plant. As compare to other conventional recycling

process, hydrate process is considered “green process” as it

produces minimum sludge and consume less energy. The lab

scale process has shown nearly 75-90% separation efficiency

and is being scaled up to a continuous bench scale mode for

further validation.

Your Company is also working on development of novel

separation processes that could lower the energy required

during the purification of Natural Gas. GAIL R&D in association

with IIT-Guwahati is developing a novel high-performance

mixed-matrix membrane with high selectivity and permeability:
