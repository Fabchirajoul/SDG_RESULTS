LETTER TO

SHAREHOLDERS

FROM CHAIRMAN

& MANAGING

DIRECTOR: Dear Shareholders

My greetings and best wishes to you.

I am delighted to reach out to you and

share the good tidings of stellar all-

round performance by your Company

for yet another year.

During 2022-23, POWERGRID added

2,972 circuit km of Extra High Voltage

transmission lines, 28,990 Mega Volt

Ampere of transformation capacity, and

9 new substations. Several important

projects

have

been

commissioned

which include the 400kV D/c Jeerat

(New) – Subhasgram line 400kV D/c

Lower Subhansri-Biswanath Chariyali

line-I, 400kV D/c Mohindergarh-Bhiwani

line, etc. in the inter-state segment and

the Bhind-Guna transmission system

in Madhya Pradesh, Rampur-Sambhal

Transmission System in U.P in the intra-

state segment. In a first for the country,

your Company commissioned a green

field

digital

220/66kV

sub-station

at Chandigarh during 2022-23. The

Company made a capital investment

of `9,212 crore and capitalized assets

of `7,413 crore on a consolidated basis

during the year.

On the operations front, transmission

system

availability

of

99.82%

was

achieved and trippings per line were

reduced to 0.27 during the year. These

achievements

demonstrate

your

Company’s capabilities to maintain

a large and complex transmission

network consistently at high levels

of operational performance. In the

International Transmission Operation

and Maintenance Study published in

February’23, your Company has been

recognized as a Best Performer (High

Performance

and

Low

Cost)

both

for transmission line and substation

maintenance, and best in transformer

maintenance. Keeping in view the

growing cyber security concerns, a

Cyber Security Operations Centre has

been set up to monitor the network

traffic.

The

consolidated

income

of

your

company for the year 2022-23 was

₹46,605 crore, an increase of 9% compared to

the previous year. The Profit After Tax for the

year was ₹15,417 crore, which after excluding the

exceptional items, is an increase of 11% over the

previous year. We have declared and paid an

interim dividend of ₹10 per share and proposed

a final dividend of ₹4.75 per share which shall

be paid upon your approval. The total dividend

payout has been increased to 67% from 60%

in the previous year, aligned with our policy

to balance dividend payments and retained

earnings for growth.

Our endeavors for growth have been successful

in the traditional transmission business as well

as in new areas. During the year your Company

has been successful in winning 11 inter-state

projects and has entered into an agreement

with a large industry for the development of a

dedicated transmission system on a bilateral

basis. In the smart metering segment, your

Company has been successful in receiving a

mandate from the Gujarat Discoms (MVVNL

and UGVNL) for the installation of more than

67 lakh meters under the DBFOOT model. Your

Company has also approved the investment

for installation of an 85MW solar power plant at

Nagda, Madhya Pradesh which will be providing

power for our captive needs as well as sale

through exchanges.

Looking ahead, the commitment of our country

to

achieve

50%

of

electricity

generation

capacity through Non-Fossil sources by 2030

and the growing share of electricity in the

overall energy mix would require significant

investments in the transmission network, both

at inter-state and intra-state levels. This would

be further bolstered by the growing interest in

Green Hydrogen and the plans to make India a

leading exporter of Green Hydrogen. A number

of transmission projects are expected to be

offered for bidding over the next 12 months and

your Company is well poised to grow its market

share in this segment.

Cross-border

inter-connections

with

our

neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh,

Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka and

to inter-connect with the ASEAN countries will

improve and provide opportunities for growth.

Your company has formed a joint venture

with the Nepal Electricity Authority to set up

the Indian portion of the Gorakhpur-New

Butwal transmission link. It is my pleasure to

share that the groundbreaking of this project

was performed by the Honourable Prime

Ministers of India and Nepal. Investment in the

development of transmission infrastructure in

Africa and other emerging countries is being

pursued and there has been some progress in

this direction, particularly in Kenya where your

Company has partnered with AFRICA50.

The teleservices business of your Company is

also growing, both in terms of network reach

and revenues. The wholly owned subsidiary

of your Company, POWERGRID Tele Services

Ltd. (POWERTEL) has obtained a license for

International Long Distance (ILD) services and

the business transfer agreement to hive off the

telecom business into POWERTEL has also been

executed.

Your Company has a pivotal role to play in

our country’s energy transition journey, for

the large-scale integration of renewables will

require a strong, flexible, and resilient grid. I

am confident that with its vast experience,

committed

and

skilled

manpower,

and

financial strength, your Company will continue

to remain a leader in the Indian transmission

sector and make a significant contribution

towards India’s energy transition. To reduce the

carbon footprint, your Company is committed

to sourcing 50% of its energy from renewable

sources by 2025, turning water positive by

2030, and becoming a net zero company by

2047. Your Company has published its 1st

Integrated Annual Report (IAR) for the year

2022-23 and aligned reporting disclosures at

par with global frameworks.

On behalf of the Board of Directors of

POWERGRID, I convey my sincere gratitude and

thanks to you all for the trust reposed in and

continued support to the management.

With the best assurances of our steadfastness

to generate and deliver value to our esteemed

shareholders,

ANNUAL REPORT ON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) ACTIVITIES

1.

BRIEF OUTLINE ON CSR POLICY OF THE COMPANY

CSR Policy of the Company was approved by the Board of Directors in its 307th meeting held on 11th November,

2014 and was modified in its 393rd meeting held on 17th June, 2021. Major changes were incorporated in line with

Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Amendment Rules, 2021 of Ministry of Corporate Affairs

dated 22nd January, 2021. The Policy is available on Company’s website at

https://www.powergrid.in/sites/default/files/CSR%26S%20policy.pdf

The main features of the Policy are:

The Policy is named as POWERGRID’s Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability (CSR&S) Policy.

Vision

To be a Corporate that sets a long term strategy for Social & Economic Development of communities through

initiatives in Healthcare, Education, Rural development, Skill development, Sanitation and other areas of

national importance and adhere to sustainable environmental practices.

Mission

To align CSR and Sustainability Policy with the business policy so as to conduct business in a sustainable

manner, adhering to the principles of Avoidance, Minimization and Mitigation in dealing with environmental &

social issues and to undertake high impact community development projects of national & local importance

in consultation with stakeholders.

Activities under CSR

The activities proposed to be undertaken under CSR shall include all the activities mentioned in Schedule VII

of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act).

The Corporation will give preference to the stakeholders who are directly impacted by its operation for CSR

activities. Since such stakeholders are generally located in the periphery of the commercial operations of the

Corporation, POWERGRID will accord priority for CSR activities in local areas and neighborhood areas of its

operations.

The Geographical limits of a District where POWERGRID has its presence shall be considered as “local area”

for CSR&S activities. In addition, POWERGRID shall also undertake CSR activities outside it. Ratio of CSR spends

between local areas and outside would be approximately 75:25. However, projects/activities executed under

directives of Government of India or of foremost concern of the national development agenda will be outside

the purview of this ratio. The CSR&S Committee is authorized to approve any project, irrespective of the

amount involved, which is beyond the above ratio.

Priority will be given for CSR activities to the stakeholders directly impacted by operations of the Corporation.

CSR Projects or Programmes or activities undertaken in India shall only amount to CSR expenditure.

Mode of Execution of CSR activities

CSR activities shall preferably be implemented in a project mode. Implementation of various activities will

normally be done through placement of award by the Corporation as per Works & Procurement Policy of the

Corporation. Services of various departments of Central, State Governments, Panchayati Raj Institutions, etc.

may also be availed for implementation of CSR activities on deposit work basis.

CSR activities/projects/programmes may also be taken up in association with a registered trust or a registered

society or a Company established by the Corporation or its holding or subsidiary or associate company,

submitted to fulfilling requirements, as mentioned in the Act.

Communication Strategy

The electronic media shall be used for broader communication with the stakeholders. Display on website,

emails, Annual CSR booklet, Annual Report, etc. will be key instruments to decipher the CSR initiatives of

POWERGRID.

Funding of CSR activities

The Corporation will be required to spend annually on CSR, two percent of the average net profit made during

three immediately preceding financial years.:

Transmission Customers (LTTCs) and balance 20% along with the expenditure incurred by VTSL from the date

of acquisition till the liquidation of the company shall be borne by the Company. Subsequently, on a review

petition filed by the Company, CERC vide order dated 20/10/2016 held that there are sufficient reasons to review

the liability of the Company to pay 20% of the acquisition price and accordingly, directed that the issue shall be

decided afresh by taking a holistic view in the matter after disposal of appeals filed by the LTTCs on the issue

in Appellate Tribunal of Electricity (ATE).

The final hearing in the appeals filed in APTEL was held on 02.03.2020 and Hon’ble APTEL directed all parties

to file written submission and reserved the Judgement. However, due to Covid pandemic lock down during

Mar’20-May’20, the matter was relisted & heard on 24.08.2020 and Hon’ble APTEL directed all the parties to file

concise comprehensive written submissions through email and reserved the Judgement again. Accordingly,

concise comprehensive written submissions were filed in APTEL

As one of the Hon’ble Members of APTEL retired during Dec’20 before pronouncement of the judgement, the

matter may need to be heard again. An Early hearing application filed in the captioned matter was allowed

vide APTEL Order dated 05.07.2021 but due to subsequent vacancy of Chairperson in APTEL matter could not be

taken up. The new Chairperson in APTEL was appointed on 02.12.2022 since then the matter was listed on several

dates but could not be heard due to paucity of time. The Hon’ble Tribunal heard the matter on 24.02.2023. The

matter was listed on several occasions on/later to 21.04.2023, but could not be heard due to paucity of time.

The next hearing date is yet to be notified.

(iv) Provision for expected credit losses

a) Financial assets for which loss allowance is measured using 12 month expected credit losses

The Group has assets where the counter- parties have sufficient capacity to meet the obligations and where

the risk of default is very low. At initial recognition, financial assets (excluding trade receivables and contract

assets) are considered as having negligible credit risk and the risk has not increased from initial recognition.

Therefore, no loss allowance for impairment has been recognised except as specified in this note.

b) Financial assets for which loss allowance is measured using lifetime expected credit losses

In respect of trade receivables and contract assets from Telecom and Consultancy, customer credit risk is

managed by regular monitoring of the outstanding receivables and follow-up with the consumer for realization.

With regard to transmission segment, the Group has customers most of whom are state government utilities

with capacity to meet the obligations and therefore the risk of default is negligible. Further, management

believes that the unimpaired amounts that are 30 days past due date are still collectible in full, based on the

payment security mechanism in place and historical payment behaviour.

Considering the above factors and the prevalent regulations, the trade receivables and contract assets

continue to have a negligible credit risk on initial recognition and thereafter on each reporting date.
