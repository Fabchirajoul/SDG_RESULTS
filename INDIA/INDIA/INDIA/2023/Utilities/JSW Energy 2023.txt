Dear Shareholders,

FY 2023 has been a remarkable

year for JSW Energy and I find

myself very excited and optimistic

about what lies ahead for your

Company. As you all are aware

the world is changing and is

rapidly adopting greener ways of

producing energy, climate change

is upon us and your Company is

leading the path towards green

energy in India. We increased our

installed capacity by ~45% this year

by adding ~2 GW capacity and I am

proud to share that JSW Energy

now has an operating capacity of

6.6 GW across Thermal, Hydro, Solar

and Wind generation. In addition to

taking strides towards becoming

a 20 GW company, we also made

I am proud to share

key investment decisions in

newer avenues of value creation,

like energy storage and green

hydrogen. I am confident that these

new-age businesses can change

the future of JSW Energy for all our

stakeholders – our shareholders,

Sustainable and Reliable

Power

At the start of the year, global

economies witnessed a rebound

in economic activity as the impact

of the Covid-19 pandemic started

fading. However, the Russia-

Ukraine conflict dampened the

broad-based recovery and, as

a result of the conflict, ‘Energy

Security’ became the focus for all
