Key Performance of the Bank

MD & CEO's Statement

During Financial Year 2023, Punjab & Sind Bank stayed commiƩed to its arƟculated strategy of focusing on retail

business and targeƟng qualitaƟve business. The Bank's total business crossed the Rs.1.90 lakh crore with a

quantum shiŌ in terms of performance in almost every area – Business Growth, Proﬁtability as well as Asset

Quality. In FY 2022-23, your bank has registered highest ever Net Proﬁt. Moreover, this is the second

consecuƟve year of consistent performance across all major parameters notwithstanding the challenges on

the geo-poliƟcal and domesƟc fronts. The healthy growth in core operaƟng proﬁt and proﬁt aŌer tax reﬂect the

strong underlying performance of the business.

The Global economic acƟvity remains resilient and economy growth has moderated amidst the prolonged

Russia-Ukraine war, persistence of inﬂaƟon at elevated levels, debacle of banks in some advanced economies,

Ɵght ﬁnancial condiƟons. The synchronous Ɵghtening of monetary policy by most central banks have started

bearing fruits, with inﬂaƟon moving back toward its targeted levels. According to IMF, the global economy

growth will boƩom out at 2.8% in 2023 before rising modestly to 3.0% in 2024.
