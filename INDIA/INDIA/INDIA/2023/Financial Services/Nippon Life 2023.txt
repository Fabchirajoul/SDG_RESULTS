Dear Shareholders,

It is my pleasure to write this note

on behalf of the entire team at

NAM India. I am pleased to present

the Annual Report for FY 2022-23

and share some of the highlights

of our progress with you.

Uncertain Global Environment

but India Resilient

FY23 was a tumultuous year for the world economy,

beginning with geopolitical disturbances and

the long-term impact of the pandemic causing

spiralling inflation all over the globe. Central banks

sprang into action with tightening monetary policy

and withdrawing accommodation extended during

the pandemic. Growth started slowing, albeit slower

than expected. Towards the end of FY23, there was

fear of banking contagion after a few banks in the US

failed and UBS took over Credit Suisse. However, India

remained resilient through the macro-economic

headwinds due to government and regulatory

foresight and emerged as the best-performing large

economy. The IMF described India as the “bright

spot” in the world economy once again as it has

done so in past crises and with 7.2% GDP growth as

per CSO (Central Statistical Organisation) for FY23

that exceeded consensus expectations, India once

again proved worthy of the title.

Amidst this, the markets remained volatile and ended

the year almost flat with S&P BSE Sensex returning

0.7%. Small cap indices returned negative 7%. There

was an increase of 250 bps in the Repo Rate, while the

10 Year G-Sec yield went up by 50 bps.

Continued Growth in the Mutual

fund Industry

Overall assets of the Mutual Fund sector increased

by 5% to ₹ 39.4 lakhs Crores in FY23 (₹ 40.5 lakhs

Crores on a QAAUM basis). At ~₹ 14,300 Crores, March

2023 recorded the highest-ever monthly SIP flows.

Total SIP folios increased by 21% yoy in March 2023

and total SIP AUM increased by 19% yoy to ₹ 6.8

lakhs Crores. In FY23, the number of active Demat

accounts in India rose by 27% to 11.4 Crores. Industry

MF folios rose to 14.6 Crores from 13 Crores in March

2022.

This growth in the asset management industry

despite low market returns, was driven by increasing

financialisation, higher awareness and improved

access to mutual fund products. Over the past

decade, households have increasingly preferred

financial assets over physical assets to achieve

long-term savings goals. Within household financial

savings, the share of mutual funds returned to >6%

for 2021-2022, post two years of the COVID impact.

NAM Remains Well-positioned

Going Forward

We improved our mutual fund industry ranking

(based on total AUM) by 2 places to 4th position in

FY23 with QAAUM increasing by 3.5% to

₹ 2,93,159 Crores. Overall market share however

declined 14 bps to 7.24%. Total folios as of FY23 stood

at 1.96 Crores, up by 26 lakhs folios over FY22 and

we continue to have the largest investor base in the

mutual fund industry. Our share of industry-unique

investors was largely stable at ~36% with a base of

more than 1.35 Crores investors. Our systematic AUM

rose by 13% over the year to reach ₹ 58,024 Crores

and our annualised systematic transaction book is

at ~₹ 13,400 Crores as of March 2023.

spirit, and strictly follow the ethical principles that

govern business. Being fully aware of the stated

regulatory requirements, the Company strives

to remain ahead of the curve when it comes to

Risks and Concerns

NAM India is exposed to specific risks that are

particular to its businesses and the environment

in which it operates, including credit risk,

operational risk, competition risk, regulatory

risk, human resource risk, outsourcing risk,

information security risk, cyber security risk, and

macro-economic risk.

Competition risk

The

financial

sector

industry

is

becoming

increasingly competitive, and the Company’s

growth will depend on its ability to keep up with

competition effectively. The Company’s main

competitors are Domestic Mutual Funds, Portfolio

Management

Services,

Alternate

Investment

Funds, investment products offered by insurance

companies,

savings

schemes

operated

by

Government as well as bank Fixed Deposits. Further

liberalisation of the Indian financial sector could

lead to a greater presence or entry of new foreign

asset managers offering a wider range of products

and services. This could significantly toughen the

competitive environment. With its strong brand

image, wide distribution network, diversified

product offering, and quality management, the

Company has a strong competitive advantage.

Market risk

The Company has quoted and unquoted

investments in equity, debt and mutual funds, all

of which are exposed to fluctuations in the prices

of underlying assets. The portfolios are reviewed

for market risks on a periodic basis. The Company

also applies stress-testing to the portfolio monitor

to manage the market risks.

Credit Risk

The Company has quoted and unquoted

investments in bonds and debt-oriented mutual

funds. Therefore, there is a risk of default or

failure on the part of borrowers in meeting

their financial obligations towards repayment

of principal and interest. Hence, credit risk is a

loss because of non-recovery of funds both on

principal and interest counts. This risk can be

addressed through diversification, by spreading

investments into multiple bonds and mutual

funds across multiple issuers.
