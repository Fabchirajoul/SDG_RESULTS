Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if the counterparty to a financial instrument, whether a

customer or otherwise, fails to meet its contractual obligations towards the Company. Credit risk is the core

business risk of the Company. The Company therefore has high appetite for this risk but low tolerance and

the governance structures including the internal control systems are particularly designed to manage and

mitigate this risk. The Company is mainly exposed to credit risk from loans to customers (including loans

transferred to SPVs under securitization agreements, excluding loans sold under assignment presented as

off-balance sheet assets).

The credit risk may arise due to, over borrowing by customers or over lending by other financial institutions

competitors, gaps in joint-liability collateral and repayment issues due to external factors such as political,

community influence, regulatory changes and natural disasters (storm, earthquakes, fires, floods) and

intentional default by customers.

To address credit risk, the Company has stringent credit policies for customer selection. To ensure the

credit worthiness of the customers, stringent underwriting policies such as credit investigation, both in-

house and field credit verification, is in place. In addition, the compnay follows a systematic methodology

in the selection of new geographies where to open branches considering factors such as the portfolio at

risk and over indebtedness of the proposed area/region, potential for micro-lending and socio-economic

risk evaluation (e.g., the risk of local riots or natural disasters). Loan sanction and rejections are carried

out at the head office. A credit bureau rejections analysis is also regularly carried out in Company.

Credit risk is being managed by continuously monitoring the borrower’s performance if borrowers are paying

on time based on their amortization dues. The Company ensures stringent monitoring and quality operations

through both field supervision (branch/area/region staff supervision, quality control team supervision) and

management review. Management at each Company’s head office closely monitors credit risk through system

generated reports (e.g., PAR status and PAR movement, portfolio concentration analysis, vintage analysis, flow-

rate analysis) and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) which include proactive actionable thresholds limits (acceptable,

watch and breach) developed by CRO, revised at the the MLRC and at the Risk Committee at the Board level.

Some of the main strategies to mitigate credit risk are:

1. Maintain stringent customer enrolment process,

2. Undertake systematic customer awareness activities/ programs,

3. Reduce geographical concentration of portfolio,

4. Maximum loan exposure to member as determined from time to time,

5. Modify product characteristics if needed (e.g., longer maturity for group clients in case the loan is above

a certain threshold),

6. Carry out due diligence of new employees and adequate training at induction,

7. Decrease field staff turnover,

8. Supporting technologies: credit bureau checks, GPS tagging and KYC checks.

The exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However,

management also considers the demographics of the Company’s customer base, including the default risk of

the country in which the customers are located, as these factors may have an influence on the credit risk.

Impairment assessment

The references below show where the Company’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set

out in this report. It should be read in conjunction with the summary of significant accounting policies.

41.2.a

Deﬁnition of default, signiﬁcant increase in credit risk and stage assessment

For the measurement of ECL, Ind AS 109 distinguishes between three impairment stages. All loans need

to be allocated to one of these stages, depending on the increase in credit risk since initial recognition (i.e.

disbursement date)::
