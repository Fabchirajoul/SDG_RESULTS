Dear Stakeholders,

I extend my warmest greetings and hope this: letter finds you well.

The insurance market, valued at USD 5 trillion1

globally, is undergoing a tectonic shift that

will redefine traditional practices. The focus is

now on prioritising digital solutions as a new

generation of consumers and advancements

in data, automation, and Artificial Intelligence

drive this change. The global insurance industry

is facing significant challenges due to the

economic consequences of geopolitical conflicts,

rising inflation, interest rate pressure, climate

change, and unpredictable market disruptions

by InsurTech. To thrive, insurers must implement

agile talent and technology strategies, and

improve operational efficiency to meet the

ever-changing customer expectations. This will

pave the way for insurers to unlock invaluable

insights, reduce costs, mitigate risks, and create

an innovation-driven and customer-focussed

ecosystem. Besides technology, there are other

pressing issues like environment and climate

change and it is becoming increasingly important

for insurers to differentiate themselves through

their environmental, social, and governance (ESG)

initiatives. The success will be measured by how

effectively organisations are able to mitigate

environmental risks, reduce carbon emissions,

promote diversity in workforce, improve inclusivity

and increase transparency and accountability in

their governance structures.

Message from the Chairperson

THE TOTAL PREMIUM OF

THE INDUSTRY GREW AT A

HEALTHY 16% FROM ` 2,208

BILLION IN FY2022 TO ` 2,569

BILLION IN FY2023.

ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited

Dear Shareholders,

I trust this message finds you well!

Global economies have faced daunting

headwinds during the fiscal year 2023

owing to geopolitical uncertainties,

trade tensions, volatile commodity

prices, tightening interest rates and

liquidity. While advanced economies

have experienced modest growth or

stagnation, India has emerged resilient

and is one of the fastest-growing

economies worldwide. This can be

attributed to robust investment activity,

supported by the Government’s

enhanced capital expenditure for

infrastructure and thriving private

consumption. Earlier in March 2023,

India achieved a milestone in credit

growth, with double-digit increase of

15%, representing the highest credit

growth witnessed in over a decade1.

THE INDIAN GI INDUSTRY

The Indian GI market is ranked 14th

globally 2 and poised to witness

accelerated growth to USD ~50 billion

(GWP)3 by 2027. Despite the seemingly

robust growth in insurance coverage

figures, it is concerning that India’s

protection gap4 remains alarmingly high

at 92%. However, that also presents

a huge opportunity given the rising

wealth levels, and an increasing agenda

of financial inclusion.

The Indian GI industry5 experienced

a remarkable growth rate of 16.4% in

Gross Direct Premium Income (GDPI)

during fiscal year 2023 with total

premiums crossing ` 2,569 billion.

The growth was primarily driven by

health segment, which continues to

be the largest contributor to the overall

industry mix. As far as profitability

INTERNAL CONTROL

The Company’s internal control systems are commensurate

with the nature of its business and the size and complexity

of its operations. The Company has adopted the following

Frameworks in order to ensure that internal controls are

adequate and effective.

i.

Internal Audit Framework

Internal Audit’s mission is to provide independent,

objective assurance on the effectiveness of internal

controls, risk management and corporate governance,

and to suggest improvements to add value. It helps the

Company to accomplish its objectives by evaluating and

improving the effectiveness of risk management, internal

controls and governance processes, through a systematic

and disciplined approach.

The Company has an established Audit Charter and

Internal Audit Policy approved by the Board, which is

based on a risk based approach. An annual Risk Based

Audit Plan (RBAP) is drawn up on the basis of risk profiling

of the businesses/ departments of the Company which is

approved by the Audit Committee.

Internal Audit acts as an independent entity and reports

to the Audit Committee of the Board. Internal Auditor has

unrestricted access to the Audit Committee Chairperson

and the: Managing

Managing Director & CEO, based

on the certification from respective functional heads, is

placed at the Audit Committee and Board of Directors on a

quarterly basis and if required, corrective action is initiated

to strengthen the controls and enhance the effectiveness

of the existing systems.

iii. Internal Financial Controls and their Adequacy

The Company has in place adequate internal financial

controls commensurate with size, scale and complexity

of its operations. The Company has complied with internal

financial controls as per the provisions prescribed under

the Act, Listing Regulations, in terms of internal control

over financial reporting and Section 404 of Sarbanes

Oxley Act, 2002. These have been designed with an

objective to provide a reasonable assurance with regard

to maintaining proper accounting controls, safeguarding

of assets, prevention and detection of frauds and

errors, ensuring operating effectiveness, reliability of

financial reporting, executing transactions with proper

authorisation and compliance with applicable regulations

and Board approved policies. These controls are covered

under the Internal Financial Control Framework, which

is aligned with the Internal Control Framework 2013

given by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations

(“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission. The Company

has in place both Entity Level Controls and Process

Level Controls to provide reasonable assurance with

regard to recording and providing reliable financial

and operational information. The Entity Level Controls

broadly cover Corporate Governance, Core Committees,

Core Policies and Risk management & Fraud Control

framework. The Process Level Controls ensure processes

are documented, risks are identified for each process,

the controls are implemented for all identified risks and

whether the controls identified are Preventive or Detective

controls. The effectiveness of internal financial controls is

exhibited through control testing with samples at periodic

intervals. The Joint Statutory Auditors of the Company

have verified the systems and processes and confirmed

that the internal financial controls over financial reporting

are adequate and such controls are operating effectively.

iv. Risk Management Framework

The objective of the Risk Management Framework (“the

Framework”) of the Company is to ensure that various

risks are identified, assessed, evaluated and mitigated.

Various policies, procedures and standards are adopted to

address these risks for systemic response and adherence.

The Company has identified enterprise wide risks, which

are categorised under six broad risk groups namely Credit

Risk, Market Risk, Underwriting Risk, Operational Risk,

Strategic Risk and Environmental, Social and Governance

(ESG) Risk. The broad structure of the Framework is as

follows:

•

Risk Identification, Assessment, Evaluation and

Mitigation process;

•

Risk Management and Oversight structure;

•

Risk Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism.

The Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) function of the

Company undertakes a comprehensive Risk and Control

Self-Assessment (R & CSA) activity for all units forming

part of the risk universe of the Company, to manage

the existing and emerging risk areas for the Company.

The Senior Management of the Company is responsible

for a periodic review of the risk management process

to ensure that the various initiatives are aligned to the

desired objectives.

The Company has in place Operational Risk Management

Committee, Market Risk Management Committee,

Outsourcing Committee and Information Security Committee.

The referred Committees are internal Governance

Committees comprising of various functional Heads of

the organisation, to monitor the levels of risk and their

effective management in different focused areas of ERM.

The risks are further monitored on a quarterly basis by

using a risk heat map based on probability and severity.

A Risk Register is maintained to capture inventory of risks

that the Company is exposed to along with mitigation and

corrective action plans. The Risk Management Committee

is updated on the enterprise wide risk management

aspects on a quarterly basis. As part of the ERM exercise,

critical and core risks along with the detailed mitigation

plan(s) are presented to the Risk Management Committee

on a quarterly basis. The risk mitigation plans are monitored

regularly by the Company to ensure their timely and

appropriate execution. The Company further measures

each of its Board approved Key Risk Indicators against:
