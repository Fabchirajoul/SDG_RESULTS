Letter dated May 31,

2023 in respect of the agreed indicators listed below (the

“Identified Sustainability Indicators”). These indicators are

as included in the Integrated Annual Report of the Company

for the year ended March 31, 2023 (‘the Integrated Annual

Report’).

Identified Sustainability Indicators

The Identified Sustainability Indicators for the year ended

March 31, 2023 are summarised in Appendix 1 to this report.

Our limited assurance engagement was with respect to

the year ended March 31, 2023 information only (unless

otherwise stated) and we have not performed any

procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other

elements included in the Integrated Annual Report and,

therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon.

Criteria

The criteria used by the Company to prepare Identified

Sustainability Indicators are internally defined criteria by

the management of the Company as set out under Appendix

1 to this report (the ‘Criteria’).

Management’s Responsibility

The Company’s Management is responsible for identification

of key aspects of the Integrated Annual Report, engagement

with stakeholders, content and presentation of the

Integrated Annual Report in accordance with the Criteria

mentioned above. This responsibility includes the design,

implementation, and maintenance of internal control

relevant to the preparation of the Integrated Annual Report

and measurement of Identified Sustainability Indicators,

which are free from material misstatement, whether due

to fraud or error.

Inherent limitations

The absence of a significant body of established practice

on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial

indicators allows for different, but acceptable, measures

and measurement techniques and can affect comparability

between entities.

Our Independence and Quality Management

We have complied with the independence and other

ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics

for Professional Accountants (including International

Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics

Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), which is

founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity,

professional competence and due care, confidentiality and

professional behavior.

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality

Management 1 [Quality Management for Firms that

Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements,

or Other Assurance or Related Service Engagements],

and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of

quality management including documented policies and

procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements,

professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory

requirements.

Our Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance

conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Indicators

based on the procedures we have performed and evidence

we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance

engagement in accordance with International Standard on

Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance

Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical

Financial Information' issued by the International Auditing

and Assurance Standards Board. This standard requires

that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited

assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability

Indicators are free from material misstatement.

A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the

suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the

Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified

Sustainability Indicators, assessing the risks of material

misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Indicators

whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed

risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating

the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability

Indicators.

forward-looking assertions and/or data.

Limited Assurance Conclusion

Based on the procedures we have performed and the

evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our

attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s

Identified Sustainability Indicators included in the

Integrated Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2023

are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with

the criteria.

Message from the Chairman

At HDFC Life, we believe that to become

the insurer of choice, we need to stay

ahead of the curve. Over the years,

HDFC Life has successfully implemented

a profitable and consistent growth

strategy resulting in a smooth upward

curve on key metrics.: Dear Shareholders,

FY 2022-23 was a difficult year for the global

economy. The slowdown in growth, tightening

of financial conditions in most regions and the

subsequent stress saw the collapse of some large

financial institutions. Many central banks hiked

policy rates to combat inflation.

In this difficult environment, India has demonstrated

sustained resilience. Economic activity remained

buoyant, with high frequency indicators such as

credit growth, Goods & Services Tax, e-way bills, rail

freight traffic and air passenger traffic, amongst

others continued to strengthen during the year.

Dear Shareholders,

The year gone by was a challenging

one, both at a global macro level

as well as at an operating level.

However, as we step into the new

financial year, I am as enthused

about

the

opportunities

that

lie ahead as I was ever before.

We have a long runway for growth

ahead and an unfinished agenda of

ensuring every Indian has adequate

life insurance coverage.

We closed the year FY 2022-23 on a strong note. The Company

recorded 27% growth* year-on-year, with a market share of

16.5% and 10.8% in the private and overall sector respectively,

clocking expansion of 40 and 70 basis points respectively.

We continue to grow faster than the private industry and be

ranked amongst the top three life insurers across individual

and group businesses, consistently demonstrating market

leadership through profitable growth. We are also delighted

to be ranked1 10th amongst India's Best Companies to Work for

2023 (Top 100) by Great Place to Work.

Managing Director & CEO.

The Chairman leads and manages

the Board by providing direction and

process within the Board.

background information and updates

on the industry and the organisation

and help them discharge of their

duties efficiently. To strengthen

the

effectiveness,

the

Board

conducts periodic assessments of

its performance, including that of

individual Directors based on pre-

determined criteria. The Independent

Directors also meet separately to

review their performance and that

of the

Managing Director,

CEO and CHRO conduct an annual

review of their potential for growth

and identify developmental needs.

These reviews are used to design

learning interventions such as

workshops, labs, immersions and

360-degree feedback in collaboration

with reputed consultants and top

global business schools.

In addition, this review forum is critical

in identifying potential successors

for vital roles within the Company.

These successors are groomed over

time through expanded roles, cross-

functional exposure, opportunities to

lead major projects or initiatives, and

educational opportunities at premier

institutions.

Mr. Deepak S. Parekh

Dear Stakeholders,

Our commitment to ESG is integral to our long term sustainability strategy. Our focus reflects

in improved scores and ratings: We scored 49 in the 2022 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability

Assessment reflecting an improvement of 35 points over the last 3 years; our Sustainalytics

rating was 19.5 indicating low risk of experiencing material financial impact arising from ESG

factors; we have maintained our MSCI rating at ‘BBB’.

We understand the importance of environmental stewardship and have implemented

initiatives such as procurement and installation of energy efficient appliances (e.g.

LEDs, star-rated appliances, etc.), sensor-based water taps, renewable energy sourcing,

and waste recycling to minimize our ecological footprint. We have conducted a detailed

assessment of our greenhouse gas emission (GHG) inventory and have articulated our Scope

1, 2 and limited Scope 3 emissions. We have also disclosed our climate-related performance

in accordance with the TCFD recommendations.

Our focus on social responsibility extends to our employees, customers, and the communities

in which we operate. We have taken steps to ensure a safe and inclusive work environment,

fostering diversity and equal opportunities for all. Our efforts to reduce gender bias have

resulted in increased women representation across levels and currently stand at 26%.

Furthermore, we actively engage with local communities through various CSR initiatives,

including employee volunteering programs and partnerships that address their specific

needs.

High standards of corporate governance is a fundamental building block of our business.

We are committed to transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct at all levels. Our Board

of Directors comprises individuals with diverse expertise and experience, ensuring a

balanced approach to decision making. We have implemented robust risk management

frameworks, compliance procedures, and internal controls to safeguard the interests of our

stakeholders.

We have also conducted Materiality Assessment as per the GRI Universal Standards during

the financial year.

Looking Ahead:

We remain committed to the ongoing integration of ESG considerations into our business

operations, decision-making processes, and long-term strategy. By focusing on innovation,

collaboration, and stakeholder engagement, we are confident that we will continue to make

meaningful contributions to a sustainable future. We are grateful for the continued support

and trust of our stakeholders as we navigate these ESG challenges. Your partnership enables

us to pursue our vision of responsible and impactful business practices. We look forward to

updating you on our progress.

An actuarial assessment of the components of value of a life insurance company will not necessarily be consistent with the

value of a life insurance company or a portfolio in the open market and should not be interpreted in that manner.

The Results are based on a series of assumptions as to future operating experience. It should be recognised that actual

experience will differ from these assumptions on account of changes in the operating and economic environment and natural

variations in experience. To the extent that actual experience is different from the assumptions, the future projected profits

from which the Results are derived will also differ. The Report include various sensitivity results to illustrate how vulnerable

the IEV and VNB results are to changes in assumptions for the key risks. The Results shown are presented at the valuation

dates stated and no warranty is given by Milliman that future experience after these valuation dates will be in line with the

assumptions made.

Milliman is not a tax expert and is not able to provide tax or accounting advice. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that no reliance

will be placed on Milliman, its Partners, or employees with respect to any tax or accounting issue. The allowance for taxation

reflected in the Results is based on the Company’s interpretation of applicable tax regulations. The Results do not reflect

any allowance for withholding or other taxes (if any) that may apply to the payment of future shareholder dividends or on

remittances out of India.

The Results have been determined on a going concern basis, and assume a stable economic, legal and regulatory environment

going forward. Any change in the general operating environment would add a high degree of uncertainty to the Results.

Unless explicitly stated, the Results do not consider any external (including regulatory) developments after the valuation

date of March 31, 2023.

Yours faithfully,
