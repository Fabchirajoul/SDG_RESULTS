Dear Shareholders,

It gives me pleasure to share with you

the performance of your Company for

the year 2022-23. If I were to describe

the happenings of the year succinctly,

‘eventful and significant’ are the words

that come to my mind.

We stayed true to our purpose of

creating value for all our stakeholders,

driven by the three-engine model of

growth that we had set for ourselves:

TI-1 comprising our core business, TI-2

which includes step-outs and frontier

businesses like EV and TI-3 from

inorganic growth through acquisitions.

The Indian Economy demonstrated

great resilience emerging, according to

IMF (International Monetary Fund), as

one of the fastest growing economies in

the world. A buoyant domestic market

provided opportunities for growth and

scale in sales volumes in key sectors

such as auto, general engineering,

construction, infrastructure, etc. The

rural sector however remained sluggish

with inflationary pressures impacting

vulnerable communities.

across all categories, with passenger

cars, particularly SUVs and commercial

vehicles recording an upward growth

trajectory of nearly 27%. The industry is

on the cusp of a major transformation

with the dynamically changing pace

of vehicle technologies and mobility

systems.

India

with

supportive

Government policies is rapidly changing

into a major automotive hub of the

world.

The three businesses - Engineering,

Metal Formed Products and Industrial

Chains recorded significant growth

addressing

the

surge

in

market

demand with great agility and efficiency.

Co-partnering with OEMs and auto

majors, the businesses built a portfolio

of

innovative,

value-engineered

products for critical applications and

new-age technologies.

Revenue

from

the

Railways,

an

important user segment for the Metal

Products

business,

was

impacted due to the deferred projects

of the Government as an overhang

of the pandemic disruption. A major

growth engine of the country, Railways

is however slated for exponential

Revenue from exports, primarily from

U.S and Europe, was impacted by the

conflict between Russia and Ukraine,

with inflationary pressures, escalation

in raw material prices and energy

crisis leading to plant closures and a

decline in global trade. The economic

fragmentation on geopolitical faultlines

triggered fears of insecurity with a

slowdown in global growth.

We stayed anchored to the four

cardinal metrics that we had set as part

of our business discipline: Revenue

Growth, Profitability, Return on Invested

Capital and Free Cash Flow recording

a significant growth across businesses,

except for the Mobility Business

which

reflected

the

decline

and

general malaise in the bicycle industry.

Our step-out, particularly in the E-3W

business, is showing great market

promise and the strategic acquisitions

in the EV spectrum under the subsidiary

TI Clean Mobility are envisaged to turn

into major growth enablers.

The auto industry, an important user

segment for TII’s Engineering and Metal

Formed businesses ended the year

with an overall increase of 20% in sales

ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23:

Dear Shareholders,

It gives me pleasure to share with

you the strong performance of your

Company for the year 2022-23.

TII recorded significant growth with

each of the businesses riding the

buoyancy in the domestic market

with demand resurgence across core

sectors, driven by a resilient Indian

economy. Revenues from exports

however

was

impacted

by

the

turbulence triggered by the Russia-

Ukraine conflict and its fallout in terms

of inflation, volatile raw material prices,

and paucity of gas supplies paralysing

plant operations particularly in the Euro

zone and slowing down B2B trade.

Process

efficiencies,

value-added

engineering,

deepening

customer

engagement and a slew of differentiated

products

proved

to

be

strong

growth enablers, in addition to the

focus on the 4 cardinal metrics that

we have set for ourselves: Revenue

Growth, Profitability, Return On Invested

Capital and Free Cash Flow.

PBT before exceptional Items was

at `928 Cr. as against `628 Cr. for

scope of operations into new and

emerging business ventures. In line

with our strategy, we marked the

year with a number of acquisitions

in

EV,

mobile

camera

modules,

medical consumables and ventured

into

Contract

Development

and

Manufacturing Operations in API for the

pharmaceutical segment.

The year was also doubly significant as

it marked the transition of TII, through

its subsidiary TICMPL, from an ancillary

to an Original Equipment Manufacturer.

Engineering Business

The Engineering business put in a

sterling performance both in the

domestic and export market with its

specialized hydraulic cylinders and

tubular products for the auto and

non-auto segments. Revenue was at

`4,562 Cr. compared to `3,868 Cr. in

the previous year. PBIT for the business

was `549 Cr. as against `376 Cr. for

the previous year.

Metal Formed Products Business

The Metal Formed Products Division

(MFPD) rode the buoyancy in the

auto market to record a year of strong

growth.

The business earned a Revenue of

`1,424 Cr. and PBIT of `174 Cr. for

the year as against `1,240 Cr. and

`136 Cr. in the previous year.

According

to

Society

of

Indian

Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), the

industry recorded the highest sales

across segments during the year, with

a growth of 27% in passenger cars,

particularly SUVs and Commercial

Vehicles. The Auto industry is on a major

transformational path, with supportive

Government policies to make India a

global auto manufacturing hub.

The

Business

expanded

its

customer roster with its engineering

expertise

and

operational

agility,

co-partnering with OEMs to design

and supply innovative products for

the multiple new models, on tight lead

times. Aftermarket sales recorded

robust demand with channel expansion

and rationalization.

At TII, it was an event-marked calendar

year, with the Company enlarging its

scope of operations into new and

emerging business ventures.

Dear Shareholders,

The Directors take pleasure in presenting the 15th Annual

Report together with the audited financial statements of the

Company for the year ended 31st March 2023.

1.

Business Environment

The financial year 2022-23 was a challenging year for

the global economy starting with the conflict between

Russia and Ukraine leaving the oil/energy prices to

go up significantly. This was followed by inflation due

to increase in the prices of commodities across the

globe and energy crisis. Most of the major economies

witnessed unprecedented inflation rates in its history

and all the central banks started continuously raising

the interest rates. Due to increasing oil prices, the US

dollar had gained against all currencies which resulted

in inflationary pressures on emerging economies who

are import dependent and the chain effect continued.

The aforesaid developments in the global economy

influenced and posed a downside risk to the Indian

economy. The erratic climate conditions including

unseasonal rains also affected the food supply and

resulted in increased food inflation in India during

FY 2022-23. Consequently, Reserve Bank of India

continued to increase the repo rates to tame the

inflation within the upper tolerance limit. In spite of

all the headwinds, India continued to be the fastest

growing major economy for FY 2022-23 @ 7.2% as

a result of the strong macro-economic fundamentals,

domestic consumption and increase in exports.

The Indian economy is projected to grow at around

6.3% in FY 2023-24 amid global headwinds and rising

costs. This is mainly driven by private consumption

and private investments backed by supportive

Government policies to improve the infrastructure

and business ecosystem. The Government has

indicated that to sustain the current growth trajectory,

structural changes for ensuring financial discipline and

compliance will be introduced. The digital infrastructure

expansion, implementation of production linked

incentive schemes have incentivised the corporates

for setting up of infrastructure for sustained growth in

the future.

The latest episodes of banking sector crisis across

the major economies have exposed the financial risks

faced not only by these countries but also globally.

Also, with the fear of recession looming large at the

world, 2023-24 is expected to be an even more

challenging and turbulent year. However, it is expected

that the Indian economy will remain insulated to some

extent due to its strong domestic demand and sound

macro-economic fundamentals.

The automotive industry, a sector in which the Company

has a large exposure, has witnessed a healthy revival

in FY 2022-23 and is expected to carry forward similar

momentum going forward. The Government’s push for

capital outlay of `2.4 lakh crores for railways as part of

the Union Budget, will be favourable to the Company

which expects its railways business to benefit out of

this spend. Further, other announcements to boost

domestic manufacturing, promote exports and green

energy will be advantageous to the Company.

Reserve Bank of India has finally paused the rate

hike after six consecutive increases in April 2023. It

is an indicator of the strong resilience shown by the

Indian economy. Though there appears to be a pause

in the investment climate, it is expected that a mix of

cautious and necessary investments will still continue

through this financial year which may help the Indian

economy to continue its growth momentum.
