Dear Shareholders,

This year, SBI Card is celebrating the 25th year anniversary of

its inception. On May 15, 1998, SBI Card was born with an

aspiration to revolutionise the payments landscape in India.

At the time, the credit cards market was at a nascent stage

with very few players. SBI Card entered the market to work

towards digitising the payments. Since then, the market has

witnessed many ups and downs. Today, the market has grown

exponentially in size, with over 85 million outstanding cards

and spends touching all-time high benchmarks. SBI Card has

also charted a firm growth path over these years to become

the second-largest credit card player in the industry.

Throughout this remarkable journey, SBI Card has continued

to expand its offerings through innovative products,

technology, best-in-class capabilities, and connect with new

customer segments to meet their evolving aspirations.

I am proud to say that SBI Card has played a pivotal role in

shaping the industry, leveraging the conducive economic

and consumer-led changes.

The past few years have been crucial for this growth. The

industry’s outstanding cards have grown at 18% CAGR in

the last five years, from FY18 to FY23, with spends seeing

an increase at 26% CAGR during the same period. India's

consumption-led economy remains robust, driven by several

favourable factors, including the digitisation of payments,

demographic dividend, and increased disposable incomes.

Additionally, growing e-commerce, rising urbanisation, and

increased access to financing are redefining the consumption

market, leading to a growing shift towards discretionary

spending. The recent RBI Consumer Confidence Survey

confirms the positive outlook for consumer demand, with

households increasing their essential and non-essential

spending, indicating a significant opportunity for businesses

to capitalise on these prospects.

India has emerged as a frontrunner in the field of digital

payments. Over the past five years, India's digital payments

landscape has experienced remarkable growth. According

to a recent report, India's digital payments market is poised

to grow from the current US$3 trillion to US$10 trillion by

2026*, representing an increase of more than threefold.

This unprecedented growth will lead to non-cash transactions

accounting for two out of three payment transactions by

2026, signalling a significant shift towards digital payments

in India.

According to a recent report,

India's digital payments market is

poised to grow from the current

US$3 trillion to US$10 trillion by

2026*, representing an increase

of more than threefold.

SBI Cards and Payment Services Limited:

Dear Shareholders,

I am happy to share with you that SBI Card registered a

robust performance for the reporting period, demonstrating

the resilient and sustainable business model built over the

years. India's credit card industry also achieved strong

growth over the past year while assimilating significant

changes, setting the tone for its future. At SBI Card, our

growth has always been intertwined with India’s credit

card market’s potential, and we are poised to leverage the

emerging opportunities to scale our growth further.

Today, digital payments have transformed the way Indians

conduct their daily transactions. Various modes of digital

payments such as UPI, credit cards etc. have seen a massive

adoption and usage among various segments of consumers.

The credit card industry has been showcasing a consistent

growth, with the number of credit cardholders expanding

from 7.4 crore in March 2022 to 8.5 crore in March 2023.

Card spends increased significantly by 28% from ` 1.07 lakh

crore in March 2022 to ` 1.37 lakh crore in March 2023 –

the highest ever monthly spends for the industry^, as of

March 2023. FY2023 also saw the highest ever annual

card spends in the industry at over ` 14 lakh crore, with

e-commerce contributing significantly.

The past year has been pivotal for the industry with many

changes being introduced by the regulator. These changes

are progressive for the industry, with the basic ethos being

cardholder convenience and protection. The industry has

largely adjusted to and incorporated them in a seamless

manner and is now ready for the next level of growth.

Coming to the SBI Card’s performance amidst these crucial

changes in the industry. Our sharp focus on strengthening

acquisition channels and acquisition quality, enhancing

sustainability of the business, and ensuring an engaged and

active customer base yielded new benchmarks for FY2023.

Our market share for cards in force has grown to 19.7%, and

we added a record high of 52.02 lakh total new accounts

during the year. As of March 2023, our total card base stands

at 1.68 crore, with a strong 22% YoY growth. In Q3 FY2023,

we added 16 lakh new accounts, the highest ever during a

quarter. We continue to be the second-largest credit card

issuer in the country.

In terms of card spends, SBI Card's market share has been

18.2% for the year. We recorded the highest ever retail

spends in FY2023 at over ` 2 lakh crore, with online spends

accounting for 57% share. We also witnessed healthy

growth across key spend categories such as departmental

stores, health, utilities, education, travel, entertainment &

Our sharp focus on strengthening

acquisition channels and acquisition

quality, enhancing sustainability of the

business, and ensuring an engaged

and active customer base yielded new

benchmarks for FY2023.
