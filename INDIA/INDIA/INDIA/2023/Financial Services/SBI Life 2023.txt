Management.

Dr. Bhasin is presently the Chairman,

Advisory Board for Banking and

Financial Frauds. He was appointed as

the vigilance commissioner in central

vigilance commission by the President

of India. He has over 44 years of

experience in administration, banking

and finance industry. He joined Oriental

Bank of Commerce as a Probationary

Officer in June 1978 and rose to the

rank of General Manager. He served as

Executive Director in United Bank of

India and elevated as the Chairman and: Managing

Dear stakeholders,

The major forces that shaped the world

economy in 2022 continued into 2023

with varied intensities. Recovering from

the pandemic-induced contraction,

global economic growth moderated as

escalating geopolitical tensions kept

supply chains in disarray and pushed

inflation to historically high levels.

The central banks of major economies

initiated a synchronised and aggressive

monetary tightening cycle which has

eased inflation in recent months.

Commodity prices that rose sharply

have moderated, aided by normalising

supply chains. However, increased

uncertainty from the recent financial

sector turmoil and elevated

geopolitical tensions remain key risks.

The International Monetary Fund

(IMF), in its April 2023 outlook,

expects global growth to slow down

further to 2.8% in 2023 from 3.4%

in 2022 before stabilising to 3.0% in

2024. The Indian economy, on the

other hand, demonstrated strong

resilience and positioned itself to

ascend to the pre-pandemic growth

path in FY23. In real terms, the

economy is expected to grow at 6.5%

in FY24, as per the Economic Survey

2022-23.

Greater need to boost

financial immunity

The Indian insurance industry has seen

impressive growth in the past decade.

This growth can be attributed to

growing income, increasing awareness

and a greater need for safeguarding

oneself and one's family post-pandemic.

The Indian government has played

a very crucial role in increasing the

scope of the insurance sector through

various policies and schemes, such

as the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti

Bima Yojana (PMJJBY,) providing life

insurance coverage at an affordable

price.

During FY23, the Life Insurance

industry recorded 18% growth in

New Business Premiums. The life

insurance premium is expected to

grow at 9% annually in real terms by

2032, making India the fifth-largest life

market globally. Today the awareness

and demand for Life Insurance

products amongst the customer along

with digitalisation are supporting

the sector’s growth. Further, the

regulatory development and vision

set for the increasing penetration and

sector development are laying the

path for long-term and sustainable

growth of the Insurance Industry.

At SBI Life, we are aligned with the

regulator’s vision and will continue

to focus on various reforms enabling

deeper penetration of the Life Insurer

Industry.

Yet another year of standout

performance

It gives me great pride to share with you

that SBI Life has been able to maintain

its leadership position in the private

life insurers space while creating value

for customers and other stakeholders.

With great delight, I place before you,

SBI Life Insurance Company Limited:

Dear stakeholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to

report to you that SBI Life continues

to deliver robust performance across

all key financial and non-financial

parameters. With India projected

to become the fifth-largest life

insurance market by 2032, we remain

favourably positioned to capitalise

on the immense growth opportunity

ahead. As one of India’s leading private

life insurers, we are committed to

delivering need-based solutions that

address the ever-evolving consumer

needs while contributing towards

realising the nation’s ambition of

‘Insurance for all’ by 2047.

Today, insurance features as a key

element for consumers to hedge life’s

uncertainties. Their choice of financial

as well as insurance products is guided

by their specific interests and needs.

As SBI Life's Financial Immunity Survey

2.0 suggests, more than 75% of Indians

believe insurance plays an essential

role in overall financial planning and

over 50% believe that 'Financial

Immunity' is necessary to secure the

financial future. Based on these needs

and demands from the customers and

further enhancing the product suite for

various life cycle needs the Company

has launched several products namely,

SBI Life-Smart Annuity Plus

with deferred annuity option,

SBI Life- Retire Smart Plus with

choice of 7 varied fund options,

SBI Life-Smart Lifetime Saver

guaranteed returns and protection for

a lifetime, and SBI Life-Group Micro

Shield Insurance, leading to financial

inclusion.

Robust performance

During FY23, we brought 20+ million

new lives under our insurance safety

net. Our Gross Written Premium (GWP)

came in at ₹673.16 billion, driven by a

17% y-o-y growth in First Year Premium

(FYP) and a 15% y-o-y increase in

Single Premium (SP). Our New Business

Premium (NBP) grew 16% y-o-y to

₹295.89 billion, while Individual NBP

rose 27% y-o-y to ₹209.06 billion. New

Business Margin expanded 420 bps to

30.1%. VoNB increased by 37% y-o-y to

₹50.67 billion. Our AUM continued to

record strong growth, crossing the ₹3

trillion milestone during the year under

review.

The strong premium growth, coupled

with our continued focus on improving

the quality of business, best-in-class

cost ratio, and improved persistency,

led to yet another impressive operating

year. Our 13th-month Persistency of

Regular premium/Limited Premium

Payment under the Individual

category stands at 85.5%, which

speaks volumes about the quality of

business and customer retention. We

maintained our cost efficiency at 9.6%.

Our solvency ratio remains strong at

2.15, above the regulatory minimum

of 1.5. Profit after tax (PAT) came in at

₹17.21 billion, up 14% y-o-y.
