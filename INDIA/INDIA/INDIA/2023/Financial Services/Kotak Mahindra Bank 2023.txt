Future

Ready

As the years roll on, the temptation to look at the rear view mirror

rather than the windshield in front increases for both the company

and the individual. And if the past has been positive, it is even more

so. Succumbing to that is dangerous. What matters is the road

ahead and it is important to sift the past between lessons and

baggage of history. Kotak is at one such juncture, where it has to

not only embrace the change, but accelerate it. At the same time,

Victor Hugo’s words ring a bell: “Change your opinions, keep your

principles; change your leaves, keep your roots intact.”

An institution has to outlive individuals, including those who

founded it. But like the water in an ocean, each contributory stream

collectively makes up the institution. It is this continuous ‘Manthan’

that strengthens the core. I look at Kotak as a constant confluence

of river waters, collaborating to build a sustainable ocean, aspiring

to live in perpetuity.

What does it take to build a sustainable institution for the future?

Product excellence, customer obsession and trust. We, at Kotak, are

in midst of this mindset shift for these priorities. We have moved in

part from the physical world to the ‘phygital’ (physical enabled by

digital) one.

We are now leap frogging to ‘digical’ (digital first supported by

physical), and soon, technology and AI may change this too. We

need to live with conflicting emotions of paranoia and excitement at

the same time.

For a long time, we believed that the best way to grow was to give

our internal people new opportunities. But when we got the banking

licence in 2003, we created a great blend by hiring experienced

bankers and our internal team of non-bankers to build the bank. We

are now looking at the new ‘compound’ required given the dynamic

transformation happening in the banking industry.

"What does it take to build a

sustainable institution for the

future? Product excellence, customer

obsession and trust. We, at Kotak,

are in midst of this mindset shift for

these priorities."

• Mr. C S Rajan (Non-Executive Director, Independent)

The CSR and ESG Committee has played a pivotal role in guiding

the Bank’s ESG strategy and driving action across the focus areas

of the ESG policy framework. The guidance from the Committee

has provided the Bank with a strong impetus and clear direction to

build and strengthen ESG-aligned practices in the short, medium

and long term. The ESG function at the Bank plays an important

role as the nodal team responsible for the overall implementation

of the ESG policy framework, review of ESG performance across

functions and communication of ESG progress through periodic

reports to internal and external stakeholders, including the

Board Committee. To help with the implementation of the ESG

policy framework, this nodal team has created an ESG task force

consisting of representatives from relevant functions and group

companies.

Furthermore, the Committee is responsible for overseeing the

development and implementation of the Bank’s ESG framework.

It provides strategic direction to the Bank’s ESG performance,

taking into consideration the relevant risks and opportunities. The

Committee also oversees compliance with applicable ESG-related

regulatory requirements, tracks progress against goals and

targets, as well as reviews the Bank’s ESG disclosures.

We have institutionalised an ESG policy framework to align our

business strategy, processes and disclosures with national and

international ESG standards and frameworks. The ESG policy

framework details the ESG focus areas identified through our

materiality assessment. The focus areas are:

‣

Corporate Governance

‣

Enhancing Customer Experience

‣

Creating an Empowered Workforce

‣

ESG integration in Risk Management

‣

Managing Climate Risk and Caring for the Environment

‣

Community Development

Detailed information regarding each of the listed areas of focus

can be accessed in our Environment, Social and Governance

Policy Framework document which came into effect from 1st

April, 2022. We have strengthened the relevant ESG-linked policies

and processes across the identified focus areas to facilitate

the organisational transformation to streamline and elevate

ESG integration across the organisation. We have identified key

performance indicators for each focus area to implement specific

projects in order to improve our ESG performance. This approach

has also enabled us to effectively monitor and report our ESG

performance on a periodic basis.

We endeavour to enhance value for our stakeholders by integrating

social and environmental considerations into our operational

and financial decision-making. We have initiated a structured

programme to raise awareness among our workforce on ESG

aspects and empower each of them to make a difference through

their professional pursuits. In FY 2022-23, we imparted training to

the first cohort of origination, underwriting and risk management

teams to help them appreciate the relevance of ESG aspects in their

area of work.

In FY 2022-23, we integrated a CoC for service providers in

our standard service contract format. This Code covers ESG

topics such as labour practices, ethics and anti-corruption and

environmental stewardship. The objective of incorporating this CoC

in contracts is to inform our service providers of the expected ESG

practices to be followed. In addition, we conducted an awareness

programme for our vendors wherein we shared information on the

basics of ESG, components of our CoC for service providers, and

industry best practices and provided recommendations to enhance

their processes and systems in the short and medium term.

We also engaged with regulatory bodies, industry associations

and think tanks to actively contribute to the formulation of policies

and regulations aiming to cultivate robust sustainability practices

in our industry. One such emergent association is the Climate

Finance Leadership Initiative (CFLI) India. Since 2021, we have been

a member of the CFLI India, a global initiative that brings together

leading institutions to build the momentum for mobilising private

capital for climate-related solutions. We are active members of

various working groups as part of our association with industry

bodies such as the Indian Banks’ Association, Confederation of

Indian Industry, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &

Industry, Sustainable Markets Initiative and CDP (formerly the

Carbon Disclosure Project). We are also a part of other associations

mentioned on page 355 of the BRSR disclosure of this Report. This

helps facilitate engagement with regulators, policymakers, clients,

peers and think tanks regularly and acts as a medium to discuss

and address industry-specific challenges.

The CSR and ESG Committee has played a pivotal role

in guiding the Bank’s ESG strategy and driving action

across the focus areas of the ESG policy framework.

spirit. This also helps exchange of views on best practices and to understand compliance risk across the group. Guidance or directions are extended

to the subsidiary companies Compliance Officers, keeping in the mind the overall responsibility of the Bank as the Holding Company. The Compliance

Function is responsible for all aspects of regulatory compliance across the Bank. Compliance is given utmost importance with the tone from the Top

and Senior Management of the Bank and subsidiaries are directly monitoring the same.

The compliance framework, approved by the Board, broadly sets out the compliance risk management processes and tools to be used by businesses,

management and Compliance Officers for managing its compliance risks. Apart from the Bank’s compliance framework, the Bank and all the

subsidiaries have their own operating procedures. The Compliance team supports top management and manages and supervises the compliance

framework along with providing compliance assistance to various businesses/support functions. The Bank has a Board approved New Products/

Process approval policy and all new products/processes or modifications to the existing product/processes are approved by Compliance by satisfying

that these products are compliant with not only various RBI regulations but that of the SEBI/IRDAI/PFRDA. As prescribed by the RBI, the Bank has

a system of compliance review of its new products within six months of its launch to satisfy that all the regulatory prescriptions have been adhered

to. These Review reports are issued to the concerned businesses/Product Heads.

The Compliance Department ensures that the applicable regulatory prescriptions apart from Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of

Terrorism/KYC aspects are dovetailed in to the new products/processes notes. Compliance Department senior executives are members of various

internal and external committees, which enable them to monitor the compliance risk of the institution effectively.

important compliance related matters through monthly, quarterly and annual compliance reviews.

Internal Controls

The Bank has put in place adequate internal controls, driven through various policies and procedures, which are reviewed periodically. Businesses

have an Internal Risk Control Unit or Internal Controls functions to assess the efficacy of the control designs placed to mitigate identified risks and

to identify new risks. Senior officers of the operating and business units, also monitor the mitigating measures taken.

The Bank has an Internal Audit (IA) function that is responsible for independently evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of all internal control

designs and implementation, risk management, governance systems and processes. IA is manned by appropriately skilled, experienced and qualified

personnel. This team of IA includes qualified Information technology, data security and cyber security related risks personnel as well.

The Internal Audit department and Compliance function ensure business units adhere to internal processes and procedures as well as to the

regulatory and legal requirements and provide timely feedback to Management for corrective action. The audit function also proactively recommends

improvements in operational processes and service quality, wherever necessary. The Bank takes corrective actions to minimise the design risk, if

any.

The IA department adopts a risk based audit approach in congruence to the RBI Guidelines on Risk Based Internal Audit (RBIA). Audits are conducted

across various businesses and functions i.e. Consumer, Commercial, Wholesale, Treasury (for domestic and overseas businesses). This include

audit of Operations units, Risk and Support functions, Information Security Audits, Information Technology audits, IT Governance and Infrastructure

audits etc. These are conducted to independently evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls on an ongoing basis and pro-actively

recommending enhancements thereof.

exception monitoring within IA. Further, using a risk based approach, critical units of the bank including retail branches are subjected to Independent

Concurrent Audit process in line with the RBI guidelines. These concurrent audits are conducted through reputed external CA/consultancy firms under

the supervision of IA team of the bank. The senior leadership and the Audit Committee of the Board regularly review the IA reports and concurrent

audit reports along with COM findings and their remediation.

and calendar. These reviews take into consideration the banks’ overall strategic plans, risk trends as well as risk classifications evaluated periodically

by the Strategy, Risk and Information Risk management functions of the bank.
