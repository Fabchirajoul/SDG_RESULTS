MANAGING DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE

Addressing the

growing needs

of India

I am deeply passionate about

empowering individuals and

turning their dreams of home

ownership into a reality. It is my

firm belief that owning a home

is not just a financial milestone

but a transformative experience

that brings stability, security, and

a sense of pride to individuals

and their families. And that’s

where I, as the new Managing

Director of the organisation,

sowed the seed of our growth,

driven by a deep understanding

of the market opportunities and a

strong commitment to providing

accessible housing finance

solutions at reasonable prices to

millions of individuals across India.

- Girish Kousgi: Managing

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

I am thrilled to present our

35th Annual Report, arriving

at a crucial juncture when

the global economy continues

to face umpteen challenges

since FY22, such as persistent

inflation, geo-political conflicts

and financial sector issues. In

the face of these formidable

obstacles, it is remarkable to

observe India’s resilience as it

continues to outperform many

developed economies. With its

substantial young population

and strong economic

foundations, our country is

primed for robust growth.

Having gained a profound

understanding of the real

estate sector, it is poised for

a period of steady growth

following a decade-long

contraction. The sector has

already begun its journey

towards recovery, which

is expected to persist and

further advance. According

to CRISIL, housing demand is

projected to exceed the levels

observed before the pandemic,

indicating the commencement

of a growth cycle.

The affordable housing

segment has emerged

as the key driver of

incremental growth,

with a remarkable 44%

year-on-year increase in

low-ticket housing loan

disbursements during

FY23. This growth is

primarily witnessed in

tier II cities and beyond,

reflecting the expanding

demand in these regions.

Ind AS 1 – Material accounting policies - The

amendments mainly related to shifting of disclosure
