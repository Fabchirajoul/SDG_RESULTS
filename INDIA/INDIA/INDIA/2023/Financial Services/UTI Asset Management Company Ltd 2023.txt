Dear Stakeholders,

It has been encouraging to see India

being resilient and demonstrating fortitude

despite the challenging situations for

the world economy. This can be directly

correlated to the foundation that the

Indian economy has built over the years.

India has proven to be a beacon of light

amidst the economies all around the

world navigating variety of challenges.

As India’s oldest and one of the largest

mutual fund houses, we are immensely

proud to extend our constant support

towards the growth of this dynamic

and vibrant marketplace. We believe

that inspite of significant challenges

in the global environment, India

continues to remain resilient and is on

its path to become one of the largest

economies in the world. And this will be

possible through its limitless potential

and prosperity driven by innovation,

entrepreneurship and a steadfast

commitment to progress.

today, it is encouraging

to see the growing

inclination of Indian

households towards

actively participating in

the dynamic financial

markets. And with the

expected growth of

middle-class population

in the near future, the

investor participation in

capital markets will only

increase further.

Leveraging the opportunities of the

industry, we take immense pride in the

growth of our strong retail base and

our successful presence in the B30

markets. This serves as a testament to

our commitment towards empowering

our investors and enabling them to make

the most of the opportunities that the

Indian markets offer. Our continued

efforts to adapt and innovate attract

significant strategic alliances while

enhancing our digital prowess as a

critical enabler of business growth.

Owing to the rising awareness of the

broader impact of business activities

in our society, we are also committed

to integrating ESG factors in the

investment decision-making process

and other operations through our

policy frameworks.

As I mentioned, India’s potential

has captivated investors across the

globe, who seek to participate in the

country’s phenomenal growth story.

This has created a vital opportunity

for the financial services industry

to drive its future in an accelerated

and sustainable manner. During this

journey, financial institutions in our

country are well-positioned to provide

the necessary support and infrastructure

for businesses to thrive.

I would like to take this opportunity to

express my gratitude to all our valued

stakeholders. Your support to the

Company has been invaluable.

I would also like to convey my

appreciation to our employees and I

am extremely proud of the team that

constantly strives to improve and add

value.

As we look forward, we believe the

Company’s three pillars – Conviction,

Capabilities and Commitment – will

continue to be the driving force

behind our success. I am confident

that a strong brand, our deep-rooted

experiences and commitment to

investors, will enable us to capitalise

on the opportunities and continue

to deliver long-term value for all our

stakeholders.

I extend my best wishes to all of you

and your families.

ANNuAl REpoRt 2022-23:

Dear Stakeholders,

Throughout the year, we have been

steadfast in our commitment as we

capitalised on opportunities to strengthen

our capabilities and build on our strong

foundation, solidifying our ability to

deliver with conviction. It is my privilege

to present to you, our Company’s Annual

Report for FY 2022-23.

Reflecting on the Year Gone by

The last financial year can be considered

among the most eventful years from a

global economic standpoint. Various

factors ranging from geopolitical

tensions, rising interest rates, supply

chain disruptions, and technological

innovations were influential in shaping

the year’s prospects.

However, India’s robustness ensured that

we successfully navigated the challenges

and continued to progress as the fastest-

growing major economy. The promising

Union Budget and the unwavering

support from the Government reflects the

prevailing sentiment around the nation’s

growth as India continues to occupy an

increasingly significant position in the

global economic landscape.

The growing accessibility of the financial

markets, over the last few years has

primarily contributed towards the

growing inflow of participants, directly

benefitting the financial community. A

growing awareness around the diverse

array of financial products available

has fuelled the expansion of India’s

investment journey.

Growth of the Mutual Fund

Industry

India’s potential has extended its reach

and has also translated into growth of

the Mutual Fund industry over the last

districts in the country, placing us as a

preferred option among retail investors.

Furthermore, we have a vast reach

through our broad network of 166 UTI

Financial Centres (UFCs) spread across

the country.

Our Company’s Quarterly Average

Asset Under Management (QAAUM)

stood at ₹ 2.39 lakh crore for the

Mutual Fund business, while the Group

AUM for UTI AMC reached ₹ 15.56

lakh crore as of 31st March, 2023.

Retirement Solutions Business

As far as the performance of the

subsidiaries is concerned, during

FY 2022-23, UTI Retirement Solutions

Limited (UTI RSL) experienced

an increase in its Assets Under

Management (AUM) to ₹ 2.41 lakh

crore amounting to a growth of

19.21% over the financial year, holding

a market share of 26.78% in the

NPS sector and aims to continue its

growth. To support this goal, we are

in the process of implementing several

strategic business plans.
