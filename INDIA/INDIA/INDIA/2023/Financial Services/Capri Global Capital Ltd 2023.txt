THROUGH OUR

JUDICIOUS

DECISION-MAKING

REVOLUTIONISING CREDIT

CHANGING LIVES…: Dear Shareholders,

It is my pleasure to present the Annual Report for

the year ended March 31, 2023. I feel optimistic

about the future of CGCL and am confident that

we will continue to innovate new ways to make

credit easily accessible to those in need.

We believe in the quote “Times and conditions

change so rapidly that we must keep our aim

constantly focused on the future.” At CGCL, we

have been at the forefront of revolutionising the

credit landscape in India and will continue to

do so with superior zest. We are committed to

enriching the customer experience, no matter

how challenging the environment is.

FY2023 – A YEAR OF UPS

AND DOWNS

The year 2023 was marked by severe inflationary

pressure, geopolitical unrest and the resurgence

of Covid-19 variants, especially in China. Despite

this, several economies emerged successful in

grappling with these challenges, bolstered by

stronger-than-expected private consumption

and investment amid tight labour markets. The

start of 2023 looks promising, with fiscal support,

increased spending on pent-up demand and a

positive business environment with supply-side

bottlenecks beginning to ease. India is set to

remain one of the fastest-growing economies

in the world, with strong fiscal, monetary and

budgetary interventions expected to keep the

country on track to become a $5 Trillion economy

by 2027. This was further re-emphasised by the

Indian government in the Union Budget 2023-24.
