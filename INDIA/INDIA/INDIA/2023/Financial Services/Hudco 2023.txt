Dear Shareholders, Ladies & Gentlemen,

The world is witness to India’s resurgent growth story. Amidst the heightened global economic uncertainty where the global growth

is likely to bottom out at around 3.0 per cent in 2023-24, India continues to remain a ‘bright spot’ as the fastest growing economy

in the world and on track to be the 3rd largest economy by financial year 2028. Though the global pandemic largely receded by the

onset of financial year 2022-23, the twin impacts of geo-political tensions arising out of Russia-Ukraine war and emergence of global

inflationary pressure posed hurdles and uncertainties to the global economic growth during financial year 2022-23. The interest rates

were seen moving up as major central banks, including Reserve Bank of India (RBI) resorted to hiking the policy rates to combat

inflation, pushing up domestic lending and borrowing rates. However, your Company successfully navigated through this uncertain

business environment during financial year 2022-23, by registering overall loan sanctions of `24,572 crore and disbursements of

` 8,466 crore during the financial year.

I would like to share the highlights of HUDCO’s performance during financial year 2022-23, vis-à-vis the economic environment,

challenges faced and future outlook of the Company, which would clearly demonstrate that your Company is on a high growth path

in its continued efforts for building assets for the nation.

1.

Economic Environment

India’s growth momentum would continue to be the fastest in the next two years as per IMF-World Economic Outlook Update Report,

July 2023, with the highest growth rate of 6.1 per cent in 2023-24 and 6.3 per cent in next fiscal. As per latest data released by

National Statistical Office (NSO), the estimated growth in real GDP during 2022-23 was 7.2 per cent (Provisional estimates of national

income for 2022-23, dated 31st May 2023). Growth was supported by a visible pick-up in the services sector. The disaggregated data

showed that the Q1, Q2, Q3 & Q4 GDP had grown by 13.1%, 6.2%, 4.5% & 6.1% respectively in 2022-23, particularly the Q4 growth

was better-than-expected.

During the financial year 2022-23, RBI raised the policy repo rate six times between May 2022 and February 2023, from 4% to 6.5%

to subdue the inflationary pressures. This resulted in a high interest regime in the domestic economy posing challenges to domestic

growth prospects. Further, as per RBI’s latest monetary statement (June 2023), the GDP growth is likely to be 6.5 percent this fiscal

on the back of supportive domestic demand conditions. This is indicative of India’s continued economic resilience and strong macro-

economic fundamentals.

2.

Sectoral Overview and Government Policy Initiatives

One of the key reasons for India’s sustained growth is the contineous investment in real estate sector with its strong income and

employment multiplier effects through ‘forward’ and ‘backward’ linkages with other industries in the economy. The Govt. of India’s

focus on ‘infrastructure-led economic growth’ is further outlined through Union Budget 2023-24, with capital investment outlay for

infrastructure has been increased by 33% to `10 lakh crore, which is 3.3 per cent of GDP. States and cities will be encouraged

to undertake urban planning reforms and actions to transform cities into ‘sustainable cities of tomorrow’. Through property tax

governance reforms and ring-fencing user charges on urban infrastructure, cities will be incentivized to improve their credit worthiness

for Municipal Bonds. Further, similar to the RIDF, an Urban Infrastructure Development Fund (UIDF), through use of priority sector

lending shortfall, has been established and being managed by the National Housing Bank, which will be used by public agencies to

create urban infrastructure in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. The outlay for Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) has been enhanced by 66

per cent to over `79,000 crore (Union Budget speech 2023-24).

3.

Emerging Issues in Sustainable Urbanisation, Housing and Urban Infrastructure

India holds the current Presidency of economically powerful G20 countries. Adopting the Indian philosophy of “Vasudhaiva

Kutumbakam”- One Earth One Family One Future, the G20 Presidency provides a strong platform for furthering our resolve to

achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the defined timeline of 2030, particularly sustainable urbanization,

resilient infrastructure development, addressing climate change, green economic growth and transformative habitat development

through 5 key pillars: Finance, Technology, Inclusion, Partnerships and Capacity Building. Further, various available data and

Reports, such as World Bank Report, NIP Report, etc., point towards a sustained increase in urbanisation level and consequent:
