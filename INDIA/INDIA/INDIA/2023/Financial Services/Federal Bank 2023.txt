Dear Stakeholders,

I am deeply honoured to have received the opportunity to lead

a dedicated organisation such as Federal Bank on its course be

‘The Most Admired Bank’. In my first year as the Chairman of

Federal Bank, I take great pleasure in presenting the Annual

Report for the fiscal year 2022-23.

Allow me to emphasise the paramount importance Federal

Bank places on the relationships we forge with our esteemed

customers and other stakeholders. Driven by an unwavering

dedication to serve the nation’s growing population, your

Bank has wholeheartedly embraced the global wave of digital

transformation, expanding its offerings to meet the demands

of an ever-evolving landscape.

Reflecting on the macroeconomic landscape of FY 2022-23, it

is evident that the Indian economy has demonstrated resilience

and agility in navigating uncharted waters. Despite formidable

obstacles such as geopolitical tensions, escalating inflation,

and disruptions in supply chains, policymakers demonstrated

resolute determination to steer us through these testing

times and alleviate their repercussions by maintaining

financial stability through prudent measures and effective

communication.

Notably, the Indian economy is rebounding strongly and

becoming one of the fastest-growing large economies.

The conducive economic climate fostered by India has

attracted investments from across the globe, underscoring

the nation’s appeal as an investment destination. Moreover,

the strengthened indigenous capabilities of our nation have

diminished reliance on global economic counterparts, further

boosting our self-sufficiency.

Ignited by this ‘India Positive’ story, your Bank continues to soar

on an upward trajectory, concluding yet another triumphant

year. Grounded in the philosophy of ‘Digital at the Fore, Human

at the Core,’ your Bank leverages the power of technology, while

cherishing the essence of human connections. The relationship

campaign ‘Rista App Se Hai, Sirf App Se Nahi’ which was launched

recently is demonstrative of the same. The aim is to capture

the essence of humanised banking in digital format through

the implementation of various digital transformation initiatives,

harnessing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI),

Machine Learning (ML), and Robotic Process Automation (RPA).

Additionally, your Bank’s relentless enhancement of analytical

capabilities has played a crucial role in gaining valuable insights

into customer behaviour and significant trends. As a result, your

Bank could create tailored products and deliver an unparalleled

personalised experience to our customers.

Managing diRectoR & ceo, wHole

tiMe diRectoRs and MateRial Risk takeRs (MRts)

The compensation paid out to the referred functionaries is

divided into two components:

The fixed compensation is determined based on the relevant

factors such as industry standards, the exposure, skill sets,

talent and qualification attained by the official over his/her

career span and adherence to statutory requirements. All the

fixed items of compensation, including the perquisites, will be

treated as part of fixed pay. Perquisites that are reimbursable

would also be included in the fixed pay so long as there are

monetary ceilings on these reimbursements. Contributions

towards superannuation/retiral benefits will also be treated as

part of fixed pay. (Approval from RBI to be taken as per section

35B of the Banking Regulation Act while deciding the fixed and

variable compensation part for: Managing

Managing director & ceo, whole time directors and Material

Risk takers (MRts): In order to have a proper balance between

fixed pay and variable pay, at least 50% of the total compensation

would be variable. Deferral arrangements would invariably exist

for the variable pay, regardless of the quantum of pay. For such

executives of the Bank, a minimum of 60% of the total variable

pay must invariably be under deferral arrangements. Further,

if cash component is part of variable pay, at least 50% of the

cash bonus would also be deferred. However, in cases where

the cash component of variable pay is under ` 25 Lakh, deferral

requirements would not be necessary. The deferral period

would be minimum of three years.

Risk control and compliance staff: At least 25% of the total

compensation would be variable and the total variable pay will

be limited to a maximum of 100% of the fixed pay (for the relative

performance measurement period). Deferral arrangements

would invariably exist for the variable pay, if the Variable Pay

exceeds 75% of the fixed pay. In such cases a minimum of

60% of the total variable pay must invariably be under deferral

arrangements. Further, if cash component is part of variable

pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus would also be deferred.

However, in cases where the cash component of variable pay is

under ` 25 Lakh, deferral requirements would not be necessary.

other categories of staff: The variable pay would be in the

form of cash, share-linked instruments, or a mix of both cash

and share-linked instruments. The total variable pay will be

limited to a maximum of 300% of the fixed pay (for the relative

performance measurement period). Deferral arrangements

would invariably exist for the variable pay, if the Variable Pay

exceeds 200% of the fixed pay. In such cases a minimum of

60% of the total variable pay must invariably be under deferral

arrangements. Further, if cash component is part of variable

pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus would also be deferred.

However, in cases where the cash component of variable pay is

under ` 25 Lakh, deferral requirements would not be necessary.

seveRance Pay and guaRanteed Bonus

Severance pay (other than gratuity or terminal entitlements or

as entitled by statute) is not paid to any official of the Bank.

Guaranteed Bonus on joining in the form of Cash/equities/

deposits/ bonds/debentures etc. or multiyear guaranteed bonus

(like retainer fees) is not paid to any official in the organisation.

However, to attract talent, sign on bonus or joining bonus can

be paid, but this will be limited to the first year only and it will be

given as Employee Stock Options only.

Hedging

No compensation scheme or insurance facility would be provided

by the Bank to employees to hedge their compensation structure

to offset the risk alignment mechanism (deferral pay and claw back

arrangements) embedded in their compensation arrangement.

Compliance arrangements are in place to ensure that employees

do not insure or hedge their compensation structure.

Malus / claw Back aRRangeMent

The variable compensation is covered under Malus / Claw

back arrangements in case of all categories of employees. In

the event of subdued or negative contributions of the Bank

and/or the relevant line of business in any year, the deferred

compensation will be subjected to:

•

Malus arrangement wherein Bank shall withhold vesting

of all or part of the amount of deferred remuneration.

•

Claw back arrangement wherein the employees shall be

liable to return previously paid or vested remuneration to

the Bank. The deferred compensation, if any, paid to such

functionaries shall be subject to Claw back arrangements,

which will entail the Bank to recover proportionate amount

of variable compensation from such functionaries, on

account of an act or decision taken by the official which

has brought forth a negative contribution to the Bank at a

prospective stage.

The malus and claw back provisions would cover the deferral and

retention periods. If an Official covered under these provisions

is responsible for any act or omission or non-compliance of

regulatory guidelines resulting in a penalty being imposed by

any Regulators or engages in a detrimental conduct, the Bank

would be entitled to recover proportionate amount of variable

compensation from such functionaries within 48 months from

the date of payment/vesting of variable compensation. The

Bank has put in place appropriate modalities, performance

thresholds and detailed framework to cover the trigger points

with or invoking malus/claw back, taking into account relevant

statutory and regulatory stipulations, as applicable.

Fixed assets are carried at cost of acquisition less

accumulated depreciation, amortisation and impairment,

if any. Cost includes cost of purchase and all expenditure

like freight, duties, taxes and incidental expenses related

to the acquisition and installation of the asset before it is

ready to use. Taxes like GST paid on Fixed assets wherever

eligible are availed as ITC as per GST rules. Subsequent

expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised

only when it increases the future economic benefit /

paid to acquire fixed assets.

Depreciation on fixed assets, including amortisation of

Premises are depreciated under the written

down value method, using the same useful life

as in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.

Improvements to leased Premises are depreciated

over lower of lease term or 5 years based on

technical evaluation.

•

Depreciation on premises revalued has been charged

on their written-down value including the addition

made on revaluation.

•

Assets individually costing ` 2,000/- or less are fully

depreciated in the year of purchase.

The management believes that the useful life of assets

assessed by the Bank, pursuant to Part C of Schedule II

to the Companies Act, 2013, taking into account changes

in environment, changes in technology, the utility and

efficacy of the asset in use, fairly reflects its estimate of

useful lives of the fixed assets. The estimated useful lives

STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023 (Contd.):

Managing Director & Chief

Executive Officer and Material Risk Takers is fixed based on organisational performance (both business-unit

and firm-wide) and KPAs set for the official. The organisation’s performance is charted based on Performance

Scorecard which takes into account various financial indicators like revenue earned, cost incurred, profit earned,

NPA position and other intangible factors like leadership and employee development. The Scorecard provides

a mix of Financial and Non-Financial, Quantitative and Qualitative Metrics. Additionally, serious supervisory

observations (if any) are also factored. The variable pay is paid in the form of share-linked instruments, or a mix

of cash and share-linked instruments.

Risk, control and compliance Staff: Members of staff engaged in financial and risk control, including internal audit,

are compensated in a manner that is independent of the business areas they oversee and commensurate with their

key role in the Bank. The total fixed and variable compensation paid out to the employees in the Risk Control and

Compliance Function is decided independent of business parameters. The mix of fixed and variable compensation for

control function personnel is weighted in favour of fixed compensation, to ensure autonomy and independence from

business goals.
