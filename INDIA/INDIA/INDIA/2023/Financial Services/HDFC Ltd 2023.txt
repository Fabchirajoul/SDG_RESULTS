LETTER

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

When I wrote to you last year, we had just commenced our journey of working towards the merger

of HDFC and HDFC Bank. Financial year 2023 marked a year of many happenings. We have been

working relentlessly on the merger, whilst continuing to focus on ‘business as usual’ in a global

macro-economic environment that has been exceptionally volatile.

The optimism on India continues with renewed vigour. The country has demonstrated resilience

with its broad-based recovery. India’s position has been further strengthened with cyclical and

structural tailwinds. The country’s GDP growth rate is likely to be more than double that of global

growth. We are extremely confident that the runway for housing finance in India will remain

immense for several years to come.

During the year, we have made substantial progress on the merger. Personally, if I were to

summarise the year in one word, it would be ‘gratitude’.

When we announced the merger, we knew we had hard deadlines to meet and a maze of complex

transactions to navigate through. Being one of the world’s largest merger announcements in recent

times, each milestone has been closely followed by all stakeholders. We have been unwavering

in our commitment of being transparent throughout this process and have engaged deeply with

our stakeholders to keep them abreast of the progress of the merger.

Working on a merger of this scale has been challenging and rewarding. Encountering hurdles is

par for the course in such transactions. Yet, what amazed us the most has been the immense

goodwill and strong relationships that HDFC as a group has. Whenever and wherever we reached

out for guidance, doors opened and help was at hand instantly. We have worked with possibly the

country’s best legal teams, chartered accountants, valuers, bankers, advisors and other specialised

professionals. The collective knowledge and experience of all these parties is unparalleled.

The approvals by the Competition Commission of India, the National Company Law Tribunal, the

shareholders and the regulators were important merger milestones. In all our dealings pertaining

to the merger, the HDFC group has been treated in a fair and just manner. We stand committed

to adhering to the prerequisites as stipulated by the regulators, respecting the fact that these

decisions are made keeping in mind the best interests of the Indian financial ecosystem.:

Credit Risk Assessment Methodology

Corporate Portfolio

The Corporation has an established credit appraisal procedure which has been detailed in Corporate Loans

Policy and Developer Loans Policy respectively. The policies outline appraisal norms including assessment of

quantitative and qualitative parameters along with guidelines for various products. The policy also includes

process for approval of Loans which are subject to review and approval by Sanctioning Committees.

Corporation carries out a detailed analysis of funding requirements, including normal capital expenses, long-term

working capital requirements and temporary imbalances in liquidity. A significant portion of Corporate Finance

loans are secured by a lien over appropriate assets of the borrower.

Borrower risk is evaluated by considering:

•

the risks and prospects associated with the industry in which the borrower is operating (industry risk);

•

the financial position of the borrower by analysing the quality of its financial statements, its past financial

performance, its financial flexibility interms of ability to raise capital and its cash flow adequacy (financial

risk);

•

the borrower’s relative market position and operating efficiency (business risk);

•

the quality of management by analysing their track record, payment record and financial conservatism

(management risk); and

•

the risks with respect to specific projects, both pre-implementation, such as construction risk and funding

risk, as well as post-implementation risks such as industry, business, financial and management risks

related to the project (project risk).

Restructuring, ECLGS and Moratorium Guidelines issued by RBI are adopted for loans on a selective basis, after

assessing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their businesses.

Lease Rental Discounting

Loan is given against assured sum of rentals/receivables. The risk assessment procedure include:

•

carrying out a detailed evaluation of terms of Lease / Leave and License Agreements such as lease rental

receivables, term of the leases and periodicity of rentals.

•

conducting due diligence on and appraisal of Borrowers / Lessors and Lessees a including due

diligence of project/property. These Loans are secured by project property and serviced from rentals/

receivables.:

letter of intent is issued to the

borrower, which outlines the principal financial terms of the proposed facility, sponsor obligations, conditions

precedent to disbursement, undertakings from and covenants on the borrower.

After completion of all formalities by the borrower, a loan agreement is entered into with the borrower.

Project finance loans are generally fully secured and have full recourse against the borrower. In most cases,

the Corporation has a security interest and first lien on all the fixed assets. Security interests typically include

property, plant and equipment as well as other tangible assets of the borrower, both present and future. The

Corporation also takes additional credit comforts such as corporate or personal guarantees from one or more

sponsors of the project.

The Corporation requires the borrower to submit periodic reports and continue to monitor the credit exposure

until loans are fully repaid.

Further since both Lease Rental Discounting and Construction Finance Facilities are mostly serviced from

receivables from the projects/property financed, all the cash flows are charged to the Corporation, and are ring

fenced by way of Escrow mechanism. Under this mechanism all such receivables flow into Escrow Account from

where amounts are directly credited into the Corporation’s account.

During the year, additional credit checks were introduced in the non-retail policy in accordance with certain

regulatory measures announced by RBI to mitigate the burden of debt servicing as a result of disruptions in cash

flow due to the COVID -19 pandemic.

Restructuring of Accounts

The economic fallout on account of COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant financial stress for many borrowers.

Considering the above, with the intent to facilitate revival and to mitigate the impact on ultimate borrowers,

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) introduced measures under the Resolution Framework for COVID-19. As per the RBI

Framework, the Corporation established a policy to provide resolution for eligible borrowers having stress on

account of COVID-19 in line with the RBI Guidelines.

As advised under the said circular and Corporation’s policy, the eligibility of customers was assessed, so as to

understand the extent of financial stress caused due to COVID-19, i.e delay in construction, sales and consequent

cash flow mismatch, duly supported by the documentary evidence. In addition to assessing the impact of stress,

the Resolution framework was discussed with the eligible borrower and existing lenders (in case of multiple

lenders) prior to invocation of Resolution plan. The Resolution Framework offered to ensure that the servicing

of the restructured loan is not likely to be impacted. The implementation of Resolution plan is under process for

respective accounts in line with the time lines prescribed in the said Circular.

ECLGS

During the current year, the Government of India through Ministry of Finance, Department of Financial Services,

had introduced the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), for providing 100% guarantee coverage:

letter dated October 13, 2022 have approved the aforesaid scheme of amalgamation and

the scheme is effective date from end of day of October 14, 2022

51.
