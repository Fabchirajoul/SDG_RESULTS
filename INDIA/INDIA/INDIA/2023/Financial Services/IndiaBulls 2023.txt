letter) of

properties have been issued to the customers and substantial sales consideration is received from the customers.

The Group considers the terms of the contract and its customary business practices to determine the transaction

price. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange

for transferring property to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example,

indirect taxes). The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed consideration, variable

consideration (if reversal is less likely in future), or both.

For each performance obligation identified, the Group determines at contract inception whether it satisfies the

performance obligation over time or satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time. If an entity does not

satisfy a performance obligation over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. A receivable is

recognised by the Group when the properties are handed over as this is the case of point in time recognition where

consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required.

When either party to a contract has performed, an entity shall present the contract in the balance sheet as a

contract asset or a contract liability, depending on the relationship between the entity’s performance and the

customer’s payment.

The costs estimates are reviewed periodically and effect of any change in such estimate is recognized in the period

such changes are determined. However, when the total project cost is estimated to exceed total revenues from the

project, the loss is recognized immediately.

Revenue from air transport services

Revenue from air transportation services is recognised in the year in which the service has been rendered, and

billed as per terms of contract / arrangements with customers, provided that collection is reasonably certain.
