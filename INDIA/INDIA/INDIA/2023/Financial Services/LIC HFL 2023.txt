Dear Shareholders,

As I sit down to write my: letter to shareholders as the

Dear Shareholders,

We are delighted to communicate with you through the

Annual Report. With a vintage of over 34 years, LIC Housing

Finance Limited is consolidating its position as the largest

housing finance company in India.

FY 2022-23 was also a year of great change. We started

the year on the backdrop of optimism and anticipation in

the real estate sector, triggered by positive macroeconomic

developments. These developments augur well for India’s

housing finance industry, but more importantly, for greater

home ownership. Our motto of Home Delivery of Home Loans

drives us every single day to improve customer experience

and delight them with doorstep services.

Also, after interest rates increased sharply this year, with the

RBI hiking repo rate by 250 bps in the current rate hike cycle,

interest rates appear to have peaked and stabilised. A steady

interest rate regime further induces affordability and drives

down the cost of owning a home.

INDUSTRY SCENARIO IN FY 2022-23

After the pandemic-induced spell, the real estate industry

bounced back strongly due to government’s focus on

affordable housing and various policy initiatives. In fact, the

real estate sector is expected to grow further to attain a

market size of US$ 1 trillion by 2030 and account for 18-20%

of India’s GDP.

The residential real estate market picked up as well, and

witnessed astounding progress in CY2022, aided by pent-up

demand and demonstrating its prominence as one of India’s

fastest growing industries. All the real estate verticals

(Residential, Commercial, Retail and Warehousing) are coming

out of a prolonged downcycle. The government’s huge push to

infrastructure will continue to be a key positive for the Indian

real estate market, resulting in more buoyancy for the housing

finance sector.

Demand for housing and home finance is expected to sustain,

aided by a positive interest rate trajectory. Rate hike is said

to have had no material impact on demand for home loans.

On the contrary, the policy initiatives have resulted a surge in

the demand for affordable housing. Tier 2/3 cities witnessed

tremendous growth in demand for home loans, in the

post-Covid scenario and with the “Work from Home” trend, it

supported in putting the sector back on the growth trajectory.

At LIC Housing Finance Limited, we are poised to leverage this

growing opportunity of the rising demand for home finance.

The industry is also upbeat on the back of an increasing desire

for home ownership. Aspiration levels to own a home continue

to be high and demand is picking up in the mid-segment too.

In fact, with new projects getting launched in the real estate

market, there is a gradual increase in demand for finance from

project developers too.

A ROBUST BALANCE SHEET AND A STRONG

CAPITAL BASE

In the fiscal year 2022-23, a steady growth was witnessed

in the outstanding loan portfolio and disbursement.

Asset quality also displayed stability with further improvement.

Affordable Housing segment contributed the highest to our

total book size – at 70% of total disbursement.

Total Disbursements stood at ` 64,115 crore, up 4% from

` 61,847 crore in the earlier fiscal year. Of this, the Individual

Home Loan Segment registered disbursement of ` 53,459

crore from ` 53,662 crore, whereas total disbursements under

Project Loans stood at ` 2,697 crore, a growth of 106% from

` 1,312 crore in the previous year.

Revenue from Operations stood at ` 22,656.95 crore, up nearly

14% from ` 19,919.07 crore. Profit After Tax was recorded

at ` 2,891.03 crore, a growth of 26% from ` 2,287.28 crore.

Net Interest Income (NII) for 12 months was up by 14.86% at

` 6,330.26 crore, while Net Interest Margin (NIM) stood at

2.41% vs 2.28% for the previous year. During the year 2022-23,

the Board recommended a dividend of 425%.

LIC HFL NEXT

To address the changing needs of the market, a major

reorganisation is underway in the way we operate, with a

stringent focus on improving organisational capability

and vitality and delivering sustained value to all our

stakeholders – Customers, Investors, Employees and the

Society. As part of our stated plan for this reorganisation and

transformation and to make LIC Housing Finance Limited

even ready for the future, we follow a motto of

segment of providing loans for purchase, construction,

Standard (Ind AS) 108 on ‘Segment Reporting’.

3.

KEY ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS:

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity

with Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) requires

the management to make estimates, judgements

and assumptions. These estimates, judgements and

assumptions affect the application of accounting policies

and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,

the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at

the date of the financial statements and the reported

amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.

Accounting estimates could change from period to

period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised

prospectively. The Management believes that the

estimates used in preparation of the financial statements

are prudent and reasonable. Future results could differ due

to these estimates and the differences between the actual

results and the estimates are recognised in the periods in

which the results are known / materialise.

3.1 Determination of Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”)

The measurement of impairment losses (ECL) across

all categories of financial assets requires judgement, in

particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of

future cash flows based on Company’s historical experience

and collateral values when determining impairment losses

along with the assessment of a significant increase in credit

risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors,

changes in which can result in different levels of allowances.

Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting

judgements and estimates include:

Bifurcation of the financial assets into different

portfolios when ECL is assessed on collective basis.

Company’s criteria for assessing if there has been a

significant increase in credit risk.

Development of ECL models, including choice of

inputs / assumptions used.

The various inputs used and process followed by the

Company in measurement of ECL has been detailed

in Note 37.4.2.3

3.2 Fair Value Measurements

In case of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded

or disclosed in financial statements the company uses

the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or

based on inputs which are observable either directly or

indirectly for determining the fair value. However in certain

cases, the Company adopts valuation techniques and

inputs which are not based on market data. When Market

observable information is not available, the Company has:

Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Act, 2020 (3 of 2020) the Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Rules, 2020 for all those assessment
