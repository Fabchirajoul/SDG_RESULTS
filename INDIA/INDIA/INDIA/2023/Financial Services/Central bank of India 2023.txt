Executive Director (w.e.f. 01.12.2022):

Dear Stakeholders,

I am delighted to present the Annual Report of your

Bank for Financial Year (FY) 2022-23. This year has

been a remarkable year for the Bank and Bank has

come out from RBI’s PCA framework in the month of

September, 2022.

We emerged more resilient and reinvigorated, and our

confidence in our capabilities is reflected not only in

our numbers but also in the trust that our customers

have placed in us. I am grateful to our customers,

partners, team members, and other stakeholders for

their relentless collaboration to make this happen. I am

presenting here highlights of the performance of our

Bank for FY 2022-23.

Economic Outlook

The year 2022-23 was full of volatility across the

world with global economy experiencing several

shocks. Central banks across advanced and emerging

economies raised interest rates slowing down the global

economy. Indian economy has remained resilient with

robust domestic demand. Service sector continued to

register strong growth while manufacturing suffered a

setback due to global slowdown and high commodity

prices prevalent during the year. Inflation remains still a

concern for most Advanced Countries (AEs). However, series

of mid-size bank failures in US has signaled that central

banks might shift their stance towards pause of policy rates.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report released in

April 2023, revised down the growth of the global economy

to 2.8% in 2022 and 3.0 % in 2024. AEs have slowed down

due to series of rate hikes to tackle sticky inflation. Global

inflation is expected to moderate slowly to 7.0 % in 2023

from 8.7 % in 2022 and further to 4.9 % in 2024.

AEs as a whole are expected to grow by 1.3 % in the year

2023, 140 basis points lower than the growth recorded in

the year 2022. The growth rate of Euro area is expected

to be 0.8 % while UK economy will contract by 0.3 % in

2023. Japan is estimated to grow at 1.3 % in 2023 after

rebounding from technical recession in the year 2022.

The Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs)

share in the world GDP is 58.3% and among these, China

and India accounts for 18.5 %and 7.3 % share, respectively,

for the year 2022. Russia is expected to report 0.7 %

growth in year 2023. India is identified as a “bright spot” in

the world economy and a key contributor to global growth

in the coming years. Indian economy is projected to grow at

5.9 % in 2023 by IMF.

No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020

(as amended) (the “RBI communication”)

1.

We have audited the internal financial controls over

financial reporting of Central Bank of India (“the Bank”)

as at March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of

the standalone financial statements of the Bank for the

year ended on that date which includes internal financial

controls over financial reporting of the Bank’s branches.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal

Financial Controls

2.

The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing

and maintaining internal financial controls based on

the internal control over financial reporting criteria

established by the Bank considering the essential

components of internal control stated in the Guidance

Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered

Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the

design, implementation and maintenance of adequate

internal financial controls that were operating effectively

for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its

business, including adherence to the Bank’s policies, the

safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection

of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness

of the accounting records, and the timely preparation

of reliable financial information, as required under the

Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the circulars and

guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

Auditor’s Responsibility

3.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s

internal financial controls over financial reporting based

on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with

the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls

Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued

by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the

“ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by

the ICAI, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal

financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance

Note require that we comply with ethical requirements

and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable

assurance about whether adequate internal financial

controls over financial reporting were established and

maintained and if such controls operated effectively in

all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit

evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial

controls over financial reporting and their operating

effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over

financial reporting included obtaining an understanding

of internal financial controls over financial reporting,

assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,

and testing and evaluating the design and operating

effectiveness of internal financial controls based on the

assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the

auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the

risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial

statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained

and the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors,

in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters

paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide

a basis for our audit opinion on the Bank’s internal

financial controls over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting

4.

A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial

reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable

assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting

and the preparation of standalone financial statements

for external purposes in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal

financial controls over financial reporting includes

those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the

maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,

accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide

reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded

as necessary to permit preparation of standalone

financial statements in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles, and that receipts

and expenditures of the Bank are being made only in

accordance with authorisations of management and

directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable

assurance regarding prevention or timely detection

of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the

Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the

standalone financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting

5.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial

controls over financial reporting, including the possibility

of collusion or improper management override of

controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud

may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any:

but is not recognised because:

i.

it is not probable that an outflow of resources

embodying economic benefits will be required

to settle the obligation; or

ii.

a reliable estimate of the amount of obligation

cannot be made.

Such obligations are recorded as contingent liabilities.

These are assessed at regular intervals and only that

part of the obligation for which an outflow of resources

embodying economic benefits is probable, is provided

for, except in the extremely rare circumstances where

no reliable estimate can be made.

16 Earnings per Share:

a)

The Bank reports basic and diluted earnings

per share in accordance with AS 20 – “Earnings

per Share” issued by the Institute of Chartered

Accountants of India. Basic Earnings per Share

is computed by dividing the Net Profit after Tax

for the year attributable to equity shareholders

by the weighted average number of equity shares

outstanding during the year.

b)

Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential

dilution that could occur if securities or other

contracts to issue equity shares were exercised

or converted during the year. Diluted earnings per

equity share is calculated by using the weighted

average number of equity shares and dilutive

potential equity shares outstanding during the year.:
