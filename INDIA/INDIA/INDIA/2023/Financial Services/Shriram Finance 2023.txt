pillars to excel in our journey. For that, I, on

behalf of the whole Shriram Finance team like to

express our sincere gratitude towards them. Hope

The efficient functioning of our Company is further

supported by various committees constituted by the Board

enhancement, assist management in decision-making and

prudent financial management and uphold the principles of

transparency and excellence in corporate governance.

Additionally, SFL requires annual declarations from

applicable laws and regulations and fostering a culture of

integrity and professionalism.

corruption, and we have implemented robust policies

and procedures to prevent such practices. Our Business

Responsibility Policy and Code of Conduct strictly prohibit

our Company and our employees from engaging in abusive,

corrupt, or anti-competitive activities. We are committed

to upholding ethical standards and promoting fair business

practices in all our operations.

At SFL, we have implemented a robust grievance redressal

mechanism to address complaints and grievances from

our various stakeholder groups, including communities,

Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the BRSR report for Shriram Finance Limited (SFL), a leading retail NBFC committed to driving

positive change in our society and environment. Our range of credit solutions includes commercial vehicles, two-wheeler

loans, car loans, home loans, gold loans, personal loans, and small business loans.

We recognise that we have the dual responsibility of ensuring sustainable finance and protect the environment in our day-

to-day activities. To that end, as a corporate entity, we are committed to extend financial assistance for vehicles that are

run on alternate fuels and have also implemented stringent policies that prohibit financing vehicles older than 12 years.

Additionally, we have transitioned to digital processes to reduce paper wastage and embraced energy-efficient lighting

fixtures and gadgets to conserve energy. Water-saving measures such as sensor-based taps and water harvesting have also

been adopted to minimize water wastage.

At SFL, we understand the significance of social responsibility and the impact of communities on our shared future. To this

end, we have undertaken initiatives to support education, healthcare, and skill development for underprivileged sections

of society. We are proud to announce that we have provided scholarships to more than 2,45,000 underprivileged children

from various regions in the country. Furthermore, our preventive healthcare program for truckers has established mobile

medical units across 15 locations in 11 states, benefiting the community at large. In addition, we have trained and upskilled

more than 44,000 truck drivers and also 4,512 youth from rural communities have benefitted from our skill development

workshops.

Corporate governance is of utmost importance to us, and we are dedicated to achieving transparency and governance

goals. We adhere to established policies and frameworks that guide ethical decision-making in all our engagements. Our

commitment to employee welfare is unwavering, as we provide comprehensive benefits including life, health, and accidental

insurance. We also conduct skill development workshops to encourage the professional growth of our employees.

Looking ahead, SFL is steadfast in its dedication to promote Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices. By

letter dated June 15, 2022 conveyed its No-Objection to the Scheme. As per the directions of the Hon’ble National

Company Law Tribunal, Chennai Bench, (“NCLT”) in the common order dated May 11, 2022, the meeting of the Equity

Shareholders, Secured Creditors and Unsecured Creditors was held on July 04, 2022 and the Scheme was approved by the

requisite majority of the Equity shareholders, Secured Creditors and Unsecured Creditors in their respective meetings. The

Company had obtained approvals/no objection to the Scheme from various statutory authorities, as applicable. The Hon’ble

NCLT had sanctioned the Scheme, vide order dated November 09, 2022 to be read with Corrigendum order dated November

17, 2022 effective from appointed date of the Scheme being April 01, 2022. Pursuant to the scheme, Shrilekha Business

Consultancy Private Limited (“SBCPL”) was amalgamated with SCL. The undertaking carrying on the business of financial

services from SCL was demerged and transferred to Shriram Investment Holdings Limited (“SIHL”). The undertakings

which were carrying on the businesses of Life Insurance and General Insurance were demerged from SCL and transferred

to Shriram LI Holdings Private Limited (“SLIH”), and Shriram GI Holdings Private Limited (“SGIH”) respectively. The

remaining undertaking of SCL and its investments in STFC and SCUF were amalgamated with STFC.

Pursuant to the Scheme, the name of the Company is changed to Shriram Finance Limited upon receipt of necessary approval

from the Registrar of Companies, Tamil Nadu, Chennai, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, with effect from November 30, 2022.

Pursuant to the Scheme, new equity shares of face value of Rs. 10/- each fully paid-up have been issued and allotted to the

eligible shareholders of SCL and SCUF on december 12, 2022 as per the share exchange ratio contained in the Scheme. As

per Ind AS 103, the amalgamation has been accounted under “acquisition method”. The difference between the purchase

consideration and fair value has been accounted as goodwill/capital reserve on amalgamation, as applicable.

The Group has determined the useful life of the intangible asset in the nature of branch network of SCUF acquired through

the scheme of amalgamation as five years and started amortising the same over its useful life by making a suitable change in

the accounting estimate. Impact for future periods will be Rs. 302.58 crores per annum over next four years. The Group has

determined the useful life of the intangible asset in the nature of branch network of SHFL acquired through the scheme of

amalgamation as one year and amortised the same over its useful life. The figures for the current reporting period include the

effect of merger of transferor Companies SCUF and SCL as discussed above and are therefore not comparable with figures of

the respective previous year.
