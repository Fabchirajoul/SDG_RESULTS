MESSAGE FROM MD & CEO

Driving Growth, Achieving

Success: A Year of Milestones

“We recently

celebrated AU SFB's

28 year anniversary

and six years of

banking, and akin

to the enduring life

of a tree, we shall

together sow a

legacy that grows

through eternity.

This is my dream,

and I am sure, now

yours too.”: Dear Stakeholders,

Namaskar!

“A thing of beauty is a joy forever”,

wrote John Keats, the famous

poet, etching the thought that

a subject of our admiration and

endeavour would never fade or

diminish in value for us.

Seen through a kaleidoscope,

the FY 2022-23 saw much of the

world embarking on an insightful

journey, reshaping priorities,

coming out of the pandemic years,

and in the wake of an intensifying

economic slowdown, geopolitical

tensions and increasing liquidity

tightening. The stress in the global

banking system has given many

valuable lessons to bankers and

regulators alike.

AU Small Finance Bank Limited

MESSAGE FROM MD & CEO

We have

strengthened our

tech team and forged

partnerships with

leading global tech

companies such as

Amazon, Salesforce,

Accenture, Adobe,

and Oracle.

Such endorsements give me ample

confidence that AU SFB is building

on its credentials through a strong

compliance, robust governance,

and sustainable business model.

Technology

We are on a relentless pursuit

to build one of the finest tech-

led retail banking franchises.

To achieve this vision, we have

strengthened our tech team and

forged partnerships with leading

global tech companies, including

Amazon, Salesforce, Accenture,

Adobe, Oracle, and the National

Payments Corporation of India.

I am personally engaging with

their global leadership teams to

enhance our relationships and

explore areas of innovation.

Our ongoing technology

modernisation has led to the

successful implementation of the

upgraded Core Banking Solution

(CBS), enhancing scalability,

resilience, and introducing new

functionalities. Significant progress

has been made in enhancing

our core technology stack, with

upgrades to our core banking

system and data centre capacity.

We are implementing Salesforce

LOS (Loan Origination System)

along with FICO's underwriting

tool to enable a seamless

processing of vehicle loans.

Our aim is to extend these credit

automation processes to all types

of loans, while also incorporating

the Robotic Process Automation

(RPA) and Artificial Intelligence

(AI) for operational excellence.

Banks, as the custodians of the

customer digital footprint, will

thrive by leveraging technology

to personalise customer

experiences. At AU SFB, we are

working towards augmenting

our understanding of customers

by utilising publicly available

information. Our long-term

goal is to develop a data-driven

understanding of customers

on par with global tech giants,

while strictly adhering to

privacy and data protection

norms. We are also working

to exploit the opportunities

presented by India's emerging

public digital infrastructure.

We are live on the Account

Aggregator platform, one of the

early banks on the Open Credit

Enablement Network (OCEN)

platform, and in discussions with

the Open Network for Digital

Commerce (ONDC) team to

explore innovative use cases for

digital commerce. Furthermore,

we are collaborating with an

RBI Innovation Hub-incubated

fintech company to drive the

financial inclusion.

Since our digital properties

have been well received by our

customers, I believe this is the

right time to consolidate all our

digital businesses (like AU0101,

video banking, QR code and

merchant lending, etc.) under

a single umbrella to drive our

business to the next level of

scale. A distinction between

digital businesses and technology

architecture will also allow our

technology vertical to have their

complete focus on running the

Bank’s digital infrastructure

while continuing their journey

of innovation.

‘AU Bano Champion’

reducing the inequality. With

Sustainability and Inclusivity

at the core of our thoughts, we

are striving to create a positive

impact by empowering the youth

through the ‘AU Skills Academy’

for livelihood opportunities,

women empowerment through

‘AU Udyogini’, and ‘AU Bano

Champion’ by supporting sports

initiatives for rural children and

the youth.

As we embark on our ‘Forever’

journey, we are committed to

integrating ESG principles across

our operations. To enhance

transparency and accountability,

we had initiated the publishing

of Sustainability Report last year.

This year’s Report details our

sustainability approach and its

performance. Our strong ESG

practices have been recognised,

with an 'AA' rating from MSCI and

a medium rating in ESG risk from

Sustainalytics. To further drive

our sustainability initiatives, we

have established a Board-level

committee chaired by an

independent director.

Transformation within,

through SBU Structure

We have successfully implemented

a robust SBU structure of 10 units,

enabling enhanced agility,

flexibility, and employee focus in

our business planning. Last year,

senior leadership of nine of these

SBUs presented their thoughts and

outlook with you via four different

‘AU Insights’ sessions. The SBU

structure has also played a pivotal

role in attracting talent, fostering

leadership development, and

promoting cohesive and motivated

teams, facilitating an effective

succession planning.

Focus Areas for the Coming

Years

With a mere 0.4% market share

in deposits and assets, our true

potential for growth is immense.

Thus, our robust business model

is focusing on specific market

segments, targeting urban areas

for deposit acquisition and

core/rural markets for lending to

take advantage of this opportunity.

Our primary objective is to

establish a sustainable, low-cost,

and granular deposit franchise

despite the prevailing higher

interest rates. We will prioritise

managing our CASA and granular

deposits, by enhancing our Current

Account proposition. We will

also safeguard our margins by

strengthening our current account

propositions, transaction banking,

data analytics capabilities,

credit automation, and process

re-engineering.

While our investments to build

capabilities may temporarily

impact our cost-to-income levels,

the benefits of scale are likely to

be realised soon. Our investments

in merchant lending, video

banking, unsecured lending, and

cross-selling will positively impact

our profitability. Furthermore,

we anticipate additional revenue

streams from AD-1 business, wealth

products, gold loan business, and

the gradual profitability of our credit

card business in the coming years.

Another key area of focus will

be setting up the Transaction

Banking vertical to build our

business around AD-1 license,

which allows us to operate the

foreign exchange market and

undertake full range of foreign

currency related transactions on

par with universal banks. This could

be a cross-functional business

intersecting SBUs from branch

banking to commercial banking

to forex transactions on our credit

cards or Merchant apps. This is an

evolving space, and we will update

more as we progress.

Our primary objective

is to establish a

sustainable, low-cost,

and granular deposit

franchise despite

the prevailing higher

interest rates. We will

prioritise managing

our CASA and

granular deposits,

by enhancing our

current account

proposition.

3 Secured Business Loans

Overview

Secured Business Loan (SBL)

is a flagship product within the

retail assets segment. Our loans

primarily serve MSMEs with a

few years of track record in such

businesses, generating cash

flows at high frequency, with

limited formal documentation

(such as grocery/kirana stores,

dairy/cattle rearing and hotel/

restaurants). We are focused on

the financing of consumer-driven

unserved and underserved MSME

businesses. We understand our

customers’ business and their

future requirements, their existing

and projected cash flow, and

on-ground feedback to arrive

at the loan amount that can be

offered to them. Such loans are

backed-up by business cash

flows, and are for working capital

and business expansion. Further,

as these loans are secured in

nature, we take physical collateral

as a deterrent to loan, which

also helps in steady behaviour of

repayment along with cash flows.

Our funding is to different

businesses and different

participants in the supply chain

which further helps in creating

employment opportunities.

Along with the unserved and

underserved segments of the

economy, we also serve to the

formal segment, that have more

structured businesses. Our target

customer base includes traders,

wholesalers, distributors, retailers,

manufacturers and self-employed

professionals, and these loans

are meant to meet their needs

for expansion, working capital

and purchase of equipment. The

average loan tenure is 8-10 years.

There is a huge addressable

credit gap in the MSME sector

and a majority of the demand is

from MSMEs located in rural and

semi-urban geographies. As per

a report by UK Sinha Committee

constituted by RBI in June 2019,

the MSME credit gap is estimated

to be around H20-25 trillion.

and aim to deepen the relationship

further by offering a wide range of

CMS solutions and enhancing our

customer’s banking experience.

Our strong performance in

FY 2022-23, gives us confidence

that we are on track to achieve our

strategic objectives. With constant

awareness of the changing

macro-economic variables along

with adherence to the regulatory

compliances, we are optimistic

that our strategy to diversify and

build granularity will help us deliver

sustainable growth.
