Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure in welcoming you to another eventful year

for GIC Re.

As we reflect on the past year’s journey, I am filled with a sense of gratitude

for the collective efforts that have brought us to this point.

The year behind us was marked by both challenges and triumphs.

The global landscape posed uncertainties which tested our resilience

and adaptability to rise to the occasion. Despite these challenges, I am

glad to announce that our company has not only weathered the storm

but has also emerged stronger, more cohesive, and poised for continued

success in the long run.

At the core of our achievements are our dedicated team members,

who have exemplified unwavering commitment and determination for

the Corporation. Their dedication has been the driving force behind our

accomplishments, and I extend my deepest appreciation to each and

every one of them. It is their passion, and collaborative spirit that make

our company a centre of excellence.

In every field – be it the economy, science and technology or agriculture

we have been steadily climbing the world rankings and have shown

our mettle. I deem it my privilege to congratulate especially, our great

scientists of ISRO who have once again raised our heads high by launching

Chandrayan (Lunar Mission).

As we know in this changing world, geopolitical tensions continue to rise as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Euro zone crisis have

disrupted the global economic order. Food insecurity, inflation and climate concerns escalate. The global financial markets including

(re)insurance are thus challenged - stability and growth are seemingly elusive as of now.

The 51st Anniversary of your Company is being observed with all joy and happiness that such a glorious event deserves, we are all

indeed privileged to be a part of this incredible journey. While we celebrate the vision, entrepreneurial spirit and commitment of our

Founders and Leaders, we take this opportunity to pay our humble homage to them.

We truly hope we have carried their charter forward and that we have been able to build on their noteworthy accomplishments to

keep this great financial institution at the forefront of the nation’s economic development index.

Declaration of the Company Secretary

In terms of S88 (2)(e) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, I certify that in respect of the financial period ended 31 March 2023, the company

has lodged with the Registrar of Companies all such returns that are required by the Companies Act, and that all such returns are to

the best of my knowledge and belief, true, correct and up to date.

W Mwase

Company Secretary:

letter of comfort given by the parent company provides support to the company in

order to maintain adequate capital, to meet solvency and policy holder liability requirements and financial obligations.

3.3

Credit risk

The company has several exposures to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when

due. Key areas where the company is exposed to credit risk are:

• amounts due under reinsurance contracts

• amounts due from Retrocessionnaire contracts

• investments excluding equities; and

• retroceded technical liabilities.

Exposure to individual policyholders and groups of policyholders are monitored as part of the credit control process. Reputable

financial institutions are used for investing and cash handling purposes.

Under the terms of the retrocession agreements, Retrocessionnaire agree to reimburse the ceded amount in the event that a

gross claim is paid. However, the company remains liable to its cedants regardless of whether the Retrocessionnaire meets the

obligations it has assumed. Consequently, the company is exposed to credit risk.

The company reinsures with Sirius International Insurance Corporation which has been rated A (Excellent) by A.M. Best and A-

(Strong) by S&P Ratings.

Notes to the Financial Statements:

letter of credit to Lloyd’s (Funds at Lloyd’s) to collateralise its reinsurance obligations to the Company and deposited an additional £53.0

million during the year (2021: £44.2 million).

Strategic Report:

letter of credit and the funds provided by the Parent Reinsurer at Fund’s at Lloyd’s.

Since the Company did not undertake many transactions of its own, the Directors do not consider currency or credit risk to be significant.

Regulatory and Compliance Risk

The Company is subject to continuing approval by Lloyd’s to be a corporate member of the Syndicates. The Company reduces the risk

of this approval being revoked by monitoring and fully complying with all its Lloyd’s membership requirements.

The capital requirements to support the proposed amount of Syndicate insurance capacity for future years are set by Lloyd’s. Lloyd’s

takes a variety of factors into account when setting these requirements including market conditions and Syndicate performance.

Though Lloyd’s intends for the process to be fair and reasonable, the requirements can fluctuate from one year to the next, which may

constrain the amount of Syndicate insurance capacity that the Company can support going forward.
