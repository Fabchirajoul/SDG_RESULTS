No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated 17th March

2020 (as amended) (the “RBI communication”)

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial

reporting of State Bank of India (“the Bank”) as of 31st March

2023 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial

statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date which

includes internal financial controls over financial reporting of

the Bank’s branches.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal

Financial Controls

The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and

maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal

control over financial reporting criteria established by the

Bank considering the essential components of internal control

stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial

Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute

of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities

include the design, implementation and maintenance of

adequate internal financial controls that were operating

effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of

its business, including adherence to the Bank’s policies, the

safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of

frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the

accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable

financial information, as required under the Banking

Regulation Act, 1949, State Bank of India Act, 1955 and the

circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s

internal financial controls over financial reporting based on

our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the

Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the

Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and

the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by the ICAI, to the

extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls.

Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we

comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the

audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate

Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting were

established and maintained and if such controls operated

effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit

evidence about the adequacy of the Internal Financial

Controls over financial reporting and their operating

effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over

financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of

internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing

the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and

evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal

financial controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures

selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the

assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the

financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and

the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors, in terms

of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph

below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our

audit opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls over

financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over

Financial Reporting

A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting

is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance

regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the

preparation of financial statements for external purposes in

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting

includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the

maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately

and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the

assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation

of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted

accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures

of the Bank are being made only in accordance with

authorizations of management and directors of the Bank;

and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention

or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or

disposition of the Bank’s assets that could have a material

effect on the financial statements.
