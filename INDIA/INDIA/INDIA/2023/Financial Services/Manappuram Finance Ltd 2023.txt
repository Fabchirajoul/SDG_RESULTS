Managing Director’s

Message to Shareholders: Dear Shareholders,

I am extremely honored and delighted to share with you our

31st Annual Report for the financial year ended March 31,

2023. We emerged stronger by navigating a volatile, uncertain

and complex economic landscape. Execution of our business

plans with finesse and perfection ensured that we closed

FY 2022-23 with Consolidated Assets under Management

(AUM) of ` 354.52 billion, achieving a growth of 17% over the

previous year.

What adds glitter to this commendable performance is an

unwavering commitment towards our customers, regulators,

policy-makers, and last but not the least, our employees –

the real foot soldiers without whom your Company couldn’t

have scaled such great heights. No institution can aspire to

grow by alienating itself from its roots and true to that spirit,

we will make every effort to uphold our cherished values and

principles in our future growth trajectory.

Navigating The ‘Vuca’ World

Even as scars of the COVID-19 pandemic had begun

to fade, geopolitical tensions took the world by storm.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the consequent polarization

of the global order had its ramifications in the economic

landscape. The threat of inflation was imminent and the war

sent the prices of essential staples – from rice to edible oils

– skyrocketing, not to mention its debilitating impact on the

poor and the vulnerable. Controlling inflation even at the cost

of growth became the unmistakable agenda of global central

banks. Interest rates were increased sharply in the developed

economies. The US Federal Reserve was at the forefront as it

raised its key policy rate, the Fed Fund rate, by a cumulative

5% in 2022-23. The Bank of England and the European

Central Bank were not far behind either. However, even with

these measures, inflation remains stubbornly high in the UK

and EU, though US had a modicum of success. The Reserve

Bank of India raised its repo rate by a much lower 250 basis

points (bps) during the year under review, compared to the

developed world. In India, Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) is now

below 5%, after staying rigidly in the 6.5% to 7% range for two

years in a row.

As the world battled the geopolitical fallout of the war, another

jolt was the US banking crisis with Silicon Valley Bank, that

housed the funds of many technology and start-up firms,

becoming insolvent. The crisis had its roots in the sharp hike in

Fed Fund rate and the asset liability mismatches that followed.

The crisis of confidence brought back memories of the 2008

debacle, but the US financial regulators acted swiftly to bring

the situation under control by exhorting bigger banks to rescue

failed ones. I feel that prudent and conservative practices

followed by Indian banks have always stood the test of time,

acting as shock absorbers and automatic stabilizers during

crises, a fact that has been endorsed time and again.

It is universally acknowledged by analysts as well as agencies

including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that India

is emerging as the fastest growing among large economies.

There is a growing consensus that China might slow down to

the 2% to 2.5% range owing to a slew of factors, such as the

real estate crisis, aging and insufficient support from domestic

consumption, among others. The China Plus One strategy

is indeed an attractive proposition for India as it bestows an

opportunity to emerge as a manufacturing powerhouse and

export hub. The Production-Linked-Incentive (PLI) scheme

could not have been envisaged at a more opportune time, now

that its second version has also been unveiled. Manufacturing

as a share of gross domestic product has been languishing in

the mid-teens for much of the past decade, which needs to be

taken to a higher level.

India witnessed a slew of developments on many fronts in the

year gone by. The G-20 presidency cemented our standing on

the global stage, opening the door to make our imprint felt on

several global policy decisions ranging from climate change

to transfer pricing. We could also turn Russia’s isolation by the

West in the wake of the Ukraine conflict into an opportunity by

sourcing 20% of our crude oil from that country, which not only

helps alleviate the bulging current account deficit, but also

cools off inflation.

The fruits of reforms unleashed over the past years are now

slowly becoming available. The Goods and Services Tax (GST)

has stabilized, mobilizing ` 1.5 trillion and upwards every

month. The use of analytics and artificial intelligence have

gone a long way in ensuring compliance and preventing

evasion, thereby easing the fiscal burden. India historically

has a poor Tax-GDP ratio and major reforms help correct this

distortion, one of which is to ensure maximum compliance.

COMMODITY PRICE RISKS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RISKS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Commodity Price Risks

The Company lends against the collateral of used gold

jewellery. When the customer fails to repay the principal

plus interest of the loan, the Company auctions the collateral

and recovers the dues as per the RBI guidelines on gold loan

auctioning. The amount recovered at the time of auction

depends on the price of the gold content of the jewellery. As

gold is a commodity, the Company does therefore bear an

exposure to commodity price risk. If gold prices are high, the

amount of recovery at the time of auction is more and when

the price of gold is low the amount recovered at the time

of auction is lower. At the time of auction, the Company at

times may not collect full amount of interest due, especially

if the price of gold is lower at the time of auction than at the

time of disbursement.
