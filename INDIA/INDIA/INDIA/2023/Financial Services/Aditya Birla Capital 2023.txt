INSTRUCTIONS TO FURNISH/UPDATE PAN, BANK

ACCOUNT, KYC AND NOMINATION DETAILS

SEBI vide its Circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD-1/P/

CIR/2023/37 dated 16th March 2023 has mandated all physical

shareholders to furnish their PAN, Nomination and KYC details

(Contact Details, Postal address with PIN, Bank Account Details

& Specimen Signature) to the Company. Further, linking of PAN:

Dear Shareholders,

The foundation of our Group rests upon a philosophy of

trusteeship, which imagines corporations as institutions that

drive collective prosperity. This philosophy has played an

integral role in shaping our actions for generations, guiding

us in our quest to enrich lives. Over the years, this purpose,

though unstated, has been our unwavering anchor.

In FY23, we formally put to words our group’s purpose

statement. At its heart is the commitment to enrich lives

by building dynamic and responsible businesses

and institutions that inspire trust. Every day, we strive

to honour this commitment through our brands, products,

services, solutions, actions, relationships, and institutions.

Our purpose statement stands both timeless and fresh

against the backdrop of our extensive history. In a world of

increasing opportunity, and also accelerating uncertainty, our

purpose statement is meant to act as a talisman and remain

at the core of our business decisions.

Our purpose offers us a unique lens with which to view the

world, to bring perspective to it, and to thrive in it. Guided

by this unique perspective, we navigate the evolving global

landscape with resilience and foresight. As we turn our

attention to the current state of the global economy, it is

evident that we are charting a course through a 'new normal’.

GLOBAL ECONOMY: FINDING A NEW NORMAL

The global economy continues to pull itself out of the

pandemic-triggered shock. It does so amid a complex

environment marked by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine,

geo-economic fragmentation, soaring interest rates, and

looming risks of a banking contagion. Reflecting these

concerns, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects

global economic growth to dip from 3.4% in CY22 to 2.8%

in CY23. Developed countries are predicted to experience

a more pronounced deceleration, their aggregate growth

stumbling to just 1.3% in CY23 - the slowest pace in a

decade, excluding the pandemic-impacted CY20.

On the brighter side, China's economy marches towards

normalisation following the lifting of its Covid-related

restrictions. Both China and India are set to significantly

contribute to global economic growth in CY23, providing

a much-needed stimulus as developed economies grapple

with challenges.

Meanwhile, global supply chain pressures have largely

normalised, helping ease commodity prices and peak

inflation levels in most economies. Central banks, led by

the US Federal Reserve, appear to be nearing the end of

their rate-hiking phase, signaling cautious optimism for the

global economy and financial markets. However, vigilance

remains crucial in the face of potential risk events in this

fragile environment.

INDIA: THE SHINING STAR

India's economic narrative paints a much brighter picture.

With a government-led push to infrastructure investments

and pragmatic policies such as the production-linked

incentives scheme, private capex has seen a surge.

Aditya Birla Capital Limited:

letter and other loan securing documents, agrees with its customers on collateral

security to be provided by the customers in secured loan exposures that are subject to credit risk. Collateral security enables

us to recover all or part of the outstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral asset provided, in cases where the borrower is

unable or unwilling to fulfil its primary obligations.

Collateral security accepted could be in the form of:

a)

Financial collateral in the form of pledge of equity shares, units of mutual funds, assignment of life insurance policies

b)

Current Assets in the form of inventories meant for sale or receivables arising out of the sale of finished goods

c)

Fixed Assets (in the form of immovable properties – Real Estate, Plant and Machinery, Equipment)

d)

Third-party obligation (in the form of Irrevocable Unconditional Guarantee issued by Bank, Third party)

e)

Risk participation from Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE)

f)

Assignment of borrower’s rights and interests under agreements with third parties.

In addition, we also stipulate escrow of cash flows and a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) for project loans. Collateral serves

to mitigate the inherent risk of credit loss in an exposure, by either improving recoveries in the event of a default or substituting

the borrower.

As part of the assessment of a credit transaction the availability, adequacy and suitability of collateral for the transaction is evaluated

and decided upon. The processes include verification of the title to the collateral offered and valuation by technical experts where

warranted. We accept as collateral only securities of good quality and have in place legally effective and enforceable documentation.

For guarantees taken, the guarantor’s creditworthiness is assessed during the credit assessment process of the transaction. We

have collateral type specific haircuts in place, which are reviewed at intervals as appropriate to the type of collateral.

The NBFC & HFC recognises that collateral can be a credit mitigant (alternative source of repayment), but does not replace or

dilute the underwriting standards the Company adopts to underwrite credit exposures.
