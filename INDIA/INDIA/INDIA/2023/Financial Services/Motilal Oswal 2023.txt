Dear Shareholders,

Indian economy proved to be remarkably resilient in

FY2023 with GDP growth of 7.2% and continues to

remain one of the fastest growing economy due to the

strong macroeconomic fundamentals. Global economy

faced uncertainty due to geopolitical tensions and

continued lockdown in China. This led to signiﬁcant

disruption in global supply chain and consequently high

inﬂation across the world. Several central banks

including RBI were quick to react to this alarming

situation and hiked interest rates to curb inﬂation. The

proactive steps taken by RBI effectively curbed

inﬂationary pressure and paved the way for a more

stable economic environment.

At MOFSL, we reported highest ever operating revenue of ₹ 4,319 crore in FY2023, registering a growth of 8% YoY.

Our operating PAT touched an all-time high of ₹ 879 crore. Our consolidated ROE stood at 18%. Our focus on

knowledge, talent, processes, technology, brand & culture and inter-segment synergies have helped us to

withstand market headwinds and achieve key milestones across all business verticals. We continue to remain

optimistic on the growth potential of all our business verticals given the robust fundamental structure.

On the capital markets front, Indian equity markets ended on a ﬂattish note. Number of new entrants into the stock

market declined as industry witnessed 2.5 crore new demat account being opened in FY2023 as compared to 3.5

crore in previous ﬁnancial year. While FIIs were on a selling spree for second consecutive year, DIIs offset the

pressure and recorded highest ever inﬂows. On the back of our strengths- “Phygital Business model” and

“Research and Advisory”, our broking business recorded highest ever broking revenues, proﬁts and Average Daily

Turnover (ADTO) in FY2023. We added 6.5 lakh clients in FY2023, taking the total retail client base to ~35 lakh. We

had one of the highest Average Revenue Per User (ARPUs) in the industry. Our derivative market share was at multi

period high in FY2023. Our distribution AUM stood at ₹ 21,300 crore and has huge head-room for growth. During

the year, we launched Options Store and Research 360-degree App, further strengthening our offerings. In

Institution business, our rankings and clientele continued to remain robust. We were awarded #1 Corporate

Access Team in Asia Money Brokers Poll 2022. We completed the largest private equity deal for our Investment

Banking business in FY2023 and we continue to engage on a wide cross-section of mandated transactions across

capital markets and advisory.

Our AMC AUM which includes MF, PMS and AIF stood at ₹ 45,620 crore. During the year, we onboarded Prateek

Agrawal, an industry veteran, to lead business and investment strategy. We strengthened our Risk Management

framework and revamped investment process to deliver consistent returns. All these measures led to turnaround

in performance of our active MF schemes, which in turn led to improvement in gross sales and decline in

redemptions. We have a diverse passive product basket spread across various categories including international

ETFs and index funds. Fee earning PE and RE AUM stood at ₹ 10,280 crore. We launched IBEF IV, the biggest PE

fund, in FY2022. The fund witnessed overwhelming response and we were able to attain ﬁnal close at ₹ 4,500

crore within a year. Our wealth management business AUM recorded a growth of 51% YoY at ₹ 52,000 crore. Our

net sales was at an all-time high of ₹ 5,800 crore in FY2023. We have bolstered our leadership team with senior

management hiring to strengthen Ultra HNI offerings and advisory capabilities. Keeping in mind our growth

aspirations, we on boarded 63 RMs during the ﬁnancial year, taking the total count to 182. We will continue to

invest in this business by adding RMs. With improvement in the vintage of RMs, the proﬁtability of our wealth

management is poised for further traction.
