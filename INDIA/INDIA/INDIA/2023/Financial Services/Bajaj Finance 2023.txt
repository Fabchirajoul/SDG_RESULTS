LETTER

Sanjiv Bajaj

Chairman

Dear Shareholder,

For two consecutive years, your Company had to struggle almost on a day-to-day basis to overcome the human

and business consequences of three waves of COVID-19, plus an economic slowdown that preceded COVID-19

but intensified during the pandemic. It was a very tough act and I remember writing in my last: letter to you

about ‘resilience’. To quote:

“[the] resilience of your Company in dealing with various external shocks in recent years — be it the three

successive COVID-19 waves, macroeconomic slowdown that pre-dated COVID or the fundamental changes in

the industry that we belong to. Through these shocks, your Company demonstrated tremendous resilience and

financial strength and took all necessary actions without hurting any aspect of its business model or its financial

position.”

Omnichannel strategy

will make Bajaj Finance a

truly customer-centric

digital enterprise.
