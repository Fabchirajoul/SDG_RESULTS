Executive Director

Our business strategy was led by a 360º customer-centric approach with an aspiration to

serve customers seamlessly across ecosystems, customer segments and micromarkets while

fostering a strong risk and compliance culture. We have further empowered our employees

with enablers for seamless engagement and better delivery of services to customers. The

Bank will continue to invest in process decongestion, digital capabilities, technology platforms,

distribution and security features to respond to the evolving opportunities and risks.

Our efforts will continue to be founded on the pillars of ‘One Bank, One Team, One ROE’,

‘Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank’ and paramountcy of return of capital. We strive to build a

culture of collaboration and teamwork wherein each employee upholds the ICICI values to

enhance Customer 360º propositions. Our goal is to serve customers with transparency and

integrity while creating value for our shareholders.

The Indian economy continued to show resilience amidst a volatile global environment in

fiscal 2023. During the year, we remained focussed on our strategic objective of growing our

risk-calibrated core operating profit through the 360° customer-centric approach, which was

supported by our process, technology, and HR measures. We continued to operate within our

strategic framework and strengthened our franchise, enhanced our delivery and servicing

capabilities, and expanded our technology and digital offerings.

We enabled our Customer 360° approach by working as one team across various

departments of the Bank, and bringing together the strength and expertise of our employees.

In fiscal 2023, we continued to implement suitable initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint

of the Bank. Through our philanthropic arm, ICICI Foundation for Inclusive Growth, we aim to

create an enduring impact on the society and environment. Our efforts on providing affordable

and accessible healthcare, creating rural livelihoods and supporting societal development

have made a difference to nearly 10.9 million lives till date.

The Bank continues its strategy of 360° customer-centric approach through innovation

and adapting to the ever-evolving customer needs across segments and ecosystems. As

our business modes evolve digitally, trust, reliability and security remain the key anchors

that underpin our long-term profitable growth strategy. The principle of ‘One Bank, One

Team’ enhances the Customer 360° approach with key focus on execution. The Bank has

undertaken various initiatives to scale the franchise in terms of capacity, capability,

empowerment and deepening its presence in key micromarkets.

To enhance the corporate relationship including its stakeholders, the Bank focussed on

capturing opportunities across entire value chain by deep diving into the customer journeys

and providing integrated industry-specific solutions. The Bank offered new STACKS

additions of real estate, GIFT City, capital markets and custody, and a one-stop platform

for trade transactions. The Bank continued its approach of choosing right counterparty,

multi-channel distribution and taking entire Bank to the customer with a transparent and

best-in-class banking experience.
