Chairman's Message: Dear Stakeholders,

Greetings!

It gives me immense pleasure to

present to you the Integrated Annual

Report of our Bank for the financial

year 2022-23.

The year 2022-23 gone by was a

momentous year in many ways. It

was a year in which the world largely

shook off the effects of the COVID-19

pandemic thus enabling Governments,

businesses and people to rebound

in their activities with renewed zest

and make fresh beginnings and

investments. At the same time, quite

unexpectedly, it was the year when

the world was buffeted by a surging

geopolitical turmoil, burgeoning

energy prices and inflation, and the

inevitable tightening of the monetary

policies around the globe. Despite

global headwinds, the Indian economy

continued to demonstrate resilience.

The runway for growth in India,

predominantly driven by the country’s

domestic consumption, remains

immense. Global investors and India

watchers have acknowledged the

country’s macroeconomic and

financial stability.

For us at HDFC Bank, the year started

with a path breaking announcement

of the merger of our promoter, HDFC

Ltd., one of the largest housing finance

companies of India with the Bank.

This merger was meant to, inter-alia,

transform the Bank to a financial

services conglomerate straddling

key financial services and products,

including housing loan, life and general

insurance, and asset management

amongst others.

The merged entity would benefit

from increased scale, comprehensive

product offering, balance sheet

resilience and the ability to drive

synergies, enhance operating

efficiencies and underwriting

efficiencies, thereby leveraging the

complementary strengths of both

the organisations. This would enable

the Bank to serve its customers in

a significantly enhanced way with a

bouquet of financial services.

I am happy to inform you that the

merger has now been completed

within our estimated timelines and

focus now shifts on capturing the

full benefits of the synergies and

future proofing the Bank for the

coming decades.

The Integrated Annual Report being

placed before you would once again

demonstrate that the Bank has

achieved over the past financial year,

robust growth in its businesses with

healthy financial performance and

profitability, and it continues to be one

of the best managed banks in terms of

its risk management, non-performing

assets, regulatory compliance and

governance standards. This reflects

the effectiveness of our governance

culture and the supervision of the

Board. Let me elaborate on

these themes.

Governance at the core

At the Bank we accord tremendous

importance to very high standards of

corporate governance. This philosophy

rests on the essential principles

of independence, accountability,

responsibility, transparency, fair

and timely disclosures which have

built credibility over the years. The

various Committees of the Board met

throughout the year giving them an

opportunity to take stock of various

aspects of critical importance to the

Bank. These Committees enabled

the Board members to perform

their governance and supervisory

duties and have an oversight on the

performance of senior management.

This ensured that your Bank would not

be buffeted by sudden ebbs and flows

of events.

We stand at the

cusp of a New Era

Atanu Chakraborty

Part-time

Dear Stakeholders,

Warm greetings to you all.

The year gone by was one in

which the world moved away

from the new normal to the

normal. The pandemic is largely

over. However, the after effects

of decisions made during those

trying and unusual times have

left behind a lot of issues for the

world to address. This includes

higher inflation and resultant

monetary tightening, and the

regional banking crisis in Europe

and USA.

Sashidhar Jagdishan: Managing

letter to you in the last two years,

I had highlighted my key focus areas.

These are: improving technology

resilience, a clear focus on three Cs:

Culture, Conscience and Customer

and building for the future.

Let me now elaborate on these.

Technology Update:

HDFC Bank is today in the midst of

a technology transformation exercise

that focuses both on building the Bank

of the future as well as running the

Bank. For me, the focus on technology

upgrade and digital transformation are

central to achieving growth as well as

excellence in customer service.

We are focusing on two foundational

aspects. First, transforming the Bank

through new platforms and customer

experiences offered by the best-in-

class products and services through

our digital factories. Second, running

the Bank efficiently by reinforcing our

core technologies with enhanced

performance and resilience at scale,

through the enterprise factory. Our

digital transformation journey is being

powered by building competencies

within the Bank. The factory approach

is focused on leveraging new-age

tech such as AI/ML, cloud-native

architecture, API-driven banking

as well as pioneering industry-

first initiatives through emerging

technologies such as generative AI

enablement across banking domains.

Some of our flagship programmes

focused on our customers are

enumerated below:

• Our modernised PayZapp 2.0

arrives with a variety of quality-of-

life improvements while offering

convenience, security, and a

wide array of payment options at

customers’ fingertips. This will drive

our acquisition of New To Bank

customers.

• SmartHub has grown into the

preferred banking platform for

merchants with over 1.5 million

using the app, handling over 18 lakh

transactions daily.

• Our Bank One Program is a

cloud-native platform powered by

conversational AI & ML capabilities

offering our customers a unified

banking experience across channels.

With multilingual bots covering ~40

per cent of customer interactions,

the platform has significantly boosted

efficiencies and reduced resolution

times.

• Our Acquisition Platform enables

a smoother and more consistent

customer experience for purchase

of the Bank’s retail products on the

Bank’s platforms and has facilitated

more than 5 million products being

availed by our customers.

• Xpress Car Loan has evolved

into India’s single largest digital

loan platform for origination and

disbursement with over 50,000

happy customers.

• Smart Saathi, our most recent

launch, digitally enables our network

of Business Correspondents and

Business Facilitators by providing

them an omnichannel experience of

our digital products.

• The Bank has driven various industry-

first innovations through programmes

such as Digital Cattle Finance, Digital

Rupee, OfflinePay, Digi-Passbook,

exploration of AI / ML based data

extraction and signature verification.

• On the Corporate Banking front,

the Bank hosts Corporate Banking

eXchange (CBX) which is one of

the largest corporate transactions

platforms and a state-of-the-art Trade

Finance platform.

Our conscious effort has been

to launch in small scale, listen to

customer feedback, build acceptance

projects. This means we can

participate more meaningfully in India’s

growth story and contribute to nation

building. In light of all this, the pace at

which we aim to grow - we could be

creating a new HDFC Bank every

4 years.

The merger would of course not have

been possible without the support and

guidance of the regulatory authorities

including RBI, SEBI, CCI, IRDAI, BSE,

NSE, PFRDA and NCLT. I would like to

take this opportunity to thank all

of them.

Now, to come to our performance.

Our Performance

As a Bank our performance has been

consistent across business cycles. We

have grown our Balance Sheet and

Net Profit while maintaining our

asset quality.

Our Balance Sheet grew by 19.2 per

cent to `24,66,081 crore and Net Profit

increased 19.3 per cent to `44,108.7

crore. Net Interest Income increased

by 20.6 per cent to `86,842.2 crore.

GNPA decreased to 1.12 per cent

from 1.17 per cent. We have been able

to maintain a stable NIM at 4.1 per

cent (4.3 per cent on interest earning

assets) despite deposits growing

by 20.8 per cent on account of low

cost of funds. The Return on Assets

(ROA) was 2.07 per cent while Return

on Equity was 17.4 per cent. Our

commitment to shareholders remained

high with a proposed dividend pay-out

of `19 per equity share of `1/- which

translates to a dividend pay-out ratio

of 24.07 per cent of the profits for the

financial year ended March 31, 2023.

I am pleased to state that the Bank’s

performance continued to be robust

during FY 2022-23 with sustained

growth across the Wholesale, Retail

and Commercial and Rural Banking

businesses.

Dear Stakeholders,

Your Directors take great pleasure in presenting the 29th Annual

Report on the business and financial operations of your Bank,

together with the audited accounts for the year ended March

31, 2023.

The year gone by has been the first normal/near normal one in

the last three years as the world largely shook off the effects of

the pandemic and spread cheer.

On the economic front, India's GDP grew by 7.2 per cent in

Financial Year 2022-23 compared to 9.1 per cent in the preceding

year as per the Central Statistical Organisation. The higher

growth last year in Financial Year 2021-2022 was largely due to

the negative impact of the pandemic in Financial Year 2020-21.

Growth was supported by pent up consumption demand and

easing of supply – side constraints as the economy recovered

from pandemic induced disruptions. Increased Government

spending improved investment momentum and in turn supported

the recovery of private sector capital expenditure

Overall systemic liquidity remained in surplus for much of the

last financial year. However, RBI started raising rates from May

2022 onwards, cumulatively increasing by 250 basis points.

Global headwinds resulted in slowing export momentum in the

second half of financial year 2022-23 and 2023-24 GDP growth

forecast being revised by 200 basis points. Although, Indian

banks remain relatively immune to the effects of US regional

banking turmoil, ripple effects of the global turmoil are likely to

be felt on domestic markets due to high inflation, geopolitical

tensions and persistent but continuing localised disruptions of

the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the long run however, we see resilience in the domestic

market against future headwinds as India remains one of the

fastest growing economies globally. External stability indicators

continue to remain healthy. Internal consumption demand is

being supported by the rationalisation of income tax slabs as

well as 37.4 per cent increase in capital expenditure to ` 10 lakh

crore in the Union Budget for 2023-24.

For more details, please refer to the Macroeconomic and

Industry section on page no. 173.

Your Bank continued to grow in this environment by conducting

its business responsibly and reinforcing its commitment to the

environment and community at large.

Directors’ Report

Financial Parameters

The Bank's key financial parameters showed an improvement,

primarily attributable to its robust credit evaluation of targeted

customers and a well-diversified loan book across customer

segments, sectors and products. The Bank's performance is

also an outcome of its disciplined approach to managing risk

and returns.

Based on Standalone Financial Statements

The income statement reflected a growth in revenue comprising

net interest income and non-interest income. While the former

grew by 20.6 per cent, the latter grew by 5.8 per cent year-on-

year. On an overall basis, total net revenue for the year ended

March 31, 2023, reached ` 1,18,057 crore, reflecting increase by

16.3 per cent over prior year.

Net Profit increased by 19.30 per cent to ` 44,108.70 crore from

` 36,961.30 crore. Return on Average Net Worth was 17.39

per cent while Basic Earnings Per Share was ` 79.25 up from

` 66.80.

A & B As per the salary review approval process of the

Reserve Bank of India, the salary increment proposal to be

effected from April 01 in a given financial year can only be

made in the subsequent financial year post assessment of

performance for the reference financial year. For e.g. salary

increment proposal to be made to the RBI effective April 01,

2022 can only be made post assessment of performance

for the financial year 2022 - 2023. The approval received

from the RBI will therefore be retrospectively applied from

April 01, 2022. In light of aforementioned process, the

salary increase given in the particular year will always be

reported as zero.

The percentage increase in remuneration for the Managing

Director and Executive Director in FY 2021-22 was 5.03%

and 5.18% respectively. The remuneration for the Managing

Director and Executive Director for performance in FY 2021-

22, effective April 01, 2021 was approved by the RBI vide

their letter dated March 01, 2023.

The salary increase for performance in previous financial

year i.e. 2021 - 2022 paid retrospectively from April 01,

2021 was approved by the RBI on March 01, 2023.

CMr. Santosh Gurudas Haldankar was promoted on

December 01, 2022. The percentage increase mentioned

in the table is the overall increase in FY 2022-23 which is

insure or hedge their compensation structure to offset the risk alignment effects embedded in their

compensation arrangement.

Statutory Bonus

Some employees are also paid statutory bonus as per the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 as amended

from time to time.

III. Remuneration Processes

Fitment at the time of hire

Pay scales at the Bank are set basis the job size, experience, location and the academic and professional credentials

of the incumbent.

The compensation of new hires is in line with the existing pay ranges and consistent with the compensation levels of

the existing employees of the Bank at similar profiles. The pay ranges are subject to change basis market trends and

the Bank’s talent management priorities. While the Bank believes in the internal equity and parity as a key determinant

of pay, it does acknowledge the external competitive pressures of the talent market. Accordingly, there could be

certain key profiles with critical competencies which may be hired at a premium and treated as an exception to the

overall pay philosophy. Any deviation from the defined pay ranges is treated as a hiring exception requiring approval

with appropriate justification.

Pay Increment / Pay Revision

The Bank strives to ensure external competitiveness as well as internal equity without diluting the overall focus on

optimising cost. In order to enhance the Bank’s external competitiveness, it participates in an annual salary survey of

the banking sector to understand key market trends as well as get insights on relative market pay position compared

to peers. The Bank endeavors to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of

fixed pay over time. This coupled with key internal data indicators like performance score, job family, experience,

job grade and salary budget form the basis of decision making on revisions in fixed pay.

Increments in fixed pay for majority of the employee population are generally undertaken once every financial year.

However, promotions, confirmations and change in job dimensions could also lead to a change in the fixed pay

during other times of the financial year.

The Bank also makes salary corrections and adjustments during the financial year for competitive pay positioning for

the purpose of retention of critical skills and critical talent in the domain of Information Technology, Digital, Information

Security, Data Science as well as business segments that are strategic focus areas of the bank. However, such pay

revisions are done on an exception basis.

The Fixed Pay for the Material Risk Takers (other than Whole time Directors), Senior Management, Key Management

Personnel is approved by the NRC and the Board. The Fixed Pay for the Whole Time Directors is approved by the

NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
