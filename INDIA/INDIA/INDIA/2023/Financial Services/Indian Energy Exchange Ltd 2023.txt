ndia continues to be the fastest growing major

economy in the world, well-positioned to become

a $5 trillion GDP economy in this decade. The

Economic Survey 2022-23 has projected a baseline

GDP growth of 6.5 percent in real terms for FY24,

closely following the robust growth of 7.2 percent in

FY23. India’s Index of Industrial Production for FY23

grew 5.1 percent year-on-year (YoY). Electricity,

being the bedrock of all industrial and commercial

activity, saw a consequent surge in demand. As

per the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), power

consumption rose 9.4 percent on YoY basis to reach

1,504 billion units (BU) in FY23. India’s daily peak power

demand reached 221 GW in May 2023, which was the

highest-ever daily peak recorded (at the time) in the

country.

The government’s focus on electrification as a

means to achieve decarbonisation - from cooking to

railway traction, and electric vehicles - will contribute

significantly to an increase in power consumption in

the country. It is projected that India would contribute

to approximately 25 percent of the total global energy

demand growth by 2040. This provides a massive

growth potential for the country’s electricity sector.

Currently, India’s per-capita electricity consumption

is only about one-third of the global average. This

further presents a huge opportunity for the electricity

sector, which is expected to increase at a rate of over

6 percent per annum for the next five years.

Today, India is the only country among the G20

nations which is on track to achieve its targets under

the Paris Agreement, highlighting its far-reaching new

initiatives in renewable energy, e-mobility, ethanol

blended fuels, and green hydrogen, as alternate

energy sources. The country’s G20 presidency this

year presents an unprecedented opportunity for the

country to showcase this extensive sustainability

roadmap.

Standing Strong Amid Global

Headwinds

While global economies were impacted due to

disruptions caused by the adverse geopolitical

situation in 2022, the Indian economy grew from

strength-to-strength. Increased industrial activity

backed by strong private consumption, higher capital

expenditure, and a robust financial sector, contributed

to India’s sustained growth story.

This also speaks volumes about the resilience of the

country’s energy sector, given the backdrop of a

severe fuel supply crunch across the world. Expanded

diversity of energy sources, and a decisive shift

towards renewable energy sources, shielded the

country from adverse impacts of the global energy

crisis. Critical interventions by the Government of

India helped improve domestic fuel production and

ease supply constraints and allowed India to stand

strong in the face of this global energy crisis.

India has targeted to achieve renewable energy

capacity of 500 GW by 2030 and reach net zero

carbon emission by 2070. The present renewable

capacity at 174 GW (as on 31st May 2023), represents

42 percent of total installed capacity of 418 GW. India

IEX – Pioneering India’s Power Market

for the Past 15 Years

I feel both proud and humbled to note that IEX is

celebrating 15 years of transforming India’s power

markets. This momentous journey, from trading 2

BU of electricity volumes in FY 2009 to about 100

BU annually at present, reflects the trust of market

participants in the country’s power markets and in IEX.

We have traded a cumulative volume of nearly 700

billion units, with a growth of about 30 percent CAGR

since inception.

With technology and innovation at the core, your

company has been at the forefront of introducing

new products and market segments, aligned with

India’s economic and decarbonisation targets. IEX

has played a humble role in India achieving its ‘One-

Nation One-Grid One- Price’ vision. Your company

enabled competitive procurement for commercial

and industrial consumers of 1 MW and above to

buy directly from the exchange. IEX created a green

market in the country through innovative products

such as the Renewable Energy Certificate, Green Day-

Ahead, and Green Term-Ahead segments.

Since its inception, IEX has been truly benefitting the

power sector. Competitive power prices discovered

on our platform serve as the benchmark for power

purchase for long, medium, and short-term basis.

These transparent and market-discovered prices

provide

signals

for

future

capacity

addition.

Additionally, exchange discovered competitive prices,

coupled with flexible procurement, have helped

distribution utilities accrue significant savings and

improve their efficiency.

Our best-in-class exchange technology has enabled

maximisation of social welfare and competitive price

discovery. Today, the IEX platform that comprises

7,500+

participants,

has

introduced

efficiency,

transparency, flexibility in procurement, and payment

security across the entire power sector value chain.

These milestones have been possible only due to

the unwavering faith and support of all our partners,

employees, and stakeholders.

Managing Director Mr. S.N. Goel shared

his thoughts on this journey.

“It gives me immense pride and gratitude to be a

part of the significant transformation in India’s power

markets over the last 15 years. Aligned to the vision of

policymakers to transition towards a market-based

economy IEX commenced operations with an aim

to provide a platform to access electricity in India

in the most competitive, transparent, flexible, and

reliable way. Over the last 15 years, with innovation

and technology at the core, IEX is relentlessly working

towards

facilitating

India’s

sustainable

energy

transition.”

IEX ACADEMY

On the occasion, your company also launched the IEX

Academy, which comprises customised certification

courses, webinars, workshops etc designed to develop

skills and expertise on Electricity Markets, covering

varied aspects of power sector policies, regulatory

frameworks, and power exchange operations. The

academy plans to offer wide range of programmes

on the Indian and Global Electricity Market - both

online and offline. The courses are designed for

capacity building of young skilled professionals in the

power sector based on in-house experience of IEX,

and in collaboration with academic institutions and

think tanks.

POWERX – ELECTRICITY PRICE

INDEX

The power market in India is set to grow at an

accelerated pace, given the government target to

increase the share of spot markets to 25% by 2030.

A transparent, neutral, and competitive power price

index can help market participants in planning and

future decision making. With this background, IEX has

launched PowerX - India’s first electricity price index

- to provide competitive benchmark signals and

enable market participants to make more effective

decisions. Based on the most liquid electricity

markets – PowerX is a daily weighted average of Day

Ahead Market and Real Time Market. PowerX will also

provide competitive benchmark signals and facilitate

renewable capacity addition in the country aligned

to the government’s vision of achieving 500 GW of

installed renewable energy capacity by the year 2030.

ENERGX – WEB-BASED

BIDDING

With an aim to provide seamless customer experience,

IEX has launched EnergX - a comprehensive web-

based bidding platform across all the segments on

the IEX platform – Real Time Market, Term Ahead and

Green Term Ahead Market, Ancillary Services, Intra

Day and Day Ahead Contingency. IEX had earlier in

the year launched the web-based bidding platform

only for the Day Ahead Market segment, which has

now been extended to all segments.

Regulator is likely to examine the objective of coupling

and its need in the current market framework, before

undertaking next steps.

Regulatory Initiatives: Centre

The

Central

Electricity

Regulatory

Commission

(CERC) notified various regulations such as CERC

(Connectivity and General Network Access to the

inter-State Transmission System) Regulations, 2022,

CERC (Terms and Conditions for Renewable Energy

Certificates

for

Renewable

Energy

Generation)

Regulations 2022, CERC (Indian Electricity Grid Code)

Regulations, 2022 (IEGC) and the 1st Amendment

to CERC (Sharing of ISTS Charges and Losses)

Regulations, CERC (Deviation Settlement Mechanism

and Related Matters) Regulations, 2022, CERC

(Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2022.

All these regulations will lead to further strengthening

of the power market. The new DSM Regulation

has linked the deviation charges with the market

discovered prices. In the longer run, as the markets

grow, this will lead to reduction in unscheduled

interchanges and entities will rely on markets to meet

their requirements. As per the GNA Regulations, the

distribution utilities will not be required to pay for

short term transactions if the injection/drawl is within

their GNA. Along with the amendment to Sharing

regulations, the GNA regulations also clarify that when

implemented the transmission bills will be raised only

to Drawee DICs, thus removing the present anomaly

in the sharing regulations which is resulting in levy of

transmission charges on both Buyers and sellers.

In order to address the volatility and soaring prices,

CERC issued orders on Price Capping at Power

Exchanges in May 2022, limiting the prices to ₹ 12/

unit in all segments, which continued till March 2023

and thereafter reduced it further to ₹ 10/unit from 4

April 2023. Further, to align the caps across segments,

CERC issued an order capping the DSM charges at

₹ 12/unit so as to remove any unwarranted arbitrage

among the market segments. CERC also approved

introduction of HP-DAM to enable sale of high price

power in the market.

CERC notified amendment to the ESCerts regulation

notifying a floor price at 10% of price of one metric

tonne of oil equivalent of energy consumed as

notified by Central Government. This was followed by

resumption of trade of the ESCerts at IEX during the

year.

CERC also issued an order approving long duration

contracts for TAM and Green TAM (G-TAM) initially

providing trade for delivery up to three months. This

marked the beginning of longer duration trades at

the exchange which hitherto were restricted to 11 days

only. Once allowed for 11 months, these trades would

constitute significant trade volumes at the Exchange.

The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) issued draft

Guidelines for Resource Adequacy (RA) Planning

Framework for India which seeks to suggest optimal

capacity mix required to minimize system cost in

meeting the projected demand for future.

3.16 Standards issued but not yet effective

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new

standard or amendments to the existing standards

under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023,

MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting

Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies

(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules,

2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:

a.

Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements:

The amendments require companies to disclose

their material accounting policies rather than their

significant accounting policies. Accounting policy

information, together with other information, is

material when it can reasonably be expected to

influence decisions of primary users of general

purpose financial statements. The Group does not

expect this amendment to have any significant

impact in its financial statements.

b.

Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes: The amendments

clarify how companies account for deferred

tax

on

transactions

such

as

leases

and

decommissioning obligations. The amendments

narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption

in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition

exemption) so that it no longer applies to

transactions that, on initial recognition, give

rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary

differences. The Group is evaluating the impact, if

any, in its financial statements.

c.

Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes

in

Accounting

Estimates

and

Errors:

The

amendments will help entities to distinguish

between accounting policies and accounting

estimates.

The

definition

of

a

change

in

accounting estimates has been replaced with a

definition of accounting estimates. Under the new

definition, accounting estimates are “monetary

amounts in financial statements that are subject

to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop

accounting estimates if accounting policies

require items in financial statements to be

measured in a way that involves measurement

uncertainty. The Group does not expect this

amendment to have any significant impact in its

financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(All amounts in Rupees lakh, unless otherwise stated):

Managing Director of the Company along with the Board of Directors have been identified as the Chief

Operating Decision Maker (CODM) as defined by Ind AS 108 “Operating Segments”. Operating Segments have been defined

and presented based on the regular review by the CODM to assess the performance of each segment and to make decision

about allocation of resources. Accordingly, the Company has determined reportable segments by the nature of its products

and services, which are as follows:

a) Power exchange

b) Gas exchange

b) Carbon exchange

The Group prepares its segment information in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and

presenting the consolidated financial statements of the Group as a whole.

No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.

Information related to each reportable segment is set out below. Segment results (profit/(loss) before interest and tax is

used to measure performance because management believes that this information is most relevant in evaluating the

results of the respective segments.
