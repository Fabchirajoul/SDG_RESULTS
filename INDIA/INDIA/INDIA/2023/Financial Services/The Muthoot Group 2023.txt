Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to inform you that this was yet another

year where we demonstrated resilience amid industry

headwinds. However, as you have noticed over

the years, we continued to remain steadfast in our

focus towards promoting financial inclusion in the

country. As a result of our concerted efforts, we were

successfully able to end the seemingly slow year with

a record-breaking performance in the final quarter,

a testament to our undeterred focus irrespective of

external developments.

Operating backdrop

Before I delve into the details of our performance,

it is imperative that we talk about the economic

environment in which we operate. In the global context,

India has indeed been a silver lining; despite challenges

posed by inflation and supply chain disruptions,

the Indian economy displayed immense resilience,

George Jacob Muthoot

Chairman & Whole Time Director

With inflation and

geo-political tensions

looming large, gold continues

to be a safe-haven asset

and will be so over the

foreseeable future.

Muthoot Finance Limited

16:

Managing Director of Muthoot

Finance, delivered the keynote address.

We have already committed more than H1,000 million

for the upcoming financial year, with a primary

focus on initiatives in the domains of environment,

healthcare, and education. Our goal is to address

poverty and elevate the socio-economic status of

marginalised communities.

Way forward

I truly believe that the year under review just validated

something that we always knew: Our ability, grit and

determination to stay focused on our goals. I, on

behalf of the Board of Directors, would like to take this

opportunity to thank each and everyone associated

with us for their constant and unwavering support.

This business was started with the goal of promoting

financial inclusion in the country, and we will continue

to ensure that we are able to widen our horizons and

continue fulfilling the aspirations of the populace.
