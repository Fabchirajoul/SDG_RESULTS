Board of

Dear Shareholders,

As the Company celebrated its 60th anniversary

in 2022, let me begin by expressing my deepest

gratitude to all our shareholders, both past and

present. Your unwavering trust in the Cummins

brand and your shared commitment to our

mission, vision and values have been integral to

our success.

The dedication to our purpose, people and

impact remained at the forefront of all that we

accomplished in the past financial year, 2022-23.

We successfully propelled our company strategy

forward and extended a positive impact on our

valued customers, investors, suppliers, employees,

communities and the planet.

I am pleased to report that FY 2022-23 was a year

of outstanding performance for your Company.

We recorded the highest-ever revenue and profit

for the second financial year in a row due to

strong demand across various market segments

and geographies and the conscious efforts by

the Company on managing costs and improving

profitability. Despite inflationary pressures and

geo-political headwinds, we sustained our growth

momentum. As a part of a globally integrated

supply chain network, we were able to mitigate

the impact of ongoing supply chain constraints

and meet customer demand, underscoring the

resilience of our business.

At Cummins, we are driven by ‘Power With

Purpose’. Our purpose is to sustainably power a

more prosperous world for everyone. This purpose

guides us every day to live up to our brand promise

of innovation and dependability and contribute

toward the progress of all our stakeholders. In FY

2022-23, we continued to serve our customers,

focused on empowering our communities, and

as part of our PLANET 2050 strategy, we worked

on various environmental projects guided by the

mantra: use less, use better, and use again.

We aim to lead the way toward a prosperous and

more sustainable future for all while helping our

customers succeed.

We also understand the importance of Diversity,

Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) in powering innovation

and leveraging it as a competitive advantage. Our

enhanced global DE&I strategy focuses on policies

and processes that support the hiring, retention,

advancement and development of our people to

create a talent ecosystem that is future-ready and

able to help us achieve our goals.

2022 was also a momentous year for Cummins Inc.

with the appointment of Jennifer Rumsey as our

new Chief Executive Officer on August 1. She made

history as the first woman to hold this prestigious

position in the company’s over-century-long history.

Tom Linebarger, our long-standing global CEO,

transitioned to the role of Executive Chairman,

cementing Cummins’ commitment to diverse and

capable leadership.

Your Company’s focus on innovation and growth

has never been stronger, and I am excited about

the potential that lies ahead for us. By staying

nimble and responsive to external and economic

indicators and their impact on our customer

demand and operations, your Company is well-

positioned for long-term profitable growth. I am

grateful for your continued contributions to our

success and look forward to achieving even greater

things together.

Together, we will shape the next six decades and

beyond.

I would close by saying that, however good we are

today, we know the best is yet to come.

Steven

Thank You,:

letter finds you in good health.

As we celebrate another successful year, I want to

thank you, reflect on our accomplishments and look

ahead into the future.

2022 was a remarkable and historic year for our

country – India, and your Company, Cummins India

Limited (CIL). As India celebrated its 75th year of

independence, your Company also marked 60

years of its presence in India and is proud to have

been a part of the country’s growth story. Since

1962, we have believed in the potential of our

country and focused on opportunities to fuel its

progress.

Despite macroeconomic headwinds, we witnessed

a surge in demand across our domestic and export

markets in the past fiscal year, 2022-23, resulting in

a stellar financial performance.

We owe this success to the hard work and

dedication of our employees and the unwavering

support of our customers, investors, shareholders

and partners. These achievements were further

bolstered by several tailwinds driving India’s

economic growth, including the government’s

impetus on infrastructure development and

domestic manufacturing, stringent emission norms,

alternate fuels, rail, and other electrifications, and

various favorable policies.

Throughout FY 2022-23, your Company continued

to witness strong demand for its products in

domestic and international markets. Demand

was robust in business segments like Power

Generation for end markets like data centers,

hospitality, commercial realty and manufacturing.

The Aftermarket business also contributed strongly

to the Company’s success by living up to its

commitment to provide exceptional service and

support to our customers.

Exemplifying the success of the ‘Make in India’

initiative and bolstering our association with the

Indian Railways (IR), the Indian Army, and the

Indian Navy, the Company excelled in providing

indigenous and integrated customized solutions

such as the Hotel Load Converter, Diesel Electric

Tower Car (DETC) propulsion system, and bagged

the maiden order for submarine genset application.

Demonstrating our ongoing commitment to

Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), the

Company maintained its focus on sustainability

initiatives such as waste recycling, Greenhouse

Gas (GHG) reduction, solar PV installations,

regenerative dynos, water conservation, treated

water reuse, water neutrality, green supply chain,

and returnable packaging.

At Cummins, at the heart of our mission to power a

more prosperous world lies a deep-seated purpose

of empowering our people and communities. The

Company has always been driven by the ethos

of ‘Power with Purpose’ that has underpinned

our success for over six decades and continues

to shape a sustainable and prosperous future

for everyone. Our long-standing commitment to

our stakeholders—our communities, customers,

employees, partners and shareholders— remains

a top priority and is guided by a strong focus on

powering their progress.

A sustainable future is built on the foundation

of good governance and strong economic

performance. These factors are critical for the long-

term success of any business. With this in mind, I

am happy to share that starting FY 2022-23, CIL

Annual Report will now include a comprehensive
