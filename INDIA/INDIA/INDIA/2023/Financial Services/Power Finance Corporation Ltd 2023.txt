OPERATIONAL & FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE

The year 2022-23 was the year

of resurgence for PFC, as we

emerged from the adverse impact

of COVID and achieved impressive

growth along with outstanding

financial performance.

I am delighted to share that, in

FY 2022-23 we have delivered the

highest ever net profit of J11,605

crore, up 16% from the previous

fiscal. This is the third consecutive

year in which we are setting a new

record for the highest annual profit.

We registered double-digit growth

of 13% in our loan asset book.

As a result, loan asset portfolio

surpassed the J4 lakh crore mark

and stood at J4,22,498 crore as

on March 31, 2023. We have also

achieved an all-time high loan

sanctions of J2.32 lakh crore and

disbursed J85,756 crore during the

year, underscoring our role as the

principal lender to the Indian power

sector. On the asset quality front

also, significant strides have been

made in reducing Non-Performing

Assets, resulting in the NPA ratios

dipping to their lowest levels in the

past seven years. In the fiscal year

2023, the Net NPA ratio stood at

1.07%. Coupled with strong growth,

consistent profits and stable asset

quality, we continued to have a

robust net worth of J68,202 crore.

Continuing with our commitment

to maximise shareholders return,

we have declared a dividend of

J13.25 per share, which equates

to impressive 132.5% on the share

face value.

MACRO-ECONOMIC SCENARIO

& POWER SECTOR OUTLOOK

The global macroeconomic

scenario in FY 2022-23 has been

challenging, but India has been one

of the few bright spots, with the

economy continuing to grow at a

robust pace, supported by healthy

domestic demand and prudent

monetary policy.

This favourable economic

environment is set to benefit

the Power Sector's growth.

Untapped demand potential is

significant, driven by India's vast

population of nearly 1.44 billion.

The Government's "Make in India"

initiative and the Production-Linked

Incentive scheme are expected to

further boost demand. Projections

indicate a 7.18% Compound Annual

Growth Rate (CAGR) in India's

electricity consumption until 2027.

To address this growing demand,

additional capacity would be

needed. Government plans to

double the installed capacity, with

addition of around 500 GW of

capacity by 2032, with 87% from

non-fossil fuel sources and 13% from

fossil fuels, requiring an estimated

investment of approximately J31

lakh crore.

An integral aspect within the power

sector value chain is the role of

distribution companies (Discoms).

Over recent years, Discoms

have grappled with financial and

operational challenges, which has

put a strain on the entire power

sector value chain. However, a

transformative shift is underway.

The government has undertaken

significant reforms for Discoms

over the past two years. The impact

of these reformative measures, as

part of the Revamped Distribution

Sector Scheme (RDSS), is evident. All

India level AT&C losses are at 16.5%

in FY 2021-22, which is significantly

lower than FY 2020-21 figure of

21.5%. The ACS-ARR gap, which is

the cash-adjusted revenue gap per

unit of electricity sold, significantly

improved to 40 paise per unit in

FY 2021-22 compared to 89 paise per

unit in FY 2020-21.

Equally noteworthy is our success in

implementing the LPS Rules. Over

the past year, we have disbursed

loans worth J16,800 crore to power

distribution companies under

these rules.

The scheme has led

to a remarkable 40%

reduction in legacy dues

payable by distribution

utilities from their peak

level of J1.4 lakh crore.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Welcome to the 37th Annual General Meeting of your company.

Let me begin by congratulating you for yet another year of stellar

financial performance by your Company.

In connection with fine levied by NSE and BSE for non-appointment of

Independent Directors as stated in the previous question, since the

power to appoint Directors on the Board of the Company vests with

the President of India, acting through the administrative ministry i.e.,

Ministry of Power (MoP), Government of India, therefore the Company

has been requesting the appointing authority, i.e. MoP, for appointment

of requisite number of Independent Directors.

In view of the same, the Company has been requesting the stock

exchanges to waive off the said fines. It is pertinent to mention, that

BSE has already waived off the fine imposed on the Company for earlier

quarters i.e. July 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020.

The Company follows a Board approved methodology wherein

assessment for allowance is carried out by an external agency for

impairment based on certain guidelines and procedures in respect of

criterion/framework classifying the assets into various stages depending

upon credit risk and level of evidence of impairment.

Impairment loss measurement requires use of statistical models to

estimate the Probabilities of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and

Impairment loss.

The key indicators underlying for assessment of impairment allowance

are appraised on the ongoing basis by the management.

Our audit procedures included:

• Company has availed services of independent expert to estimate

the carrying value of the loan assets. We verified the criterion/

framework with various regulatory updates along with Company’s

internal guidelines and procedures in respect of the impairment

allowance as well as the completeness and accuracy of the data

shared with the independent experts.

• Recoveries are verified applying the standard audit procedures.

Loan balances are confirmed and quality of the borrower is

Letter of Comfort and Guarantee of ` 50.93 crore (as at 31.03.2022 ` 77.21 crore).

Loans to state sector are well diversified as these are extended to multiple entities under the control of various State

Governments and Central Government. The Company considers that these loans have a low credit risk in comparison to

lending to private sector mainly due to low default / loss history in state sector and availability of government guarantee

in certain loans. Presence of Government interest in these projects also lowers the risk of non-recoverability of dues.

Further, the Company has a lending portfolio comprising of loans to generation, renewable, transmission, distribution,

power projects & other infrastructure projects spread across diverse geographical areas.

Key Audit Matter

Auditors’ Response

(i)

Credit impairment of financial instruments- Loan Assets

The Holding Company follows a Board approved methodology

wherein assessment for allowance is carried out by an external agency

for impairment based on certain guidelines and procedures in respect

of criterion/framework classifying the assets into various stages

depending upon credit risk and level of evidence of impairment.

Impairment loss measurement requires use of statistical models to

estimate the Probabilities of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and

Exposure at Default (EAD). These models are key driver to measure

Impairment loss.

Our audit procedures included:

• The Holding Company has availed services of independent expert

to estimate the carrying value of the loan assets. We verified the

criterion/framework with various regulatory updates along with

Company’s internal guidelines and procedures in respect of the

impairment allowance as well as the completeness and accuracy

of the data shared with the independent experts.

• Recoveries are verified applying the standard audit procedures.

Loan balances are confirmed and quality of the borrower is

Upfront equity requirement, Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA), Debt Equity ratio, shareholders’ agreements,

(iii) Project Monitoring

PFC has comprehensive project/loan monitoring guidelines that captures aspects relating to monitoring, tracking of

project construction, implementation, identifies risks where intervention is required to minimise the time/ cost overruns/

consequent slippages in disbursements and including progress of commissioned projects.

For State sector projects, monitoring is carried out based on project progress details obtained regularly from borrowers

through progress monitoring reports, site visits, discussions with the borrowers, information/reports available on Central

Electricity Authority’s (CEA) website etc.

For private sector, where PFC is Lead Financial Institution (FI), PFC engages Lenders’ Engineers (LEs) and Lenders’ Financial

Advisors (LFAs), which are independent agencies to act on behalf of various lenders/consortium members. The LEs

conduct periodic site visits, review relevant documents, discusses with the borrowers and submit its reports on progress

of the project. LFAs submit the statements of fund flow and utilisation of funds in the project periodically. In cases where

PFC is not the lead FI, the tasks related to LEs and LFAs services are coordinated with the concerned lead lender. From

FY 2022-23 onwards PFC has started empanelling Project Management Agency (PMA), as a single entity, for private sector

projects, thereby facilitating better coordination of project monitoring activities.

Also, the consolidated periodic progress report of certain projects is prepared comprising important observations/ issues

viz. areas of concern, reasons for delay, issues affecting project construction/ implementation etc. and is reviewed by PFC

on a regular basis.

PFC continuously monitors delays and/or default of borrowers and their recoverability. On occurrence of default in the

borrower’s account, PFC initiates necessary steps which may involve action(s) including, but not limited to, Special Mention

Account (SMA) reporting to RBI, credit information reporting to Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC)

etc., regularisation of the account by recovering all overdues, invocation of guarantees/securities to recover the dues,

conversion of loan into equity as per loan agreement, restructuring of loan account, formulating resolution plan with the

borrower, change in ownership, Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under IBC -2016, sale of the exposures to

other entities/investors, other recovery mechanisms like referring the case for legal action before Debt Recovery Tribunal

(DRT), SARFAESI, etc. and other actions as specified under regulatory/legal framework.

B. In respect of RECL

The credit risk is managed at different levels including at appraisal, disbursements and post disbursement monitoring. RECL has

"Integrated Rating Guidelines" and "Comprehensive Risk Management Policy". To mitigate credit risk, RECL follows systematic

institutional and project appraisal process to assess the credit risk. These processes include a detailed appraisal methodology,

identification of risks and suitable structuring and credit risk mitigation measures. Further, on periodic basis, the loan assets

are reviewed and categorised as High/Moderate/Low based on ECL Methodology. The process for Credit Risk Management is

as under:

(i)

RECL has "Integrated Rating Guidelines" covering credit assessment, risk grading, collateral requirements, reporting,

monitoring of end utilisation of funds etc. Further, independent Lender legal counsels are appointed to ensure effective

documentation and mitigation of legal risk.

(ii)

For all existing private sector projects, where RECL is Lead Financial Institution, RECL engages Lender’s Independent

Engineers (LIE), Lender’s Financial Advisors (LFA) and Lender’s Insurance Advisors (LIA), which are independent agencies

who act on behalf of various lenders and consortium members. LIE conducts periodic site visits and submits reports on

progress status of the project, after discussion with borrower and inspection/review of relevant documents. LFA submit

the statements of fund flow and utilisation of funds in the project periodically. In cases where RECL is not the lead Financial

Institution, the tasks related to LIE and LFA services are being coordinated with the lead lender.

Letter of Comfort (LoC) and Guarantee of ₹ 66.80 crore. (As at 31.03.2022 ₹ 98.11 crore.)

Loans to state sector are well diversified as these are extended to multiple entities under the control of various State Governments

and Central Government. The Companies considers that these loans have a low credit risk in comparison to lending to private

sector mainly due to low default/loss history in state sector and availability of government guarantee in certain loans. Presence of

Government interest in these projects also lowers the risk of non-recoverability of dues.

Further, the Companies have a lending portfolio comprising of loans to generation, renewable, transmission and distribution power

projects spread across diverse geographical areas.

B. In respect of PFCCL

The trade receivables of PFCCL comprises mainly amount recoverable from the State Government entities. RECL considers that

the exposure to state sector have a low credit risk mainly due to low default/ loss history. Further, the presence of Government

interest lowers the risk of non-recoverability.

Subsequent to initial recognition, PFCCL recognises expected credit loss (ECL) on financial assets especially on trade receivables

other than related parties. ECL is recognised at 100% on the trade receivables due for more than 2 years and 50% on the trade

receivables due for more than one year and less than 2 years.
