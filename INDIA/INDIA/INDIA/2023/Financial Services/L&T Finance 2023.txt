Board. The NRC ensures that the Board comprises the

required number of Independent Directors, who meet

Director's Responsibility Statement,

which subsequently constitutes a part in the Board's report

as per Section 134(3)(c) of the Act.

Additionally, the Audit Committee reviews changes,

if any, in the accounting policies and practices, along

with the reasons behind them. This review also includes

significant accounting entries involving estimates based

on the exercise of judgement by management, significant

adjustments made in the financial statements due to

audit findings, compliance with listing and other legal

requirements regarding financial statements, disclosure

of any related party transactions, and qualifications in the

draft audit report.

The Committee also reviews, with the management,

the quarterly and annual financial statements before

submission to the Board for approval. This review is critical

to ensuring that the financial statements are accurate and

complete and that the Company is meeting its financial

objectives.

Another important responsibility of the Audit Committee

is to review, with the management, the statement of uses/

application of funds raised through an issue (public issue,

rights issue, and preferential issue, among others.), the

statement of funds utilised for purposes other than those

stated in the offer document/prospectus/notice and the

report submitted by the monitoring agency engaged in

monitoring the utilisation of proceeds of a public or rights

issue and making appropriate recommendations to the

Board.

The Committee also reviews and monitors the auditor's

independence and performance, as well as the

effectiveness of the audit process. This review is critical

to ensuring that the auditors are performing their duties

in a professional and ethical manner, and that the audit

process is effective in detecting and reporting any financial

irregularities or fraud.

The Independent Directors serving on the Committee

approve the related party transactions, including any

subsequent modifications. This review is crucial to ensure

that all transactions with related parties are conducted at

an arms-length basis, and your Company is not engaging

in any activities that may be deemed to be a conflict

of interest.

Audit Committee

The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing

your Company's financial reporting process and

the disclosure of its financial information to ensure

that the financial statements are correct, sufficient,

and credible. This oversight is critical to maintain

the Company's reputation and credibility in the

financial marketplace. The Committee must ensure

that the financial statements are prepared in

accordance with the applicable laws and present

a clear and accurate picture of the Company's

financial position.

The Independent Chairperson of the Audit

Committee is required to have interaction with

the Credit rating agencies once every year without

the presence of the management. The interaction

mainly pertains to discussing various matters

including related party transactions, internal

financial controls and other material disclosures

made by the management, which have a bearing

on the ratings.

LTF is dedicated to upholding high standards of ethical

behaviour in its business and operations. It has established

a policy framework that fosters ethical conduct, outlines

stakeholder expectations, and provides remedial measures

Code of Conduct

Your Company has a Code of Conduct (CoC) that is equally

applicable to all its employees, including Executive and

for individuals, fair employment practices, bribery

and corruption, privacy of employees, information

confidentiality, conflict of interest, whistle blower policy,

breach/violation of the code, environment, health, and

insider trading, among others.

personal relationships, and the use of your Company

assets. During the reporting period, no complaints were

received regarding the conflict of interest. Moreover, there

were no fines or penalties paid related to law enforcement

agencies/regulators during the financial year.

The CoC must be read and agreed to by every employee

of LTF through a written or digital acknowledgment. This

document validates that the employee has understood the

CoC and will be operating according to it. The newly hired

employees receive CoC training during their induction

programme. Additionally, existing employees who are not

in frontline positions are required to complete the CoC

e-learning module every year and take an assessment post-

completion of the module.

Your Company has established a CoC Committee that

addresses breaches or incidents raised by an employee,

or any conflict of interest identified by an employee.

Employees are required to report any instance of breach or

violation of the human rights violations to code@ltf.com

During the reporting period, there were no instances

of breaches of the CoC reported. Also, no fines or

settlements related to anti-competitive or anti-trust were

For the purpose of determining the ratio of remuneration and percentage increase in remuneration of directors as stipulated in Sr. No. 1 & 2 above, only

remuneration of Executive Director is considered.

(2)

Considering that the Company is a Core Investment Company which carries on its business through its underlying subsidiaries and the Executive Director

is entrusted with group level responsibilities, comparing the ratio of the remuneration of the Director to the median remuneration of the employees of the

Company would not be meaningful.

(3) Also a KMP of a wholly-owned subsidiary.

Managing Director of the

Company is not serving as an Independent Director

in any Company.

None of the Directors of the Company are inter-se

related to each other.

2.

Board Procedure:

The Board meets at regular intervals and the Board

meetings (including Committee meetings) serve as

a forum for Board/ Committee members to come

together and deliberate on critical matters related

to the organization’s strategy, operations, financial

performance, and governance. These meetings of

the Company as well as its subsidiaries are held at

regular intervals, and a tentative annual calendar

of the Board and Committee meetings is circulated

to the Directors in advance to facilitate them to

plan their schedule and to ensure meaningful

participation in the meetings. However, in case

of a special and urgent business need, separate

special Board / Committee meetings are held or

the approval is taken by passing resolution(s) by

circulation, as permitted by law, which is noted in

the subsequent meeting.

The Company Secretary approaches various

business / department heads in advance with regard

to matters requiring the approval of the Board /

Committees to enable inclusion of the same in

the agenda for the Board / Committee meetings.

Board members receive detailed agendas including

relevant materials, such as reports, financial

statements, and other necessary documents, well

in advance of the Meeting enabling them to review

and prepare for discussions. During the meeting,

the Board engages in structured discussions,

allowing each member to share insights, ask

questions, and express their viewpoints.

Where it is not practicable to circulate any document

in advance or if the agenda is of a confidential

nature, the same is presented directly at the

meeting. In special and exceptional circumstances,

consideration of additional or supplementary

items are taken up with the approval of the Chair

and majority of Directors. Senior management is

invited to the Board / Committee meeting(s) to

provide additional inputs for the items pertaining

to their line of business / function being discussed

by the Board / Committee(s). The Board members

interact with the Senior Management (including

Chief Executives) of the various operating

subsidiary companies frequently including at the

Board meetings.

Further, presentations are made on business

operations to the Board by the respective

Senior Management covering business strategy

and updates on business, macro economic

development, IT and data analytics and initiatives

towards environmental, social and governance

(ESG) aspects. Additionally, presentations are

made on various matters including the financial

statements, fund raising program, operations

related issues, the regulatory environment or any

other issue which the Board is required / wants to be

apprised of. The Company Secretary is responsible

for preparation of the agenda and convening of

the Board and Committee meetings. The Company

Secretary attends all the meetings of the Board

and its Committees, advises / assures the Board on

compliance and governance principles and ensures

appropriate recording of minutes of the meetings.

With a view to leveraging technology and reducing

paper consumption, the Company has adopted a

web-based application for transmitting Board /

Committee agenda and minutes. The Directors of

the Company receive the agenda in electronic form

through this application, which can be accessed

only through i-Pad. The application meets the high

standards of security and integrity that is required

for storage and transmission of Board / Committee

agenda and minutes in electronic form.

The draft minutes of the proceedings of the

meetings of the Board / Committee(s) are circulated

to all the members of the Board or the Committee

for their perusal, within fifteen days from the date

of the conclusion of the meeting. Comments, if any,

received from the Directors are incorporated in the

minutes. The minutes are approved by the members

of the Board / Committee(s) and confirmed in

accordance with the regulatory requirements.

Contingent Liabilities

–

The Company has assessed its obligations arising in the normal course of business, proceedings pending

with tax authorities and other contracts including derivative and long term contracts wherever applicable.

In accordance with the provisions of Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) - 37 on ‘Provisions, Contingent

Liabilities and Contingent Assets’, the Company recognises a provision for material foreseeable losses when

it has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be

required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. In cases where the

available information indicates that the loss on the contingency is reasonably possible but the amount of loss

cannot be reasonably estimated, a disclosure to this effect is made as contingent liabilities in the financial

statements. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially adverse

effect on its financial statements.

This disclosure is given pursuant to the notification no. DNBS.CC.PD.No. 252/03.10.01/2011-12 dated December 26, 2011 issued by Reserve

Bank of India.

The Group has assessed its obligations arising in the normal course of business, proceedings pending

with tax authorities and other contracts including derivative and long term contracts wherever applicable.

In accordance with the provisions of Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) - 37 on ‘Provisions, Contingent

Liabilities and Contingent Assets’, the Group recognises a provision for material foreseeable losses when it

has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be

required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. In cases where the

available information indicates that the loss on the contingency is reasonably possible but the amount of loss

cannot be reasonably estimated, a disclosure to this effect is made as contingent liabilities in the financial

statements. The Group does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially adverse effect

on its financial statements.
