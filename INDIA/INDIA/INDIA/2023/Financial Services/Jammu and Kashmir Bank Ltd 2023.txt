Maintenance of Secretarial record is the responsibility of the management of the Bank. Our responsibility is to

express an opinion on these secretarial records based on our audit.

I have followed the audit practices and processes as were appropriate to obtain reasonable assurance about the

correctness of the contents of the Secretarial records during the period of my audit. The audit process was carried

on the basis of documents, reports and records made available to me, which were relied upon as audit evidence for

conducting the audit.

The verification was done on test check basis to ensure that correct facts are reflected in secretarial records. I

believe that the process and practices, I followed provide a reasonable basis for my opinion.

Wherever required, I have obtained the management representation about list of applicable laws, compliance of laws,

rules and regulations and happening of events etc.

The compliance of the provisions of corporate and other applicable laws, rules, regulations and standards is the

of Corporate Governance codes and apply it innovatively in a

more meaningful manner, thereby making it relevant to the

organization that is operating in a specific environment.

In line with its vision, Bank wants to use Corporate Governance

innovatively in a transitional economy like Jammu and

Kashmir. The Bank wants to use Corporate Governance as

an instrument of economic and social transformation. Given

the fact that J&K Bank is seen as a great success of “public-

private partnership”, our Bank as a business is expected to

play a pivotal role in social transformation of the economy.

This lends urgency to implementation of good governance

practices which go beyond the Corporate Governance code.

We, as the prime corporation of Jammu and Kashmir

and Ladakh, have a focused interest in making the Union

Territories a safe place for business. Bank has a key role

to play in providing public and private services, financial

infrastructure and employment. As such, the efficiency and

accountability of the corporation is a matter of both private

and public interest and governance, therefore, comes at the

top of the agenda. The fact that the Bank is majorly owned

by the Government of UT of J&K and UT of Ladakh but

professionally managed to take care of interests of all stake

holders which include sizable number of other investors,

makes governance critical. For us, Corporate Governance is

concerned with the systems of laws, regulations and practices,

which will promote enterprise, ensure accountability and

trigger performance. The Bank, for one, stands for being

more accountable, practice self-policing and make financial

transactions transparent and constitutional.

VISION

social transformation across the country through a deep

commitment to value creation for all our stakeholders, while

continuing to build on our historic business relationship with

Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.

c) Audit Qualifications made by SCA's

Statement on Impact of Audit Qualifications (for audit

report with modified opinion) submitted along-with Annual

Audited Financial Results - [Standalone and Consolidated

separately)

We draw attention to the matter described below, the

possible effects of undetected mis-statements on the

financial statements due to the inability to obtain sufficient

and appropriate audit evidence which is material but, not

pervasive either individually or in aggregate.

a) Refer to Note No. 1.4 of Schedule 18 of the financial

statements regarding the allotment of 7 Crore Equity Shares

aggregating Rs. 274.75 Crore for Rs. 39.25 per share (at a

face value of Rs. 1/-) to 9834 employees by the Bank on 21st

March, 2023 under the J&K Bank Employee Stock Purchase

Scheme, 2023 (JKBESPS 2023).

The Compensation Committee of the Board approved the ESPS

issue open date as 15th March, 2023 and the issue close date

as 21st March, 2023. During the process of issue of certificate

for listing purpose, we came across from the sample data of

employees (who have applied for issue) that the employees

availed their existing/ freshly enhanced facilities of general-

purpose cash credit limit and personal loan accounts and

transferred amounts from such Ioan accounts to their saving

bank accounts from where the amount for share issue was

debited/ ( money was given). These transfers from credit

facility to saving bank account were made during the period

of opening of ESPS or just before that to allotment of shares

under ESPS. This use of credit facility is not in line with RBI

Directions. It has also been noticed that Allotment was made

on 21.03.2023 and payment was realized on 22.03.2023 and

23.03.2023. Further to substantiate the facts, we requested

the management to provide us the information regarding

the number of shares allotted to employees where amount

was transferred from general purpose Cash Credit Limits

and Personal Loan Accounts of the employees to saving

bank accounts during the period of opening to allotment

of ESPS but management vide its letters dated 25.04.2023

& 02.05.2023 submitted that “The funds have been purely

debited from the saving accounts of the respective employees

under their mandate”. We also escalated the issue to Audit

Committee of Board on 17.04.2023 vide our detailed queries

along with supporting documents but a reply from ACB is still

awaited.
