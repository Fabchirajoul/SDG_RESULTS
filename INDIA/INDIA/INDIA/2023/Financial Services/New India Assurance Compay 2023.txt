Chairman-cum-: Managing

Dear Shareholders,

I take the opportunity to congratulate and thank all the

stakeholders on the completion of 104 years of successful

operations of our great Company. Our history is replete

with golden moments from the time it commenced

operations in 1919 and spread its wings, through the

turbulent days of the pre-independence period and the

Word War II, the freedom struggle when all Indians stood

as one, the post-independence days of heady freedom

and nationalistic pride, subsequent nationalization when

there were only 4 PSU Insurers and then the de-tariff

era where today we compete with 25 General Insurers,

5 Standalone Health Insurers and 2 Specialist Insurers.

All throughout the Company has always remained

adequately capitalized. Today we have around 1 lakh

shareholders across various categories. The Government

of India currently holds 85.44% of the total shares of the

Company.

The expectations of our stakeholders have always

remained a motivation for us to meet the highest level of

business performance, ethics and standards. New India

continues to be the market leader with the highest market

share of 13.42% in the non-life insurance industry in

India. Gross Written Premium increased by 5.3% for New

India as the Company pursued its strategy of growth with

profitability, which meant that the Company had to let go

of some businesses where the price was inadequate,

or the terms were unfavourable. The conscious call and

efforts taken by the Company to weed out loss-making

accounts in Group Mediclaim and Crop Insurance

business has resulted in a lower market share compared

to last year. But there has been a resultant improvement

in the operating performance of the Company.

Profit After Tax has increased to Rs 1,055 Crores in this

financial year as compared to a Profit After Tax of Rs

164 in the previous financial year, an increase of nearly

543%. Underwriting results were negatively impacted to

an extent of Rs 224 Crores due to adverse development

of claims pertaining to the previous years in the crop line

of business. Some major losses in foreign operations

also negatively impacted on the full year’s results by Rs

107 Crores. The Company’s guarded approach to Group

Mediclaim will continue. Strict implementation of the

guidelines framed by the Company has enabled the ICR

of Group Mediclaim to reduce to 105% in Financial Year

2023 from a high of 120% in Financial Year 2022. The

Company has rolled out price increase in Retail Health

which will be effective from FY 2024, and the Company’s

focus is on increasing its footprint in the retail health

segment.

After muted performance over last many years, New

India saw good growth in the motor portfolio once

again and steps are being taken to reduce loss ratio

in this segment. In Financial Year 2023, the Company

absorbed the entire impact of the wage arrears and

additional provisioning on account of employee benefits

to the extent of Rs 3,445 Crores. Despite additional profit

realization of equity portfolio to offset this impact, the fair

value change continues to remain healthy in excess of

Rs. 18,000 Crores as of Financial Year 2023.

The Company declared a dividend of Rs 1.93 per share

adhering to its stated Dividend Distribution Policy of

30% of Profit After Tax as Dividend. The performance of

the Company was also well recognized and it received

a number of prestigious awards during the year. The

Company has been conferred the most preferred

workplace award and the General Insurance company

of the year award by ET Ascent for Excellence and

Leadership in BFSI.:

Taxation:

a)

Income Tax: Provision for Tax ₹ 21,386.06 Lakhs

(P.Y. ₹ 1173.29 Lakhs) (Current Tax) shown in Profit

and Loss Account includes ₹ 2,364.72 Lakhs (P.Y. ₹

1,036.83 Lakhs) relating to foreign taxes.

b)

The Company was claiming exemption u/s 10(38) of

the Income Tax Act, 1961 till FY 2017-18 in respect

of profit on sale of investments. The deduction

under section 10(38) has been disallowed by the

department and the matter in certain years has been

decided in favour of the company up-to Bombay

High Court & ITAT while there are cases pending in

appeal at different levels by the department as well

as by the company. Finance Act, 2018 introduced

grandfathering provisions u/s 55(2)(ac) of the

Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of profit on sale

of investments and deduction for the same was

being claimed by the company up-to the FY 2021-

22 based on the earlier judicial pronouncements in

its favour. The said deduction for FY 2018-19 has

also been disallowed by the department and the

company has filed appeal against the same which

is pending. Effective current financial year, based

on the opinion from Tax consultants and Senior Tax

counsels, the Company has decided to not claim the

deduction of grandfathering and the total income of

the Company for the year has been computed as

per the normal provisions of the Act.

Accordingly, the tax expenses of earlier years have

been recalculated and as a result the company has

utilized previous years carry forward losses and MAT

credit available in earlier years in accordance with

the Accounting Standard 22 “Accounting for Taxes

on Income”. The Company had not recognised MAT

Credit in the earlier periods due to prudence and

absence of convincing evidence of utilising it. The

company has decided to utilize the available MAT

Credit of previous years to the extent of eligible

credit required to be set off against tax computed as

per the normal provisions of the Act. Therefore, total

MAT credit of ₹ 24,802.43 Lakhs which includes

previous year utilisation amounting to ₹ 3113.47

Lakhs, has been recognised and utilized.

Based on the opinion of the Tax consultant and

the judicial pronouncements available till date, the

management is confident of matters relating to

Section 10(38) will be decided in its favour and the

MAT credit recognised will be fully realised.

c)

The Income Tax Assessments of the Company have

been completed up to assessment year 2019-20.

Major disputed demands are in respect of profit on

sale of investment, IBNR, expenses paid to Auto tie-

up dealers. Based on the decisions of the appellate

authority, the interpretations of the relevant

provisions, the management of the Company is of

the opinion that the demands are likely to be either

deleted or substantially reduced and accordingly no

provision has been made for the same.

d)

Deferred Taxes:

The components of temporary differences resulting

into Deferred Tax Assets/(Liabilities) are as under:
