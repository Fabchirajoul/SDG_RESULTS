Letter to Shareholders: Dear Shareholders,

Greetings!

With the Sensex at a historic high, stable GDP growth,

inflation under control, a record number of people

lifted out of multidimensional poverty… suddenly a

rainbow of positive news about the Indian economy

is making the headlines in stark contrast to the global

economic scenario.

To begin with, the world economy has faced significant

shocks in the past three years, including the COVID-19

pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and monetary

tightening by central banks to combat inflationary

pressures and so on. However, that hasn’t derailed

the Indian growth story post the inevitable Covid blip.

As Capital Group notes in its newsletter*, “Corporate

confidence is high, the economy is expanding at a

decent clip and technological innovation is leading to

new areas of growth”.

The Prime Minister’s long term game plan of developing

infrastructure and making India a manufacturing and

export hub, powered by schemes like Skill India and

Make in India have started bearing fruit. Despite the

temptation, the government has shown admirable

fiscal prudence. Further, the government has ushered

in reforms like bringing GST, simplifying labour code,

introducing RERA, Bankruptcy code among slew of

big-ticket changes*. While introduction of UPI shows

India’s digital prowess, cleaning up of bank books

have helped in shoring up investors’ confidence. The

PLI scheme is set to be the bulwark of a manufacturing

upsurge in the country.

As foreign companies look for a ‘China plus one’

strategy, India has a real chance of gaining prominence.

The government is looking to cut compliance issues to

improve ‘Ease of Doing Business’ parameters making

investing in India an attractive proposition. India is

currently the 5th largest economy in the world, and if

Goldman Sachs is to be believed, it is likely to become

the 2nd largest economy in the next 50 years. Thus,

while the path to prosperity is long and arduous, the

outlook is extremely promising.

The life insurance industry in India has seen an

increased focus on protection and withdrawal

planning, driven by heightened awareness among

the middle class. Insurance penetration is rising, and

the sector benefits from government interventions,

favourable regulations, and partnerships. The industry

has experienced growth in premium and assets under

management. Government schemes like Pradhan

Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan

Jyoti Bima Yojana, and Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana

Yojana have contributed to the sector's growth. Yet,

the industry also faces challenges particularly due to

recently imposed tax measures for the Life Insurance

sector.

Turning more specifically to your company, I am

Ease of Doing Business

parameters making

investing in India an

attractive proposition.

Obviously, several

challenges remain in India’s

path of becoming a 5

trillion-dollar economy.

STRATEGIC REVIEW

FINANCIAL REVIEW:

Dear Shareholders,

The year 2022 went by with significant economic

uncertainty compounded by recent events across the

financial system, including volatile equity markets,

rising interest rates, and a looming recession across

global markets. However, the Indian economy has

managed the difficulties to become the fifth biggest

economy with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

of $3.75 trillion in 2023 owing to quick vaccination

coverage, incisive international governance, and

strong domestic industrial production.

With India’s economic resilience, the life insurance

industry also grew. Max Life performed well across all

key metrics in FY 2022 -23. And if we chart our growth

over the last five years, we have produced consistent

outcomes in every business area. Our individual

new business has expanded faster than the overall

industry average of 10%, with a CAGR of 13%. While

our proprietary channels saw an impressive 21%

CAGR, the bancassurance channel grew at a healthy

11% CAGR in the period. While retaining a dominant

position in online protection over the past five years,

we have tripled our retail protection business. Our

robust investing strategy is evidenced by a CAGR of

19% in our assets under management.

In terms of the FY 2023 business performance, Max

Life secured a 9.8% market share amongst the top

10 private players in individual adjusted first-year

premium, ranking fifth in the industry. During the year,

the total new business premium increased by 13%

to `8,960 crore, while a 19% growth was achieved

in the Sum Assured in-force over the previous year.

A robust fiscal for Max Life saw the value of new

business (VNB) increase to `1,949 crore, representing

a year-on-year growth of 28%. Max Life’s embedded

value stood at `16,263 crore, and the operating Return

on EV (RoEV) improved to 22.1% year-on-year. This

fiscal, we generated a post-tax shareholders’ profit of

CEO: Letter to Shareholders

`435 crore, as compared to `387 crore in the previous

financial year, recording an increase of 12%. Despite

the challenges posed by the open architecture model

in the year, we have demonstrated our execution

prowess by maintaining our counter share in the

bancassurance channel over a 15-month period,

validating our business tenacity.

At Max Life, we have always believed in creating long-

term value for our shareholders. To deliver consistent

and long-term profitability for the company and our

shareholders, last year, we refreshed our 5-year

strategy framework (FY21-FY26) with six key pillars

with which we have continued to focus on to build

business muscle this year.
