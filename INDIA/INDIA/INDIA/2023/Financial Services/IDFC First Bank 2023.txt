Dear Shareholders,

It gives me immense pleasure as the Chairman of IDFC FIRST

Bank to write to you in the Annual Report 2022-23.

Today, as we reflect on the global economic landscape, we

find ourselves navigating unprecedented challenges. The world

has witnessed the intricate interplay of macroeconomic factors

affecting international trade, financial markets, technology

disruption and innovation and geopolitical uncertainties. Let me

share an overview of the global economic outlook and trends,

which are crucial for understanding the direction of the global

economy in the future.

Based on current projections, global growth rate is expected to

decline to 2.8 percent in 2023, followed by a modest recovery

to 3.0 percent in 2024. Inflation also remains persistent, with

core inflation exceeding target levels in most inflation-targeting

economies, even as global headline inflation is expected

to decrease.

Despite global uncertainties, India has emerged as a shining

star in the global economy, surpassing expectations with a

robust FY23 real GDP growth of 7.2%, ahead of all emerging

TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE

INNOVATION

AND GROWTH

Sanjeeb Chaudhuri

Chairman

As a Board, we are committed to the

ESG agenda as it is extremely important

for the future of our country and our planet.

By incorporating ESG considerations in our

day to day working, we can not only create

long-term value for your Bank but also

contribute positively to the environment

and the society in which we live.

Managing Director & CEO: Dear Shareholders,

It’s a great pleasure writing to all of you on the occasion of

IDFC FIRST Bank’s Annual Report for the year 2022-23.

First, a few words in the context we operate in. India is well

placed with moderate inflation and strong GDP growth. India is

powering up today with a few key pillars including acceptance

of entrepreneurship as a key driver of progress, accelerated

pace of capital expenditure, providing social benefits to the

bottom of economic pyramid, building digital ecosystems,

increased financialization, liberalisation, reforms like GST, and

timely shift towards a “green” economy.

If India stays on such course of reforms, and continues

investing in physical, digital, and social infrastructure, we will

all see the miracle of India almost reaching developed country

status within our lifetimes, exceeding per capita income of

$15,000 by 2050.

In the medium term, with the economy projected to touch

$7 trillion economy by 2030, a significant shift is underway –

millions of people are advancing from lower to mid-income tiers

and from middle to upper class. Rising disposable incomes

empower citizens to aspire for and afford enhanced quality

of life. A recent UN report notes that India lifted 415 million

EMPOWERING

THE FUTURE

from poverty in 15 years. The next 10 years will be better,

and that’s how the power of compounding works. The basket

of goods and services consumed will change dramatically,

and the economic progress will offer immense opportunities

in Banking and Financial services.

The RBI is ever watchful, and forward-looking at the same time.

They are sensitive toward the lower sections of society and

hence a push from the regulator towards financial inclusion

but they insist on high asset quality at the same time. It is more

possible to address this paradox today than before because

India has created a unique digital infrastructure, including credit

bureaus, biometrics, e-KYC, e-agreement, e-verification, and

e-cash flow assessment, where we get more precise, digitised

information and trackability of transactions and cash flows.

Coming to our Bank, I’m happy to share that the bank has come

through its unique birth pangs of a DFI (Development Financial

Institution) converting to a universal Bank and has emerged

very strong. In the private sector, after ICICI Bank in 2002, we

are the only other institution which has successfully managed

such a transition, which was done under the leadership of my

former boss, the legendary Mr. K V Kamath.

There is a push from the regulator

towards financial inclusion and they insist

on high asset quality at the same time. It is

more possible to address this paradox today

than before because India has created

a unique digital infrastructure, including

credit bureaus, biometrics, e-KYC...
