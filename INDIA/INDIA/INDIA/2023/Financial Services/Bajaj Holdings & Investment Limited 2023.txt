Managing Director who is the Chief Operating

Decision Maker. The Core Management Committee examines performance both from product and a

geographical perspective.

15. Foreign currency translation

Functional and presentational currency

The standalone financial statements are presented in INR which is also functional currency of

the Company.

Transactions and balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the spot rate of

exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional

currency at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on non–trading

activities are taken to other income/expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the

spot exchange rates as at the date of recognition.

16. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk of firm commitments.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and

are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain/

loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and

effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Statement of Profit

and Loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged item.

The Company enters into derivative financial instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts to

manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risks. The Company does not hold derivative financial

instruments for speculative purposes.

Hedge accounting

The Company designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk as cash flow

hedges. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the

hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management
