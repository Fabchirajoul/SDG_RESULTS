Dear Stakeholders,

It is my privilege to share with you the overall

developments in the economy, banking sector and

journey of Bank of Baroda in FY 2022-23 (FY 2023).

Global economy

The Financial Year 2023 started amidst the shadow

of war between Russia and Ukraine. The world had

gradually started recovering from the economic

slowdown and hardships due to the Covid19 pandemic,

and it was at this time that geo-political tussle occurred

between Russia and Ukraine. These two countries

being the key suppliers of major commodities like

food and energy, the war between these two countries

led to supply chain disruptions and substantial jolt to

commodity markets globally.

Following this, the prices of energy, food grains and

(AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs).

Subsequently central banks of the major economies

were compelled to tighten their monetary policy

stances. The US Fed Reserve has increased its policy

rates by 500bps (cumulative) since March 2022, while

Bank of England (BoE) and European Central Bank

(ECB) followed with rate hikes of 440bps and 370bps

respectively, during the same period.

The emerging market and developing economies also

experienced the shock waves of different wave lengths.

put pressure on the value of their domestic currencies.

According to IMF, the global economy has moderated

to 3.4% in 2022 from 6.3% in 2021 and is expected to

Domestic economy

Coming to the domestic economy, the Indian economy

has comparatively performed well and positioned better

through its strategic policy decisions in the context of

the adverse global economic scenario as mentioned

DERYH 7KLV ZDV PDLQO\ EHFDXVH RI SURDFWLYH ÀVFDO

policy and regulatory measures which were already

aligned to revive the economy with stimulus policy

measures in order to come out of the sluggishness in

economic activities caused by the Covid-’19 pandemic.

Further India’s quick response to International issues

like the Russia-Ukraine war and related matters

through country’s diplomatic policies have also helped

to safeguard the Indian economy from a free fall to a

large extent.

India’s GDP growth for the FY 2023 has been registered

at 7.2%, which can be considered as a good number

as compared with the growth of other economies in the

Dear Stakeholders,

I am delighted to present before you the highlights of the

Bank’s performance during the Financial Year, 2022-23.

FY2023 represents a watershed year for your Bank with a

quantum shift in terms of performance in almost every area -

The Indian economy has weathered these challenges and

continues to be the fastest growing economy in the world.

The digitisation of the personal loans has resulted in a stellar

101.5% growth. The corporate segment, which had seen

relatively tepid growth in the previous year too recovered

smartly with a growth of 13.2%, driven by the large capex

push of the Government, improved capacity and working

capital utilisation.

Striking the right Asset liability balance

With the loan growth outpacing the deposit growth, the asset

liability management has been of paramount importance.

Growth of term deposits was targeted at a relatively shorter
