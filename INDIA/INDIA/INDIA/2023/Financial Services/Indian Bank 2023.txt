Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present to you the performance

highlights of your Bank for the financial year 2022-23.

Business growth and the details of accomplishments

and initiatives of the Bank are provided in the Annual

Report for the year. The performance of your Bank

came in an economic environment where the major

economies around the world faced unprecedented

inflation & monetary tightening, which led to global

slowdown.

Now, let me begin with a short preview of the prevailing

financial eco-system and the outlook for global and

Indian economy.

Global Economy:

Global economic activity remains resilient amidst the

persistence of inflation at elevated levels, debacle of

banks in some advanced economies, tight financial

conditions

and

continued

geopolitical

tensions.

Now, the Supply-chain disruptions are normalising,

the disorders to energy and food markets caused

by the geo-political conflict are also receding. The

synchronous tightening of monetary policy by most

central banks have started bearing fruits, with inflation

moving back toward its targeted levels.

Unhedged foreign currency exposure

The Bank has in place a policy on managing credit risk arising out of Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposures of

its borrowers. Where there is no natural hedge, forward cover is suggested to customers in respect of import/

export transactions. The forward cover will act as Unhedged risk mitigation on exchange risk. While sanctioning

the facilities, Bank is ensuring that all the exposures (fund based and non-fund based including Letter of

comfort/ Letter of undertaking) in foreign currencies are covered by forward cover. Request for considering

waiver of forward cover if any is considered only at corporate office level. While reviewing the borrowal accounts,

unhedged exposure are captured and impact is analysed in credit proposals.

Letter DOS.ARG.No.6270/08.91.001/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020 (as amended) (the “RBI communication”)

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Indian Bank as of March 31, 2023 in

conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date

which includes internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Bank’s branches.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the

internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of

internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued

by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and

maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and

efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the

prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and

the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the

circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based

on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls

Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”)

and the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by the ICAI, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial

controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and

perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial

reporting were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial

controls over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over

financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting,

assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating

effectiveness of internal financial controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the

auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial

Statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the branch auditors, in

terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a

basis for our audit opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A Bank’s internal financial controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance

regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external

purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial controls over

financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in

reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide

reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone Financial

Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of

the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and Board of Directors of the

Bank; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition,

use, or disposition of the Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.:
