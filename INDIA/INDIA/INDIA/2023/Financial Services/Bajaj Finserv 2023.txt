Overview

You will agree with me that these are very creditable results.

Before closing let me share with you something that is very dear to my heart. It is an employability initiative, which

aims to upskill first-generation graduates from small towns and villages to gain the right aptitude and attitude

for building a career in the financial services industry. The programme started in 2015 and has thus far benefited

more than 30,000 fresh graduates across the country.

Under the financial skilling initiative, your Company conducts a customised 100-hour Certificate Programme in

Banking, Finance and Insurance (CPBFI) for final-year undergraduate students. CPBFI comprehensively covers

key aspects of employability, such as attitudes, skills and knowledge. Unlike conventional skilling programmes,

it prepares students for more than 10 roles in the financial services industry.

I see this as the minimum that your Company can do to give some returns to society. We will continue with it, and

take it further ahead in the years to come.

To get back to what I started: your Company is not an aggregator. It strives to be an entity where the whole is

greater than the sum of its parts.

Thank you for your good wishes. These matter a great deal to all of us.

Yours sincerely,

Sanjiv Bajaj
