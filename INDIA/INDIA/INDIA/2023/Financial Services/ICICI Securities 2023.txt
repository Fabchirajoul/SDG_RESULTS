Message from the Chairman

Initiatives like digitalisation and

technological advancements and

government’s renewed push for

‘Digital India’ and ‘Make in India’ is

expected to fuel capacity building

in several areas like electronics

manufacturing, EVs, textiles etc.: Dear Shareholders,

The fiscal year 2023 was an eventful

one with inflation, interest rates, and

supply chain disruptions continuing to

remain key concern areas for businesses

and policymakers. Financial markets

experienced volatility and the central

banks across the globe closely monitored

inflationary pressures to adjust their

monetary policies accordingly.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

continued to implement measures to

support economic growth and stabilise

inflation. Initiatives like digitalisation

and technological advancements and

government’s renewed push for ‘Digital

India’ and ‘Make in India’ is expected to

fuel capacity building in several areas like

electronics manufacturing, EVs, textiles

etc. From being known for home to large

Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present to you the annual report

for FY2023, which highlights the achievements

and challenges faced by your Company, which is

India’s leading wealth-tech player, over the past

fiscal year.

FY2023 was marked by significant developments

in the global economy. With the impact of

COVID-19 pandemic weaning off, there was

recovery and resurgence of economic activities

across the world, with vaccination rollout and

fiscal stimulus measures playing a crucial role

in revitalising economies. However, ongoing

geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions,

and inflationary pressures remained key concerns.

FY2023 saw the Indian equity markets return

hardly any gains to investors. During the year,

the S&P BSE Sensex gained 0.72% while the

Nifty 50 declined 0.6%. Indian headline indices

outperformed global peers like the American

Dow Jones, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Hong Kong’s

Hang Seng and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 while

underperforming against Euro Stoxx 50, CAC 40,

FTSE 100 and Japanese Nikkei 225.

With markets largely listless, investor sentiment

also turned passive, leading to reduction of new

retail investors entering the market to ~25 Million

in FY2023 against ~35 Million in FY2022.

We were among the top performers

in procurement in majority of the

IPOs marketed during the year,

underlining the inherent strength

of our business and validating the

success of our strategy.
