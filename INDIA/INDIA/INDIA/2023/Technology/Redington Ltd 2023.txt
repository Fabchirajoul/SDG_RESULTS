Access to information and knowledge has long

posed challenges for individuals and organisations

worldwide. However, we firmly believe that these

obstacles can be triumphantly overcome with the

power of technology. Yet, a greater divide looms—

the divide between early adopters and cautious

organisations, those with access to cutting-edge

advancements and those without. Financial limitations

further exacerbate this gap, preventing some

from embracing the transformative potential of

new technologies.

At Redington, we are committed to bridging

technology divides. We strive to bridge gaps between

markets, adopters, sectors, and socio-economic

groups. Our mission is to democratise access to

technology for all. By enhancing reach, affordability,

and awareness, we address global divisions. As

innovators and partners, we tailor solutions to diverse

challenges. Through collaboration and alliances, we

foster knowledge exchange and mutually beneficial

relationships. Redington unites and creates an

inclusive technological landscape. Our goal is to

empower millions, ensuring no one is left behind.

Together, we bridge gaps, connect communities, and

build a limitless future enabled by technology.

01:

Dear Shareholders,

As I reflect upon the extraordinary journey we have embarked

on together, I am overwhelmed with pride and gratitude and

am delighted to present to you the 30th Annual Report of

our organisation. We stand here today, united by a shared

purpose and a resolute commitment to excellence.

In the rapidly changing digital world, businesses are working to

bridge technological gaps and enhance operational efficiency.

However, many challenges hinder the widespread access

to and adoption of technology. These include organisational

complexities, data quality issues, collaboration and supply

chain constraints, and difficulties in data integration.

Managing Director’s Message

K79,519 Crores

Revenue

K2,261 Crores

Operating Profit

K1,393 Crores

Profit After Tax: Dear Shareholders,

It is with great pleasure that I address you all, reflecting on the

extraordinary achievements of FY23.

Throughout the fiscal year FY23, our organisation has achieved

notable milestones, propelled by a steadfast commitment to

excellence, relentless innovation, and the resolute dedication of

our exceptional team.

Together, we have forged an extraordinary path, leaving an

indelible mark on our industry and communities. I am filled with

immense pride for what we have accomplished together and

the profound positive impact we have made, igniting a legacy of

inspiration and transformation.

We are delighted to announce that this fiscal year has marked

another outstanding phase of expansion, as evidenced by our

global revenues surpassing an unprecedented milestone of

`79,519 Crores. This significant achievement represents a

commendable year-on-year growth of 27%. Equally noteworthy

is our highest-ever operating profit of `2,261 Crores,

exemplifying our dedication to driving operational excellence.

Furthermore, our PAT stands at an impressive `1,393 Crores,

showcasing a noteworthy growth of 8.8% compared to the

previous year.

This year, we have witnessed a stellar feat of four consecutive

quarters with revenue growth exceeding 25%. Our success

knows no boundaries, as all regions, including South Asia,

India, the Middle East, Africa, and Turkey, have delivered

robust performances. It is in comparing our achievements

with an industry that has experienced a rapid decline that the

magnitude of our success truly shines.

The global macroeconomic, financial, and geopolitical landscape

has posed immense challenges in recent quarters. Most

countries have witnessed a downward trajectory in GDP

growth rates with the possibility of recession looming. Interest

rates have soared to levels not seen in over 15 years while

developing economies grapple with inflationary pressures and

currency devaluation. These cost escalations have created

margin pressures which in turn have impacted our profitability

during the second half of the year. We believe this to be a

transient phase, an outcome of the temporary reduction in

demand and industry-wide inventory corrections. Despite these

challenges, we have expanded our market share and seized

new opportunities, demonstrating robust growth across all

financial parameters.

The external business dynamics have been a mixed bag.

Demand for technology products related to remote work and

learning has declined as evidenced by the contraction in the

global PC industry and smartphone shipments. However, digital

transformation initiatives undertaken by organisations have

continued, leading to an increased demand for data centre

infrastructure products such as servers, storage, software,

and networking. As a result, we have achieved a striking 34%

growth in enterprise products. Customers are also embracing

cloud migration, contributing to an impressive 52% growth in

our cloud business.

During the year we underwent a fundamental shift in our

business approach. Embracing our strategic pillars of

technology, innovation, and partnerships, we made substantial

investments in our transformation journey toward becoming a

digital-first organisation. Evolving from a traditional distributor,

we have become a technology aggregator and a comprehensive

solutions provider. Our range of computing devices and

smartphones caters to consumer demands and the evolving

needs of hybrid work and learning environments. Our solutions

address the requirements of SMBs and enterprises, aligning

with the emerging technologies of 5G, Internet of Things, Edge

computing, and Artificial Intelligence.

Redington's innovative B2B eCommerce platform offers an

omnichannel engagement providing customers with ease

of procurement and a best-in-class experience. Our Cloud

platform facilitates the transition to an "everything as a service"

model. By enhancing the value we deliver to our stakeholders,

we have successfully gained market share and accelerated our

growth momentum.

With relentless determination to foster stronger partnerships,

we have undertaken a transformative redesign of our Go-

To-Market model. Recognising the pivotal role our esteemed

partners and vendors play in our journey of growth, we have

placed them at the heart of our strategic approach. Their

unyielding reinforcement and collaborative efforts will remain

fundamental to our continued success.

As an organisation operating in countries with substantial

underserved populations, Redington embraces a purpose

that resonates deeply within us to harness the transformative

power of technology and bridge these divides. Our mission is

to create a better, healthier, and more empowered life for all

individuals. This purpose serves as our driving force, igniting

our passion to make a meaningful and lasting impact. We are

grateful to have the opportunity to be agents of positive change

and contribute towards a more inclusive and prosperous world.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations

hold great importance at Redington. Our mission is to foster

equitable and just growth - ensuring a reduced carbon footprint

through initiatives like our Solar business, supporting the

communities we serve and upholding the highest standards

of corporate governance. We are executing various initiatives

under ESG that will propel us towards becoming a most

admired organisation.

Looking ahead, we anticipate a constrained demand

environment in certain product categories while others such

as data centres, cloud services, and accessories present more

favourable opportunities. Our strategic growth initiatives,

investments in automation and digital transformation and

strong operational and execution capabilities will enable us to

sustain our revenue and profit growth trajectory.

In closing, I express my heartfelt gratitude to our exceptional

employees, valued partners, and esteemed stakeholders who

have played an integral role in our impressive achievements

throughout the past year. Your unwavering support has

been instrumental in driving our growth. As we stand on

the threshold of the future, our commitment to excellence

remains resolute. We eagerly embrace the challenges and

opportunities that lie ahead, confident in our ability to conquer

them with determination and innovative thinking. Together,

we will continue to chart a path of unprecedented growth,

achieving even greater milestones and setting new standards

of excellence.

Best,
