Dear Shareholders,

As I reflect on the past fiscal year, I am proud to share that Sonata continues to deliver

outstanding value to its clients, employees, communities, and shareholders. We have done this

feat over the years consistently.

The past year has been characterized by numerous geopolitical shocks, inflationary pressures,

post-COVID readjustments, and cryptocurrency volatility, which have profoundly impacted

organizations worldwide. Yet, Sonata has remained agile and adaptable in such a dynamic

environment.

During the last fiscal, we successfully implemented a well-thought-out MD & CEO transition

plan – as we continue to gain market share, we wanted to make sure this transition is seamless

for the firm. Srikar Reddy has now taken the role of Executive Vice Chairman.

I want to thank Srikar for his outstanding services to Sonata over the years. During the year,

Samir, our CEO, and his team have continued to deliver on the vision and goals of the firm.

We are excited to continue building Sonata as a Modernization Engineering powerhouse in

the industry.

We are committed to maintaining our strategic focus and driving growth and expansion.

We are investing in our growth by recruiting a seasoned team of leaders and technologists

who can drive our business forward, promoting talent from within, and we will continue to

seek out strategic opportunities to supplement our organic growth. Our focus on innovation

and emerging technologies will continue to be a driving force in our strategy, and we are

confident that we can continue to deliver value to our stakeholders.

Our employees are our greatest asset, and we are committed to fostering a culture of

innovation and creativity. In the past year, we have taken several initiatives to provide our

employees with the tools and resources they need to thrive. These initiatives include investing

in training and development programs, providing access to cutting-edge technologies, and

encouraging cross-functional collaboration. At Sonata, we have a culture where employees are

encouraged to be curious to experiment, and share things they learn. In addition, we believe in

cultivating a growth mindset, where personal growth goes hand in hand with organizational

development and building a learning culture. These beliefs are the foundation on which we

will create the next phase of our story – where we dream big and “Play Big”!

Annual Report 2022-23

03:

Dear Shareholders,

In today's market - there is a unique duality in technology adoption. On one side, extreme focus

on cost containment by clients, and on the other, deep motivation to modernize their digital

storefronts to attract more consumers and B2B customers.

This duality presents a significant opportunity for Sonata globally based on the deep

differentiation we have created in Modernization Engineering powered by our Lightening suite

and Platformation™ playbook. In addition, we bring agility and systems thinking to accelerate

time to market for our clients.

I'm excited about the opportunity to lead Sonata Software into its next growth phase. I've taken

the baton passed to me, and will work hard to make Sonata an IT powerhouse in the future.

FY'23 was a year of transformation for Sonata! We see the benefits of modernization driven

hypergrowth. We have set a goal to achieve revenue of $1.5B (~$1B from SITL and ~$0.5B from

the International Business) and be in the leader category on Modernization and Great Places to

Work in three years, building a mindset to "Play Big."

We started well, and as a team, we won our largest deal ever during the year, TCV of $160M,

to modernize our client's IT estate. In addition, we won eight other large contracts during the

year. We successfully integrated Quant Systems into Sonata, our largest acquisition to date.

Quant brings deep Enterprise data capabilities, and we added one BFSI and one Healthcare

client to our Top 5 client list from the acquisition.

As we bring the "Play Big" mindset, we continue to invest in our business. We invested in key

GTMs (Cloud, Data, Dynamics, Managed Services, and Contact Centre) – all focused on

Modernization and Automation in our key Markets of the USA, UK, Nordics, India, and ANZ.

We strengthened solutions for our key verticals - TMT, Manufacturing-Retail-Travel, BFSI, and

Healthcare. We made significant investments in Generative AI capabilities. We continued to

build scale across partners (Microsoft, AWS, SFDC, and Snowflake) and win high-quality logos

and large deals working with partners. We're investing in global sales and marketing in the USA,

Europe, and APAC. We continue strengthening our frontline solution and sales organization to

add value to our customers.

All these investments resulted in us delivering industry-leading QoQ growth in the year's

second half.
