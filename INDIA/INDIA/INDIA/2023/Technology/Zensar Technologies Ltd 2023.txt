CEO and Managing:

Chairman's Communique: Dear Shareholders,

Building resilience.

Powering progress.

At Zensar, we are preparing for the

next wave of growth by focusing

on high-quality services, pushing

the boundaries of innovation,

and creating sustainable value

for our customers. While macro

headwinds may exist, we believe

that with strategic investments in

our service lines and our vertical

bets, we are well-positioned to

capture opportunities created in

the evolving business landscape.

Long-term prospects in the IT

sector remain attractive as digital

transformation and technology

investments become increasingly

critical to the growth ambitions of

organisations.

Our efforts toward clients’

transformation initiatives, continued

thrust on refining our portfolio,

and identifying replicable success

stories within our operations are

driven by a deep understanding of

our clients' needs. During the year,

we strengthened our management

team, bringing together a

combination of skills, experience

and vision at the executive and

board levels. We have forged new

alliances and partnerships with

major technology players.

Zensar has been at the forefront

with industry-leading work-from-

anywhere flexibility, diversity,

equity, and inclusion policies, and

best-in-class wellness benefits. The

Zensar Learning Academy embodies

our commitment to upskilling

and growth. With significant

investments in capability-building,

career progression, learning,

compensation, and recognition, we

are training the next generation of

tech talent and developing leaders

for the future. We believe that

by providing the right tools and

resources, we can create a culture

of innovation and excellence that

benefits both our people and clients

alike.

I am happy to share that our

recently acquired company - M3BI

- is now well integrated into the

overall organisation.

We are committed to addressing

the pressing issues of climate

change, carbon emissions, and

water pollution, and collaborate

with businesses and communities

to drive meaningful action toward

mitigating these challenges.

We have increased reliance on

green energy across our locations

worldwide. We are also a water-

positive organisation.

Additionally, our UI/UX business

has been working closely with our

clients on their sustainable business

initiatives with a unique offering

that combines climate experts,

experience designers, and design

strategists to offer a cutting- edge

standard of sustainability expertise

that is firmly rooted in design

thinking methodologies.

I would like to thank our clients

and partners for their unwavering

support and our esteemed

shareholders for continuing to place

their trust in Zensar as we walk

together toward an exciting and

digital future.

Regards,

H.V. Goenka

Enhancement of the

allows us to easily track both

internal and external resources,

leading to better reporting

capabilities.

Digitisation of

Our software installation

procedure has been

considerably enhanced by

deploying bots to automate it.

It has lowered the turnaround

time from one day to two to

three hours, contributing to

higher operational efficiency.

Digitisation of

finance processes

Digitisation of the invoicing

process has completely

automated the lead-to-invoice

generation process. We have

eliminated manual intervention,

reduced invoicing cycle time,

and increased overall efficiency.

Unified dashboard

and analytics

We look forward to

implementing a unified

dashboard that will empower

our delivery teams with

effective governance to

facilitate more efficient

decision-making. It will also

feature analytic capabilities,

providing our teams with

valuable insights to optimize

our overall performance.

Bolstering information security

measures

To maintain a robust information security

infrastructure, we conduct quarterly Information

31. Share Based Payments

(a) Employee Stock Option Plan, 2002 (2002 ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Plan, 2006 (2006

ESOP)

Under the 2002 ESOP and 2006 ESOP schemes, participants are granted options which vest equally over

a period of 5 years from the date of grant. Participation in the plan is at the discretion of the Nomination

and Remuneration Committee (NRC) and no individual has a contractual right to participate in the plan or to

receive any guaranteed benefits.

-

The exercise price is determined based on the market price, being the closing price of the share on the

stock exchange with higher trading volume on the day preceding the day of the grant of options. The

scheme allows the NRC to set the exercise price at a premium or discount not exceeding 20% on the

market price.

-

The options remain exercisable for 10 years from date of vesting and lapse if they remain unexercised

during this period.

-

Options granted carry no dividend or voting rights. When exercisable, each option is convertible into one

equity share.
