Dear Stakeholders,

It gives me immense pleasure to present our first annual report

post public listing. I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the

shareholders for the faith shown in our business model and

vision. Your support has made our offer for sale successful. It

is a momentous occasion for us, and would be pivotal in our

next phase of growth and expansion.

The recent times have been eventful for the capital market

ecosystem, marked by sustained disruptions from new

technology introductions, innovations in asset classes and

increased volatilities. Yet, backed by our technology excellence

and market knowledge, we continued to grow our market

leading position and emerged stronger. The strength and

enthusiasm to do this and beyond, is driven by the trust

bestowed upon us by each one of you. We are delighted to

have you as partners in our endeavors and remain committed

to delivering value sustainably over the long term.

Annual Report 2022-23:

Dear Stakeholders,

I am delighted to report our performance for the year through

this maiden annual report as a listed entity. At the outset,

I thank all investors for the overwhelming confidence shown in

our growth story and responding enthusiastically to our offer

for sale of equity shares aggregating `15,000 million. Your

support has been truly remarkable and motivates us to ascend

to greater heights.

FY 2022-23 has been an outstanding year. Even as we got

busy with getting the Company listed, we maintained sharp

focus on business to deliver resounding performance, meeting

the expectations and aspirations of our valued shareholders.

More importantly, we diligently executed several strategic

plans that lay the foundation for a stronger, reliable and

profitable growth in the years to come.

Operating in a volatile market

The overall operating environment in FY 2022-23 was

challenging. Heightened fears of the world going into

recession along with rising inflation and interest rates, resulted

in a highly volatile market. Overall, the mutual fund AAUM

grew 5.55% compared to a strong growth of 19.56% in

the previous year. Through the year, the markets witnessed

sustained increase in equity AUM and SIP retail channel

inflows, which are stickier and efficient routes, indicating the

growing trust of investors in India's equity and capital markets.

The other asset classes also increased including alternative

investment funds and pensions.

In the global context, the markets in South-East Asia were

reasonably tepid, underpinned by mark-to-market erosion in

the stock markets.
