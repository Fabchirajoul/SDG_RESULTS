Managing Director – IBPM

*List as of May 29, 2023:

Letter to the Shareholder

Performance overview

Dear shareholder,

Financial year 2023 was a strong year for our business.

In FY23, we saw growth of over 15%, operating margins

of 21%, and free cash flow of US$2.5 billion. Our attrition

reduced for each quarter of the year.

With the changing economic environment, we positioned

our Company to work with clients for their digital

transformation as well as their cost efficiency and

automation programs, enabling us to support them in two

critical areas of interest.

We have developed a strong set of capabilities in

generative artificial intelligence to enhance how we enable

our clients to derive value. These capabilities are available

to all our clients in the form of Infosys TopazTM.

Our Cobalt capabilities for the cloud continue to resonate

with our clients. Our platforms, including Finacle for banks,

McCamish for insurance, Equinox for commerce, and Helix

for healthcare, are creating strong impact with clients.

During the year, we were recognized by Brand Finance

among the top three most valuable IT services brands

globally.

We continue to deepen our engagement with our clients.

The number of clients with over US$100 million in revenue

for the year was at 40. The number of clients with over

US$50 million in revenue for the year was at 75. Our large

deal intensity was strong during the year. We had 95 large

deals with a value of US$9.8 billion in the year. We see

our One Infosys approach helping support our clients by

bringing all our capabilities and the strength of our entire

employee-base to work for their benefit.

We recruited over 50,000 college graduates in the year and

ended the year with over 3,40,000 employees. At the end

of the year, 39% of our employees were women.

Our learning ecosystem enabled over 5.5 million learning

days for our employees during the year.

Last year we returned US$3.1 billion to our shareholders –

US$1.7 billion as dividend and US$1.4 billion through our

share buyback program.

At the end of the financial year, we were the leading

company among our peers in total shareholder return over

the past five years.

We remain committed to the communities we live and

operate in. With the work of Infosys Foundation, we

support a variety of social causes, including creating

positive impact in healthcare, education, sustainability, and

women empowerment. Our Infosys Springboard initiative

continues to help build digital skills by providing free

learning programs to millions of people around the world.

In the past few quarters, we have seen the global

economy dealing with inflation, interest rate increases,

and changes in demand environment for companies in

various industries. Our strength in digital, cloud, and in

automation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have

held us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in

the evolving economic environment.

As I look ahead, given the trust of our clients, the

dedication of our employees, the strength of our

capabilities, our One Infosys approach, and the guidance

of our Board, I remain confident of our ability to serve our

clients and continue to create impact for them.

With my warmest regards,

Every Board member can suggest the inclusion of additional

items in the agenda.

The Board meets at least once a quarter to review the quarterly

results and other items on the agenda. Additional meetings

are held when necessary. Independent

directors are expected to attend at least

four quarterly Board meetings and the

Annual General Meeting (AGM). However,

with the Board being represented by

independent directors from various parts

of the world, it may not be possible for

all of them to be physically present at

all meetings. Hence, we provide video /

teleconferencing facilities to enable their

participation. Committees of the Board

usually meet the day before the Board

meeting, or whenever the need arises for

transacting business.

The Board members are expected

to rigorously prepare for, attend and

participate in Board and applicable

committee meetings. Each member

is expected to ensure their other

commitments do not materially interfere

with their responsibilities with us.

Meeting of independent directors

For the Board to exercise free and fair

judgment in all matters related to the

functioning of the Company as well as the

Board, it is important for the independent

directors to have meetings without the

presence of the executive management.

Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013

and the Rules thereunder mandate that

the independent directors of the Company

shall hold at least one meeting in a

financial year, without the attendance of

non-independent directors and members

of the Management. Even before the

Companies Act, 2013 came into effect,

our Board’s process mandated periodic

meetings attended exclusively by the

independent directors.

During the year, the independent directors

met four times. At such meetings, the

independent directors discuss, among

other matters, the performance of the

Company and risks faced by it, the flow

of information to the Board, competition,

strategy, leadership strengths and

weaknesses, governance, compliance,

Board movements, succession planning,

human resources matters and the

performance of the executive members of

the Board, and the Chairman.:

letter in line with

Recommendation No. 9 of the Blue Ribbon Committee

on Audit Committee effectiveness, to be provided in the

financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS in the

Annual Report on Form 20-F.

Relying on its review and the discussions with the Management

and the independent auditors, the Committee believes that

the Company’s financial statements are fairly presented in

conformity with Ind AS and IFRS and that there is no significant

deficiency or material weakness in the Company’s internal

control over financial reporting. In conclusion, the Committee is

satisfied that it has complied with its responsibilities as outlined

in the Audit Committee Charter. The Board has accepted all

recommendations made by the Audit Committee.

RESOLVED THAT pursuant to the provisions of Sections 149, 150, 152, 161, Schedule IV and other applicable provisions of the Companies

Act, 2013 (“the Act”) read with the Rules framed thereunder, and applicable provisions of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure

Requirements) Regulations, 2015, (“the LODR Regulations”) [including any statutory modification(s) or re-enactment(s) thereof, for the

Committee and that of the Board, Helene Auriol Potier (DIN: 10166891), who was appointed as an Additional Director in the capacity of

letter to the Scrutinizer by email to evoting@infosys.com with a copy marked to

evoting@nsdl.co.in.

5. The register of directors and key managerial personnel (KMP) and their shareholding, maintained under Section 170 of the Act, and

the register of contracts or arrangements in which the directors are interested, maintained under Section 189 of the Act, will be

available electronically for inspection by the members during the AGM. All documents referred to in the Notice will also be available

for electronic inspection without any fee from the date of circulation of this Notice up to the date of AGM, i.e. June 28, 2023. Members

seeking to inspect such documents can send an email to investors@infosys.com.

6. Members whose shareholding is in electronic mode are requested to notify any change in address or bank account details to their

respective depository participant(s) (DP). Members whose shareholding is in physical mode are requested to opt for the Electronic

Clearing System (ECS) mode to receive dividend on time in line with the Circulars. We urge members to utilize the ECS for receiving

dividends. Please refer to point no. 16 for the process to be followed for updating bank account details.

7. Members may note that the Board, at its meeting held on April 13, 2023, has recommended a final dividend of ₹17.5 per share. The

record date for the purpose of final dividend for fiscal 2023 is June 2, 2023. The final dividend, once approved by the members in the

ensuing AGM, will be paid on July 3, 2023, electronically through various online transfer modes to those members who have updated

their bank account details. For members who have not updated their bank account details, dividend warrants / demand drafts /

cheques will be sent to their registered addresses. To avoid delay in receiving dividend, members are requested to update their KYC

with their depositories (where shares are held in dematerialized mode) and with the Company’s Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA)

(where shares are held in physical mode) to receive the dividend directly into their bank account on the payout date.

8. Members may note that the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the IT Act”) as amended by the Finance Act, 2020, mandates that dividend paid or

distributed by a company on or after April 1, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of members. The Company shall therefore be required

to deduct tax at source (TDS) at the time of making the payment of final dividend. To enable us to determine the appropriate TDS

rate as applicable, members are requested to submit relevant documents, as specified in the below paragraphs, in accordance with

the provisions of the IT Act.:

applicable provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder including any statutory modification(s) or re-enactment(s) thereof) and

she shall not be liable to retire by rotation.

In compliance with Section 149 read with Schedule IV to the Act and Regulation 25 of the LODR Regulations, the approval of the

Members is sought for the appointment of Helene Auriol Potier as an Independent Director of the Company, as a special resolution.

No director, KMP or their relatives except Helene, to whom the resolution relates, is interested in or concerned, financially or otherwise, in

passing the proposed resolution set out in item no. 4.

Parikh as an independent director of the Company, for a second term of 5 (five) years effective July 15, 2023, to July 14, 2028, (both

days inclusive) pursuant to Sections 149, 152 and other applicable provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder (including any
