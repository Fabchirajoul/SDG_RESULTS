Letter to Shareholders

03

Chapter: Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to share the

progress of Intellect in a

deﬁning year of its journey.

FY23 marks the culmination

of Intellect 2.0 – the second

phase of Intellect’s

metamorphosis and growth. We

had commenced this ﬁve year

journey in FY19 soon after Lakshya 2018, our

organisation wide visioning exercise. We

focused on three priorities – Industrialisation

of our Products and Processes, Building deep

Customer relationships and building

monetisation models for our rich IP.

Financial performance in Intellect 2.0

(FY19 - FY23)

As outlined in our Q4FY23 Investor

communication, our revenue demonstrated a

16% CAGR during this period, with Earnings

before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and

Amortisation (EBITDA) reporting a strong 49%

CAGR and Proﬁt after Tax growing 42%

annually during this period. As an IP-driven

Co, we also measure ourselves by our

Recurring revenues. This has again grown at a

CAGR of 34% during this period.

Our roadmap for the future

While the ﬁnancial performance has been

rewarding, the preparedness for the next

phase of our journey is of equal importance in

creating value for our stakeholders. During the

Intellect 2.0 phase, we built a strong

repository of IP commencing with Products for

each of the Banking verticals and Insurance

went on to upgrade some of those to

Platforms, launched iTurmeric – our MACH

composable platform for the design of

Experience, Operations and Integration with

the Ecosystem. We stepped up the investment

in IP towards the Platformisation of our

Products in the last year of Intellect 2.0 –

FY23- and launched eMACH.ai – the

MACH-compliant, open architecture-based,

composable platform that is driven by

Contextual Data & Embedded AI to support

Flexible extensibility of applications – rich with

over 285 Microservices, 200+ Events and

1214 APIs.

The superiority of our architecture and

technology was repeatedly recognised by

both Analyst accolades as well as in qualifying

in rigorous technical evaluation and proofs of

value/ concept by Tier 1 Financial Institutions

across the globe, competing against both new

age Technology startups as well as established

players. These eventually led to the acquisition

of Logos that are Global/ Regional leaders and

the expansion of our footprint in key

geographies. FY23 witnessed 42 deal wins. We

are now catering to BankTech migration in the

Europe & Americas for banks with asset sizes

adding up to $200 Bn.

Technology trends and Intellect’s

early mover advantage

Externally, two key technologies were

signiﬁcantly impacting the Market – Cloud and

Artiﬁcial Intelligence / Machine Learning

Table No. 2.134

The Group is contesting the demands raised by the respective tax authorities, and

the management, based on internal assessment and per its tax advisors, believe

that its position will likely be upheld in the appellate process and ultimate

outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the

Group’s financial position and results of operations.

b)

The Honorable Supreme Court of India had passed judgement on February 28,

2019 that all allowances paid to employees are to be considered for the purpose

of Provident fund wages determination. There are numerous interpretative issues

relating to the above judgement. As a matter of caution, the Group has recognised

a provision on a prospective basis from the date of Supreme Court order. The

Group will update its provision, on receiving further clarity on the subject.

36 GOODWILL ON CONSOLIDATION

Goodwill on consolidation represents the excess purchase consideration paid over net

asset value of acquired subsidiaries on the date of such acquisition. Such Goodwill is

tested for impairment annually or more frequently, if there are indications for

impairment. The management does not foresee any risk of impairment on the carrying

value of Goodwill as at March 31, 2023.

The Group acquired the entire interest in Intellect Design Arena Inc. USA, a US based

Insurance technology provider with effect from October 01, 2008. The excess of

purchase consideration paid over the net assets of Intellect Design Arena Inc. USA is

recognised as Goodwill. Goodwill on consolidation as at March 31, 2023 stood at

Rs. 330.21 million (March 31, 2022 - Rs. 304.57 million).

37 FAIR VALUE

Set out below, is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the

Group’s financial instruments, other than those with carrying amounts that are

reasonable approximations of fair values. The management assessed that the fair

values of cash and cash equivalents, bank balances including deposits, trade

receivables, loans and deposits, other financial assets, trade payables and other

financial liabilities would approximate their carrying amounts due to their nature.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which

the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,:
