Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

LETTER: Dear Stakeholders.

As we commence the second decade of Happiest Minds, it gives me immense satisfaction to

report that your Company continues its path-breaking and highly successful run. We represent a

unique model which combines the highest standards of corporate governance and people-centric

culture with industry-leading results of profitability and growth.

In FY 2022-23, Happiest Minds delivered a growth of 23.7% in

revenue (constant currency) and an EBITDA margin of 26.2%.

Our EBITDA margin was second only to the largest listed IT

Services company. We have delivered an enviable EBITDA

margin of 26.2%, exceeding the upper band of our guidance of

22% - 24%. On a metric of revenue growth plus EBITDA margin,

at 56.8%, we continue to be amongst the best in the industry.

This year, we have chosen the “Excellence in Governance and

Growth” theme for our Integrated Annual Report FY 2022-23.

At Happiest Minds, we have established corporate governance

practices well before the company was listed in 2020,

fundamentally striving to function like an exemplary public entity

since our inception. As part of our vision to be known for the best

corporate governance standards, we have made continuous

strides to deploy leading-edge tech for the dissemination of

information and educating our stakeholders on cyber risks

within the organizational network, driving sustained, long-term

business value while ensuring collaborative, and transparent

communication at all levels of the organizational network.

I would like to highlight a few of the accomplishments we

earned in the last financial year. Happiest Minds stands for

excellent corporate governance, and the awards represent

a triple confirmation of our disclosure, transparency, and

governance practices.

Golden Peacock Award for Excellence in Corporate

Governance 2022

ICSI Best Governed Company in Listed Segment:

Medium Category – National Awards for Excellence in

Corporate Governance

ICAI for ‘Excellence in Financial Reporting for 2021-22’

Plaque in the Category VIII (A) – Service Sector (other

than financial services sector)

GOLD at the League of American Communications

Professionals’ (LACP) 2022 Spotlight Awards for the

Integrated Annual Report (FY 2021-22)

I was humbled on being conferred ICSI’s Lifetime Achievement

Award for Corporate Governance. I have accepted this award

on behalf of all Happiest Minds and the many teams who have

worked with me to create institutions recognized for excellence

in Corporate Governance.

We are also delighted to be recognized by Great Place to Work®

Institute (GPTW). For the second time in a row, Happiest Minds

was recognized among the Top 10 India’s Best Workplaces in

Health and Wellness 2022. We continued to receive recognition

from GPTW as one of the most attractive employers. We were

named among the Top 50 India’s Best Workplaces Building

a Culture of Innovation by All 2023, Top 25 India’s Best

Workplaces in IT & IT-BPM 2022, and Top 50 India’s Best

Workplaces for Women 2022.

Your Company’s growth was broad-based, with all our business

units, operating geographies, and Centers of Excellence

delivering excellent results. These results were enabled by the

contributions of our delivery teams, technology and domain

groups, and the support of all our corporate functions under the

leadership of our Executive Board. Customer Satisfaction, as

measured by our internal survey, showed a Net Promoter Score

(NPS) of 60 and an overall satisfaction level of 7.9 on a scale of

9.0. We believe these numbers to be in the top tier, along with

comparable companies.

We are driven by a mindful approach, choosing to do what best

serves our people, our customers and business outcomes.

Our people are collaborative and have a superlative commitment

to value creation for our customers. We continue to strive hard

to partner with our people, customers, and the community

so that we are unitedly committed to a single purpose and

shared success.

Several strategic decisions made in the past year mark

our growth story. We purchased a Grade A, fully built-up

commercial property with a super-built area of 240,000 sq.

ft., in Electronic City, Bengaluru, and an expansion in a newer

location like Bhubaneswar. We increased the delivery capacity

of our Noida facility (“Smiles 5”) to leverage the diverse

high-technology talent pool in NCR. I am also excited to share

that in the last quarter of the year, your Company acquired

Sri Mookambika Infosolutions (SMI). The new entity, SMI, brings

in deep domain capabilities which add to our healthcare vertical

strengths and align very well with our Product Engineering

Services business unit.

Another indicator of our confidence in growth for FY 2023-24 is

Happiest Minds’ people addition plan. We aim to add a record

number of 1300 persons. This is in stark contrast to some of our

peer organizations who have announced deferment of campus

hiring etc. We plan to continue with a robust guidance on revenue

growth while sustaining EBITDA margin in the 22-24% range.

Sustainable development is key to our growth. Happiest Minds,

for its part, is dedicated to achieving carbon neutrality in its

operations by 2030. We have deployed a 183 kWp solar power

plant that will generate 256 MWh of electricity annually. It is

estimated to reduce 210 MT of carbon emissions annually and

5200 MT over its lifecycle. This new solar power plant at our

Bengaluru campus and our array of CSR initiatives are important

Smilestones on our ESG roadmap to be vocal about a cleaner

energy future and building long-term business sustainability.

As we look ahead to the future, we are optimistic and excited

about the tremendous opportunity that awaits us.

I would like to express my gratitude to our customers for their

continued faith and trust in Happiest Minds. I am also grateful

to all Happiest Minds for their commitment and dedication to

enable the happiness of our customers. I am grateful to our

Board of Directors, our shareholders, and all other stakeholders

for their wishes, guidance and support that help us accelerate

our digital and agile journeys.

Let me close by wishing all of you good health and happiness.

With warm regards.

LETTER

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE

It gives me immense pleasure to share this year’s Integrated Annual Report with you.

The financial year of 2023 was eventful for Happiest Minds. Progress made against our

Vision 2031 on Business fundamentals, Customer satisfaction, People, Growth, Profitability,

Environmental & Social Initiatives, and not least of all, Governance makes me proud. We have

come out stronger from the last years marred by the pandemic and economic uncertainty with

a steely resolve to continue building a stronger and sustainable organization.

IT HAS BEEN

AN EVENTFUL

YEAR FOR

HAPPIEST MINDS,

OUR PARTNERS,

CLIENTS,

EMPLOYEES, AND

INVESTORS.

While our financials, achievements, and other metrics point

towards all of the above, our Vision of building a Company

which will have a perpetual existence hinge on our commitment

and us executing on a thought-out Environmental, Social, and

Governance (ESG) framework.

ESG as a collective concept came into prominence during these

last few years and primarily by investors who were looking to

invest in companies but wanted a measure or a touchstone

against which they could evaluate investments made or to be

made. With ESG regulations increasing globally and studies

linking good ESG practices to improved revenue growth, ESG

performance has become a significant determinator when

doing business.

Put simply, ESG takes cognizance of the environmental impact

of a company’s operations, corporate social responsibility (CSR),

and good governance practices.

G stands for the governance criteria.

It is the internal system of practices,

controls,

and

procedures

your

Company adopts to govern itself,

make effective decisions, comply

with the law, and meet the needs of

external stakeholders. Every company,

which is itself a legal creation,

requires governance.

While I am sure you know what the letters in the acronym ESG stand for, a quick refresher would be:

E stands for environmental criteria,

which,

amongst

others,

primarily

includes the energy your Company

takes in and the waste it discharges,

the resources it needs, and the

consequences

for

living

beings.

Not least, E encompasses carbon

emissions

and

climate

change.

Every company uses energy and

resources; every company affects and

is affected by the environment.

S stands for social criteria, which

addresses

your

Company’s

relationships and the reputation it

fosters with people and institutions

in the communities where you do

business. It includes human rights,

labor relations, diversity, and inclusion.

Every company operates within a

broader, diverse society.

Simply put, ESG refers to the ‘Dharmic principles’ per which

one should run an enterprise. ESG is a philosophy and must be

ingrained into the culture of the enterprise or the way we operate

and do business to see its complete impact, effect, and benefits.

I make this statement drawing from my experience and with

specific reference to my current engagement at Happiest Minds.

When we started the Company 11 years back, we had clearly

articulated the Mission, Vision, and Values of our Company.

We believe that “MVV” - short for Mission, Vision and Values are

the cornerstones to building a successful enterprise.

Active

participation

and

a

collaborative

approach

to

establishing the MVV of a Company have been seen to be

very effective. MVV at Happiest Minds is done collaboratively

and democratically, which means this is grounds up and in

active participation with all Happiest Minds, which is how we

refer to our employees. Such an exercise ensures not only a

common objective but also alignment and buy-in into the Vision

by one and all.

We

had

incorporated

Corporate

Governance,

Social

Commitment, and Stakeholder Value enhancement into our

Vision. This focus and rigor from inception helped us immensely

and especially during these past few years in an environment of

heightened awareness and attention around “ESG”.

As part of our Vision statement, aspects of Corporate Governance,

Social Commitment, and Stakeholder Value enhancement

were to be achieved through clearly articulated milestones.

These milestones are evaluated regularly along with our Board.

After listing in October 2021, we decided to put together Vision

2031. Given how ESG has evolved, we now have a Vision

statement focused solely and completely on ESG, which is “Be

known for our ESG practices”. Again, we have clearly articulated

milestones linked to achieving desired outcomes to fulfill this

vision. Our focus on Corporate Governance meant we put in

best practices on accounting, disclosure, Board composition,

management, compliance with law, systems, and processes

from the word ‘go’.

Though set up as a Private Ltd. company, we thought and

operated like a publicly listed company. For example,

Board meetings are serious affairs with clear agendas,

pre-circulated

reading

material,

etc.

We

established

committees ahead of time and before they were mandatory.

We published annual reports just like a listed company

would do. Transparency and information sharing amongst

stakeholders, identification of key indicators on the health

of the business, etc., were put in place right upfront. All our

actions were subject to the ‘sniff test’ of – “how would it look

if what we did or did not do” appeared in the newspapers

tomorrow.

We are quite proud of our industry recognitions, working

with sustainability at the forefront of our decision-making.

Ingrained as a core component of our global strategy to act

on environmental, social, and governance issues, our 2023

Integrated Annual Report focuses on the theme of Corporate

Governance that hinges on transparency, integrity, and

management accountability.

Significant Factors Affecting our Results of Operations

The following is a discussion of certain factors that had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our financial condition and

results of operations:

Expansion of Customer Base and new Sales to Existing Customers

Customer relationships is the core of our business. We had an average count of active customers 206 and 237 as of March 31, 2022

and 2023, respectively. Our ability to grow our customer base and drive market adoption of our software is affected by the pace at

which organizations digitally transform. We expect that our revenue growth will be primarily driven by the pace of adoption of our

offerings. We believe the degree to which prospective customers recognize the need for our offerings to maximize their business

process would lead to a higher budget allocation by such prospective customers for engaging our services. This will drive our ability

to acquire new customers and increase sales to existing customers, which in turn will affect our future financial performance.:
