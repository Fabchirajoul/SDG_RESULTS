TECH MAHINDRA LIMITED:

Dear Stakeholders,

With crisis comes opportunity, and at

Tech Mahindra, we have championed the

uncertainties of the past few years to

Rise Beyond: To become bolder, better

and future-ready. While the geopolitical

tensions, inflation, and recession have

slowed down enterprise tech spending,

it has also triggered a greater need for

businesses to conserve resources and

optimise costs. The broader macro-

economy has witnessed significant

instability and evolution, which is likely

to persist. Nevertheless, there’s also

significant demand on the horizon for

cost, digital, and business transformation

projects in the near-to-medium term.

There’s a growing enthusiasm among

enterprises to invest in innovation and

future-ready solutions. We are better

positioned than ever before to serve these

enterprises with a range of holistic offerings

such as generative AI, metaverse, 5G and

Cloud. We currently have a roster of 1,297

clients and we continue to forge strategic

alliances to co-innovate with our clients and

partners and deepen our capabilities.

COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS

Audit Committee

Mr. T. N. Manoharan,

letter to internal deployment to client projects. With

rigor in talent allocation and proactive skilling of bench

talent, your Company has been able to increase its

internal fulfilment to 71% from 48% which is the best

in the industry.

Learning: Skilling on the job

With the growth in digital business, your Company

has been transforming its workforce both at speed

and scale. The Company accelerated skilling

initiatives to keep up with the pace of technological

developments and built a ‘future-ready’ talent pool.

#NAD Learn, the AI-based platform with interactive,

on-demand,

contextual

and

hyper-personalised

up-skilling is helping the Company develop full-stack

professionals. Your Company has supplemented this

with young leadership development programs as well

as new policies to promote niche skilling and fast-track

career growth. Employees can learn and grow as a

Fresher through Elevate, in customer deployments

through Project Skilling, for career progression

through Future Skilling and into the leadership pipeline

through journey-based programs. The Company also

offers super-specialization skilling programs including

Architect CoE, HiPOT programs at units and Program

Manager CoE through EMBARK. Some new programs

that the Company has recently launched for high-

potential talent development include MALT and TrIBE.

Leadership: Integrative Thinking

The natural culture of empowerment that was

supercharged during the pandemic continues to be the

mainstay in the current hybrid work environment. Your

Company aims to help employees imbibe mindsets &

behaviors for the future which include a renewed focus

on Integrative Thinking, Business & Financial Acumen,

Bias for Action, Closure over Follow-up, Data over

Emotions and Extreme Ownership. This was reinforced

through the adoption of an industry leading learning

platform – Harvard Manage Mentor Spark aimed at

imparting best-in-class training at every level in real-

time. Your Company has a robust Talent Management

process for developing the leadership talent pipeline

and has adopted consistent coaching practices for

managers. Apart from Coaching, the employees have

experienced new forms of learning with technology-

enabled tools and pedagogies. For example, the

‘Wheel of Life’ is a customized self-coaching tool with

gamified journeys, and personalized Habit Tracking

making personal and professional well-being goals

accessible to every employee.

Performance: Feedback focused

Your Company launched the Annual Performance

Feedback cycle in December 2022. In order to build

a culture where performance is enabled through

feedback, Managers have been trained to have better

performance review dialogues with their direct reports

and work on an outcome-based evaluation rather than

process or effort measurement. Your Company is

creating a High-Performance Culture through hyper-

personalized Incentive plans. Your Company has a

suite of Incentive plans that are designed to create

a strong alignment between Individual growth and

Organization performance.

Wellness: Collective well-being

Your Company puts a happier, healthier and more

productive workforce at the core of its business,

policies and decisions. Your Company has designed:

Managing Director.

The Group has identified business segments as reportable segments. Accordingly, Information Technology

(IT) Business and Business Processing Outsourcing (BPO) has been disclosed as business segments.

Geographical information on revenue and business segment revenue information is collated based on

individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.

Segregation of assets (except trade and other receivables), liabilities, depreciation and other non-cash

expenses into various business segments has not been done as the assets are used interchangeably

between segments and the Company is of the view that it is not practical to reasonably allocate liabilities

and other non-cash expenses to individual segments as the same will not be meaningful.:
