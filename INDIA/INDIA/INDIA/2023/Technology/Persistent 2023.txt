Managing Director

Dear Fellow Shareowners,

It is an honor and privilege to present our

33rd Annual Report for the Financial Year

(FY) 2022-23 as we achieve an important

milestone of becoming a Billion Dollar

Company.

The 33-year journey from taking an initial

idea to a Billion Dollar business has been

exhilarating, challenging and immensely

satisfying. This journey has been possible

only because of the unwavering support

we received from employees, customers,

partners and thousands of well-wishers.

I remain eternally grateful to all of them.

As we celebrate this milestone, I feel nostalgic

as I reflect upon our incredible journey

together. Growth in a business is not linear

but a sequence of S-Curves. Some defining

actions set you on a gradient, and after a

few good years of growth, business seems

to flatten down. At this point, you must

change orbits. Each orbit shift is hard and

challenging but necessary. We have seen

five of these orbits at Persistent, and in our

33rd year, we are entering our Sixth Orbit.

Our First Orbit was difficult and infrastructure

challenges in India were the primary

constraint. During this period, we built

teams with a culture of supporting our

Over these 33 years, we have formed a

bond that goes beyond mere transactions.

Together, we have built a thriving community

that has weathered storms and celebrated

triumphs. We have forged a collective

commitment to our clients, employees,

partners and each other built on a foundation

that engenders excellence. We are

committed to being responsible corporate

citizens and playing an active role in

preserving the planet through environmental

and health initiatives based on an intrinsic

desire to nurture growth in our communities

and society at large.: Message from the

Managing Director of

Persistent, has been honored with the “Ananya Sanman” award by

Zee 24 Taas for his outstanding contributions to the IT industry and for

supporting entrepreneurs in India through the deAsra Foundation

Future Outlook

Macroeconomic headwinds, global unrest and rising operational costs continue to impact companies’ ability to invest,

innovate and grow. Many are experiencing declining revenues, lower margins, decreasing company valuations and substantial

layoffs, and the current economic climate indicates that this instability will remain throughout the year.

With this economic uncertainty, business leaders are taking deliberate steps to streamline operations, control corporate

spending and optimize product development. They also remain committed to making investments to accelerate innovation

and uncover new avenues to revenue growth by reprioritizing product portfolios, enhancing go-to-market activities, entering

new markets and vertical industries, accelerating product creation and capitalizing on major technology trends such as

Generative AI, intelligent automation, cybersecurity and cloud. They’re looking to collaborate with a trusted partner that

demonstrates a proven track record of generating customer growth and optimized service delivery that can help them

achieve these goals and adapt to an everchanging market.

Given this challenging environment, we are well prepared and strongly positioned to help new and existing clients navigate

these turbulent times and implement their tactical and strategic plans. During the last three years of our journey to $1 billion

in annualized revenue, we have future-proofed and embedded resiliency into our organization, and we will continue to adjust

our operations to ongoing economic, market and technology shifts.
