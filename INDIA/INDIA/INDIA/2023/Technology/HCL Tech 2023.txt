Chief Executive Officer &: Managing

Dear Stakeholders,

We are delighted to present our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) for the financial year April 1, 2022 to March

31, 2023 (“FY23”). We engaged Ernst & Young Associates LLP (“EY”), as a third party to perform an independent limited assurance of our

BRSR. The independent assurance statement by EY is also enclosed as part of the Annual Report.

HCLTech has undergone significant changes during FY23. We launched a new brand identity and we published our new purpose statement

– “To bring together the best of technology and our people to supercharge progress”. The mantra of supercharging progress guides how

we accelerate digital transformation for our clients, advances the aspirations of our people, contributes toward a more sustainable planet

and works toward equitable and sustainable communities. The disclosures we present in our BRSR, reflect our HCLTech purpose.

The environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) & diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) committee of the board met on four occasions

in FY23 when HCLTech’s steady progress across these dimensions was reviewed. The key dimensions of our progress against our

targets, have also been validated by external third-party recognitions. Some of the highlights are outlined below:

•

MSCI has rated HCLTech as an ESG ‘Leader’ in the software and services industry. This year, HCLTech has been recognized as a

leader with an “AA” rating, a significant move up from last year’s “A” rating.

•

The S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2023 has recognized HCLTech as an ‘Industry Mover’. The Yearbook lists leading companies

that have demonstrated sustainable business practices in their operations.

•

HCLTech has also been included in Sustainalytics’ 2023 Top-Rated ESG companies list in the Software and Services Industry

segment and in the Asia Pacific Region.

The progress achieved would not be possible without the appropriate focused execution and resource allocation of the initiatives and

projects by the respective teams involved.

Each quarter, the committee presented its review on outcomes and relevant milestones to the board. During FY’23, in response to the

recommendations of the committee, HCLTech has implemented an internal audit system covering all ESG disclosures. The outcome of

the audit was reviewed by the Audit Committee of the board.

A separate sustainability report for FY’23 will also be published to give more details on the sustainability strategy implementation and the

performance against the commitment and goals that have been outlined by HCLTech.

We will be eager to have your feedback on the BRSR disclosures and the sustainability report and look forward to hearing from you.
