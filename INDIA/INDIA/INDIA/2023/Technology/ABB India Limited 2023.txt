Vulnerable / marginalized stakeholder engagement

Women, the elderly, adolescents, youth, children, and persons with disabilities, are some of the key vulnerable groups

identified during our stakeholder engagement, as they experience the highest degree of socio-economic marginalization.

These groups become even more vulnerable in emergencies. The Company, in line with ABB CSR policy, prioritizes the needs

of these groups and gives them quality assistance by engaging with institutional partners who work with them. Several

programs under the Company’s CSR have been implemented to address the above vulnerable groups.

PRINCIPLE 5 Businesses should respect and promote

Human Rights

Recognizing Human Rights

ABB recognizes ‘respect for human rights’ to be one of it’s core principles and has therefore included this value in ABB Code

of Conduct, ABB Human Rights Policy and the ABB Sustainability Strategy 2030.

ABB is committed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,

the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the ILO Core Conventions on Labour Standards, the UK Modern Slavery Act

and other similar standards for upholding human rights.

Apart from being a long-standing and active member of the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights and the UN Global

Compact, the ABB group also engages with several NGOs to uphold the human rights of vulnerable groups.

A Human Rights Working Group with dedicated Human Rights Champions for each of the business areas, like marketing and

sales, procurement and operations, works to better embed human rights in the internal processes is in place. Our Human

Rights Champions have also been nominated in relevant business countries as experts on human rights.

Essential Indicators
