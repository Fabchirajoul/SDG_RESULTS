Chairman's Letter to Stakeholders

18 CEO's: Letter to Stakeholders

20 Board of

Letter to Stakeholders.: Dear Stakeholders,

I am happy to share that in FY23 our revenue crossed

$11 billion, a growth of 11.5% YoY in constant currency

terms. This makes it our second consecutive year of

double-digit growth since we began our transformation

journey in 2020. The Board approved a buyback for the

value of `120 billion ($1.5 billion) at the price of `445 per

equity share. This is the biggest buyback in Wipro’s history.

We were tested this year by a difficult global

macro-economic environment. Even as the pandemic

receded, the Ukraine conflict entered a second year and the

global interest rates stayed high. While technology adoption

as a whole remained secular, in the second half of FY23,

we saw some re-prioritization–more cost optimization and

less discretionary spending–particularly in sectors like BFSI

and technology.

Our efficiency and growth-focused solutions allowed us to

respond quickly and pertinently to these developments.

We ended the year with strong bookings, a growth of 28%

from last year, and hired 22,000 Next-Gen Associates

(or freshers, as we called them earlier), our highest for a

single year.

This year, as in the previous one, we made several major

strategic investments, added new capabilities, and grew

our talent to support future growth. We brought together

Wipro’s entire cloud capability under a fully integrated

global business line (GBL) called Wipro FullStride Cloud,

which accounts for more than a third of our Company’s

revenue. We acquired Rizing, a global SAP consulting firm,

and made significant hires in our cybersecurity practice,

helping us create industry-leading applications. On April 1,

2023, we reorganized ourselves into four global business

lines–FullStride Cloud, Enterprise Futuring, Engineering

Edge, and Consulting–to help us align more strongly with

our clients’ priorities and drive growth in our strategic areas.

FY23 was a pivotal year for technology, with artificial

intelligence taking a quantum leap. While we have been long

familiar with AI-powered products (think predictive text,

digital personal assistants, chat bots), OpenAI’s ChatGPT

and Dall-E brought discussions about the use of generative

AI emphatically into the public domain.

The next decade, we believe, will be the

age of AI. We have been investing ahead of

the curve to understand AI and leverage its

power inside Wipro, and to create solutions

for our clients.

Ambitions Realized.

Performance Overview:

Managing Director is a professional CEO

who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the

Company. Of the seven Non-Executive Directors, six

are Independent Directors, free from any business or

other relationship that could materially influence their

judgment. In the opinion of the Board, all the Independent

Directors are independent of the management and

satisfy the criteria of independence as defined under

the Companies Act, 2013, the Listing Regulations and

the NYSE Listed Company manual.

The Board is well diversified and consists of three

women Independent Directors and five Directors who

are foreign nationals. The profiles of our Directors are

leadership.

Board Meetings

The Board meeting dates are decided in consultation

with the Board members. The schedule of the

Board meetings and Board Committee meetings are

communicated in advance to the Directors to enable

them to attend the meetings.

The Board meetings are normally scheduled over two

days. In addition, every quarter, Independent Directors

meet amongst themselves exclusively. In line with Para

4 of Schedule B of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading)

Regulations, 2015, it is the endeavour of the Company

that the gap between the clearance of accounts by audit

committee and board meeting is as narrow as possible.

Information flow to the Board Members

Information is provided to the Board Members on a

continuous basis for their review, inputs, and approval

from time to time. More specifically, we present

our annual strategic plan and operating plan of our

business to the Board for their review, inputs, and

approval. Likewise, our quarterly financial statements

and annual financial statements are first presented to

the Audit Committee and subsequently to the Board

for their approval. In addition, various matters such

as review of business performance, appointment of

Directors and Key Managerial Personnel, corporate

actions, review of internal and statutory audits, details

of investor grievances, specific cases of acquisitions,

important managerial decisions, material positive/

negative developments, risk management initiatives

including cyber security along with mitigation actions

and legal/statutory matters are presented to the

respective Committees of the Board and later with
