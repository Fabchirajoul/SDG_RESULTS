Dear Stakeholders,

I am happy to address you as part of

the Annual Report of CAMS for FY23 at

a time when the world has almost come

out of the Pandemic. The year also

witnessed the capital markets weighing-

in the impact of various macroeconomic

events including the Russia-Ukraine

war, high inflation, and reports of China

Covid surge. Despite the global volatility

and slowdown, the Indian MF Industry

remained resilient, particularly with

retail investor participation.

CAMS retained its performance levels

and continued to make significant

progress in operational excellence and

customer satisfaction. It successfully

managed multiple large New Fund

Offers for Mutual Fund houses

smoothly and efficiently. It has also

geared up to meet the increased

requirements of the MF industry due

to the growing volumes. It has been

making significant investments in

enhancing its operational capabilities,

cyber security features and

technological innovations.

The Company continued to focus on

its growth through multiple avenues. It

has been appointed as the Registrar

and Transfer Agent for Helios and

Navi Mutual fund. The momentum in

the Alternatives platform and services

increased both on the revenue side

and in launching market relevant

technology. There has also been

significant progress as Account

Aggregator and TSP combination,

onboarding several marquee banks,

broking houses, NBFCs and wealth

platforms. The Insurance Repository

business saw improved traction

and the number of eInsurance

accounts that is being opened was

on a continuous increase. The CRA

operations completed the first full year

of operations during the year and

eNPS clocked a double-digit market

share and PoP modules went live.

MFCentral, India’s first industry-wide

all-in-one investment management

platform which was launched last

year along with other RTA has seen

increased utilisation by the investors.

The payments business carried on by

the Company has become a regulated

business and the Company has

received the in-principle approval from

Reserve Bank of India for carrying out

the business as a Payment Aggregator.

As part of its efforts to increase its

Non Mutual Fund revenue and for

improving its presence in new edge

technology platforms, CAMS has

acquired a controlling stake in two

start-up entities viz. Fintuple and

Think360 AI. Integration of their

products with the services of CAMS is

underway and this will assist CAMS in

building overall market reach and drive

innovation. The product and solution

suite of Think360 AI is a great fit to

the Account Aggregator offerings of

CAMS, and this will help the Company

to solidify its position as a digital public

infrastructure. This acquisition will also

further drive CAMS’ vision of providing

technologically superior products in the

analytics space.

On behalf of the Board of CAMS,

I would like to thank investors,

intermediaries and all the customers

who avail our services for making us the

industry leader. My heartfelt gratitude

to all the employees of CAMS Group

for their commitment to excel and hard

work which has enabled the Company

to retain its leadership position. I would

also like to thank our shareholders

who have reposed their faith in us and

the Directors on the Board for their

support and active participation in the

governance of the Company.

Warm Regards,

Dinesh Kumar Mehrotra

Chairman

Computer Age Management Services Limited

Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present the Annual

report for FY23. The year has been

satisfying with the MF Industry posting a

positive increase despite the headwinds

of global volatility, inflationary trends

and rising interest rates. Mutual Funds

continued to be a preferred choice

of retail investors and recorded new

highs in the asset base. Enabling the

business growth of MF Industry is core

to CAMS’ value proposition. Its support

for the industry is engineered through

superior technology, solutions for new

products, development of new services

and creation of brand-new digital

conveniences apart from others. We also

made significant strides in other business

verticals and built momentum in the new

businesses. It’s a privilege to share the

key highlights of the year with you.

Financial Performance

During FY23, the consolidated

revenue of the Company was ` 971.83

Crore which was a 6.8% increase

over the previous year. The PBT

at ` 380.19 Crore marginally down

by 0.6% compared to the previous

year. Dividend of 375% inclusive of

the final dividend to be approved by

the shareholders was recommended

during the year.

Customer Satisfaction

The Company’s philosophy as

reflected in its mission statement –

‘Our Mission… Your Growth’ – mirrors

our core value of serving customers,

including investors, intermediaries,

clients, employees, and every other

stakeholder. This mindset that drives

our service efficiency has invoked

deep appreciation from our customers.

The recent customer satisfaction

survey showed a response of 96.1%

of the respondents stating it as very

satisfied/satisfied. More than 40K

investors who utilised multiple modes

of touchpoints offered by CAMS

responded to the survey.

Operational Excellence

Mutual Funds

FY23 marched ahead to see month-

on-month increase in volumes as

retail investor participation remained

steady on the back of their confidence

in the capital markets and in Mutual

Funds in particular. Transaction

volumes scaled to nearly 39 million

monthly transactions, catapulting

the annual transaction volume to

466 million, a 12% increase over the

previous year.

SIP registration momentum kept

pace to the positive sentiment to

record in excess of 15 million new

registrations during FY23. CAMS

serviced Funds garnered 71% of the

NFO collections and supported new

MF folios to touch 13 million during

the year. We maintained our strong

focus on operational excellence for the

long term with continued investments

in technology and people. CAMS

operations, technology, intermediaries’

support, digital enablers, customer

service and front offices stretched

every sinew to ensure high service

delivery for these staggering volumes.

Milestone events such as Transition of

L & T Mutual Fund’s assets to HSBC

MF, change of control of IDFC MF to

Bandhan MF and onboarding of NAVI

Mutual Fund were carried out smoothly

without any investor inconvenience.

Firmly focussed on client

convenience, we have used

technology and innovatively evolved

smart strategies for investor

satisfaction. Many of the technology-

based initiatives that went live during

the year, enabled the Company to

improve its delivery standards.
