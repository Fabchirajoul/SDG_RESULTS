Dear Stakeholders,

We are pleased to provide you with an update on the sustainability initiatives and achievements at Astra Microwave. Our

commitment to integrating sustainability into our operations remains strong, and we are dedicated to addressing the

environmental, social, and governance (ESG) challenges we face. Here are some significant highlights of our sustainability

journey:

We have conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment, identifying key sustainability issues based on their

significance and impact. This assessment has allowed us to prioritize and address these issues effectively. Additionally,

we have diligently calculated our emissions and water footprint, enabling us to measure and manage our environmental

impact efficiently. This data forms the basis of our sustainability strategies and targets.

To ensure a structured approach, we have developed an overarching Business Responsibility and Reporting (BRR) policy.

This policy guides our actions and decisions, reinforcing our commitment to sustainability. Moreover, we are proud to

announce that our Bangalore building has achieved a remarkable 5-star GRIHA rating, showcasing our dedication to

energy efficiency and sustainable infrastructure.

As part of our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint, we have installed a solar power plant to increase our consumption of

renewable energy sources. This step contributes to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future. Furthermore, we have

implemented sewage treatment plants (STPs) across our units to manage wastewater properly. This ensures responsible

water usage and minimizes our environmental impact.

We recognize the importance of our employees in driving sustainability. Therefore, we prioritize their training and

development, equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills to contribute effectively. Additionally, we have

established a grievance portal that offers a transparent and efficient platform for vendors, customers, investors, and

employees to address their concerns and grievances.

We are aware of the challenges presented by ESG, including data availability and quality, regulatory uncertainties, and

evolving investor expectations. As a proactive organization, we are continuously monitoring and adapting to these

challenges to ensure our sustainability practices align with the best standards and practices. Moreover, we have set targets

in critical areas such as poverty eradication, energy, sustainable transport, health and population, and promoting full and

productive employment. These targets serve as milestones on our journey towards sustainable development.

In conclusion, we remain committed to transparency, continuous improvement, and collaboration with our stakeholders.

We value your support and engagement as we work together to create a better, more sustainable future.

Sincerely,

S. Gurunatha Reddy: Managing
