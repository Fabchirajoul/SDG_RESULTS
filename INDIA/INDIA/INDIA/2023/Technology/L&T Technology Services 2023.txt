Corporate

Overview

02-38:

Dear Shareholders,

During the year, L&T Technology Services crossed

the $ 1 billion revenue run rate for the first time.

The achievement is even more salient when seen

against the backdrop of macroeconomic volatility,

supply chain disruptions and simmering geopolitical

tensions. The success in achieving our revenue targets

reaffirms our credentials as India’s largest pure-play

technology services provider. It also paves the way for

us to consolidate our presence and build further on our

successes. I thank you for your faith and trust in the

leadership team.

The road ahead holds greater promise. As the global

economic scenario improves, and organizations

look to leverage emerging technologies across

the communications, energy, sustainability, and

cybersecurity domains, your Company is well poised

to scale and deliver unmatched value to its customers.

Technology-driven initiatives will continue to be

the driving force for sustained growth and inclusive

development worldwide.

Smart World and Communication: Unlocking

New Value Paradigms

Early in Q4, as part of its strategic objective to expand

capabilities and deepen competencies across key technology

domains, your Company completed the acquisition of L&T’s

business of Smart World and Communication (SWC). This entity

possesses significant talent and extensive experience of

working with marquee telecom and OEM companies. As an

innovation-led business, SWC’s track record includes the

development of Fusion – a state-of-the-art software platform

for data analytics, and gEdge – a green Data Center that can be

used at the Edge to contribute to savings in Capex and Opex.

Its engineers have also implemented extensive communication

projects of complexity and scale across India, underscoring their

capabilities in network orchestration and smart city systems.

I am confident that the acquisition of SWC will unlock new

synergies for your Company, help scale its offerings around

5G and next-gen communications, and drive growth across

geographies. The acquisition closed at the start of the current

fiscal, and subsequent performance provides reassurance of

future outcomes.

Leveraging Global Opportunities: An ER&D

Perspective

We are witnessing an exponential rise in global demand

for a range of emerging technologies, including vehicle

electrification, next-gen connectivity, digital products and

solutions, smart manufacturing practices, cutting-edge

healthcare delivery, and a more sustainable approach to

business operations. These key trends are reshaping the

global ER&D landscape, driving new investment decisions,

and defining business growth plans. Recent market research

also indicates that most business leaders are looking to

enhance their ER&D spends despite an uncertain economic

outlook, with a major focus on digital engineering services

and solutions. As a result, we are looking at a scenario where

digital engineering activities are set to account for over 53%

of all global engineering spends, growing 1.7x by 2025.

Managing Director’s Message: Dear Shareholders,

This was a landmark year at LTTS. We achieved the

milestone of a billion dollars in revenue run rate,

surpassed ` 1,000 crore in annual profits, crossed 1,000

patent filings, and closed our largest acquisition to

date. What makes our achievements even more special

is that these were attained in a year that continued to

be defined by geo-political uncertainties and supply

chain challenges across geographies and industries.

I take this opportunity to thank our customers,

shareholders, employees, and all key stakeholders for

their continued trust and faith in Team LTTS as we

continue to engineer sustainable growth journeys.

The accomplishments during the year reaffirm our

position as the industry bellwether, and bear witness

to LTTS’ continued commitment toward expanding and

deepening our offerings and capabilities across the

global technology landscape.

The record-setting performance during the year can be

attributed to the combination of our robust innovation

capabilities with a core Engineering DNA – a major

differentiator and enabler in a rapidly evolving global

landscape. This belief in a technology-defined future is driven

by our 6 Big Bets: Electric Autonomous and Connected

Vehicles, Nex-Gen Comms, AI & Digital Products, Digital

Manufacturing, MedTech, and Sustainability. Our focus on

each of these strategic areas has not only helped us deliver

industry-leading performance across each of our five verticals,

but also strengthened our commitment towards delivering a

profitable, sustainable, and inclusive growth paradigm.

Celebrating Performance and Consistency:

Our Industry Defining Moment

During the year, we continued to redefine the performance

paradigms for the pure-play ER&D industry. Our revenues for

the year were at $ 990 million, a growth of 16% in constant

currency, led by broad-based double digit performance

across each of the key geographies - North America, Europe,

India, and Rest of the World (RoW). In terms of vertical-wise

growth, the Transportation segment led the trajectory,

followed by Plant Engineering, Industrial Products, Medical

Devices, and Telecom & Hi-tech.

Annual EBIT margin for the fiscal was the highest ever

at 18.5%, driven by our focus on building a robust and

sustainable operating model. The strong revenue growth

and operational performance led to a 22% rise in PAT to

` 1,170 crore. Over the last 5 years, our PAT has continued

to grow at a stellar 18% CAGR through a combination of

steady expansions and rising operating margins. We further

improved ROE to 26% for the year – again on the back of

consistent PAT growth.

The confidence of customers in your Company’s capabilities

and offerings was further reflected in the number and size of

Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Board of India

not yet made publicly available by the Company, which,

when made publicly available, can materially impact the

for transacting in the Company’s securities, after seeking

prior clearance for transactions wherever necessary, and a

mechanism for periodical reporting of transactions.

The objective of the Code is to prevent the purchase and/

or sale of shares of the Company by an Insider on the basis

of unpublished price sensitive information. Under this

Code, Designated Persons (Directors, Advisors, Officers,

and other concerned employees/persons) are prevented

from dealing in the Company’s shares during the closure

of the Trading Window. To deal in securities beyond

specified limits, permission of the Compliance Officer is

also required.

All the employees falling in the Designated Persons

category are also required to disclose related

information periodically as defined in the Code.

Directors and Designated Persons who buy and sell

shares of the Company are prohibited from entering

into a contra transaction i.e., an opposite transaction

i.e., sell or buy any shares of the Company during

the next six months following the prior transactions.

Pursuant to the enactment of the SEBI (Prohibition of

Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018, the

Company has suitably modified the provisions of the

Code which are effective from 1st April 2019. Further,

the Company modifies the Code as and when there are

amendments in the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading)

Regulations, 2015.

Ms. Prajakta Powle, Company Secretary, has been

designated as the Compliance Officer. Mr. Rajeev Gupta

and Procedures for Fair Disclosure of Unpublished Price

Sensitive Information which is available on the Company’s

website at www.LTTS.com.
