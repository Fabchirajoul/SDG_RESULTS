OUTLOOK

This year’s NASSCOM’s strategic review report is themed “Priming for a ‘No Normal’ Future”; as the Indian technology Industry has

displayed resilience and growth in the wake of global uncertainty, as well as strengthened its position as a trusted global technology

leader over the past several years.

Midway through 2022, uncertainty resulting from recent global events largely centered on persistent inflation, fiscal tightening,

market volatility and geopolitical tensions, signalled that the world economy was headed towards a potentially prolonged downturn,

foreshadowing a likely global recession.

According to McKinsey’s recent Global Economics Intelligence summary, the growth estimates for 2023 and 2024 have become less

acute pointing towards a shorter slowdown, with an anticipated rebound in 2024. Even in the backdrop of this dynamic environment,

enterprise IT spending has remained strong and is projected at $4.6 trillion in 2023, an increase of 5.5% from 2022, according to the

latest forecast by Gartner.

This duality in the environment is a result of the different economic realities being faced by consumers and enterprises. Enterprises are

continuing to increase spending on digital business initiatives despite the slowdown.

A divergence from previous cyclical downturns can be explained by modern enterprises prioritizing segments of technology spend as a

means of transforming their business and becoming more innovative, with a view towards optimizing current revenue streams or creating

new ones. This is echoed by NASSCOM’s report which states that technology will continue to be a strategic imperative, which is a critical

component of business innovation and transformation, as well as a source of improving operational and cost efficiencies. This is also

evident by the fact that leaders in enterprise technology are growing five times faster than laggards today, whereas this gap was only two

times before the pandemic. Leveraging technology is going to be a critical factor in an enterprise’s catalyst of the future.

In this dynamic environment, your Company continues to move forward from a position of strength. Your Company has a foundation

of strong industry solutions, marquee client base and earnings and cash flow; all these aspects will help your Company to continue to

execute its growth strategy and insulate it from the market challenges. Your Company’s lead indicators are positive with the second

highest deal wins on record where BFSI continues to generate highest share of the pipeline. Even with the recent disruption in the US

banking system that impacted smaller community banks, the Company’s larger portfolio of clientele, focused on organizations that are

tightly governed, remains protected from the resulting after-effects. Your Company’s business from US regional banks is a low single

digit percentage contribution to the overall revenue. Your Company will continue to work with its clients to build their transformation

capabilities and get them future-ready. Your Company’s continuously evolving Tribes and Squads model driving the themes of cloud-led

transformation is the steering force behind strong TCV. This model has helped your Company to scale its ability to service the growing

pipeline; your Company’s overall pipeline for large deals remain strong and well-distributed across all verticals. Some of the pipelines that

have been built up over vendor consolidation may translate into additional TCV in near future. At this stage, your Company is focusing

on the micro while being attentive to the developing macro-environment.

Your Company made the right choices a few years ago - technology as a service, consumer and cost - are now converging in this

backdrop. The technology investing super cycle that started in 2021 is still underway and your Company foresees that enterprises will

continue to prioritize investments in areas such as cloud, data engineering and strategic data assets, as well as areas like cybersecurity,

customer experience and support transformation, as the latter also leads to a significant cost takeout opportunities. This will necessitate

a pivot for the entire industry from maintenance and infrastructure services to transformation that can enable clients to deliver better
