Chairman’s: Letter

Board of

Dear Shareholders,

Warm regards

Amita Birla

During FY23, our consolidated

revenue grew by 16.1% to Rs 47,948

million, driven by our business and

technology transformation that

includes Digital Services, which

registered an even higher growth of

19.2%. We reported an Adj EBITDA of

Rs 6715 million, translating to an Adj

EBITDA margin of 14% for the year.

All this signals that our deal win

momentum remains strong, and our

margins are expected to strengthen as

we move forward.

Today we are at the edge of a pivotal

moment, so much has gone right as

we work with diligent focus on our

inner transformation. With a focus on

reorganising ourselves to create

efficient teams, verticals and

functions, we have designed a future

ready org structure and ways of

working, onboarded key leaders to

strengthen our client proposition and

upgraded our Go To Market approach.

This strategic realignment has

empowered our global teams with a

"One Birlasoft" vision and culture.

We have enhanced our sales and

delivery practices by institutionalising

best practices and investing in

upskilling the teams. We are

consciously strengthening our market

facing organisation, making necessary

bold investments and have deepened

our relationships with key partners

like hyper scalers, SaaS, ERP and data

analytics partners.

We also strengthened our long

standing customer relationships

during the year, with revenues from

our Top 10 customers recording a 17%

growth. This reflects the confidence

that our top tier customers have in our

capabilities. We are committed to

investing in strategic relationship

building and becoming increasingly

relevant to our customers by

developing capabilities across the

board: offshore and onsite, as we

continue to think, behave, and

strategise. We expanded our delivery

footprint with the operationalisation of

a new 250 seat capacity delivery

centre in Coimbatore. Our suite of

enterprise solutions is streamlined

and combines our sales and delivery

capabilities to provide best in class

consultative, operational and delivery

efficiencies for ensuring fulfilment at

speed and scale.

This value maximisation for our

stakeholders is a direct outcome of the

contribution of each of our employees.

All our 12,000+ professionals, have

played a vital role in our growth

journey. Our employees are our

partners and embody the Customer

first mindset, the stretch in their

targets indicating how bold and

ambitious they are for our clients. I

thank each one of our employees for

making customer first and organisation

a priority, with a growth mindset that

are the hallmarks of Birlasoft today.

Our focus towards being an Employer

of choice ensures that our work

environment is built around a culture

of collaboration and innovation. This

has contributed to us being certified as

a Great Place to Work for the second

consecutive year.

Birlasoft’s innovative solutions and

technical capabilities continue to be

recognised by various industry bodies

and analyst firms, securing high ranks

in their respective studies. These

include recognitions from ISG,

Avasant and SAP to name a few. This

repeated external acknowledgment

reinforces our position as a leader in

the industry, and reaffirms the value

we add to our clients.

At Birlasoft, we believe in giving back

to the society and the communities we

work with. Our CSR efforts are driven

by two key themes, environmental

sustainability and empowerment and

enablement of women and children.

During this fiscal, we were honoured

with the award for 'CSR Project of the

Corporate Overview:

Managing Director. Angan has extensive experience in scale

and business transformation, brand building, strong customer

engagement, and building high-performing teams – all of which

align well with the Company’s growth ambitions. Additionally,

the Company has taken measures to strengthen both its front-

end market-facing team as well as the service lines, delivery

operations, and enabling functions, with multiple new leaders being

inducted. These new leaders come with deep domain experience

and extensive experience.

As the Company re-invents itself to sharpen its go-to-market focus

and build a growth mindset, significant changes have been initiated

along these key dimensions: (i) to become sharply focused on its

chosen industry verticals and service lines, (ii) to culturally become

more nimble and execution-oriented, and (iii) to be region-aligned

to be closer to the markets it serves.

Initiatives to build a growth-oriented organisation

Among the measures undertaken to drive better growth in the

coming years is a restructuring of the Company’s organisation,

with its operations now aligned by industry verticals. The revamped

organisational structure should enable greater synergies,

efficiencies, and predictability. With a focus on capability building,

technology excellence, pre-sales, and solutions building, the

key initiatives that are being or already have been rolled out are

summarised as under:

•

The front-end team and back-end leadership is being

reinforced, with a mix of external hires and internal promotions.

•

The organisation has been redesigned to optimise its

cultural transformation initiatives around six key tenets:

High ‘Say-Do’ Ratio, Be Bold, Customer Centricity, Quick

Decision-making, Employee Centricity, and Organisation

First. The objective is to ensure greater accountability and

swifter action.

•

At the back-end, a new COO (Chief Operating Officer) role

has been created, which will be responsible for all back-end

operations – leading delivery, building up capabilities from

a service lines perspective, and running the Company’s

CIO/InfoSec and CTO functions. Consequently, the

Company now has a single, unified delivery organisation.

The organisation's new structure is expected to yield

better efficiencies, with operations aligned by verticals,

enabling a more focused approach. With a single unified

delivery system, the Company can ensure consistency and

quality of its services across all verticals. Additionally, the

establishment of horizontals/service lines has enabled

a greater focus on capability building and technology

excellence, providing the organisation with a competitive

advantage.

The team and leadership reinforcements have brought in fresh

perspectives and new ideas, resulting in a more dynamic and

growth-oriented organisation. At the same time, a healthy mix

of external hires and internal promotions has ensured continuity,

contributed to a diverse and inclusive workforce, and is fostering

a culture of accountability and meritocracy.

The Organisation First approach encourages better and effective

collaboration while the focus on employee centricity has resulted

in a motivated and engaged workforce, which is getting reflected

in both employee satisfaction as well as improving attrition rates.

These changes are leading to a more future-ready organisation,

deeply committed to solving customer challenges with multi-

tower engagements and build upon its multiple 10+ years client

relationships. The organisation is gearing up to address the

opportunities around large-scale business transformations, new

technologies, and changing business models.

These initiatives, which should start yielding results over the course

of the year, would position Birlasoft strongly to capitalize upon the

bounce-back in demand once macro headwinds ease up.

Review of operating and financial Performance

Birlasoft’s performance during the year under review reflects its inherent strengths as well as some initial impact from the changes that

the renewed leadership has been making. The Company’s consolidated revenue for the year registered a growth of 16.1% to H 47,948

million. This growth was led by its top customers, with Top-10 accounts recording a growth of 17% year-on-year, and was achieved despite

the discontinuation of revenue contribution from a US-based customer Invacare Corporation that had to file a petition for relief under

Chapter 11 of Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court. This development also resulted in a one-time provision amounting to about

H 1,510 million during the year against the outstanding receivables and contract assets pertaining to that customer. While this matter

has been put to rest now, after the settlement that was amicably entered into with Invacare recently, it did affect the Company’s reported

earnings for the year under review. Consolidated EBITDA for the year under review stood at H 6,715 million translating into an EBITDA

margin of 14%, after excluding the afore-mentioned one-time provision. Profit After Taxes (PAT) for the year stood at H 3,316 million.

1.

Significant accounting policies

Basis of preparation of standalone financial statements

The standalone financial statements are prepared in

accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to

as "Ind AS") as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies

Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules as amended from time to time. The standalone

financial statements are presented in millions of Indian

rupees rounded off to two decimal places, except per share

information, unless otherwise stated.

Accounting policies have been consistently applied except

where a newly issued accounting standard is initially

adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard

requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.

These financial statements have been prepared on the

historical cost basis except share based payments, defined

benefit obligations and certain financial instruments, which

are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting

period, as explained in the accounting policies below.

Use of estimates

The preparation of standalone financial statements

requires the management of the Company to make

judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the

reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures

relating to the contingent liabilities as at the date of the

financial statements and reported amounts of income and

expenditure during the year. Actual results could differ

from estimates. Differences between actual results and

estimates are recognized in the year in which the results are

known / materialized.

Critical accounting estimates

a.

Revenue Recognition

The Company uses the percentage-of-completion

method in accounting for its fixed-price contracts. Use

of the percentage-of-completion method requires the

Company to estimate the efforts or costs expended to

date as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to be

expended. Efforts or costs expended have been used

to measure progress towards completion as there is

a direct relationship between input and satisfaction

of performance obligation. Provisions for estimated

losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded

in the period in which such losses become probable

based on the expected contract estimates at the

reporting date.

b.

Income tax & Deferred tax

Significant judgments are involved in determining

the provision for income taxes, including amount

expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax

positions. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the

extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will

be available against which the deductible temporary

differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly,

the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the

carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of

each reporting period.

c.

Measurement of defined benefit obligation, key

actuarial assumptions and share based payments

Information

about

assumptions

and

estimation

uncertainties in respect of defined benefit obligation

and share based payment are given in note 31 and note

36 respectively.

d.

Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using Ind-

AS 103, Business Combinations. Ind-AS 103 requires

the identifiable intangible assets and contingent

consideration to be fair valued in order to ascertain

the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities

and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. Significant

estimates are required to be made in determining the

value of contingent consideration and intangible assets.

e.

Leases

The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies

to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116.

Identification of a lease requires significant judgment.

The Company uses significant judgement in assessing

the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and

the applicable discount rate.

f.

Impairment of investment in subsidiaries

The Company reviews its carrying value of investments

carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually,

Independent Auditor’s Report

To the Members of Birlasoft Limited

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of

Birlasoft Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding

Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its

subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), which comprise

the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2023, and the

consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other

comprehensive income), consolidated statement of changes

in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year

then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements,

including a summary of significant accounting policies and

other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the

consolidated financial statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to

the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of

reports of other auditors on separate financial statements of such

subsidiaries, as were audited by the other auditors, the aforesaid

consolidated financial statements give the information required

by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required

and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting

principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state

of affairs of the Group as at 31 March 2023, of its consolidated

profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated changes

in equity and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on

Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our

responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated

Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent

of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are

relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in

terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered

Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and

we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance

with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence

obtained by us along with the consideration of reports of the

other auditors referred to in the “Other Matters” section below,

is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on

the consolidated financial statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional

judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the

consolidated financial statements of the current period. These

matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the

consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our

opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on

these matters.

Revenue recognition in respect of fixed price contracts See note 1.4 and 29 to consolidated financial statements

The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

Revenue recognition in respect of fixed price contracts:

The group engages in fixed-price contracts with customers.

In respect of fixed-price contracts other than maintenance

and support service contracts, revenue is recognised using

percentage of completion computed as per the input

method. This is based on the Group’s estimate of contract

costs and efforts for completion of contract. Provision for

estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded

in the period in which such losses become probable based

on the expected contract estimates at the reporting date.

Contract estimates are formed by the Group considering

the following:

á

Application of the revenue recognition accounting

standard is complex. It involves a number of key

judgements and estimates. One of the key estimate

is total cost-to-completion of these contracts. It is

used to determine the percentage of completion of

the relevant performance obligation.

á

There is judgement involved in identification of

distinct performance obligations and determination

of transaction price for such performance obligations.

á

These contracts may involve onerous obligations on

the Company requiring critical estimates to be made.

á

Contracts are subject to modification to account for

changes in contract specification and requirements.

Our audit procedure in this area included the following:

á

Obtained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls implemented

by the Group and evaluating the design and implementation of internal controls

for measuring and recording revenue and the associated contract assets and

unearned revenue;

á

Tested the design and operating effectiveness of key IT controls over IT environment

in which the business systems operate. This includes access controls, program

change controls, program development controls and IT operation controls;

á

For selected samples of contracts, we inspected the terms of the contract and

assessed the revenue recognised in accordance with Ind AS by:

i.

Evaluating the identification of performance obligations.

ii.

Agreeing the transaction price to the underlying contracts.

iii.

Inspecting the approval of the estimates of cost to complete.

iv.

Challenging the Group’s estimate of contract cost through a retrospective

comparison of costs incurred with budgeted costs. Identifying significant

variations and testing variations resulting into re-estimating the remaining

costs to complete the contract.

v.

Assessing the work in progress (contract assets) on the balance sheet date by

inspecting the underlying invoices and signed agreements on sample basis to

identify possible delays in achieving milestones. Those may require change

in estimated costs to complete the remaining performance obligations.

Group Overview

Birlasoft Limited (“the Company”) is a public limited company

incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and its shares

are listed on the National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock

Exchange. The Company’s registered office is in Pune and it has

subsidiaries across multiple geographies.

The Group provides Software Development, global IT consulting

to its clients, predominantly in Banking, Financial Services and

Insurance, Life Sciences and Services, Energy Resources and

Utilities and Manufacturing (which mainly includes Discrete

Manufacturing, Hi-Tech & Media, Auto and Consumer packaged

goods) verticals.

These Consolidated Financial Statements were authorised for

issue by the Group’s Board of Directors on 08 May 2023.

Significant accounting policies

1.1

Basis of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements relate to Birlasoft

Limited (‘the Company’) and its subsidiary companies

which constitutes ‘the Group’.

a.

Basis

of

preparation

of

consolidated

financial

statements

i.

The financial statements of the subsidiary

companies used in the consolidation, have been

aligned with the parent group and are drawn up to

the same reporting date as of the group, i.e. year

ended 31 March 2023.

ii.

The

consolidated

financial

statements

are

prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting

Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed

under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read

with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)

Rules as amended from time to time. The

consolidated financial statements are presented

in millions of Indian rupees rounded off to two

decimal places, except per share information,

unless otherwise stated.

Accounting policies have been consistently applied

except where a newly issued accounting standard is

initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting

standard requires a change in the accounting policy

hitherto in use.

These financial statements have been prepared on

the historical cost basis, accounting for share based

payments, defined benefit obligations and certain

financial instruments, which are measured at fair values

at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the

accounting policies below.

b.

Principles of consolidation:

The Consolidated financial statements have been

prepared on the following basis:

i.

The financial statements of all entities are drawn

up to same reporting date as that of the parent

group i.e. 31 March 2023 for the purpose of

preparation of consolidated financial statements.

ii.

The Company consolidates all the entities over

which it has control. The Company establishes

control when it is exposed, or has rights, to

variable returns from its involvement with the

entity and has the ability to affect those returns

through its power over the entity. The financial

statements of subsidiaries are included in the

consolidated financial statements from the date

on which control commences until the date on

which the control ceases.

iii.

The financial statements of the Company and its

subsidiary companies have been combined on

a line-by-line basis by adding together the book

value of like items of assets, liabilities, income

and expenses. The intra-group balances and

intra-group transactions and unrealized profits or

losses have been fully eliminated. These financial

statements are prepared by applying uniform

accounting policies in use at the Company.

iv.

The excess of cost of acquisition to the Group

over the share of net fair value of identifiable

assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the

subsidiary companies, at the acquisition dates, is

recognized as ‘Goodwill on consolidation’ being

an asset in the consolidated financial statements.

Where the fair value of identifiable assets and

liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after

reassessing the fair values of the net assets and

contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as

capital reserve. Goodwill is measured at cost less

accumulated impairment losses.

v.

Non-controlling interest is initially measured

either at fair value or at the proportionate share of

the subsidiary companies’ identifiable net assets.

The choice of measurement basis is made on an

acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequently,

the carrying amount of non-controlling interest

is adjusted for the changes in the equity of the

subsidiary companies.

A)

Vertical segments

The Group has identified business segments (‘industry vertical’) as reportable segments. The business segments comprise:

1)

Manufacturing,

2) Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI),

3) Energy and Utilities,

4) Life Sciences

Revenue, Income and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under each reportable segment. All other Income

and expenses which are not attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as unallocable expenses.

Assets and liabilities used in the Group’s business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used

interchangeably between segments. The management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures

relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.

In terms of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961,

in the hands of the Members. The Company shall, therefore,

be required to deduct TDS at the time of payment of

dividend at the applicable tax rates. The rate of TDS would

depend upon the category and residential status of the

Member.

As it is important for the Company to receive the relevant

information from Members to determine the rate of tax

deduction, the Members are requested to furnish relevant

documentation in the prescribed manner on the portal of

RTA on or before Friday, July 14, 2023 (06:00 p.m. IST).

The applicable TDS rate for dividends and documents

to be furnished by each category of Members is given in

the “Annexure – TDS on Dividend”, annexed hereto. The

relevant documents can be uploaded on RTA portal at

https://web.linkintime.co.in/formsreg/submission-of-

form-15g-15h.html.

The information given in the said Annexure may not be

exhaustive and the Members should evaluate on their

own about the category for which they should furnish the

documents. In absence of all the relevant documents, the

Company shall determine TDS rate based on information

available with the RTA (for shares held in physical form) and

the DPs (for shares held in dematerialized form).

Please note that the duly completed & signed documents

should be uploaded on the portal of the RTA on or before

Friday, July 14, 2023 (06:00 p.m. IST). Ambiguous,

incomplete and/or unsigned forms and declarations will

not be considered by the Company. No communication on

the tax determination/deduction shall be considered after

the abovementioned date & time.

Members are also requested to update changes in their

Residential Status, if any, with the RTA (for shares held in

physical form) & the DPs (for shares held in dematerialized

form), along with the supporting documents.

If the Permanent Account Number (“PAN”) is not as per the

database of the Income-tax portal, it would be considered as

an invalid PAN. Further, individual Members are requested

to link their Aadhaar number with the PAN.

In case TDS is deducted at a higher rate in the absence of

receipt of the specified details/documents, you would still

have the option of claiming refund of the excess tax paid

at the time of filing your income tax return, only in case

your valid PAN is registered with the RTA (for shares held in

physical form) and the DPs (for shares held in dematerialized

form). No claim shall lie against the Company for such taxes

deducted.

Members should note that any document/form not

uploaded on the portal will not be considered for the

purpose of processing and shall be rejected, therefore, it

should be uploaded on the portal only.

Members who have uploaded documents on the portal of

the RTA should also forward the originals to the Company

subsequently.

submission of relevant documentation should be sent to
