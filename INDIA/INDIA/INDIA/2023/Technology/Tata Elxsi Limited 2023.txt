MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN:

Dear Stakeholders,

It is a delight to write this message after Tata Elxsi crossed the

revenue milestone of Rs. 3 Billion in 2022-23. In recent years, your

Company’s revenue and margins remained robust even when

the overall business environment was not conducive to growth,

such as during the pandemic or the current geopolitical climate.

Despite residual uncertainty in the business environment and a

challenging geopolitical situation, Tata Elxsi maintained its high

growth – high margin trajectory for the third consecutive year

in 2022-23. Your Company’s performance was strong across key

geographies and verticals.

In 2022-23, your Company’s operating revenue stood at

Rs. 3,144.72 crores, representing a robust yearly growth of 27.28%.

The Profit Before Tax for the year stood at Rs. 937.50 crores. The

year’s Net Profit stood at Rs. 755.19 crores, which corresponds to

a 37.39% profit margin, one of the highest among our peers.

operations

During the fiscal year 2022-23, our Transportation business

grew by 32.70% year-over-year, continuing the upward trend

observed the previous year. In addition to signing contracts for

establishing a Centre of Excellence (CoE) for Tier 1 suppliers,

your Company continued to obtain major contracts in next-

generation SDV development, EV platform development, and

related technologies.

Similarly, our Healthcare & Medical Devices business reported

a robust YoY expansion of 37.56%. Multiple transactions in the

segment utilised our innovation prowess, design-led engineering,

and new product development capabilities.

This fiscal year saw an increase in Design-Digital contracts won

across all three business segments. We anticipate this trend to

persist into the following fiscal year.

At the 9th Annual CII Industrial Innovation Awards 2022, your

Company was recognised as the ‘Innovative Company of the Year’

for the Large Enterprise Service Sector.

investment in size

Over the past two fiscal years, your Company has experienced

robust top-line growth in excess of 72.20%. To support this

growth, we have invested in building scale from the beginning

of the fiscal year, expanding our presence to new locations and

hiring a record number of employees.

We’ve opened a new office in Frankfurt, Germany, to collaborate

closely with OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, European technology

companies, and universities to add value for our European

customers. In addition, we have opened new offices in

Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai, Bengaluru, and

Kozhikode, India, to be closer to the pool of engineering and

technology graduates in their homeland.

In addition, to strengthen our position as the Employer of

Choice, your Company launched the Employee Value Proposition

(EVP) ‘Home to a Billion Possibilities,’ highlighting the limitless

opportunities for development and enriching job experiences

within your Company.

The EVP acknowledges each employee’s contribution to your

Company’s success, outlines the variety of learning opportunities

available to our engineers and managers, and emphasises our

employees’ autonomy in determining their career trajectories.

looking Ahead

As we progress into the next fiscal year, your Company is well-

positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by

the digital revolution in business and consumer markets. And

despite the muted macroeconomic outlook for large economies,

our unwavering dedication to remaining competitive and at the

forefront of innovation will enable us to continue to write our

growth narrative.

I want to express my appreciation to our engineers, designers,

and associates for their hard work and dedication to your

Company. I also want to thank the management team, which is

actively working to develop and expand our business at every

opportunity.

I also want to express my gratitude to my fellow board members

for steering your Company at all times.

Your Board of Directors has recommended a final dividend

of 606%, or Rs. 60.60 per share, subject to taxation, for your

consideration.

Thank you, on behalf of the entire Board of Directors and

management team, for your continued confidence, guidance,

and support.

Yours Sincerely

n. G. Subramaniam
