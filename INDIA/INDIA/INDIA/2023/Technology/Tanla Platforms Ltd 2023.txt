Dear Shareholders,

“Tanla is a company with a strong purpose

– empowering consumers and enabling

companies.

Our platforms enable accessibility, provide

data security and data privacy, curb spam

& scam for consumers, to secure the digital

economy. We execute our purpose on the

pillars of greenfield innovation, tremendous

financial discipline, and the highest

standards of ESG.

We entered FY23, on the back of

market disruptions in the enterprise

communication business. It gives us great

satisfaction that we stayed committed

to our purpose – we accelerated our

innovation, maintained our financial

discipline, returned cash to shareholders,

and set benchmarks on ESG. As industry

leaders with ~35% CPaaS market share in

India, we set the direction for the industry -

the biggest positive for me is the structural

changes we have been able to do, which

augurs well for the future.

Let me start with the Enterprise

communications business. We saw

consolidation in the market – we have been

consistently maintaining that one needs

deep domain knowledge and ability to work

with the entire ecosystem to succeed in

India. Acquisition of ValueFirst from Twilio is

a validation of this long-standing belief. We

have worked with the ecosystem including

mobile carriers to stabilize the pricing

environment. We are driving responsible

industry conduct and expect pricing to

improve in FY24. We stayed resilient in the

Enterprise communications business in

FY23 – after a weak Q1, we exited the year

with 20% gross margins in Q4FY23. We are

entered FY24 with stronger momentum,

both in growth and profitability.

Message from Founder Chairman & CEO

Our Digital platforms business is

demonstrating all the SaaS metrics –

predictable growth (20%+YoY growth in

gross margins every quarter), SaaS business

model (100% of the platform business is

per transaction/user), IP led (4 patents) and

high profitability (running at EBIT% levels

of ~70%). We are addressing all the buying

centers of the enterprise and our innovation

engine is accelerating.

All the platforms are built on Wisely – our

single platform of platforms on which every

other platform is built. This provides us with

tremendous speed and agility to develop

new platforms. For example, we took 12

months to build Wisely Communicate but

took only 4 months build and launch Wisely

ATP – our anti-phishing platform to curb

phishing and scam, the biggest menace

threatening the digital economy. What is

most exciting to us is that we have multiple

new platforms in the ideation phase. We are

not opportunity constrained – as the digital

economy grows, we will accelerate our

growth.

We are making the right investments

to capitalize on the opportunity. Our

investments are around areas of innovation,

customer success, brand, and talent. Our

total investments for FY23 would ₹ 190

Cr in these areas. We are also investing

in global expansion. We will gain access

to Saudi Arabia and Indonesian markets

with acquisition of ValueFirst, while further

strengthening our presence in the UAE.

Our investments are positioning us well for

the future. We are also making investments

in ESG, to build a sustainable organization

beyond just business objectives. We

released our Tax Transparency report and

Sustainability report for FY23 and we are

setting the benchmark on governance.

As we look forward, we see tremendous

opportunities ahead of us. We are working

towards creating a safer, more secure

environment for millions of users. I want

to thank every one of our stakeholders for

their contribution in our incredible journey.

My team and I have rolled our sleeves and

we are working towards a better tomorrow.

Thank you all.”
